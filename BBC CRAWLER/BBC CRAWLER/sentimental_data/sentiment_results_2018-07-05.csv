"Alesha MacPhail was reported missing on Monday morning A 16-year-old boy has been charged in connection with the death of schoolgirl Alesha MacPhail. The six-year-old's body was found on the Isle of Bute on Monday, just hours after she was reported missing. The teenager, who was arrested on Wednesday, is expected to appear before Greenock Sheriff Court on Friday. Alesha, who was from Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, had been staying at her grandmother's house when she was reported missing at 06:25 on Monday. She was a few days into a three-week summer break on the island in the Firth of Clyde, west of Glasgow. During a media briefing on Thursday afternoon, Det Supt Stuart Houston said: ""I'd like to take this opportunity to personally thank Alesha's  family who have shown incredible bravery through what has been an unimaginable ordeal during these past few days. ""I'd also like to thank local people for all their support and assistance during this major investigation on the island. The response to our appeals was significant both from those living here and the wider community of Scotland. Alesha MacPhail was reported missing on Monday morning ""The people of the Isle of Bute have rallied together since Alesha was first reported missing on Monday morning and I would stress that social media speculation relating to members of the community is both misleading and inaccurate."" He added: ""The family has also received considerable support from Alesha's home town of Airdrie which was reflected in the memorial service held at her school."" Det Supt Stuart Houston said the case had touched everyone who worked on it. He added: ""Officers and staff from across Police Scotland and the Scottish Police Authority have been involved in what has been a difficult and challenging investigation during which they have worked tirelessly to bring us to where we are today. ""As I have said previously, incidents such as this are extremely rare and while the police investigation will continue, I hope that today's announcement brings some reassurance to everyone in the local community. ""It is understandable that recent events will have shocked communities across Scotland, no more so than on Bute and in Airdrie. Argyll and Bute and North Lanarkshire councils have services available for those who may have been affected.""

"Paul Davids can normally be found on YouTube explaining guitar techniques Paul Davids thought he had seen it all when it came to YouTube's copyright protection system. The Dutch YouTuber's most popular videos include himplaying famous guitar riffs,external,comparing different instruments,externalandteaching various guitar skills and techniques,external. ""Just like probably all the music YouTubers out there,""he explained in a video to his 625,000 subscribers,external, ""once in a while I get an email stating I'm infringing on someone's copyrighted material."" Paul had been contacted by YouTube to advise him that one of his videos had been flagged for copyright infringement, but in his own words, ""this was a little different"". The copyright he had apparently infringed upon was his own. 'Dancing baby' YouTube copyright case settled after 11 years Arab Despacito: Comedy version of the song complains about high dowries YouTuber's open description of social anxiety YouTuber Adam Blampied apologises for 'manipulating' women ""It said what song I was infringing on, and what I found was quite shocking,"" said Paul. ""Someone took my track, added vocals and guitar to make their own track, and uploaded it to YouTube, but I got the copyright infringement notice!"" Paul had been accused of plagiarising his own music - and worse, all the money that video was earning would now be directed towards the person who copied his content. Paul's most popular video with almost eight million views features him playing famous guitar riffs A video can be ""monetised""if a YouTube channel has at least 1,000 subscribers, and more than 4,000 hours of their content has been watched in the past 12 months So long as the channel fits these requirements, users can apply to join the YouTube Partner Programme and have adverts attached to their videos Often YouTubers will make money in other ways, through working with brands, merchandising and crowdfunding Despite being faced with a claim of copyright infringement and demonetisation, Paul remained calm. ""I looked up the guy on Facebook,"" he said. ""I wrote him a message. ""I asked: 'Are you aware that you used one of my tracks to publish as your own track? Let me know'. ""A few hours later I got a response. 'Hey, I don't know', he said. 'I did download a couple of guitar licks somewhere off YouTube. Would you consider letting me still use this?' ""I wrote him back saying, 'You can't just rip a track off YouTube and then claim it is your own. Did you know I got a copyright notice from YouTube about that track? Claiming that I was infringing on your track?' ""That's quite odd, since I wrote and recorded it."" Paul also makes a series of popular videos where he teaches people how to play different riffs In the end, Paul decided to do the nicest thing he could think of - he let the copycat keep using his song. ""It's not like he will make tons of money with it,"" Paul said. ""It's OK. It probably happens all the time."" The BBC has approached YouTube for comment. Gmail messages 'read by third parties' Sony posts whole movie in trailer's place Gareth Southgate's compassion praised This is not the first time there has been such an issue with YouTube's copyright systems. In 2015, Mitch Martinez had monetisation removed from a video afterSony filed a copyright claim against the video he licensed them.,external And in 2010, pop artist Justin Bieber was caught up in a row with the platform when they temporarilywould not allow him to upload his new song,external- because someone else had uploaded it first. Steven Bridges has had his own share of issues with Content ID on YouTube At the heart of the controversy isYouTube's Content ID system,external- the automatic process which decides whether a video contains copyright infringement. Steven Bridges, a magician with more than 178,000 subscribers on YouTube, tells the BBC how this might have happened. ""Content ID is in place to make sure people don't use content without permission of the original creator,"" Steven explained. ""YouTube's systems automatically scan videos and detect if they've got, for example, a pop song in the background. ""If the video does, then the owner of the song could be notified, and they can choose whether they want the video to be left online, or whether they want to monetise the video themselves. ""It's a great system but it has its faults. For example, sometimes content can be wrongly demonetised or taken down. Certain companies can 'claim' videos if they find copyrighted material in them, regardless of whether YouTube's Content ID detected it. ""The creator has to go through an appeal process if they think it's been unjustly claimed. ""It's a complicated thing.""

"Mr Pruitt is the subject of at least a dozen investigations Scandal-hit Scott Pruitt has resigned as head of the US Environmental Protection Agency. In a letter to President Donald Trump, he blamed ""unrelenting attacks"" on himself and his family. Mr Trump tweeted that Mr Pruitt had done ""an outstanding job, and I will always be thankful to him"". But since taking office Mr Pruitt has been mired in series of scandals concerning his spending habits and alleged misuse of office. His deputy Andrew Wheeler, a former coal industry lobbyist, will take over as acting head of the agency, Mr Trump said. Mr Pruitt is the subject of at least a dozen investigations into his conduct. He has been under scrutiny for renting an apartment with ties to a fossil fuels lobbyist at a below market rate. He is also accused of bypassing the White House to secure big pay rises for two long-time staff members. Earlier on Thursday, US media reported that he had asked his scheduler to retroactively alter his public calendar - which may be a federal crime - to scrub politically sensitive meetings. The long list of Scott Pruitt controversies The people around Donald Trump Environment chief doubts climate science He angered liberals and environmentalists by severely curtailing the agency's activities and repealing many measures designed to protect the environment. Mr Trump had become fed up with the onslaught of news stories about Mr Pruitt, including reports that he had tried to persuade Mr Trump to fire Attorney General Jeff Sessions so that he could take his job. ""It's one thing after another with this guy,"" an exasperated Mr Trump was quoted as saying, reports the New York Times. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In his resignation letter, Mr Pruitt said he was stepping down from Friday. This video can not be played Kristin Mink confronts Scott Pruitt in a restaurant in Washington DC ""Truly, your confidence in me has blessed me personally and enabled me to advance your agenda beyond what anyone anticipated at the beginning of your administration,"" he said. ""However, the unrelenting attacks on me personally, my family, are unprecedented and have taken a sizeable toll on all of us,"" he added. Mr Pruitt becomes the fourth cabinet-level official of the administration to resign or be fired, after Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Veteran Affairs Secretary David Shulkin. By Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington On Thursday morning CNN quoted an unnamed senior White House official saying that the Pruitt controversies were ""inching toward the tipping point"". It turns out that point was very close indeed. The EPA chief had managed to hold out longer than most expected as a cavalcade of controversies mounted, each alone enough to fell a Cabinet appointee in a past administration. Mr Pruitt had survived due to a combination of the vigour with which he advanced the conservative goal of paring regulations and weakening the agency and Mr Trump's natural reluctance to cede to a political outcry. In the end, however, it was Mr Pruitt who had been weakened beyond repair - hobbled by allegations of abuse of the power and privileges of office. Mr Trump had come to Washington pledging to ""drain the swamp"", and Democrats - with mid-term elections looming - were poised to point to Mr Pruitt as a prime example of how the swamp had consumed the president and Republicans in general. With Andrew Wheeler - a former coal industry lobbyist - set to run the agency for the immediate future, little will probably change as far as policies and priorities within the EPA. Many Republicans in Washington, who were growing uneasy with Mr Pruitt's seemingly never-ending bad press, will surely be happy with the change. Their relief, however, may be tinged with a certain amount of regret. Mr Pruitt had proven to be an effective champion of the conservative fight against the EPA - and even environmentalists had recognised him as a formidable adversary. Mr Pruitt himself had aspirations for higher office - either within the administration or back home in Oklahoma. While political careers these days are rarely permanently ended, at least for the moment his has been seriously derailed. Democrats welcomed the resignation, but there was also little enthusiasm for his replacement Mr Wheeler, a former coal industry lobbyist. Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey said ""#BigOil's right hand man"" was being replaced by ""King Coal's best lobbyist"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A staunch conservative, Mr Pruitt has strongly backed Mr Trump over his decision to pull out of the Paris climate accords. In his turn Mr Trump has praised him for cutting back environmental regulations which he blames for stifling economic growth. But the White House appears to have cooled towards Mr Pruitt recently. On Tuesday spokesman Hogan Gidley described the controversies facing Mr Pruitt as ""troublesome"" and said Mr Trump was ""looking into"" them. Mr Pruitt is also under investigation for: Requesting that his security detail use flashing lights and sirens to speed trips through Washington DC when he was late for meetings or flights Spending more than $168,000 on first class air travel, including $36,000 on one military flight Some questionable purchases, including $43,000 for a soundproof privacy booth for confidential phone calls and computer communications Reassigning staff for questioning the agency's spending and management.

"This video can not be played Chequers and Brexit - what's going on at the country retreat? Cabinet ministers are meeting at Chequers in a bid to thrash out an agreement on the shape of the UK's future relationship with the EU. Theresa May has said they have ""a duty"" to reach agreement on Friday, amid splits over how closely the UK should stick to EU rules after Brexit. She is expected to propose keeping the UK aligned with the EU on trading rules for goods but not services. An ex-minister warned that would mean ""something less than the full Brexit"". If ministers reach an agreement, the EU can then choose to accept or reject their proposals. Speaking on Friday, the EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said it was ""ready to adapt our offer should the UK's red lines change"" but insisted there could be no ""unravelling"" of the single market. Barnier: 'Realistic' Brexit plan needed No 10 bid to see off post-Chequers splits Will the UK leave the European Court's jurisdiction in 2019? Airbus: Ministers have 'no clue' on Brexit Ministers are expected to be at Chequers, a 16th Century house in Buckinghamshire which is the PM's country residence, until about 22.00 GMT. They had to hand in their phones and any smartwatches on arrival. Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington said the proposal would include a common rulebook on some sectors - like industrial goods and agricultural goods - for ""practical"" supply chain reasons. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I'm pretty confident we will end up with a concrete position which everybody is able to sign up to."" Cabinet ministers are expected to be in talks at Chequers all day But Brexiteer ministers are understood to be unhappy. Seven cabinet ministers met at the Foreign Office on Thursday evening to discuss the proposal. There have also been suggestions that the prime minister's proposal would make a US trade deal more difficult. No 10 says it is ""categorically untrue that we will not be able to strike a trade deal with the US"". David Jones, a former minister at the Department for Exiting the EU, said Mrs May's proposal looked set to breach her ""red lines"" on leaving the customs union, single market and jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Between meetings, the PM and other ministers took a breath of fresh air BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg If this was easy, Theresa May would not need the cloistered environment of Chequers to get her cabinet to agree. She would not need the tranquil quiet of the Buckinghamshire countryside to broker peace. She is vulnerable because her plan is hardly Brexit to some of those who campaigned to leave. Vulnerable in her party because her authority is in short supply and there is intense disagreement. Vulnerable then in Parliament because without a majority, a small faction can wreak havoc on either side. Read more fromLaura on her blog Kamal Ahmed: Treasury plays 'softest' Brexit card Ahead of the meeting, Mrs May said the cabinet had ""a great opportunity - and a duty. To set an ambitious course to enhance our prosperity and security outside the European Union - and to build a country that genuinely works for everyone"". Labour's Sir Keir Starmer said a workable agreement that could be taken to the EU was needed and ""simply a truce in the cabinet was not good enough for Britain"". Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said time was running out for the UK and the worst outcome would be ministers emerging ""arm in arm, saying they've agreed, because that means there's another helping of fudge being served up and what is being put forward is likely to be rejected by Europe"". Boris Johnson is said to have met former Prime Minister David Cameron on Thursday Meanwhile sources close to David Cameron confirmed the former PM met Boris Johnson on Thursday and discussed Brexit. But they said there was ""no grand view"" on the negotiations and disputed reports Mr Cameron had agreed that Theresa May's plan was the ""worst of all worlds"". The UK has been told to ""lay its cards on the table"" There have been differing views within the cabinet about how closely the UK should stick to EU rules after Brexit, and what compromises should be made to achieve ""as frictionless as possible"" trade. The aim is to agree a UK proposal on how future relations should work on Friday, the details of which would then be published in a White Paper net week. That would then be the subject of negotiations with the EU - which might have different ideas. Reality Check: Why services matter in any deal What kind of Brexit do voters want? Brexit: All you need to know Under standard cabinet protocol, ministers had to hand in their phones before the meeting started Ministers have yet to agree what they want to replace the UK's membership of the EU's customs union, which allows for tariff-free trading between members. One of the key issues is the need to avoid new border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland when the UK is outside the customs union. The EU and UK say there can be no return to a hard border. But Eurosceptic MPs say tying the UK to the EU after it leaves will prevent it from striking its own trade deals with other countries. Meanwhile 46 other Conservative MPs have urged Mrs May to listen to businesses and target a deal which enables ""frictionless trade to continue"". Please upgrade your browser The ""facilitated customs arrangement"" is understood to be a proposal for a post-Brexit customs agreement which would allow the UK the freedom to set its own tariffs on goods arriving into the country. Technology would be used to determine where the goods will ultimately end up - and therefore whether UK or EU tariffs should be paid. It would keep the UK aligned to EU regulations in some sectors- such as industrial and agricultural goods - but Parliament would be able to decide where to deviate. The 120-page plan is also understood to propose an end to the free movement of people but to say the UK would have to accept the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in some areas. Details of how the plan would work in practice have yet to be published. But Downing Street says it is confident the arrangement would be partly in place by the end of the proposed transition period in December 2020 - with the system being fully operational by the next general election, due in 2022. It is not clear whether the EU will agree to it. The UK is due to leave the European Union at 23:00 GMT on 29 March 2019. But to allow time for parliaments in the UK and the EU to approve whatever deal is agreed, the aim is for the framework for future relations to be agreed this autumn. This video can not be played What is the EU customs union? But the UK government has not, as yet, settled on what its post-Brexit relationship with the EU should look like. EU leaders last week told Mrs May it was time to ""lay the cards on the table"" if a Brexit deal was to be done on time. Businesses, including Jaguar Land Rover, Airbus and BMW, have also been stepping up the pressure on the government to provide more detail.

"This video can not be played Highlights: Edmund beats Klahn in straight sets Wimbledon 2018 on the BBC Venue:All England Club, WimbledonDates:2-15 July Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer, BBC Red Button, Connected TVs and the BBC Sport website and app; Live Radio 5 live and 5 live sports extra commentary; Text commentary online. Kyle Edmund is the only Briton left in the Wimbledon singles after setting up a third-round match with three-time champion Novak Djokovic. Edmund, 23, won 6-4 7-6 (7-0) 6-2 against qualifier Bradley Klahn on Centre Court in the second round. The 21st-seed will play Djokovic - who beat Horacio Zeballos 6-1 6-2 6-3 - on Saturday, the same day as England's World Cup quarter-final against Sweden. It is the first time the British number one has reached the last 32 at SW19. ""I'm really happy to get the win, it was the second time I've played on Centre Court and the first time I've won,"" Edmund told BBC Sport. ""Growing up as a kid I've always dreamed of playing here and to win is great."" Fellow Britons Johanna Konta and Katie Boulterlost their second-round matchesearlier on Thursday. Third seed Cilic knocked out by Pella Defending champion Muguruza beaten Five talking points from day four Edmund has climbed into the upper echelons of the men's game after a fine year which has seen him reach the Australian Open semi-finals and his first ATP final in Marrakech. He took over as the British number one for the first time earlier this year, a result of his fine form combined with Andy Murray's injury problems. And a notable win against Djokovic in Madrid - his first against the 12-time Grand Slam champion - helped him move into the world's top 20 for the first time. Although Edmund had only won one main-draw match at Wimbledon before this year, his new-found status meant he was pitted against two players ranked outside of the top 150 and he despatched Klahn with similar to ease to first-round opponent Alex Bolt. The American struggled with his serve in the opening game of the match, Edmund eventually taking his sixth break point in a nine-minute opener. That proved decisive as Edmund's strong service game - which saw Klahn win just four points - enabled him to dominate a 41-minute opening set. The second set was tighter as Edmund missed the only two break points, leading to a tie-break in which he upped the tempo and completely controlled. Klahn offered more resistance in the third set before Edmund took his serve for a 4-2 lead, then claimed the third of his 12 break points on his second match point. Edmund only dropped 11 points on his serve throughout the match, winning 87% of his first serve points and 84% of his second serve points. ""When you are getting those numbers it is always going to help. I was really controlling my service games, which always puts the pressure on him,"" said Edmund, who also hit 10 aces. Djokovic required a medical timeout towards the end of the third set Djokovic moved into the third round earlier on Thursday with a clinical 6-1 6-2 6-3 victory over Argentina's Zeballos. Three-time champion Djokovic needed lengthy treatment on his left knee at the end of the seventh game in the third set but later said it was nothing to worry about. ""It's most likely a twitch, you know, in the muscle or something like this that has affected the knee a little bit,"" the Serb said. ""Hopefully it's nothing that will concern me, [and] that I'll be able to perform."" 'I should have gone to the toilet' - Nadal through despite time violations Williams & Federer take centre stage - Friday preview That was his only real problem against world number 126 Zeballos, who was appearing in the Wimbledon second round for the first time. The Argentine had little to offer in attack and failed to convert any of his three break points. Former world number one Djokovic, who has slipped to 21st in the rankings after time out with an elbow injury, delivered an impressive 15 aces and 31 winners. It is the 60th match the Serb has won at Wimbledon, taking him one ahead of John McEnroe, and continues his recent return to form since pulling out of his quarter-final here last year with an elbow problem. Djokovic played his match on court two - the first time in nine years he has not played on Centre Court or Court One. With Edmund next up, Djokovic is confident of a return to one of the main courts. ""He's a hometown favourite now that [Andy] Murray is not here,"" he said. ""There's a lot of expectations and pressure on his back, But he's handling it pretty well so far."" Edmund is a huge football fan and his victory over Klahn means his match against Djokovic could clash with England's first World Cup quarter-final since 2006. It will be delicate decision for Wimbledon to make when it comes to Saturday's order of play, with early indications that it is likely to be scheduled later in the day. ""I don't mind where it is scheduled to play,"" said Edmund. ""I'm a tennis player, so I'm here to do my job first. ""Hopefully it will be a success for both of us, England and myself."" Edmund and his Swedish coach Fredrik Rosengren posed with the replica World Cups shirts of their respective nations earlier this week in a light-hearted social media post. But that is the only rivalry between them in a partnership that has paid dividends for Edmund since Rosengren came on board in October.

People travelling through the capital have been told to avoid London Victoria station if using Southern, Gatwick Express or Thameslink trains. Journeys have been cancelled and delayed by up to 60 minutes after the fault in Streatham, south London. National Rail said disruption will last until at least 07:00 BST on Friday. Passengers are advised to check theSouthern website,externalin the morning to see whether trains are running. They had initially been told to expect normal services to resume by 14:00 on Thursday after the fault was discovered on Wednesday night. Network Rail, the government-owned company responsible for maintaining rail infrastructure, offered a ""sincere apology"" to customers. Rail firms warned trains that were running would be overcrowded The cause of the fault has been traced to the failure of the power supply linked to signalling equipment. A statement from Network Rail said that while a ""temporary fix"" was put in place after engineers worked overnight, significant disruption would continue across affected lines. Victoria is the second busiest station in Great Britain. About 210,000 passengers use the station a day, according to average figures collected for the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) in 2016-17. Gatwick Express services were suspended on Thursday while Southern and Thameslink trains were badly affected.

Kevin Liffey, 54, earlier missed his sister's funeral in Jersey because he could not get to Gatwick Airport from his home in East Finchley in time for his flight. That was despite spending Â£90 on a taxi from Victoria after being told he would not be able to catch the Gatwick Express from there. He said: ""It just shows we cannot rely on public transport at the most basic level. ""It's just not really acceptable in a country that's as developed as it is."" Gatwick Airport said flight passengers should leave extra time for their journeys. Adam Parker, 32, said he was ""close to breaking point"" after the three-hour journey from Hove into work on Thursday morning. The Nickelodeon producer said: ""There are only so many times you can tell your boss you're late again because of the trains, only so many times you can miss a meal at home."" Allow Twitter content?

"Paul Davids can normally be found on YouTube explaining guitar techniques Paul Davids thought he had seen it all when it came to YouTube's copyright protection system. The Dutch YouTuber's most popular videos include himplaying famous guitar riffs,external,comparing different instruments,externalandteaching various guitar skills and techniques,external. ""Just like probably all the music YouTubers out there,""he explained in a video to his 625,000 subscribers,external, ""once in a while I get an email stating I'm infringing on someone's copyrighted material."" Paul had been contacted by YouTube to advise him that one of his videos had been flagged for copyright infringement, but in his own words, ""this was a little different"". The copyright he had apparently infringed upon was his own. 'Dancing baby' YouTube copyright case settled after 11 years Arab Despacito: Comedy version of the song complains about high dowries YouTuber's open description of social anxiety YouTuber Adam Blampied apologises for 'manipulating' women ""It said what song I was infringing on, and what I found was quite shocking,"" said Paul. ""Someone took my track, added vocals and guitar to make their own track, and uploaded it to YouTube, but I got the copyright infringement notice!"" Paul had been accused of plagiarising his own music - and worse, all the money that video was earning would now be directed towards the person who copied his content. Paul's most popular video with almost eight million views features him playing famous guitar riffs A video can be ""monetised""if a YouTube channel has at least 1,000 subscribers, and more than 4,000 hours of their content has been watched in the past 12 months So long as the channel fits these requirements, users can apply to join the YouTube Partner Programme and have adverts attached to their videos Often YouTubers will make money in other ways, through working with brands, merchandising and crowdfunding Despite being faced with a claim of copyright infringement and demonetisation, Paul remained calm. ""I looked up the guy on Facebook,"" he said. ""I wrote him a message. ""I asked: 'Are you aware that you used one of my tracks to publish as your own track? Let me know'. ""A few hours later I got a response. 'Hey, I don't know', he said. 'I did download a couple of guitar licks somewhere off YouTube. Would you consider letting me still use this?' ""I wrote him back saying, 'You can't just rip a track off YouTube and then claim it is your own. Did you know I got a copyright notice from YouTube about that track? Claiming that I was infringing on your track?' ""That's quite odd, since I wrote and recorded it."" Paul also makes a series of popular videos where he teaches people how to play different riffs In the end, Paul decided to do the nicest thing he could think of - he let the copycat keep using his song. ""It's not like he will make tons of money with it,"" Paul said. ""It's OK. It probably happens all the time."" The BBC has approached YouTube for comment. Gmail messages 'read by third parties' Sony posts whole movie in trailer's place Gareth Southgate's compassion praised This is not the first time there has been such an issue with YouTube's copyright systems. In 2015, Mitch Martinez had monetisation removed from a video afterSony filed a copyright claim against the video he licensed them.,external And in 2010, pop artist Justin Bieber was caught up in a row with the platform when they temporarilywould not allow him to upload his new song,external- because someone else had uploaded it first. Steven Bridges has had his own share of issues with Content ID on YouTube At the heart of the controversy isYouTube's Content ID system,external- the automatic process which decides whether a video contains copyright infringement. Steven Bridges, a magician with more than 178,000 subscribers on YouTube, tells the BBC how this might have happened. ""Content ID is in place to make sure people don't use content without permission of the original creator,"" Steven explained. ""YouTube's systems automatically scan videos and detect if they've got, for example, a pop song in the background. ""If the video does, then the owner of the song could be notified, and they can choose whether they want the video to be left online, or whether they want to monetise the video themselves. ""It's a great system but it has its faults. For example, sometimes content can be wrongly demonetised or taken down. Certain companies can 'claim' videos if they find copyrighted material in them, regardless of whether YouTube's Content ID detected it. ""The creator has to go through an appeal process if they think it's been unjustly claimed. ""It's a complicated thing.""

"The suspected poachers strayed into a large pride of lions, the reserve's owner said At least two suspected rhino poachers have been mauled to death and eaten by lions on a South African game reserve, officials say. Rangers discovered the remains of two, possibly three, people in a lion enclosure in the Sibuya reserve, near the south-east town of Kenton-on-Sea. A high-powered rifle and an axe were also found. There has been a rise in poaching in Africa in recent years, to feed growing demand for rhino horn in parts of Asia. In China, Vietnam and elsewhere, rhino horn is erroneously believed to have medicinal properties, even though it is made from the same material as human fingernails. Sibuya reserve owner Nick Fox said in a statement on the reserve's Facebook page thatthe suspected poachers entered the reserve late on Sunday night or early on Monday morning,external. ""They strayed into a pride of lions - it's a big pride so they didn't have too much time,"" Mr Fox told AFP news agency. ""We're not sure how many there were - there's not much left of them."" The Sibuya game reserve lost three rhinos to poachers in 2016 The remains were first spotted at 16:30 local time on Tuesday (14:30 GMT). An anti-poaching team arrived on the scene, where a hunting rifle with silencer, a long axe and wire-cutters - equipment generally used by rhino poachers - were also found. Several lions had to be tranquilised before the remains could be recovered, Mr Fox added. Four proposals to save the rhino Would a legal market deter poachers? Police have been patrolling the area in case any of the suspected poachers survived. Nine rhinos were killed by poachers in Eastern Cape province, where the reserve is located, this year alone. More than 7,000 have been killed in South Africa in the past decade. Briton injured in attack by own lion Poachers kill rhino at French zoo Would a legal market deter poachers?

"Tate St Ives faces onto Porthmeor Beach A ""breathtakingly beautiful"" Â£20m extension to Cornwall's Tate St Ives gallery has earned it the prestigious award for Museum of the Year. The venue reopened in October after an expansion that doubled its gallery space by digging into the cliff face. That impressed the judges of the Art Fund's annual Museum of the Year award, which comes with a Â£100,000 prize. Art Fund director Stephen Deuchar said the extension was ""deeply intelligent and breathtakingly beautiful"". Mr Deuchar, who chaired the judging panel, also said the redevelopment provided ""the perfect stage for a curatorial programme that is at once adventurous, inclusive and provocative"". The gallery's expansion took almost 15 years to come to fruition Tate St Ives opened in 1993 to celebrate the artists who were attracted by the light in the coastal town from the 1930s onwards, including Barbara Hepworth, Ben Nicholson, Alfred Wallis and Patrick Heron. The gallery proved more popular than expected, and plans for an extension were drawn up 15 years ago. Many locals objected to the original proposals, however, with more than 2,000 signing a petition, saying the scheme would block views of the sea and take up car parking space. So architects decided to dig into the cliff face instead, and the venue was shut for 18 months while the work was carried out. Last year's prize was won by another place with links to Barbara Hepworth - the Hepworth Wakefield gallery in the West Yorkshire city where the sculptor was born. Simon Wallis, director of Hepworth Wakefield, welcomed Tate St Ives' win. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Campaigners tried out the inflatable baby at Martin Luther King adventure playground in Islington Plans to fly a giant inflatable figure depicting Donald Trump as a baby over London during the US president's visit have been approved. Mr Trump is due to meet Theresa May at 10 Downing Street on 13 July. Campaigners raised almost Â£18,000 for the helium-filled six-metre high figure, which they said reflects Mr Trump's character as an ""angry baby with a fragile ego and tiny hands"". London Mayor Sadiq Khan gave permission for the balloon to fly. The White House has been approached for comment. OnTwitter,externalformer UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the plan was ""the biggest insult to a sitting US President ever"". The inflatable Trump Baby is six metres tall Campaigners claim the figure reflects Mr Trump's character as an ""angry baby"" Under the plans the inflatable will be allowed to fly for two hours on the morning of Friday 13 July. Leo Murray, who is behind the crowdfunded idea, said: ""[Mr Trump] really seems to hate it when people make fun of him. ""So when he visits the UK on Friday, we want to make sure he knows that all of Britain is looking down on him and laughing at him. ""That's why a group of us have chipped in and raised enough money to have a six-metre high blimp made by a professional inflatables company, to be flown in the skies over Parliament Square during Trump's visit."" Are Trump and the mayor of London set to reconcile? Sheffield Mayor Magid Magid 'bans' Donald Trump from city Treasury to cover policing cost of Trump visit to Scotland Mr Murray said organisers initially ""didn't get off to the best start with the mayor's office over this, who originally told us that they didn't recognise Trump Baby as legitimate protest"". However, he said City Hall had ""rediscovered its sense of humour - Trump Baby will fly"". A statement on behalf of the London mayor said he ""supports the right to peaceful protest and understands that this can take many different forms"". Mr Khan's city operations team met organisers and gave them permission to ""use Parliament Square Garden as a grounding point for the blimp"". The plan is for the Trump Baby to take off from Parliament Square More than 10,000 people signed a petition calling for the inflatable to be given permission to fly, activists said. Mr Khan and Mr Trump have repeatedly clashed on Twitter, including in the aftermath of theLondon Bridge attack. Before the figure can take off, campaigners will also need permission from the National Air Traffic Service (NATS) as the project constitutes a ""non-standard flight in controlled airspace"", a spokesperson said. Because Parliament Square sits within restricted airspace, additional approvals are also needed from the Metropolitan Police. This video can not be played Where will the US president go and what might greet him? Max Wakefield, who is one of the people working on the project, said the group is ""confident it will obtain all necessary permits"". He said the initial crowdfunding target was just Â£1,000, but this was reached within 24 hours. The extra cash will now be used to send the balloon on a ""world tour"" and ""haunt"" Mr Trump wherever he goes, he added. The Met has been approached for a comment.

"Aspiring doctor Edward Senior was described as caring and compassionate by family and friends A medical student killed himself after a WhatsApp message about a romance with a classmate was shared on social media, an inquest heard. Newport Coroner's Court heard Edward Senior's private message about the ""brief relationship"" was seen by hundreds of people. A complaint was made which led to Swansea University excluding him from lectures while it investigated. The 22-year-old's body was found in a wood near his home in Monmouthshire. Senior coroner Wendy James said: ""Despite having the support of a loving family, it was not enough for him to get through a stressful period in his life. ""Not knowing what the ramifications would be, he felt isolated and became overwhelmed. ""It is not unusual for young people to make mistakes. But his biggest mistake was dwelling on that one mistake."" The inquest heard that friends from Mr Senior's university rugby team shared his private message The inquest heard that Mr Senior died in February after the complaint about his WhatsApp post which had been shared on Facebook was raised. He returned to his family home in Raglan, Monmouthshire, and was said to be distraught. On the morning before his body was found he was described as ""preoccupied"". The cause of death was given as hanging. BBC - Future: How your social media betrays your mood Miss James, who recorded a verdict of suicide, said: ""It highlights the risk of posting on social media sites. ""He made the post in a private form and that post was shared by friends with the consequences that he was excluded from the majority of lectures. ""He felt his future as a doctor was in jeopardy."" Mr Senior's family said he had a 'rare ability to light up any room with his wide smile, mop of blonde hair and special charm' Mr Senior's mother Diana told the inquest Edward had gained a 2:1 in physiology at Bristol University before a gap year at an orphanage in Ghana, Africa. His brother Max added: ""In the 22 years he lived, he had an unbelievable impact on so many people's lives. ""Ted was a friend to everyone and always did his upmost to help people in need.""

"Theresa May has said she hopes her cabinet will be able to ""discuss and decide on a substantive way forward"" on Brexit at their crucial Friday awayday. The UK prime minister told Germany's Angela Merkel she hoped this would lead to an increase in the ""pace and intensity"" of UK-EU negotiations. As they met in Berlin, Mrs Merkel said Brexit talks were at a ""crucial phase"". She said that a political framework for future relations needed to be clear by October. Jaguar boss: Brexit threatens investment Theresa May's new Brexit trade plan explained What kind of Brexit do voters want? Brexit: All you need to know Downing Street said Theresa May and Angela Merkel had ""constructive"" talks about Brexit in Berlin and the cabinet's discussions at Chequers would decide a ""substantial way forward which would enable the pace and intensity of negotiations to increase"". Meanwhile Brexiteer ministers including Boris Johnson, David Davis, Michael Gove, Liam Fox and Esther McVey were holding talks on Thursday evening, ahead of the meeting on Friday.

The two leaders' meeting came as Downing Street set out some of the detail of its new proposal for how trade between the UK and the EU could be handled after Brexit. There are differing views within the cabinet about how closely the UK should stick to EU rules after Brexit, and what compromises should be made to achieve ""as frictionless as possible"" trade. After months of tension and disagreement, the prime minster is gathering the entire cabinet at her country retreat, Chequers, with the aim of agreeing a UK proposal on how future relations with the EU will work. That would then be the subject of negotiations with the EU - which might have different ideas. The UK is due to leave the European Union at 23:00 GMT on 29 March 2019. But to allow time for parliaments in the UK and the EU to approve whatever deal is agreed, the aim is for the framework for future relations to be agreed this autumn. According to No 10, the new plan would allow the UK the freedom to set its own tariffs on goods arriving into the country. Technology would be used to determine where the goods will ultimately end up - and therefore whether UK or EU tariffs should be paid. Downing Street says it is confident the arrangement would be partly in place by the end of the proposed transition period in December 2020 - with the system being fully operational by the next general election, which is due in 2022. On regulations, it is understood that the UK would closely mirror the EU's rules - but Parliament would be able to decide where to deviate. However, the arrangement has not been explained in full - and it is not clear whether the cabinet will back the plan, or whether the EU would agree. A source close to Brexit Secretary David Davis refused to comment on aDaily Telegraph report,externalthat he had already told Mrs May the plan was unworkable. Mr Davis and Mrs May were ""working closely on what will be presented on Friday"", the source said. However Mr Davis is expected to ""forcefully"" express his doubts and reservations about the compromise plan, including the view that it could be a mistake to set out too much of the UK's negotiating position at this stage Please upgrade your browser Among the issues that need to be resolved is the need to avoid new border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland when the UK is outside the customs union. Eurosceptic MPs have warned Mrs May against tying the UK to the EU after it leaves, saying this will prevent it from striking its own trade deals with other countries. Meanwhile 46 other Conservative MPs have written to Mrs May urging her to listen to the voice of business and target a deal which enables ""frictionless trade to continue"". After Friday's meeting, the government is expected to publish a White Paper setting out its plans in detail. The European Union asked a series of questions about the UK's previous customs proposals and they are still relevant. Will it be temporary? Does it solve the Irish border issue fully or partly? Does it respect the integrity of EU customs policy? How is it supervised? How will the UK system evolve as the EU's does? Will the EU need to change its trade policy? But customs is only a fraction of the relationship between the UK and the EU and so the British idea of aligning to some European regulations is a much bigger deal. And the priority in Brussels is to find a solution to the Northern Irish border. ""If there isn't a deal on that then things could turn nasty quite quickly,"" a diplomat told me. The EU is waiting to see the full White Paper. Officials from the 27 remaining countries are primed to meet soon after it is published and ministers will give their reaction at a meeting on 20 July but civil servants in Brussels expect to be combing through it until the end of the month at least.

"People sunning themselves in Glasgow's George Square last Thursday Scotland's highest ever temperature reading has been rejected by the Met Office over fears it could have been affected by a parked vehicle. On Thursday 28 June, a temperature of 33.2C degrees was measured at Strathclyde Park in Motherwell. The Met Office now says a stationary vehicle with its engine running was parked too close to the equipment. It said that although the measurement was ""plausible"" it could not rule out the potential for contamination. It means that last Thursday was not officially the hottest day ever in Scotland. A temperature of 32.9C recorded in August 2003, at Greycrook in the Borders, remains the highest ever. The ""weatherproof"" membrane of Glasgow Science Centre melted in the sun Provisional figures from the Met Office said average temperatures had made it the fourth hottest June ever experienced in Scotland. It was the fourth sunniest June for the UK overall. The temperatures were so hot on Thursday 28 June that the ""weatherproof"" membrane on Glasgow Science Centre's roof melted and dripped black ""goo"" down the building. A blog from the Met Office said temperatures in the low 30s were observed at a number of sites in the central belt of Scotland on that day, with 31.9 Â°C recorded at Bishopton in Renfrewshire.,external Many took the chance to enjoy the sun at Gourock lido Dr Mark McCarthy, head of the Met Office's National Climate Information Centre, said: ""At first review the Motherwell record appeared plausible given the wider conditions on the day and was therefore reported as such. ""However, for all new records we undertake further careful investigation to ensure that the measurement is robust. ""This investigation includes statistical analysis of the station data, evaluation against neighbouring sites, and in some cases an additional site visit to check for unexpected issues with the instrument enclosure or equipment to ensure the measurement meets our required standards."" The thermometers are housed inside a box with a Stevenson screen Jim Dale, a senior meteorologist at British Weather Services, told BBC Scotland he was surprised that a vehicle had been allowed so close to the Stevenson screen, behind which the thermometers are kept. He said: ""Temperature is measured in a white box, essentially, with slats. ""That is to keep it in the shade because all temperatures are measured in the shade not in the full sun. ""The reason for the slats is to allow a passage of air going around it, almost like a breeze. ""If a car engine exhaust is nearby it is going to be warm and therefore you are going to be in a situation where it could put the temperature up slightly."" Mr Dale said if you were dealing with record temperatures there could be no hint of it being inaccurate.

"The Madagascan banana: Could this save the world's banana crop? A wild banana that may hold the key to protecting the world's edible banana crop has been put on the extinction list. It is found only in Madagascar, where there are just five mature trees left in the wild. Scientists say the plant needs to be conserved, as it may hold the secret to keeping bananas safe for the future. Most bananas consumed around the world are of a type known as the Cavendish, which is vulnerable to a plant pest. The race is on to develop new banana varieties that are both tasty to eat and resilient enough to survive attack from Panama disease. The Madagascan banana has evolved in isolation on an island cut off from the mainland, and may have special properties. One of the few Madagascan bananas left in the wild Richard Allen, senior conservation assessor at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, said the species (Ensete perrieri) could have in-built tolerance to drought or disease. ""It doesn't have Panama disease in it, so perhaps it has genetic traits against the disease,"" he said. ""We don't know until we actually do research on the banana itself, but we can't do the research until it's saved."" Kew scientists searched for the banana plant in Madagascar and found it was almost extinct in the wild. Find out more about where plant food comes from by listening to Crowd Science on BBC World Service Radio. They hope that its inclusion on the latest official Red List of the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature,external) will highlight its plight. Dr HÃ©lÃ¨ne Ralimanana of the Kew Madagascar Conservation Centre says the plant is part of the island's rich floral heritage. ""It is very important to conserve the wild banana because it has large seeds which can offer an opportunity to find a gene to improve the cultivated banana,"" she said. If the wild banana can be protected, there will be opportunities to collect the seeds and look at the plant's genetic make-up. The Madagascan banana produces seeds within the fruit, which means it is not palatable to eat. But cross-breeding could lead to a new type of banana that would be both edible and resilient. The banana grows on the edge of forests, where it is vulnerable to damage from severe weather events as well as from logging, fires and the clearing of forests for farming. Bananas are clones - which means they are all the same. So, if the disease is present in one plant it can spread quickly throughout the whole population. That is the case for now, but it may not be so in the future. The disease affecting the Cavendish is currently confined to Asia, but if it were to spread to the Americas, it could wipe out the world's banana crop. This actually happened in the 1950s with a type of banana known as the Gros Michel (often known as Big Mike). The song, ""Yes! We Have No Bananas,"" is said to have been inspired by a shortage of Gros Michel bananas, which began with an outbreak of the fungus behind Panama disease. Gros Michel bananas were replaced by Cavendish bananas, which are named after William Cavendish, the 6th Duke of Devonshire, who lived at Chatsworth House in Derbyshire. Bananas have been grown at Chatsworth since 1830 when head gardener Joseph Paxton propagated a specimen imported from Mauritius. Nearly every banana now eaten is directly descended from this plant. It goes by the scientific name,Ensete perrieri, and is listed as Critically Endangered. It is found in the tropical forests of the country's western region where it is under threat from deforestation:  only five mature trees are now reported to remain in the wild.

"Cabin crew at Ryanair based in Italy, Portugal, Spain and Belgium say they will strike in late July. Cabin crew in Italy will go on strike for 24-hours on 25 July, while crew in Spain, Portugal and Belgium will strike for 48 hours on 25-26 July. Unions said further action may follow if the Irish airline does not make concessions on some employment terms. On Wednesday the unions issued a list of changes they wanted to their terms and conditions. They include a request to be paid into bank accounts in their own countries, rather than in the Republic of Ireland. Earlier this week, pilots directly employed by Ryanair and who are members of its Irish trade union said they would will go on strike for the first time on 12 July. Last year, Ryanair pilots went on strike to protest about their working conditions. After a long-standing hostile attitude to unions and a refusal to allow such organisations to represent staff, Ryanair finally agreed to union recognition in December. The pilots are striking as they say conditions that prompted last year's industrial action have not improved sufficiently. The four unions representing cabin crew said in a joint statement: ""We call on the European Commission, and the governments of every European country where Ryanair operates, to act upon the social dumping performed by the Irish low cost carrier and to enforce the EU employment and national imperative legislation."" The statement was signed by Belgium's CNE/LBC, Spain's SITCPLA and USO, Portugal's SNPVAC and Italy's Ultrasporti unions. They do not represent all Ryanair cabin crew in those countries, but have said other staff are welcome to join the action. Ryanair has said employment conditions for its staff are competitive, if not better, than those offered by rivals. It flies in 37 countries and carried 130 million passengers last year, making it Europe's biggest by passenger numbers.

"Rescue workers are concerned about what might happen when monsoon rains hit Rescuers are racing against the rains to free 12 boys and their football coach, who are trapped in a flooded cave in northern Thailand. A deluge is expected to hit in a matter of days that could force the water level up, threatening to flood the pocket where the group took refuge. The teenage boys and their 25-year-old coach have been trapped for 12 days. They were found on Monday night by rescue divers, on a rock shelf about 4km (2.5 miles) from the cave mouth. The boys have now received food, foil blankets, and medical attention, and rescuers are trying to run cables through the cave tunnel so they can speak to their families. The region of Chiang Rai where the boys are trapped has for the past few days experienced a dry spell, and rescuers have taken advantage of this to pump water out of the cave complex. What are the rescue options? Hope grows for daring rescue About 128 million litres of water had been pumped out by Thursday, with the water levels coming down at an average rate of 1.5cm per hour. Rescue workers are now able to walk through a 1.5km (0.9 mile) stretch from the entrance to what's being called the third chamber. Water is being pumped out of the cave complex around the clock But heavy monsoon rains are forecast for Sunday. Chiang Rai Governor Narongsak Osotthanakorn said they were ""racing against water"". ""We are calculating how much time we have it if rains, how many hours and days,"" he said. The Tham Luang cave complex is regularly flooded during the rainy season until September or October, raising fears that a delay could leave the boys trapped in the cave for months. There is hope that enough water can be pumped out of the cave tunnels for the boys to be able to wade - or be floated - out. But rescuers are also planning for other eventualities. A team are exploring the forested mountain land above the cave complex to see if they can find a chimney down to the cavern sheltering the boys. They have enlisted the help of bird-watchers, who are specialists in finding hidden holes, the AFP news agency reports. This video can not be played Bill Whitehouse from the British Cave Rescue Council explains how the boys and their coach might be rescued Thai Navy Seal divers are also teaching the boys the basics of diving, with a view to guiding them out through flooded waters if necessary. But such a rescue would be fraught with risk, say experts. Many of the boys cannot swim or dive, and there is a high risk they might panic in the dark, murky, narrow waterways. Video shows Thai cave boys in good health The Brits behind the Thai cave boys search How will the boys cope underground? The journey for the group to travel up to the cave entrance would take around five hours, rescue divers say. The Thai military has previously said that if the boys can't dive out, the group may have to wait for up to four months for flooding to recede before they can leave. Food and other supplies are being put in place for that eventuality. Helier Cheung, BBC News, Tham Luang cave Teams of volunteers are each playing their part in the rescue effort Rescue teams are working in extremely difficult conditions. The heat has been sweltering and unrelenting, at over 30C, while much of the site is submerged in squelchy mud that is several inches thick in places and extremely slippery. But the work has continued at an unrelenting pace. Everyone is aware that once the monsoon rains start, rescue efforts will be much more difficult. Meanwhile, hundreds of workers are helping to keep the site in order, with road engineers laying gravel to try and secure the mud, workers for the Thai royal kitchen providing hot food for everyone, and volunteers handing out water bottles and ice lollies to those on site. One local civil servant, who had volunteered to help hand out supplies, said he did not know the boys personally but had decided to help because ""I consider the boys in the caves as my brothers"". Video from Thai Navy special forces on Monday showed the boys looking emaciated but smiling and at times laughing. The arrival of food, foil blankets and the prospect of speaking to their loved ones will have buoyed their spirits. But concern is mounting for both their physical and mental health after 12 days below ground - and it is not clear how they would be helped to survive months more in the cave. This video can not be played Chilean miner sends message to Thai boys The boys and their coach had gone on their bikes up to the caves on Saturday 23 June after football practice. It was one boy's 16th birthday, and the team had taken a picnic. They knew the caves, and some reports suggest they had wanted to explore deeper than on previous occasions. They entered the cave when it was dry but sudden heavy rains quickly flooded the exit and rushed through the narrow passages, clogging them with mud and debris.

"The Bank of England governor now has more confidence in the UK economy, in a speech which could stoke expectations of an interest rate rise in August. Mark Carney said recent data had given him ""greater confidence"" that weak first-quarter growth ""was largely due to the weather"". He said household spending and sentiment had ""bounced back strongly"". England winning the World Cup would be an ""unalloyed, unadulterated absolute good"" for the economy, Mr Carney added. Global economy 'under threat as tariff war bites' What would a rate rise mean for you? In a speech at the Northern Powerhouse Summit in Newcastle, Mr Carney said: ""Overall, recent domestic data suggest the economy is evolving largely in line with the May Inflation Report projections, which see demand growing at rates slightly above those of supply and domestic cost pressures building."" Thepound edged up 0.2% against the dollarto $1.3254 following his remarks. Last month, three members of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee - including chief economist Andy Haldane - voted in favour of lifting the interest rate to 0.75%. Mr Carney was among the six MPC members who voted to keep rates on hold at 0.5%. He also warned that a global trade war could dampen economic growth. Mr Carney said ""protectionist rhetoric"" was rising and was now turning into action: ""There are some, tentative signs that this more hostile and uncertain trading environment may be dampening activity."" He cited evidence from the IHS Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' index (PMI), which suggested that global export orders and manufacturing output have fallen back from highs at the start of the year. On Friday, the US will implement a 25% import tariff on a list of hundreds of Chinese goods. On the same day, China will also impose 25% tariffs on a range of US goods, including pork products, fish and rice. In a Q&A session after his speech, Mr Carney - who was wearing a Three Lions lapel badge - was asked about the economic impact of an England win. ""It would be an unalloyed, unadulterated absolute good. Everything would be good,"" he replied. The Bank governor also praised the England team's work ethic, humility and its innovation, adding: ""This is a pleasure to watch right now, so we are all behind them.""

"Seven earthquakes have hit Surrey since 1 April A seventh earthquake in just over 12 weeks has struck in Surrey in what has been described as a ""swarm"" of tremors. The quake, which had a magnitude of 3.1, struck at Newdigate, near Gatwick Airport, just before 12:00 BST. It was the third tremor in nine days and the fourth reported to the British Geological Survey (BGS) since 1 April, but seismologist David Galloway said there had been a total of seven. The BGS said evidence pointed towards a natural cause. More than 100 people reported the latest quake to the BGS. Robin Miller, in Newdigate, said: ""The whole place shook. It felt like someone had reversed a vehicle into the building."" The tremor was also felt in Charlwood, Dorking, Reigate and Redhill. Surrey's earthquake swarm Three tremors were felt on 1 April. The first had a magnitude of 2.7, a second within minutes came in at 1.8 and the third, an hour later, measured 1.7 The fourth quake on 28 April measured 1.5 The fifth on 27 June measured 2.6 A sixth tremor on 29 June registered 2.4 The latest and biggest quake on 5 July measured 3.0 ""With this cluster or swarm, at the moment we put it down to natural seismicity. We live on a dynamic planet,"" Mr Galloway said. ""Plates move about all the time. They're bashing and moving away from each other."" He said the UK was not on the edge of a plate so did not get hit by huge quakes, but stresses could still affect the rocks. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Concerns had been raised thattest drilling at Horse Hill,externalby energy firm UKOG had caused the tremors, but Mr Galloway said the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA) had told the BGS no test drilling had taken place. The BGS said the calculated epicentres for the earthquakes were about 4.5km (2.7 miles) from the Horse Hill well and scientists took the step of contacting OGA on 28 June. An OGA spokesman said: ""No flow testing operations are currently taking place at the Horse Hill drilling site."" However, Frack Free Sussex has raised concerns about drilling byAngus Energy at Brockham,external, near Dorking. A spokesman for Angus Energy said: ""Angus Energy does not frack nor is there any drilling at Brockham. In fact, there is no fracking in all of Surrey. These fields have been in production for decades, nothing has changed. ""There is absolutely no correlation between the reported tremors and our activities. The British Geological Survey reported the tremors were over seven times deeper and over 11km away from Brockham. Based on the regional geology it would be physically impossible to create these tremors from the Brockham Oil Field.  Any contradictory claims are unsupported by the facts or data."" In 2011,shale gas drilling in Lancashire was suspendedfollowing an earthquake. Frack Free Sussex spokeswoman Lorraine Inglis said: ""It's not just UKOG at Horse Hill, it's also Angus Energy at Brockham."" She said: ""We have not had any earthquakes in Surrey or Sussex for 500 years. ""Now we have onshore drilling and we are starting to have earth tremors. ""This one today is higher than the one in Lancashire which led to a moratorium on fracking. ""We want a moratorium on onshore drilling in the Weald."" Friends of the Earth has called for an investigation. Spokeswoman Brenda Pollack said: ""Worryingly, it seems that the authorities can't yet say what has caused these [tremors]. ""It's right that a thorough investigation now happens so that people know whether or not it is related to local oil activities."" UKOG's executive chairman, Stephen Sanderson, said there had been no subsurface activity at Horse Hill since March 2016. He said: ""We are currently preparing to conduct a flow test using a crane. No flow has yet taken place. We are not drilling and operations utilise a crane not a drill rig. ""We should stress that the work we are planning has the same seismic impact as any type of construction work requiring the use of such a crane."" Mr Sanderson added: ""We would also like to point out that there was no recorded seismicity associated with our 2014 drilling and 2016 flow testing, nor are we aware that any of the other 80 plus wells drilled or flowed in the Weald are associated with any seismicity. ""Furthermore as the BGS have stated, the source of this seismicity is related to a deep-seated basement fault at around 5.5km below surface, 4.5km deeper than our activities at Horse Hill.""

Rail firms warned trains that were running would be overcrowded The cause of the fault has been traced to the failure of the power supply linked to signalling equipment. A statement from Network Rail said that while a ""temporary fix"" was put in place after engineers worked overnight, significant disruption would continue across affected lines. Victoria is the second busiest station in Great Britain. About 210,000 passengers use the station a day, according to average figures collected for the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) in 2016-17. Gatwick Express services were suspended on Thursday while Southern and Thameslink trains were badly affected.

Kevin Liffey, 54, earlier missed his sister's funeral in Jersey because he could not get to Gatwick Airport from his home in East Finchley in time for his flight. That was despite spending Â£90 on a taxi from Victoria after being told he would not be able to catch the Gatwick Express from there. He said: ""It just shows we cannot rely on public transport at the most basic level. ""It's just not really acceptable in a country that's as developed as it is."" Gatwick Airport said flight passengers should leave extra time for their journeys. Adam Parker, 32, said he was ""close to breaking point"" after the three-hour journey from Hove into work on Thursday morning.

"This video can not be played England may not get this chance again - Southgate England v Sweden Date:Saturday, 7 July (15:00 BST).Venue:Samara Arena, Samara Coverage:Watch the game live on BBC One, the BBC Sport website and app. Listen live on 5 live, with live text commentary online Gareth Southgate says England must ""make the most"" of their World Cup opportunity in Russia, starting with Saturday's quarter-final against an ""older, more experienced"" Sweden. The match in Samara is England's first quarter-final appearance since 2006. A victory would earn England a semi-final meeting with Russia or Croatia. ""It's a great opportunity, and although our team will be individually better in two years, we might not have this opportunity again,"" said Southgate. England beat Colombiaon penalties in the last 16to record a first knockout stage win at a major tournament since 2006 with only their second penalty shootout win in eight attempts. Victory over Sweden would hand England a first semi-final since 1990. Sweden, though, have impressed in the last 12 months - finishing ahead of the Netherlands in qualifying, beating Italy in the subsequent play-offs and qualifying from the group in Russia ahead of defending champions Germany. ""We have huge respect for Sweden. They are a team that I think in the past have been underestimated - we won't make that mistake,"" added manager Southgate. ""Our players come from the same background as their players. We shouldn't get carried away with ourselves being better than Sweden. They are older, more experienced, and have a better tournament record than us."" This video can not be played The last time England played Sweden at a World Cup England have only beaten Sweden in two of their 15 meetings, including draws at the World Cup in 2002 and 2006. Their most recent meeting came in a friendly in November 2012 as Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored all four goals in a 4-2 victory for the hosts in Stockholm. ""You have to enjoy the good moments, but I am a long way from perfect, there are plenty of mistakes we have made while we have been here and we will make moving forward, so I think it is dangerous territory if we get carried away with things,"" said Southgate. Southgate has been praised for the atmosphere he has created in the camp as well as his meticulous preparations for each game. ""The key here is to do as good a job as we can and I am proud of the way the team are playing,"" added Southgate. ""We are being successful as we have a really good group of players who are hungry, who are taking ideas on board."" This video can not be played What can England expect from Sweden?

"David Guetta was among the artists who supported the proposed rules A controversial overhaul of the EU's copyright law that sparked a fierce debate between internet giants and content creators has been rejected. The proposed rules would have put more responsibility on websites to check for copyright infringements, and forced platforms to pay for linking to news. A slew of high-profile music stars had backed the change, arguing that websites had exploited their content. But opponents said the rules would stifle internet freedom and creativity. The move was intended to bring the EU's copyright laws in line with the digital age, but led toprotests from websitesand much debate before it was rejected by a margin of 318-278 in the European Parliament on Thursday. The proposed legislation - known as the Copyright Directive - was an attempt by the EU to modernise its copyright laws, but it contained two highly-contested parts. The first of these, Article 11, was intended to protect newspapers and other outlets from internet giants like Google and Facebook using their material without payment. But it was branded a ""link tax"" by opponents who feared it could lead to problems withsentence fragments being used to link to other news outlets (like this). Why the copyright plan was so controversial. Copyright law could put end to memes Article 13 was the other controversial part.  It put a greater responsibility on websites to enforce copyright laws, and would have meant that any online platform that allowed users to post text, images, sounds or code would need a way to assess and filter content. The most common way to do this is by using an automated copyright system, but they are expensive. The one YouTube uses cost $60m (Â£53m), so critics were worried that similar filters would need to be introduced to every website if Article 13 became law. There were also concerns that these copyright filters could effectively ban things like memes and remixes which use some copyrighted material. By Mark Savage, music reporter, BBC News The vocal support of Paul McCartney and Annie Lennox was not enough to pass the legislation The combined clout of Paul McCartney, Annie Lennox, Placido Domingo and David Guetta wasn't enough to persuade MEPs to make sweeping changes to copyright law. They were among 1,300 musicians who urged politicians to enact a law forcing sites like YouTube and Facebook to use filters that would stop users illegally uploading their music. Musicians were being cheated out of money, they argued, even though websites were making huge profits off their work. Critics said the laws would stifle creativity - with Creative Commons chief Ryan Merkley observing thatThe Beatles would have been prevented from performing cover versions,externalunder the proposed rules. For you and me, it could have resulted in text, music and videos posted to blogs, social networks and comment sections being yanked from the net at point of upload - somewhat likeYouTube's controversial Content ID system,externalon steroids. In the end, MEPs decided the changes needed more debate; and sent the proposals back to the Commission. The two sides will undoubtedly step up their campaigns in the meantime. Opponents of the Copyright Directive celebrated the news that MEPs had rejected it. Julia Reda, a Pirate Party MEP who had campaigned against the changes, tweeted: ""Great success: Your protests have worked! The European Parliament has sent the copyright law back to the drawing board."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"A number of areas have been sealed off in Salisbury and Amesbury The revelation that two more people have been exposed to the nerve agent Novichock has shocked people in Salisbury. Residents have experienced months of disruption and anxiety since the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in March. Now many are wondering whether, despite a clean-up operation, their city is safe? Charlie Rowley and his partner Dawn Sturgess, from Amesbury, became ill after visiting Salisbury on Saturday. Several locations in the city have again been cordoned off while police investigate how the couple came into contact with the nerve agent. ""It's just shocking,"" says Aaron Allen, who knows Mr Rowley and saw him last week in Salisbury city centre. ""It's not knowing whether people are being targeted at random that is worrying."" Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley fell ill on Saturday ""The fact I know him just makes it all worse,"" he added. ""It was slowly getting back to normal in Salisbury and now this has happened."" Following the attack on the Skripals, a massive clean-up operation was conducted in the city in an effort to keep the public safe. However, people in Salisbury now face the prospect that this clean-up was not as successful as first thought. Dawn Dwyer said she wondered what might happen next ""It's just frightening,"" said Dawn Dwyer. ""It makes you wonder what is going to happen next. ""You don't know if it might be on something you might touch. ""Salisbury is quite quiet normally, really."" Old school-friends Susan Ballam and Angela Majury have lived in and around Salisbury all their lives. Salisbury residents Susan Ballam (left) and Angela Majury want to know if the poison came from the same batch Mrs Ballam said: ""You think Salisbury is this beautiful cathedral city but why should it not happen here? ""When the first Salisbury incident happened and everything was closed off with a huge police presence my initial thought was that it was an overreaction. ""Now it feels like it could happen anywhere."" Mrs Majury said: ""We need to know if it is the same batch [of nerve agent]. ""If somebody has got hold of a batch it might not be the Russians after all."" A pleasant medieval cathedral city in Wiltshire, Salisbury typically attracts its share of tourists. Steven and Susan Watts, from Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, who are visiting the area with their caravan, said they had decided to go into the city despite some misgivings. Steven and Susan Watts were visiting from Worcestershire ""It's been on my mind,"" said Mrs Watts. ""It's a bit of a worry wondering if they have picked it up somewhere."" In nearby Amesbury, where Mr Rowley and Ms Sturgess were taken ill, there are yet more cordons. Roy Collins, secretary of Amesbury Baptist Church, said he had seen Mr Rowley at a hog roast at the church on Saturday. Roy Collins said the facts were ""horrific"" Ms Sturgess was already in hospital at this point. He said: ""We woke up to discover the church was cordoned off. Then we discovered there had been an incident of some kind. ""Now we understand the facts, which are horrific."" The church is one of several places in the town cordoned off, along with Boots, where Mr Rowley and Ms Sturgess had been to pick up a prescription. Louise Graham said she had visited Boots and had also been near the sealed-off Baptist Church, but was not too anxious. ""People are not panicking because they think this is a random thing,"" she said. Louise Graham said most people in Amesbury thought the poisoning is ""random"" But another Amesbury resident, Shpati Arapi, felt that people had been kept in the dark, especially those who lived on Muggleton Road, where the couple fell ill. ""We should have been given more information - especially the houses on that street,"" he said. ""First [we were told] it was drug-related but now it's something completely different.""

"Actor Niall Sheehy said one audience member was ""the stupidest woman on the planet"" Actors have vented their fury at two audience members who watched England's World Cup penalty shoot-out on their phones in the front row of a musical. Titanic The Musicalactor Niall Sheehy said,externalthe women ""not only followed the penalty shootout on their phone, but also said 'yesss' on each goal scored"". He declared: ""You are the most ignorant audience members I have ever had the misfortune to perform in front of."" The match clashed with a performance at Nottingham Theatre Royal on Tuesday. The game's dramatic climax saw England beat Colombia in the last 16 and progress to the quarter-finals. But some audience members couldn't resist keeping up with the match on their phones, despite having a different kind of drama unfolding on stage. One actor, Kieran Brown,wrote on Twitter,external: ""Dumbfounded. 2 ladies, 1 older 1 middle aged, slap bang front row clearly watching football on phones during the most poignant moment of lifeboats scene, cheering & giggling like stupid schoolgirls.

""It would seem that these two audience members seated on the front row, only a few feet away from the stage, perhaps had not realised that their actions could be both seen and heard,"" the statement said. The show is currently on a UK tour ""Even if audience members feel that they are being quiet or discreet in checking their phones during a performance, it is both disrespectful and distracting to the actors on stage and to the other people around them. ""Our staff are vigilant in stopping this kind of behaviour, where it is practical to do so without further distracting from the action on stage, but we do also rely on people using courtesy and respect to those around them when they come to see a live theatre performance.""

"The suspected poachers strayed into a large pride of lions, the reserve's owner said At least two suspected rhino poachers have been mauled to death and eaten by lions on a South African game reserve, officials say. Rangers discovered the remains of two, possibly three, people in a lion enclosure in the Sibuya reserve, near the south-east town of Kenton-on-Sea. A high-powered rifle and an axe were also found. There has been a rise in poaching in Africa in recent years, to feed growing demand for rhino horn in parts of Asia. In China, Vietnam and elsewhere, rhino horn is erroneously believed to have medicinal properties, even though it is made from the same material as human fingernails. Sibuya reserve owner Nick Fox said in a statement on the reserve's Facebook page thatthe suspected poachers entered the reserve late on Sunday night or early on Monday morning,external. ""They strayed into a pride of lions - it's a big pride so they didn't have too much time,"" Mr Fox told AFP news agency. ""We're not sure how many there were - there's not much left of them."" The Sibuya game reserve lost three rhinos to poachers in 2016 The remains were first spotted at 16:30 local time on Tuesday (14:30 GMT). An anti-poaching team arrived on the scene, where a hunting rifle with silencer, a long axe and wire-cutters - equipment generally used by rhino poachers - were also found. Several lions had to be tranquilised before the remains could be recovered, Mr Fox added. Four proposals to save the rhino Would a legal market deter poachers? Police have been patrolling the area in case any of the suspected poachers survived. Nine rhinos were killed by poachers in Eastern Cape province, where the reserve is located, this year alone. More than 7,000 have been killed in South Africa in the past decade. Briton injured in attack by own lion Poachers kill rhino at French zoo Would a legal market deter poachers?

"This video can not be played Three Lions: How 'It's coming home' went viral first time around It's 25 years since England fans first started chanting that football's coming home, and they've kept singing Three Lions in every major tournament since. But it takes on extra significance this time around, because of the similarities between Euro 2020 and the tournament the song was written for - Euro 96. The FA asked comedians David Baddiel and Frank Skinner to write the official England song that year, which they did with the band The Lightning Seeds. Baddiel and Skinner weren't random choices - they hosted a popular TV show called Fantasy Football at the time. The programme summed up 90s lad culture, but the double act wanted a song which had a deeper meaning for England fans... which meant singing about all the times England had been, frankly, rubbish. 'It's time for England to redefine their biggest rivalry' Speaking in aBBC Radio 5 Live showabout the track, Baddiel said they'd wanted to write an anthem ""that actually reflects what it's like to be an England fan"". He said Frank Skinner had described it as a ""bittersweet love song to the England team"". Ian Broudie, lead singer of The Lightning Seeds, wrote Three Lions with Frank Skinner (middle) and David Baddiel (right) The opening verse of Three Lions, with the lyrics ""England's gonna throw it away, gonna blow it away,"" encapsulates a lifetime of disappointments as an England fan. But when the team wins, it's the chorus that you hear sung in streets, bars and pubs up and down the country: ""It's coming home."" ""This is a song about how we've lost so often - and yet it's a song we want to sing,"" said Baddiel. The moment the song truly cemented itself into fans' hearts was when it echoed around Wembley at the end ofthe 1996 clash between England and Scotland. ""We'd just won 2-0. As they were exchanging shirts at the end, they played it over the loud speaker, and I thought 'great',"" Skinner toldDesert Island Discs. ""And then the crowd really really sang it. That was when I knew we'd got something special."" Will this be the generation that finally brings it home? Baddiel has said that he heard the FA thought the song was too downbeat and had doubts about playing it. ""Apparently the FA didn't want the DJ to put it on at Wembley, but he did it anyway,"" he said. ""And then it was sung at every game until England went out."" A home crowd had cheered England into the semi-finals. A talented team which included Alan Shearer, Paul Gascoigne and Paul Ince, had shaken off some press criticism of their pre-tournament partying to earn a tie against the almost-always-good Germany side. Gazza graced Euro 96 four years before our most recent bleached-blond hero, Phil Foden, was born Tabloid headlines before the match included: ""Achtung! Surrender,"" and other references to the Second World War which look pretty dodgy now. Shearer sent the country into a frenzy three minutes after kick-off, when he nodded the ball in from a Gascoigne corner. But England were pegged back six minutes later with a goal scored by commentator's nightmare, Stefan Kuntz. The game stayed at 1-1 for the rest of the game. ...and England lost. Gareth Southgate - who's now the England manager - was the only man to miss a penalty in that shootout. It's no wonder then, that in 2018 he spent so much timecomforting Mateus Uribeafter he missed a penalty in Colombia's World Cup clash with England. Southgate knew exactly how Uribe felt. ""It will never be off my back, sadly. That's something that will live with me forever,"" he said, when asked about that moment after the Colombia game. The bittersweet feeling of true empathy Southgate in 1996 versus Southgate in 2021: At least he won't be taking any penalties this evening Southgate will be hoping to set the record straight in tonight's game - where Three Lions will again, no doubt, echo around Wembley. He'd be a fitting person to bring 55 years of hurt to an end this summer. ""It's coming home"" originally referred to the fact that England was hosting its first major tournament since the 1966 World Cup. But it's now got a broader meaning - basically that England will win. If England manage to get to the final this year, they will play at Wembley - their home turf - in every game except one. So although Euro 2020 has been hosted in 11 cities across Europe, for the English team it's arguably pretty close to a home tournament. Allow YouTube content?

Three Lions has been the go-to England chant since that moment back in 1996. Two years later, it was re-recorded for the World Cup, with a few updated lyrics. Some fans even prefer the 1998 version (although the original song has about 20 million more views on YouTube than Three Lions '98 does). The less said about the 2010 version - featuring Robbie Williams, Russell Brand and an opera singer - the better. This video can not be played Three Lions on BBC News in 1996 - BBC Rewind The only downside to the 1996 song's endurance is that no other artists have been able to cash in on tournament songs since. ""Three Lions killed off the football anthem quite conclusively,"" Baddieltold the BBCin 2016. ""There were a few attempts after 1996 but no-one managed it,"" he said.

"David Guetta was among the artists who supported the proposed rules A controversial overhaul of the EU's copyright law that sparked a fierce debate between internet giants and content creators has been rejected. The proposed rules would have put more responsibility on websites to check for copyright infringements, and forced platforms to pay for linking to news. A slew of high-profile music stars had backed the change, arguing that websites had exploited their content. But opponents said the rules would stifle internet freedom and creativity. The move was intended to bring the EU's copyright laws in line with the digital age, but led toprotests from websitesand much debate before it was rejected by a margin of 318-278 in the European Parliament on Thursday. The proposed legislation - known as the Copyright Directive - was an attempt by the EU to modernise its copyright laws, but it contained two highly-contested parts. The first of these, Article 11, was intended to protect newspapers and other outlets from internet giants like Google and Facebook using their material without payment. But it was branded a ""link tax"" by opponents who feared it could lead to problems withsentence fragments being used to link to other news outlets (like this). Why the copyright plan was so controversial. Copyright law could put end to memes Article 13 was the other controversial part.  It put a greater responsibility on websites to enforce copyright laws, and would have meant that any online platform that allowed users to post text, images, sounds or code would need a way to assess and filter content. The most common way to do this is by using an automated copyright system, but they are expensive. The one YouTube uses cost $60m (Â£53m), so critics were worried that similar filters would need to be introduced to every website if Article 13 became law. There were also concerns that these copyright filters could effectively ban things like memes and remixes which use some copyrighted material. By Mark Savage, music reporter, BBC News The vocal support of Paul McCartney and Annie Lennox was not enough to pass the legislation The combined clout of Paul McCartney, Annie Lennox, Placido Domingo and David Guetta wasn't enough to persuade MEPs to make sweeping changes to copyright law. They were among 1,300 musicians who urged politicians to enact a law forcing sites like YouTube and Facebook to use filters that would stop users illegally uploading their music. Musicians were being cheated out of money, they argued, even though websites were making huge profits off their work. Critics said the laws would stifle creativity - with Creative Commons chief Ryan Merkley observing thatThe Beatles would have been prevented from performing cover versions,externalunder the proposed rules. For you and me, it could have resulted in text, music and videos posted to blogs, social networks and comment sections being yanked from the net at point of upload - somewhat likeYouTube's controversial Content ID system,externalon steroids. In the end, MEPs decided the changes needed more debate; and sent the proposals back to the Commission. The two sides will undoubtedly step up their campaigns in the meantime. Opponents of the Copyright Directive celebrated the news that MEPs had rejected it. Julia Reda, a Pirate Party MEP who had campaigned against the changes, tweeted: ""Great success: Your protests have worked! The European Parliament has sent the copyright law back to the drawing board."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Among the slogans was one directed at President Putin: ""You give him 76% in the election, and at 76 you get to retire"" Euphoric Russians took to the streets when their team advanced to the quarter-finals of the World Cup by beating Spain. But hours before Sunday's match, in 38 Russian towns and cities, there were protests at government plans to raise the retirement age for men and women. In the Siberian city of Omsk 3,000 people turned out, according to the organisers. ""Help the state, die before your pension,"" read one home-made placard. ""The government must go,"" read another. You would not have seen them in any of the 11 World Cup cities, because of a ban on demonstrations for the duration of the tournament. Under the new plan, to be implemented gradually from 2019, the retirement age for men will be increased by five years to 65. Women will have to work another eight years from 55 to 63. The scenes were very different in the centre of Moscow hours later when Russians celebrated their knockout victory over Spain Unusually for Russia, protesters in Omsk were from all sides of the political debate. Communist Party red flags and nationalist banners flew side by side, and opposition supporters joined in too. Read more Russian World Cup stories Russians protest over pension age hikes Is it OK to support Team Russia? Russian media mock World Cup 'husband-hunters' ""I'm here because the government is stealing from us,"" said Ivan Vasilievich, a pensioner in his 70s who supplements his pension with a job as a security guard. ""My granddaughter and her children couldn't survive without the money I bring in."" ""Enough"" reads a placard held by a protester in Ivanovo north-east of Moscow That some Russians are prepared to tear themselves away from the football, and take to the streets in a summer heat wave, is an indication of how angry they feel. It is not just because their government wants to raise the pension age for the first time since Stalin, but also because of how it has all been handled. The televised announcement by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev coincided with the opening of the tournament on 14 June, prompting criticism that the government was burying bad news. Russia's prime minister (2nd right) was all smiles, unlike Spain's King Felipe VI (left), as they watched Russia qualify for the quarter-finals on Sunday And it came despite past promises from President Vladimir Putin that the pension age would never be raised on his watch. The prime minister says the decision was motivated by the fact that Russians are living longer and leading more active lives. ""There are more opportunities to continue their careers,"" he told a cabinet meeting. ""We have 12 million working pensioners: that's almost a quarter of all pensioners."" Most economists and many Russians agree there is a problem. The population is getting older and the state is spending more and more on pensions. After the economic chaos of the early 1990s, Russia's population plummeted. The birth rate has since shown some signs of improvement, but it is not happening fast enough. Based on current trends, 20% of Russians will be over 65 by 2050, says the UN. President Putin has just signed a new bill on pension spending, envisaging a deficit of more than 265bn roubles (Â£3.1bn; $4.2bn) in 2018. That's 1.6% of the entire state budget expenditure. It is clearly not a sustainable situation, especially in tough economic times. Population:143.5 million Unemployment:5.2% Economic growth:1.5% (in 2017) Source: OECD; Tass Life in Putin's Russia in charts While economists agree the reforms will help balance the books, many question why they were not implemented earlier when the economy was in better shape. ""Putting off an unpopular but inevitable measureâ¦ shows an unforgivable lack of seriousness by the government,"" say two top economists from Moscow's Higher School of the Economy, Ilya Kashnitsky and Vladimir Kozlov. Although the reforms won't come into full effect until 2028 for men and 2034 for women, ordinary Russians worry about the impact. ""They haven't given us more years of work, just more years of poverty,"" said one banner at the Omsk protest. Moscow accountant Larisa Grigorieva, 57, retired two years ago and has tried and failed to find work ever since, struggling to compete in a changing market. ""I'm not getting any responses. They see you're 57 and no-one's interested,"" she says. This video can not be played Russians on warm World Cup atmosphere: 'It's splendid, it's great' Unless workers of Larisa's generation are given suitable training, many are likely to end up in the shadow economy with lower pay and few rights. The other problem for many Russians is the worry that they will not even live to retirement age. That is because average life expectancy for men in 15 Russian regions is currently lower than the new retirement age of 65. Most of these areas are in the Far East but some are in the west. So far the president has refrained from comment. His spokesman says he has not even been involved in the discussions, leaving some to speculate he might intervene at some point. But two recent sets of polls show Mr Putin's popularity has taken a dent. According to state pollster VTsIOM, his approval rating fell by 14 points from 78% to 64% in the two weeks since the reform. Far from enjoying a World Cup bounce, Mr Putin's ratings have gone down since the tournament began And the independent Levada Centre published a survey on Tuesday showing trust in the president had dropped below 50% for the first time in five years. ""I wouldn't make a big thing out of it,"" said his spokesman. At the Omsk protest, many seemed reluctant to blame the president personally. ""Please stop Medvedev!"" read one placard. But not everyone agreed. ""Prosecute Putin and Medvedev,"" said another. When the World Cup ends, so does the ban on protests in host cities. That is when the next chapter in this row will unfold.

"Esther McVey has faced calls to quit over ""inadvertently misleading"" the Commons about the official NAO spending watchdog's view of Universal Credit. Labour said the work and pensions secretary either ""misread"" or ""chose to misrepresent"" the NAO report and ""either way, she should resign"". Ms McVey said she would meet the NAO boss on Monday and again apologised for ""the phrasing of the words"" she used. But she insisted that Universal Credit was helping people get into employment. For the second successive day in the Commons she stood by her claim that the NAO (National Audit Office) report on Universal Credit did not take into account the latest developments, saying that changes made earlier this year had not fed through during the period covered, which was to April this year. McVey sorry for Universal Credit claims NAO: Universal Credit 'not value for money' The head of the NAO - Sir Amyas Morse - took the unusual step on Wednesday of publicly writing to Ms McVey to take issue with how she had responded to the report on Monday. Among the issues he raised, he said: ""I'm afraid your statement that the NAO was concerned Universal Credit is currently 'rolling but too slowly' and needs to 'continue at a faster rate' is also not correct. ""While we recognise regrettable early delays, my recommendation made clearly on page 11 of the report is the department must now ensure it is ready before it starts to transfer people over from previous benefits."" Ms McVey apologised for her wording on this point when she appeared in the Commons on Wednesday, and again on Thursday. She explained her error to MPs by saying the report had said there was ""no practical alternative"" to Universal Credit and that it had also said it regretted the slow pace of its roll-out, so she had taken that to mean the NAO was recommending it be speeded up. What is universal credit? Universal Credit 'not value for money' Reality Check: What do Universal Credit reforms mean? She added: ""If people know me they will always say about me I am open and I am straight and I will say it is as it is."" Shadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood said: ""The secretary of state should be ashamed she has been forced to come to this House again. ""Why and how did she come to say falsely over two separate occasions in this Parliament that the NAO report said the roll-out of Universal Credit should be speeded up? ""How can these statements be inadvertent  slips of the tongue? Has she ever read the NAO report? If she has, how can she draw the conclusions that she has? If she misread these reports so badly, this brings into question her competence and her judgement. ""If she did the read the report and chose to misrepresent its findings, she has clearly broken the ministerial code. Either way, she should resign."" This video can not be played Esther McVey's apology on Wednesday: ""In fact, the NAO did not say that."" In the report published last month,external, the NAO said the government's flagship benefits system was not delivering value for money and could end up costing more to administer than the benefits system it is replacing. It warned some claimants switching to Universal Credit, which rolls six working-age benefits into one, had waited eight months to be paid. While the report noted that the Department for Work and Pensions did ""not accept"" that Universal Credit had caused hardship among claimants, it pointed to a recent internal departmental report that showed 40% of claimants were experiencing financial difficulties. Universal Credit merges six benefits (income support; income-based jobseeker's allowance; income-related employment and support allowance; housing benefit; child tax credit; working tax credit) into one. It was designed to make claiming benefits simpler. A single payment is paid directly into claimants' bank accounts to cover the benefits for which they are eligible. Claimants then have to pay costs, such as rent, out of their UC payment. It can be claimed by people whether they are in or out of work - but payment decreases as you earn more. SNP frontbencher Alison Thewliss said the NAO report ""blows a hole as wide as the Clyde through everything the Tories have been saying"" on Universal Credit. Labour MP Meg Hillier asked Ms McVey to confirm that she had confidence in the NAO, with the minister replying that ""they do their job"". Ms McVey said her department believed Universal Credit would bring a Â£34bn benefit to the UK economy over the next 10 years and a 200,000 increase in employment. She said that Labour had predicted that a million more people would be unemployed if Universal Credit was brought in, but actually millions more people were in work and she added: ""I have never asked Labour to apologise for their misleading figures."" Universal Credit is currently available in 353 job centres and the government says it is ""on track"" to be rolled out to all job centres nationally by the end of 2018. In her 2 July statement, Ms McVey said 83% of claimants who responded had said they were satisfied with customer service.

"On 5 July 1948, 70 years ago on Thursday, the National Health Service (NHS) was born. We look at seven decades of the development of the NHS, alongside medical advancements, highlighting events that have been documented with archive photography. After the planning of an ambitious project to bring healthcare to everyone in the UK, the NHS was launched by Aneurin Bevan, the Health Secretary of the post-War Labour government. Bevan, seen below in 1945, was the chief architect of the plan to bring together hospitals, doctors, nurses, pharmacists, opticians and dentists under the umbrella of one organisation. The services were available to everyone, financed entirely from taxation with the central principle being that people would pay according to their means. Bevan is seen below on 5 July 1948 on the first day of the NHS, at Park Hospital, in Manchester (known today as Trafford General Hospital). By the 1950s, spending on the NHS exceeded what had been expected by Parliament and the Treasury. Five years after the launch of the NHS, charges of one shilling (5p) for prescriptions were introduced, and a flat rate of Â£1 for ordinary dental treatment. Five-year-old David Hurst is seen below, receiving dental treatment at the minor ailments clinic of the newly opened LCC Woodberry Down Health Centre, in London, in 1952. Bevan, then Minister of Labour, resigned from the government in protest at the introduction of the prescription charges. The charges were briefly abolished in 1965 and then reintroduced in 1968. In 1952, Princess Margaret opened a new department of the Queen Alexandra Hospital at Cosham, Portsmouth, seen below. British scientist Sir Richard Doll began research into lung cancer in the 1940s, following an alarming rise in the disease. His research on patients in 20 London hospitals revealed that smokers were far more likely than non-smokers to die of lung cancer. He published his findings in the British Medical Journal with Sir Austin Bradford Hill. Doll gave up smoking while carrying out his research and went on to live to be 92. He is seen below in 2004. The government accepted the link between smoking and lung cancer in 1954. Everyone under the age of 15 was vaccinated against polio and diphtheria in a programme in 1958. Before the vaccinations, cases of polio climbed as high as 8,000 and diphtheria as high as 70,000 in epidemic years, resulting in 5,000 deaths. In the early 1950s, NHS mobile immunisation vans were used, seen below in Portsmouth. Initially, the pill was available to only married women, until the law was changed in 1967. The number of British women using the pill rose from 50,000 to one million between 1962 and 1969. Prof Gregory Pincus, who developed the contraceptive pill, is seen below on the streets of London in 1966. Britain's first heart transplant was carried out at the National Heart Hospital, in Marylebone, London, in 1968. South Africa-born surgeon Donald Ross led a team of 18 doctors and nurses to operate on 45-year-old Frederick West in a seven-hour procedure. The donor was 26-year-old labourer Patrick Ryan, seen below with his wife, Mitzi, on their wedding day. West, seen below after the operation, died 46 days later from an associated infection. Only six further transplants were carried out over the following 10 years, for fear of failure. Sheila Thorns underwent a Caesarean section at Birmingham Maternity Hospital in 1968, giving birth to six babies; four girls and two boys. The medical team numbered 28 staff. One of the girls died shortly after the birth. The five surviving babies are seen in incubators in a photo below. Two further babies died at a later date. About one birth in three billion results in sextuplets. Thorns had been treated with the fertility treatment gonadotrophin. She is seen in a photo below in 1969 with three of her sextuplet babies. From left to right, they are Susan, Roger and Julie. Parents Sheila and Barry Thorns are seen in Woman magazine in 1969, below. A CT scanner uses X-rays and a computer to create detailed images of the inside of the body. The scans are sometimes referred to as Cat scans. The images of internal organs, blood vessels and bones can be used to diagnose and monitor conditions and guide treatments. Godfrey Newbold Hounsfield (below, standing far left) conceived the concept of the scanner in 1967 and launched it in 1972. Model Gillian Duxbury appeared with the scanner in a press photo call below, alongside its developers. Hounsfield's invention earned him a Nobel Prize alongside the American Allan McLeod Cormack, who developed the same idea in the US. Today, CT scanners are widely used. A new technique to fertilise an egg outside a woman's body before replacing it in the womb was developed by Dr Patrick Steptoe, a gynaecologist at Oldham General Hospital, and Dr Robert Edwards, a physiologist at the University of Cambridge. Lesley Brown gave birth to the world's first test-tube baby, Louise Brown, in 1978. Louise Brown is seen below in 1981 with her parents, John and Lesley Brown, and playing in a garden the same year. Louise Brown is seen below in 2013, holding the jar in which her embryo was incubated. In 1985, two-year-old Benjamin Hardwick became Britain's youngest liver transplant patient, at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge. The transplant was successful, but Hardwick died 14 months later just after his third birthday. His family set up the Ben Hardwick Memorial Fund to offer financial support to the families of children with primary liver disease. Hardwick is seen below with his mother, Debbie, in 1984. The publication of the report Better Health Better Wales in 1998 explicitly laid out the link between poverty and ill-health. Nurse Lisa Roberts is seen in 1998 below, examining X-rays on a light-box in the special care baby unit at the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff. The first successful gene therapy was carried out at Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, in 2002, curing 18-month-old Rhys Evans of ""bubble boy"" disease - severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Children born with SCID have no immune system of their own and must be kept in totally sterile conditions. Evans is seen below in 2002. Smoking was banned in restaurants, pubs and other public places in England from 1 July 2007. In 2007, patients were treated for fast or irregular heartbeats, using a robotic arm, at St Mary's Hospital, London. The Da Vinci surgical system robot is seen below at the Royal Marsden Hospital, in London, in 2007. The opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games included a performance that paid tribute to the Great Ormond Street Hospital and the NHS. On 27 December 2012, Mark Cahill's hand was amputated and a donor hand was transplanted during an operation at Leeds General Infirmary. Cahill is seen below after the operation, at home with his wife, Sylvia. The NHS celebrates its 70th birthday on 5 July 2018. A composite image below shows an NHS waiting room at the Montague Hospital, South Yorkshire, in 1959 (left) and a waiting room at Milton Keynes University Hospital in 2018 (right).

"This video can not be played Kane puts England ahead from penalty spot England's Harry Kane is used to accolades for his goal scoring - after all it took him just 79 seconds and three touches to score on his international debut against Lithuania in March 2015. But Kane, twice the Premier League's top scorer with 108 goals in 153 top-flight games, now has the biggest individual goal scoring prize of all in his sights - the World Cup's Golden Boot. His penalty in in last-16 victory over Colombia took him to six goals for the tournament, two clear of his nearest challenger, Belgium's Romelu Lukaku, and three clear of a small group including France's Kylian Mbappe. In the process he also equalled Gary Lineker's England record for number of goals in a tournament, set in 1986, and became the first Englishman to score in six consecutive internationals since Tommy Lawton in 1939. With Croatia to come in the semi-finals on Wednesday (and either a final or a third-fourth place play-off after that), Kane may not be finished yet. BBC Sport looks at how he stacks up against the rest and whether the Golden Boot could be heading in the direction of an England player for the first time since Lineker 32 years ago. Kane does not just score goals, he does it with remarkable efficiency. His six goals have come from only 10 shots, which compares very favourably to his nearest rivals... And he is currently scoring a goal every hour, which, again, puts him ahead of those battling him for the Golden Boot... Kane has benefited from being England's penalty taker in a World Cup that has featured more spot-kicks than any other. Twenty-eight have been awarded so far, with 21 goals resulting from them. As you can see below, Kane's percentage of goals from penalties is higher than any previous Golden Boot winner who has scored from the spot in a World Cup tournament. The Golden Boot was first awarded at the 2010 World Cup. Before that, from 1982 to 2006, it was the Golden Shoe and before that players were just recognised as the top goalscorer at the tournament without there being any formal award. Kane's six goals would already have won him or given him a share of the Golden Boot (or its equivalent) in 11 of the previous 20 World Cup tournaments. In fact, since 1978, only one player has scored more than six goals in a single tournament, Ronaldo firing Brazil to victory in South Korea and Japan in 2002 with eight goals - the record tally for a player at a 32-team World Cup, as the below table illustrates... England's captain will have to do something truly remarkable if he is to break the record for most goals at a World Cup, however. He is still seven short of the tally set by France's Just Fontaine in Sweden in 1958. The below table illustrates the number of goals scored by each top-scorer at a World Cup, all the way back to the first in 1930... At 24, Kane has hit a magic number when it comes to the top scorer prize, with seven of the first nine outright winners doing so at the same age. In short - kudos, prestige and the opportunity to further your career at one of the biggest clubs in world football. Here is what winning the prize has done for the career of a selection of players... Gary Lineker scored six goals at the Mexico World Cup in 1986 and is England's only ever winner of the Golden Boot Lineker was already a big fish in the then First Division after joining Champions Everton for a club record Â£800,000 fee in 1985 and scoring 40 goals in 57 games on Merseyside. But the 1986 World Cup in Mexico saw a dream move to Barcelona materialise for Â£2.8m. He went on to win the Copa del Rey in 1988 and the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1989 and scored 42 goals in 103 league appearances for the Spanish giants Oleg Salenko entered World Cup history with five goals in a single game against Cameroon in 1994 Back in 1994, Russia's Salenko was little known away from his club, Spanish side Logrones, but his six goals in the finals in the USA ensured a tie for the Golden Boot with Bulgaria's Hristo Stoichkov. He stands alone in World Cup history for scoring five goals in a game, while also being the only player to finish top scorer after his country failed to get out of the group stages. His record-breaking exploits earned Salenko a post-tournament switch to Valencia. Ronaldo scored 15 goals in 19 World Cup finals matches for Brazil and is second on the all-time top scorers chart behind Germany's Miroslav Klose, who has 16 Ronaldo recovered from a series of knee problems to score eight goals, including two in the final against Germany, as Brazil won their fifth World Cup in 2002. Widely regarded as the best forward on the planet at the time, he moved from Inter Milan to Real Madrid that summer and his second Ballon d'Or followed later that year. James Rodriguez scored six goals for Colombia who reached the World Cup quarter-finals in 2014 Monaco's attacking midfielder Rodriguez announced himself on the world scene at the 2014 tournament in Brazil, scoring six times in five games to help Colombia to the quarter-finals. His efforts saw him eclipse Germany's Thomas Muller and home favourite Neymar in the race for the Golden Boot, paving the way for a Â£71m move from Monaco to Real Madrid on a six-year deal.

"Theresa May has said she hopes her cabinet will be able to ""discuss and decide on a substantive way forward"" on Brexit at their crucial Friday awayday. The UK prime minister told Germany's Angela Merkel she hoped this would lead to an increase in the ""pace and intensity"" of UK-EU negotiations. As they met in Berlin, Mrs Merkel said Brexit talks were at a ""crucial phase"". She said that a political framework for future relations needed to be clear by October. Jaguar boss: Brexit threatens investment Theresa May's new Brexit trade plan explained What kind of Brexit do voters want? Brexit: All you need to know Downing Street said Theresa May and Angela Merkel had ""constructive"" talks about Brexit in Berlin and the cabinet's discussions at Chequers would decide a ""substantial way forward which would enable the pace and intensity of negotiations to increase"". Meanwhile Brexiteer ministers including Boris Johnson, David Davis, Michael Gove, Liam Fox and Esther McVey were holding talks on Thursday evening, ahead of the meeting on Friday.

The two leaders' meeting came as Downing Street set out some of the detail of its new proposal for how trade between the UK and the EU could be handled after Brexit. There are differing views within the cabinet about how closely the UK should stick to EU rules after Brexit, and what compromises should be made to achieve ""as frictionless as possible"" trade. After months of tension and disagreement, the prime minster is gathering the entire cabinet at her country retreat, Chequers, with the aim of agreeing a UK proposal on how future relations with the EU will work. That would then be the subject of negotiations with the EU - which might have different ideas. The UK is due to leave the European Union at 23:00 GMT on 29 March 2019. But to allow time for parliaments in the UK and the EU to approve whatever deal is agreed, the aim is for the framework for future relations to be agreed this autumn. According to No 10, the new plan would allow the UK the freedom to set its own tariffs on goods arriving into the country. Technology would be used to determine where the goods will ultimately end up - and therefore whether UK or EU tariffs should be paid. Downing Street says it is confident the arrangement would be partly in place by the end of the proposed transition period in December 2020 - with the system being fully operational by the next general election, which is due in 2022. On regulations, it is understood that the UK would closely mirror the EU's rules - but Parliament would be able to decide where to deviate. However, the arrangement has not been explained in full - and it is not clear whether the cabinet will back the plan, or whether the EU would agree. A source close to Brexit Secretary David Davis refused to comment on aDaily Telegraph report,externalthat he had already told Mrs May the plan was unworkable. Mr Davis and Mrs May were ""working closely on what will be presented on Friday"", the source said. However Mr Davis is expected to ""forcefully"" express his doubts and reservations about the compromise plan, including the view that it could be a mistake to set out too much of the UK's negotiating position at this stage Please upgrade your browser Among the issues that need to be resolved is the need to avoid new border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland when the UK is outside the customs union. Eurosceptic MPs have warned Mrs May against tying the UK to the EU after it leaves, saying this will prevent it from striking its own trade deals with other countries. Meanwhile 46 other Conservative MPs have written to Mrs May urging her to listen to the voice of business and target a deal which enables ""frictionless trade to continue"". After Friday's meeting, the government is expected to publish a White Paper setting out its plans in detail. The European Union asked a series of questions about the UK's previous customs proposals and they are still relevant. Will it be temporary? Does it solve the Irish border issue fully or partly? Does it respect the integrity of EU customs policy? How is it supervised? How will the UK system evolve as the EU's does? Will the EU need to change its trade policy? But customs is only a fraction of the relationship between the UK and the EU and so the British idea of aligning to some European regulations is a much bigger deal. And the priority in Brussels is to find a solution to the Northern Irish border. ""If there isn't a deal on that then things could turn nasty quite quickly,"" a diplomat told me. The EU is waiting to see the full White Paper. Officials from the 27 remaining countries are primed to meet soon after it is published and ministers will give their reaction at a meeting on 20 July but civil servants in Brussels expect to be combing through it until the end of the month at least.

"This video can not be played Commuters face massive disruption due to signal failure Tens of thousands of train passengers faced long delays after faulty signalling equipment caused major disruption across London. People travelling through the capital have been told to avoid London Victoria station if using Southern, Gatwick Express or Thameslink trains. Journeys have been cancelled and delayed by up to 60 minutes after the fault in Streatham, south London. National Rail said disruption will last until at least 07:00 BST on Friday. Passengers are advised to check theSouthern website,externalin the morning to see whether trains are running. They had initially been told to expect normal services to resume by 14:00 on Thursday after the fault was discovered on Wednesday night. Network Rail, the government-owned company responsible for maintaining rail infrastructure, offered a ""sincere apology"" to customers. Rail firms warned trains that were running would be overcrowded The cause of the fault has been traced to the failure of the power supply linked to signalling equipment. A statement from Network Rail said that while a ""temporary fix"" was put in place after engineers worked overnight, significant disruption would continue across affected lines. Victoria is the second busiest station in Great Britain. About 210,000 passengers use the station a day, according to average figures collected for the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) in 2016-17. Gatwick Express services were suspended on Thursday while Southern and Thameslink trains were badly affected.

Kevin Liffey, 54, earlier missed his sister's funeral in Jersey because he could not get to Gatwick Airport from his home in East Finchley in time for his flight. That was despite spending Â£90 on a taxi from Victoria after being told he would not be able to catch the Gatwick Express from there. He said: ""It just shows we cannot rely on public transport at the most basic level. ""It's just not really acceptable in a country that's as developed as it is."" Gatwick Airport said flight passengers should leave extra time for their journeys. Adam Parker, 32, said he was ""close to breaking point"" after the three-hour journey from Hove into work on Thursday morning.

"Gaia Pope's body was found 11 days after she went missing from Swanage Dorset Police is to be investigated over the way it handled an allegation of rape brought by teenager Gaia Pope two years before her death. The 19-year-old's body was found near Swanage, Dorset on 18 November, 11 days after she was reported missing. The police watchdog said the new probe comes after a complaint by Miss Pope's family about the force's handling of a rape allegation made in December 2015. Her family has welcomed the announcement. Catrin Evans of the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), said: ""After an initial investigation, Dorset Police made the decision in June 2016 to take no further action in respect of a rape allegation made by Gaia. ""Following complaints made by her family, we will investigate whether the police response was in accordance with local and national policies and guidance in relation to the investigation of rape cases, including Crown Prosecution Service referral and charging criteria. ""My thoughts continue to be with Gaia's family and everyone affected by her death."" In a statement Supt Pete Windle, of Dorset Police, said: ""Following receipt of this complaint we have referred ourselves to the IOPC as the mandatory referral criteria was met."" Dorset Police said it is cooperating fully with the police watchdog and HM Coroner and is supplying any information as requested by them. An IOPC investigation into Dorset Police's response and subsequent searches for Gaia when she went missing is ongoing. Scores of people brought flowers and candles to a vigil at Swanage amphitheatre after Gaia's body was found near a coastal path Miss Pope's family say the rape and alleged failed investigation ""severely affected Gaia's mental and physical state"". They said ""she lived in fear every day"" in the months before her death when she learnt the man who she reported for rape was eligible for early release from prison, where he was serving a sentence for a separate conviction. Mass searches for the teenager were carried out on land surrounding the coast path on the Purbeck coast Richard Sutherland, Gaia's father, said: ""We need to know if more could have been done to make Gaia feel safe. ""Nothing can bring her back to us but a thorough, transparent and unbiased investigation will help us move forwards. We need to know the truth."" Maya Pope-Sutherland, Gaia's twin sister, said: ""It feels like we've been screaming in a vacuum for a long time but now we will break the silence. ""I hope our search for answers can open the door to positive change and help other survivors be heard and get justice. It's what Gaia would have wanted."" Gaia Pope police response investigated Gaia Pope 'died from hypothermia' Funeral held for teenager Gaia Pope In a statement, Inquest - the lawyers group representing the family - said: ""In addition to concerns about the conduct of the police, the family have questions about whether a lack of support from underfunded mental health and social services contributed to Gaia's death."" Following her disappearance on 7 November 2017 searches by police, the coastguard and police helicopter - along with hundreds of volunteers - were carried out in the Swanage area. Her body was found by police on 18 November near a coastal path and field between Dancing Ledge and Anvil Point, close to whereitems of her clothing had been foundtwo days earlier. Tests showed Gaia, who had severe epilepsy and mental health issues,died from hypothermia.

"Jean Jones was only a toddler when the NHS came kicking and screaming into life on 5 July 1948. But she immediately became one of its first patients as she had what turned to be a rare cancer called histiocytosis. It had caused permanent damage to her kidneys, lungs and pituitary gland and meant she was constantly in and out of her local hospital, The Christie in Greater Manchester, in the early years of the health service's life. She has remained under the care of the hospital ever since - and even now has regular check-ups and still has to take hormone drugs. Is the NHS a champion or an also-ran? The history of the NHS in charts Forget 70 - what will the NHS look like at 100? She says she owes the health service her life - and her treatment even inspired her to dedicate her career to the NHS, because she went on to become a nurse. ""Before the NHS came along you had to pay for everything. I've had a lot of treatment over the years. I don't know if I would have been able to afford it. ""I take medication every day, but I've been lucky because it's obviously worked for me. I have every reason to be grateful to the NHS."" Her memories of her early treatment are quite hazy - she was only 20 months old in 1948. But she says all the nurses were ""very nice"" and remembers her mother bringing in her ration book to give sugar coupons to the women who made the tea ""so they could buy sweets for the children"". After finishing school she worked as a hairdresser for three years, but then retrained as a nurse, eventually specialising in surgical nursing. She has been telling her story as the NHS celebrates its 70th birthday. When the NHS was created it was the first time anywhere in the world that completely free healthcare was made available on the basis of citizenship rather than the payment of fees or insurance. This video can not be played The launch of the NHS, providing free universal health care for everyone in the UK Celebration events are taking place across the UK, including services at Westminster Abbey and York Minister. The NHS logo will also be projected on to famous landmarks including the Eden Project in Cornwall, the Houses of Parliament and the London Eye. There will also be thousands of NHS-themed public tea parties taking place. In a reception at Downing Street on Wednesday night for health staff, Prime Minister Theresa May praised the longevity of the NHS. ""In my line of work there are not many ideas from 70 years ago that are unquestionably supported today, but that is undoubtedly the case with our National Health Service,"" she said. ""In a world that has changed almost beyond recognition, the vision at the heart of the NHS - of a tax-funded service that is available to all, free at the point of use with care based on clinical need and not the ability to pay - still retains near-universal acceptance."" This video can not be played Aneira Thomas: ""I came into the world at one minute past midnight on July 5th 1948"". Meanwhile, Game of Thrones TV star Emilia Clarke has also been paying her own tribute to the NHS. She has accepted the position of an ambassador for the Royal College of Nursing - something she said she was inspired to do following the excellent care her dying father received two years ago. She watched on as staff comforted him and then her and is now full of praise for the ""awe-inspiring skill"" and ""emotional intelligence"" they showed. ""I know my dad received the best care and medical support. ""To see family members suffer and then to see nurses selflessly care for that person means so much. ""After a panic at hearing bells and buzzers I didn't understand, the hug that came my way and the words that accompanied it both reassured and comforted me. ""The NHS is there for everyone - and we will all need it at some point."" Thursday is a time for celebration for the health service. But it also comes at a crucial point.

"Gaia Pope's body was found 11 days after she went missing from Swanage Dorset Police is to be investigated over the way it handled an allegation of rape brought by teenager Gaia Pope two years before her death. The 19-year-old's body was found near Swanage, Dorset on 18 November, 11 days after she was reported missing. The police watchdog said the new probe comes after a complaint by Miss Pope's family about the force's handling of a rape allegation made in December 2015. Her family has welcomed the announcement. Catrin Evans of the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), said: ""After an initial investigation, Dorset Police made the decision in June 2016 to take no further action in respect of a rape allegation made by Gaia. ""Following complaints made by her family, we will investigate whether the police response was in accordance with local and national policies and guidance in relation to the investigation of rape cases, including Crown Prosecution Service referral and charging criteria. ""My thoughts continue to be with Gaia's family and everyone affected by her death."" In a statement Supt Pete Windle, of Dorset Police, said: ""Following receipt of this complaint we have referred ourselves to the IOPC as the mandatory referral criteria was met."" Dorset Police said it is cooperating fully with the police watchdog and HM Coroner and is supplying any information as requested by them. An IOPC investigation into Dorset Police's response and subsequent searches for Gaia when she went missing is ongoing. Scores of people brought flowers and candles to a vigil at Swanage amphitheatre after Gaia's body was found near a coastal path Miss Pope's family say the rape and alleged failed investigation ""severely affected Gaia's mental and physical state"". They said ""she lived in fear every day"" in the months before her death when she learnt the man who she reported for rape was eligible for early release from prison, where he was serving a sentence for a separate conviction. Mass searches for the teenager were carried out on land surrounding the coast path on the Purbeck coast Richard Sutherland, Gaia's father, said: ""We need to know if more could have been done to make Gaia feel safe. ""Nothing can bring her back to us but a thorough, transparent and unbiased investigation will help us move forwards. We need to know the truth."" Maya Pope-Sutherland, Gaia's twin sister, said: ""It feels like we've been screaming in a vacuum for a long time but now we will break the silence. ""I hope our search for answers can open the door to positive change and help other survivors be heard and get justice. It's what Gaia would have wanted."" Gaia Pope police response investigated Gaia Pope 'died from hypothermia' Funeral held for teenager Gaia Pope In a statement, Inquest - the lawyers group representing the family - said: ""In addition to concerns about the conduct of the police, the family have questions about whether a lack of support from underfunded mental health and social services contributed to Gaia's death."" Following her disappearance on 7 November 2017 searches by police, the coastguard and police helicopter - along with hundreds of volunteers - were carried out in the Swanage area. Her body was found by police on 18 November near a coastal path and field between Dancing Ledge and Anvil Point, close to whereitems of her clothing had been foundtwo days earlier.

"The polar bear, which will be examined by local conservation officers, was shot dead by nearby adults A father died protecting his children in a rare polar bear attack in Canada's northernmost territory of Nunavut. Aaron Gibbons, 31, was on Sentry Island, a popular fishing and hunting spot on the west coast of Hudson Bay, when he encountered the bear on 3 July. A relative said he ""died a hero"", telling his daughters to run while he put himself between them and the bear. The children were unharmed, but Mr Gibbons died in the attack. Another adult later shot and killed the bear. ""He was enjoying his day with his children,"" Mr Gibbons's uncle Gordy Kidlapik told Canadian media. ""They were surprised by a bear that had started to stalk or charge towards one of his children."" Polar bears 'running out of food' Popularity among humans is threatening wild animals The father was unarmed at the time, police said, even though he would have had a rifle with him on the outing. One of the girls, who are described as primary school age, called for help through the boat's radio. ""We actually heard the call for help,"" said Mr Kidlapik. ""It was terrible to listen to.""

Mr Gibbons's death has shocked his hometown of Arviat, about 10km (6.2 miles) from the site of the attack, which has grown accustomed to seeing polar bears as they migrate north. ""It's really just incredibly sad,"" said local lawmaker John Main,externalon Canadian broadcaster CBC. ""We're a small community and when something like this happens, it affects the whole community."" With 380 polar bear sightings in the hamlet in 2017, the predominantly Inuit community has become increasingly concerned for public safety. The number of polar bears in the Western Hudson Bay region remains stable at around 840, according to polar bear experts. However, they have noted a decline in the animals' body size and condition. Polar bear excursions hosted in the region have also removed the wild animal's fear of humans, Mr Kidlapik alleged on Twitter, potentially resulting in more attacks on humans. Allow Twitter content?

"EDF Energy is raising its prices for dual fuel customers by 6% from August, which will add Â£70 a year to the average bill. The French-owned company says wholesale fuel prices have risen 13% since April, when it last raised prices. Then, it imposed a 2.7% increase in electricity prices, which left dual fuel customers paying 1.4% more. EDF is the second of the ""big six"" energy suppliers to raise prices for the second time this year. E.On started off this new round of price rises in the middle of June when it imposed a 4.8% price rise - an average of Â£55 a year - for its dual fuel customers. EDF said that 60% of its customers would not be affected by the latest move, which includes vulnerable customers already protected by certain price caps. The energy firm said one of the reasons prices had risen was the intense cold snap earlier this year resulting from the arrival of the so-called ""Beast from the East"" weather front, which cut gas storage stocks. That, it said, was compounded by rising oil prices on the global markets, which fed into higher UK wholesale prices for both gas and electricity. The company said that the regulator, Ofgem, had acknowledged that costs faced by all energy suppliers had increased when it set certain price caps in April. EDF's energy managing director of customers, BÃ©atrice Bigois, said: ""We know that another price rise will not be welcome, and we had hoped that our limited changes announced in April would be enough."" She added that, despite ""our best efforts"" to absorb rising costs EDF can no longer sustain this. The company would be writing to advise customers of the change, she said, and that those who wished to avoid the increase would be encouraged to choose a fixed price tariff.

The two leaders' meeting came as Downing Street set out some of the detail of its new proposal for how trade between the UK and the EU could be handled after Brexit. There are differing views within the cabinet about how closely the UK should stick to EU rules after Brexit, and what compromises should be made to achieve ""as frictionless as possible"" trade. After months of tension and disagreement, the prime minster is gathering the entire cabinet at her country retreat, Chequers, with the aim of agreeing a UK proposal on how future relations with the EU will work. That would then be the subject of negotiations with the EU - which might have different ideas. The UK is due to leave the European Union at 23:00 GMT on 29 March 2019. But to allow time for parliaments in the UK and the EU to approve whatever deal is agreed, the aim is for the framework for future relations to be agreed this autumn. According to No 10, the new plan would allow the UK the freedom to set its own tariffs on goods arriving into the country. Technology would be used to determine where the goods will ultimately end up - and therefore whether UK or EU tariffs should be paid. Downing Street says it is confident the arrangement would be partly in place by the end of the proposed transition period in December 2020 - with the system being fully operational by the next general election, which is due in 2022. On regulations, it is understood that the UK would closely mirror the EU's rules - but Parliament would be able to decide where to deviate. However, the arrangement has not been explained in full - and it is not clear whether the cabinet will back the plan, or whether the EU would agree. A source close to Brexit Secretary David Davis refused to comment on aDaily Telegraph report,externalthat he had already told Mrs May the plan was unworkable. Mr Davis and Mrs May were ""working closely on what will be presented on Friday"", the source said. However Mr Davis is expected to ""forcefully"" express his doubts and reservations about the compromise plan, including the view that it could be a mistake to set out too much of the UK's negotiating position at this stage Please upgrade your browser Among the issues that need to be resolved is the need to avoid new border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland when the UK is outside the customs union. Eurosceptic MPs have warned Mrs May against tying the UK to the EU after it leaves, saying this will prevent it from striking its own trade deals with other countries. Meanwhile 46 other Conservative MPs have written to Mrs May urging her to listen to the voice of business and target a deal which enables ""frictionless trade to continue"". After Friday's meeting, the government is expected to publish a White Paper setting out its plans in detail. The European Union asked a series of questions about the UK's previous customs proposals and they are still relevant. Will it be temporary? Does it solve the Irish border issue fully or partly? Does it respect the integrity of EU customs policy? How is it supervised? How will the UK system evolve as the EU's does? Will the EU need to change its trade policy? But customs is only a fraction of the relationship between the UK and the EU and so the British idea of aligning to some European regulations is a much bigger deal. And the priority in Brussels is to find a solution to the Northern Irish border. ""If there isn't a deal on that then things could turn nasty quite quickly,"" a diplomat told me. The EU is waiting to see the full White Paper. Officials from the 27 remaining countries are primed to meet soon after it is published and ministers will give their reaction at a meeting on 20 July but civil servants in Brussels expect to be combing through it until the end of the month at least.

"The Bank of England governor now has more confidence in the UK economy, in a speech which could stoke expectations of an interest rate rise in August. Mark Carney said recent data had given him ""greater confidence"" that weak first-quarter growth ""was largely due to the weather"". He said household spending and sentiment had ""bounced back strongly"". England winning the World Cup would be an ""unalloyed, unadulterated absolute good"" for the economy, Mr Carney added. Global economy 'under threat as tariff war bites' What would a rate rise mean for you? In a speech at the Northern Powerhouse Summit in Newcastle, Mr Carney said: ""Overall, recent domestic data suggest the economy is evolving largely in line with the May Inflation Report projections, which see demand growing at rates slightly above those of supply and domestic cost pressures building."" Thepound edged up 0.2% against the dollarto $1.3254 following his remarks. Last month, three members of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee - including chief economist Andy Haldane - voted in favour of lifting the interest rate to 0.75%. Mr Carney was among the six MPC members who voted to keep rates on hold at 0.5%. He also warned that a global trade war could dampen economic growth. Mr Carney said ""protectionist rhetoric"" was rising and was now turning into action: ""There are some, tentative signs that this more hostile and uncertain trading environment may be dampening activity."" He cited evidence from the IHS Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' index (PMI), which suggested that global export orders and manufacturing output have fallen back from highs at the start of the year. On Friday, the US will implement a 25% import tariff on a list of hundreds of Chinese goods. On the same day, China will also impose 25% tariffs on a range of US goods, including pork products, fish and rice. In a Q&A session after his speech, Mr Carney - who was wearing a Three Lions lapel badge - was asked about the economic impact of an England win. ""It would be an unalloyed, unadulterated absolute good. Everything would be good,"" he replied. The Bank governor also praised the England team's work ethic, humility and its innovation, adding: ""This is a pleasure to watch right now, so we are all behind them."" When the event host said ""In Gareth we trust"", Mr Carney quipped: ""I will get my waistcoat this afternoon.""

He declared: ""You are the most ignorant audience members I have ever had the misfortune to perform in front of."" The match clashed with a performance at Nottingham Theatre Royal on Tuesday. The game's dramatic climax saw England beat Colombia in the last 16 and progress to the quarter-finals. But some audience members couldn't resist keeping up with the match on their phones, despite having a different kind of drama unfolding on stage. One actor, Kieran Brown,wrote on Twitter,external: ""Dumbfounded. 2 ladies, 1 older 1 middle aged, slap bang front row clearly watching football on phones during the most poignant moment of lifeboats scene, cheering & giggling like stupid schoolgirls. ""To say I'm raging is an understatement! They should be marched out in disgrace!"" Sheehy added,externalthat a cast member signalled to the women to put their phone away, but they just ""smiled, gave a thumbs up and replied 'I know - we won!!'"" He concluded: ""I think you may have let us all know you are the stupidest woman on the planet. Please avoid attending any future theatrical productions."" Fellow cast memberStephen Webb wrote,external: ""If you come to theatre to see the show do not... I say do not... sit there on your phone to watch the World Cup!!! ""Stay at home!! It's so disrespectful!! Especially if you are sat in the front row!!!! #manners #GoHome"" One theatregoerwrote to a cast member saying,external: ""I feel I need to apologise on behalf of the appalling lady in the front centre of the stalls who could not stay off her phone. ""I can assure you she doesn't represent the way people usually behave at @RoyalNottingham."" Some Twitter users had sympathy for the women, however.One wrote,external: ""Oh no... Showing a bit of passion for their team in a BIG match! ""Shame on them for doing it during the show but c'mon sometimes human nature has a desire to do things that aren't intentionally bad willed."" Phone call halts Craig and Jackman play,external Mobile phone use 'unacceptable' at the theatre, says survey Actors reveal worst stage interruptions In a statement, the theatre said its front of house team told every audience member to switch off their phones as they entered the auditorium, and that a duty manager was in the stalls but wasn't aware of any disturbance. ""It would seem that these two audience members seated on the front row, only a few feet away from the stage, perhaps had not realised that their actions could be both seen and heard,"" the statement said. The show is currently on a UK tour ""Even if audience members feel that they are being quiet or discreet in checking their phones during a performance, it is both disrespectful and distracting to the actors on stage and to the other people around them. ""Our staff are vigilant in stopping this kind of behaviour, where it is practical to do so without further distracting from the action on stage, but we do also rely on people using courtesy and respect to those around them when they come to see a live theatre performance."" They will hope audience members resist the temptation to follow England's next match against Sweden at 15:00 BST on Saturday - which coincides with the touring musical's matinee performance.

Detectives working on the case said they were still seeking information from the public, especially anyone who was in the Ardbeg Road area where Alesha's body was found. The lead detective described the arrest as a ""major development"". Additional police officers were sent to the Isle of Bute to assist with the investigation Det Supt Stuart Houston said: ""The response to our earlier public appeals has been significant. ""However... I am still appealing for anyone who was in the Ardbeg Road area of Bute on Sunday night or in the early hours of Monday and who may have information about Alesha's death to contact us.

"Christopher Harrison was assaulted outside The Carlisle pub on Hastings seafront two years ago Two Hells Angels bikers launched an attack on a man that was so ""ferocious"" his eyeballs ruptured, a court heard. Matthew Barnes, 48, of Victoria Avenue, Hastings, and Oliver Wilkinson, 50, of Duke Road, St Leonards-on-Sea, deny grievous bodily harm with intent. The Old Bailey was told that Christopher Harrison was injured in the attack outside The Carlisle pub on Hastings seafront in February 2016. He was targeted because he did not want to join the bikers' club, jurors heard. Opening the case, prosecutor Nicholas Cooper said Mr Barnes was the president of the Sussex Hells Angels motorcycle club and Mr Wilkinson was part of the club's ""support crew"". They had gathered at The Carlisle pub with other members and associates, where a band was playing. Mr Harrison was also present and, although a biker, was not a member of the Hells Angels, the court was told. The jury heard that at about midnight on 20 February, Mr Harrison was invited outside by Mr Wilkinson and was asked if he was interested in becoming a member of the Hells Angels. Mr Harrison said: ""I don't want to know, I'm too old, I really don't want to know."" The prosecution said Mr Wilkinson then went away and returned with Mr Barnes, who said: ""Why wouldn't you want to wear these colours?"" The jury was told Mr Harrison replied: ""But it's neutral territory, we get all sorts of colours through here and I'm just not interested. ""We get, you know, blue and white from along the road, this black and white, they come in here, things like that."" Mr Barnes is then alleged to have said: ""I hate black and white, all black and whites should die,"" before head-butting Mr Harrison so hard that his head hit the wall behind. Mr Cooper said punches then ""started raining in"", and ""they knocked [Mr Harrison's] legs from behind the knees so he fell to the ground"". The court heard Mr Harrison knew Mr Barnes was standing in front of him and had attacked him first with the head-butt. ""Mr Harrison knew that Oliver Wilkinson was stood to his left, and that no-one else was stood there and that ferocious punch... came from that direction,"" Mr Cooper said. The trial continues.

"Rescue workers are concerned about what might happen when monsoon rains hit Rescuers are racing against the rains to free 12 boys and their football coach, who are trapped in a flooded cave in northern Thailand. A deluge is expected to hit in a matter of days that could force the water level up, threatening to flood the pocket where the group took refuge. The teenage boys and their 25-year-old coach have been trapped for 12 days. They were found on Monday night by rescue divers, on a rock shelf about 4km (2.5 miles) from the cave mouth. The boys have now received food, foil blankets, and medical attention, and rescuers are trying to run cables through the cave tunnel so they can speak to their families. The region of Chiang Rai where the boys are trapped has for the past few days experienced a dry spell, and rescuers have taken advantage of this to pump water out of the cave complex. What are the rescue options? Hope grows for daring rescue About 128 million litres of water had been pumped out by Thursday, with the water levels coming down at an average rate of 1.5cm per hour. Rescue workers are now able to walk through a 1.5km (0.9 mile) stretch from the entrance to what's being called the third chamber. Water is being pumped out of the cave complex around the clock But heavy monsoon rains are forecast for Sunday. Chiang Rai Governor Narongsak Osotthanakorn said they were ""racing against water"". ""We are calculating how much time we have it if rains, how many hours and days,"" he said. The Tham Luang cave complex is regularly flooded during the rainy season until September or October, raising fears that a delay could leave the boys trapped in the cave for months. There is hope that enough water can be pumped out of the cave tunnels for the boys to be able to wade - or be floated - out. But rescuers are also planning for other eventualities. A team are exploring the forested mountain land above the cave complex to see if they can find a chimney down to the cavern sheltering the boys. They have enlisted the help of bird-watchers, who are specialists in finding hidden holes, the AFP news agency reports. This video can not be played Bill Whitehouse from the British Cave Rescue Council explains how the boys and their coach might be rescued Thai Navy Seal divers are also teaching the boys the basics of diving, with a view to guiding them out through flooded waters if necessary. But such a rescue would be fraught with risk, say experts. Many of the boys cannot swim or dive, and there is a high risk they might panic in the dark, murky, narrow waterways. Video shows Thai cave boys in good health The Brits behind the Thai cave boys search How will the boys cope underground? The journey for the group to travel up to the cave entrance would take around five hours, rescue divers say. The Thai military has previously said that if the boys can't dive out, the group may have to wait for up to four months for flooding to recede before they can leave. Food and other supplies are being put in place for that eventuality. Helier Cheung, BBC News, Tham Luang cave Teams of volunteers are each playing their part in the rescue effort Rescue teams are working in extremely difficult conditions. The heat has been sweltering and unrelenting, at over 30C, while much of the site is submerged in squelchy mud that is several inches thick in places and extremely slippery. But the work has continued at an unrelenting pace. Everyone is aware that once the monsoon rains start, rescue efforts will be much more difficult. Meanwhile, hundreds of workers are helping to keep the site in order, with road engineers laying gravel to try and secure the mud, workers for the Thai royal kitchen providing hot food for everyone, and volunteers handing out water bottles and ice lollies to those on site. One local civil servant, who had volunteered to help hand out supplies, said he did not know the boys personally but had decided to help because ""I consider the boys in the caves as my brothers"". Video from Thai Navy special forces on Monday showed the boys looking emaciated but smiling and at times laughing. The arrival of food, foil blankets and the prospect of speaking to their loved ones will have buoyed their spirits. But concern is mounting for both their physical and mental health after 12 days below ground - and it is not clear how they would be helped to survive months more in the cave. This video can not be played Chilean miner sends message to Thai boys The boys and their coach had gone on their bikes up to the caves on Saturday 23 June after football practice. It was one boy's 16th birthday, and the team had taken a picnic. They knew the caves, and some reports suggest they had wanted to explore deeper than on previous occasions. They entered the cave when it was dry but sudden heavy rains quickly flooded the exit and rushed through the narrow passages, clogging them with mud and debris.

"People found guilty of repeatedly uploading ""revenge porn"" will face the toughest punishments when new sentencing guidelines come into force. It is the first time the Sentencing Council for England and Wales has given instructions to courts on dealing with those who humiliate others by uploading private sexual images and videos. The guidelines - published on Thursday - will come into force on 1 October. They also include guidelines for stalking and harassment cases. Revenge porn: What to do if you're a victim One in three revenge porn claims dropped My story: Revenge porn changed my life The offence of disclosing private sexual images without consent - known as ""revenge porn"" - was introduced in 2015 and carries a maximum sentence of two years. In 2016/17, there were 465 prosecutions for the offence in England and Wales. The new guidelines stress that those who repeatedly post explicit material after it has already been taken offline are likely to receive the harshest sentences, after a consultation showed a trend of some offenders doing this. Those who set up fake social media accounts to embarrass their targets will also face stronger punishments, as they show ""significant planning"" has gone into the offence, says the council. This video can not be played Revenge porn victim: 'I felt like I had been raped' The guidelines cover a range of ""intimidatory"" offences, including stalking and harassment. In these cases, tougher sentences are recommended by the council if there are aggravating factors, such as abusing a position of trust, sending grossly violent material to the victim or impacting others, such as children. The guidelines also take into account the crime of controlling or coercive behaviour in an intimate or family relationship - which can see offenders facing up to five years in jail. This was introduced as an offence in December 2015 to tackle repeated domestic abuse, such as controlling victims over social media, spying on them online, stopping them from socialising or stopping their access to money. The guidelines say that behaviour that results in debt or homelessness will be a possible aggravating factor, meaning a stronger sentence. Sentencing Council member Judge Rosa Dean said: ""Our guidelines recognise and reflect the very intimate, personal and intrusive nature of these offences, which can have devastating, often long-term, impacts on victims and their families. ""They will provide courts with comprehensive guidance that will help ensure sentences reflect the seriousness of these offences."" Justice Minister Rory Stewart said: ""These crimes can have a devastating and deeply traumatising effect on victims. ""These new guidelines will ensure that our courts recognise the serious harm caused to victims, and that perpetrators are properly punished.""

"This video can not be played The person could be seen climbing around the base of the Statue of Liberty in New York A woman who climbed up on the Statue of Liberty and sat on the monument's base has been charged with trespassing. Tourists were evacuated from Liberty Island in New York Harbour on Wednesday during a three-hour stand-off involving local and federal authorities. She was identified as Therese Okoumou, a 44-year-old naturalised US citizen from the Democratic Republic of Congo. Ms Okoumou said she was protesting against President Trump's zero-tolerance policy on immigration. She pleaded not guilty to charges of misdemeanour trespassing and disorderly conduct in a Manhattan court on Thursday. She faces up to six months in jail on each charge. A federal magistrate judge released Ms Okoumou without bail after she spent a night behind bars, US media report. Ms Okoumou, donning a T-shirt emblazoned with the words ""White Supremacy is Terrorism"", told reporters outside the courthouse that she scaled the landmark in an impromptu protest over the Trump administration's immigration policy, which has left thousands of migrant children separated from their parents. ""When they go low, we go high and I went as high as I could,"" she said, quoting former First Lady Michelle Obama. ""No children belong in a cage."" US Attorney Geoffrey Berman saidin a statement,externalthat Ms Okoumou ""staged a dangerous stunt that alarmed the public and endangered her own life and the lives of the NYPD officers who responded to the scene. ""While we must and do respect the rights of the people to peaceable protest, that right does not extend to breaking the law in ways that put others at risk. "" The charges allege she endangered herself and officers by refusing to come down during the three-hour standoff. Officers had to climb up 100ft (30m) on the statue in order to reach her. Abolish Ice: A new demand from the left The stories behind these two protest pictures ""At first, she wasn't friendly with us, but we took the time to get a rapport with her so that took a while,"" New York Police Detective Brian Glacken said at a news conference. ""She just kind of mentioned the kids in Texas. I guess the whole debate that's going on about that,"" he said in reference to migrant children who have been taken away from parents held in custody for entering the US illegally. ""In the beginning, she threatened to push us off, push the ladder off, but we stayed with her,"" he continued. Earlier, several people were arrested after holding a protest at the statue. In pictures: Fourth of July celebrations Members of the activist group Rise and Resist had earlier unveiled an ""Abolish Ice"" banner on the statue's pedestal. The sign referred to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the government agency responsible for removing undocumented immigrants from the US. National Park Service police and the New York City Police Department (NYPD) were called to the scene around 15:30 on Wednesday shortly after reports of an individual climbing the monument. It took officials nearly three hours to remove Ms Okoumou. One eyewitness, Eric Kwasi Oppongto, posted a short video of the incident on Twitter, which he said involved an individual with a T-shirt emblazoned with ""Trump care makes me sick"" and ""Rise and Resist"".

It took police three hours to coax Ms Okoumou, a personal trainer, down via a ladder that had been secured to the statue's pedestal. They said prosecutors would decide later whether she would be charged with any crime. Detective Glacken, who works for the New York Police Department's Emergency Service Unit, said it had not been an easy operation. ""It was a really technical rescue just because of the slopes up there - I mean, it wasn't a flat surface. There was nothing for [my colleague] Chris [Williams] and I to grab on to,"" he said. ""At first she wasn't friendly with us but we took our time to basically get a dialogue with her... when we got her and she couldn't go any further I think she realised that her time was up up there."" Rise and Resist initially denied any connection to the climber. The anti-Trump activist group later admitted that Ms Okoumou had helped plan the banner demonstration, but maintained the climbing stunt was her idea. Demonstrations have recently taken place across the country over US authorities' removal of hundreds of child migrants from their parents, who were detained for crossing the border without documentation. Liberty statue 'Refugees Welcome' banner Rise and Resist members say Ms Okoumou helped plan the banner demonstration Wednesday's protests took place on the Fourth of July holiday celebrating US independence. National Park Services officials estimate that approximately 20,000 tourists visit the statue to mark the holiday. On Twitter, a conservative black comedian criticised the protester. ""I never seen a black person climb the statue to protest against black on black crime & that separates families permanently,"" wrote Terrence Williams. But other users praised the demonstration, and that it occurred on US independence day. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Kim Dotcom, born Kim Schmitz, argues he is not responsible for content people shared on his site Internet entrepreneur Kim Dotcom has lost his latest court battle against extradition from New Zealand to the US. New Zealand's Court of Appeal upheld the decision that Mr Dotcom and three others can be extradited to stand trial for copyright infringement and fraud. The charges are related to Mr Dotcom's now defunct file-sharing website Megaupload, which allowed millions of people to download digital content. Mr Dotcom and his co-accused have consistently denied the US charges. It is now up to New Zealand's Justice Minister Andrew Little to decide whether extradition should take place. Mr Dotcom and his co-accused have one final legal option. ""We will seek review with the NZ Supreme Court,"" his lawyer Ira Rothken tweeted. The US claims that Kim Dotcom, Mattias Ortmann, Bram van der Kolk and Finn Batato were involved in a worldwide criminal organisation that lost copyright holders more than an estimated $500m (Â£378m). Kim Dotcom wins right to livestream appeal Kim Dotcom calls for Facebook replacement Kim Dotcom sues New Zealand for damages In an earlier court battle,the High Court agreed with the defence that the accused could not be extradited based on the alleged copyright infringement alone, as ""online communication of copyright protected works to the public is not a criminal offence in New Zealand"". However, the four accused could be extradited on the fraud charges, the judge said in his 2017 ruling, as they are crimes in New Zealand. The latest ruling does not determine whether the defendants are guilty or innocent, merely that they can be sent to the US to stand trial.

People travelling through the capital have been told to avoid London Victoria station if using Southern, Gatwick Express or Thameslink trains. Journeys have been cancelled and delayed by up to 60 minutes after the fault in Streatham, south London. National Rail said disruption will last until at least 07:00 BST on Friday. Passengers are advised to check theSouthern website,externalin the morning to see whether trains are running. They had initially been told to expect normal services to resume by 14:00 on Thursday after the fault was discovered on Wednesday night. Network Rail, the government-owned company responsible for maintaining rail infrastructure, offered a ""sincere apology"" to customers. Rail firms warned trains that were running would be overcrowded The cause of the fault has been traced to the failure of the power supply linked to signalling equipment. A statement from Network Rail said that while a ""temporary fix"" was put in place after engineers worked overnight, significant disruption would continue across affected lines. Victoria is the second busiest station in Great Britain. About 210,000 passengers use the station a day, according to average figures collected for the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) in 2016-17. Gatwick Express services were suspended on Thursday while Southern and Thameslink trains were badly affected.

"Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were being monitored by the Russian authorities in the months before their poisoning,BBC Newsnightunderstands. The government alleged, in a letter to Nato, that the Russian authorities had hacked into Yulia's email account in 2013. I understand briefings given to UK ministers and allied governments suggested it went well beyond this. Sergei and his daughter were poisoned in Salisbury in March. With the police investigation not saying whether it has identified any suspects, four months after the Salisbury incident, the UK government's case against Russia is still based largely on secret intelligence. Both former spy Sergei, and his daughter, had been monitored for some time before March this year - something found out after the poisoning. Yulia's mobile phone has since been closely studied for signs of malware that could have allowed it to be used to track her whereabouts. Questions remain though about whether any of the surveillance of her and her father was detected before the attempt, and should have prompted an increased level of protection. What happened to Sergei and Yulia Skripal? Skripal 'regretted being double agent' What are Novichok agents and what do they do? Nerve agent 'used to try to kill' Sergei Skripal The other main reason why the government blamed Russia rests with the identification of so-called Novichok nerve agent and its specific chemical properties. Experts from the OPCW international watchdog were invited to Salisbury to take samples in late March. They confirmed the UK's identification of the agent in the unclassified section of their report, which emphasised the high purity of the agent used to poison the Skripals. Investigators in hazmat suits walk near where Sergei and Yulia were found I understand that the classified section goes into further detail both about the purity and persistence of the poison. From this, it was deduced that the Novichok was produced by people employing a high level of skill in a very advanced laboratory. The inference was that the nerve agent could only have come from one or two labs in the world. Novichok agents were developed in the last days of the USSR, at the Shikhany facility in southern Russia. I met Sergei on a few occasions last summer and found him to be a private character who did not, even under the circumstances then prevailing, wish to draw attention to himself. He agreed to see me as a writer of history books rather than as a news journalist, since I was researching one on the post-Cold War espionage battle between Russia and the West. Information gained in these interviews was fed into my Newsnight coverage during the early days after the poisoning. I have not felt ready until now to acknowledge explicitly that we had met, but do now that the book is nearing completion. As a man, Sergei is proud of his achievements, both before and after joining his country's intelligence service. He has a deadpan wit and is remarkably stoical given the reverses he's suffered in his life; from his imprisonment following conviction in 2006 on charges of spying for Britain, to the loss of his wife Liudmila to cancer in 2012, and the untimely death of his son Alexander (or Sasha) last summer. Sergei Skripal is pictured here in a court in Moscow in 2006 His domestic routine appeared settled and quiet, with regular visits to the cemetery, favourite shops, and lately the Railway Social Club. Certainly he did not seem to feel himself under great threat. Sergei's Salisbury life might be best described as semi-retired, since he was making occasional trips to lecture or advise friendly intelligence services. But this appeared to be a standard arrangement with defectors, the former KGB man Oleg Gordievsky similarly giving talks to MI6 training courses and foreign agencies. One theory that investigators are probing is that Russia's spies might have regarded Skripal's activities of this kind as evidence he had re-entered the espionage world. Both he and his daughter must now make difficult decisions about their future. Yulia has spoken about her hopes of returning to Russia ""one day"". Her visit in March was only supposed to last a fortnight but now it is unclear what will become of her. Certainly, she is committed for the time being to helping in her father's recovery. For Sergei the equation is different. He was not expecting to go back to Russia, and now he knows he will not be returning to his home in this country either. His house in Salisbury has been bought by the government both as a crime scene and a place still in need of extensive decontamination. Will he make a new life under an assumed identity in the US or a Commonwealth country? That promises to be an extremely difficult decision. Certainly in US witness protection schemes, people are often asked to cut themselves adrift completely from their past. Having seen the peaceful life that he was enjoying in Salisbury last summer, I would imagine that will be very hard for Sergei. From the UK government point of view there is both an acknowledgement that Sergei and Yulia will be free to make their own choices and but also a hope that these will not trigger further political rows with Russia. The saga of Alexander Litvinenko, killed by polonium poisoning in 2006, shows though that those in government who want to move on from the Skripal affair may not have things all their own way. In the Litvinenko case, a police arrest warrant for the suspected poisoner, seven months after the deed, reignited the row. Should the police name suspects for Salisbury in the coming months, either in the poisoning or the surveillance of the Skripals that preceded it, then the issue will return to the world's front pages.

"This video can not be played The person could be seen climbing around the base of the Statue of Liberty in New York A woman who climbed up on the Statue of Liberty and sat on the monument's base has been charged with trespassing. Tourists were evacuated from Liberty Island in New York Harbour on Wednesday during a three-hour stand-off involving local and federal authorities. She was identified as Therese Okoumou, a 44-year-old naturalised US citizen from the Democratic Republic of Congo. Ms Okoumou said she was protesting against President Trump's zero-tolerance policy on immigration. She pleaded not guilty to charges of misdemeanour trespassing and disorderly conduct in a Manhattan court on Thursday. She faces up to six months in jail on each charge. A federal magistrate judge released Ms Okoumou without bail after she spent a night behind bars, US media report. Ms Okoumou, donning a T-shirt emblazoned with the words ""White Supremacy is Terrorism"", told reporters outside the courthouse that she scaled the landmark in an impromptu protest over the Trump administration's immigration policy, which has left thousands of migrant children separated from their parents. ""When they go low, we go high and I went as high as I could,"" she said, quoting former First Lady Michelle Obama. ""No children belong in a cage."" US Attorney Geoffrey Berman saidin a statement,externalthat Ms Okoumou ""staged a dangerous stunt that alarmed the public and endangered her own life and the lives of the NYPD officers who responded to the scene. ""While we must and do respect the rights of the people to peaceable protest, that right does not extend to breaking the law in ways that put others at risk. "" The charges allege she endangered herself and officers by refusing to come down during the three-hour standoff. Officers had to climb up 100ft (30m) on the statue in order to reach her. Abolish Ice: A new demand from the left The stories behind these two protest pictures ""At first, she wasn't friendly with us, but we took the time to get a rapport with her so that took a while,"" New York Police Detective Brian Glacken said at a news conference. ""She just kind of mentioned the kids in Texas. I guess the whole debate that's going on about that,"" he said in reference to migrant children who have been taken away from parents held in custody for entering the US illegally. ""In the beginning, she threatened to push us off, push the ladder off, but we stayed with her,"" he continued. Earlier, several people were arrested after holding a protest at the statue. In pictures: Fourth of July celebrations Members of the activist group Rise and Resist had earlier unveiled an ""Abolish Ice"" banner on the statue's pedestal. The sign referred to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the government agency responsible for removing undocumented immigrants from the US. National Park Service police and the New York City Police Department (NYPD) were called to the scene around 15:30 on Wednesday shortly after reports of an individual climbing the monument. It took officials nearly three hours to remove Ms Okoumou. One eyewitness, Eric Kwasi Oppongto, posted a short video of the incident on Twitter, which he said involved an individual with a T-shirt emblazoned with ""Trump care makes me sick"" and ""Rise and Resist"".

It took police three hours to coax Ms Okoumou, a personal trainer, down via a ladder that had been secured to the statue's pedestal. They said prosecutors would decide later whether she would be charged with any crime. Detective Glacken, who works for the New York Police Department's Emergency Service Unit, said it had not been an easy operation. ""It was a really technical rescue just because of the slopes up there - I mean, it wasn't a flat surface. There was nothing for [my colleague] Chris [Williams] and I to grab on to,"" he said. ""At first she wasn't friendly with us but we took our time to basically get a dialogue with her... when we got her and she couldn't go any further I think she realised that her time was up up there."" Rise and Resist initially denied any connection to the climber. The anti-Trump activist group later admitted that Ms Okoumou had helped plan the banner demonstration, but maintained the climbing stunt was her idea. Demonstrations have recently taken place across the country over US authorities' removal of hundreds of child migrants from their parents, who were detained for crossing the border without documentation. Liberty statue 'Refugees Welcome' banner Rise and Resist members say Ms Okoumou helped plan the banner demonstration Wednesday's protests took place on the Fourth of July holiday celebrating US independence. National Park Services officials estimate that approximately 20,000 tourists visit the statue to mark the holiday. On Twitter, a conservative black comedian criticised the protester. ""I never seen a black person climb the statue to protest against black on black crime & that separates families permanently,"" wrote Terrence Williams. But other users praised the demonstration, and that it occurred on US independence day. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"George Ormond was convicted of 36 offences A former Newcastle United youth team aid has been jailed for 20 years after being convicted of a string of sex abuse offences spanning 25 years. George Ormond, 62, coached a grassroots football club in the 1970s and 1980s before going on to work for United's youth system in the 1990s. Newcastle Crown Court heard he used his ""position of power"" to abuse 18 boys and young men between 1973 and 1998. He wasconvicted of 35 chargesof indecent assault and one of indecency. Ormond, who the court was told has been living at temporary addresses in Gateshead, was cleared of two further charges following a six-week trial. The jury was told Ormond ""manipulated his position"" and held out a ""glittering future"" to young players, but could block their progress if they stood up to him. How a hidden tape helped catch George Ormond He would indecently touch boys while massaging them or treating them for injuries and insist they not wear anything under their shorts, then check they had followed the rule. Judge Edward Bindloss described Ormond as ""wholly preoccupied with sex"" and said he ""used his position as a respected football coach to target boys and young men in his care"". He said: ""Some victims you do not even remember - what was for you momentary sexual gratification was for your victims a lifetime of difficulty."" George Ormond was also jailed in 2002 for sex offences Victims' statements described their shame and embarrassment, and in some cases deep regret that they had not spoken out earlier. One said his ambition had been to become a footballer but ""that dream turned into a living nightmare"". Judge Bindloss said: ""No-one observing this trial could have failed to have been moved by the complainants and other witnesses over the six weeks of evidence. ""[They were] largely men in their 50s, largely from working class and sporting backgrounds, speaking with calm and quiet dignity about how they failed to understand what was happening to them. ""And because of the times they lived in, and due to their circumstances, they were unable to speak about it."" Former Newcastle United player Derek Bell was abused by George Ormond but was ""too scared"" to speak out at the time In 2002 Ormond was jailed for six years after being found guilty of abusing seven boys under 16 between 1975 and 1999. Defending Ormond, Rebecca Trowler QC, said he had not been in trouble since his release from prison in 2006. He had been living off his savings, and his only close relationship now was with his mother, who was in her 80s.

"Sir Martin Sorrell WPP has threatened to take away share awards worth millions from its former chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell over his rival bid for digital production company MediaMonks. The share awards are potentially worth about Â£20m,Sky News reported,external. Dutch firm Mediamonks is facing takeover bids from both WPP and Sir Martin's new S4 Capital venture. A source close to Sir Martin told the BBC: ""I would say WPP are trying to muddy the waters, stir things up"". Speaking on condition of anonymity, the source said that WPP's lawyers had written to Sir Martin claiming that was likely to be in breach of his confidentiality obligations. He added: ""If WPP is going to start some sort of procedural process, Sir Martin will fight it. But this guy is worth Â£400m to Â£500m. He is not going to allow Â£20m to stand in the way what he is trying to do."" He described relations between Sir Martin and the advertising company he founded, WPP, as ""obviously not very good."" He added: ""He is not out to damage WPP. He is still one of the largest, if not the largest private shareholder in WPP, so why would he want to do that?"" Sir Martin bought WPP in 1985 and turned it into the world's biggest advertising and media company with revenues of Â£15bn. However, he stepped down as chief executive in April after the board said it was investigating claims of misconduct. There were allegations relating to the use of company funds to pay for a prostitute, which Sir Martin has denied. WPP later said its board had appointed independent counsel to conduct the investigation. Within weeks of leaving WPP, Sir Martin had bought a shell company, and renamed it S4 Capital. He described it as ""a company that aims to build a multinational communication services business focused on growth.""

"Theresa May has said she hopes her cabinet will be able to ""discuss and decide on a substantive way forward"" on Brexit at their crucial Friday awayday. The UK prime minister told Germany's Angela Merkel she hoped this would lead to an increase in the ""pace and intensity"" of UK-EU negotiations. As they met in Berlin, Mrs Merkel said Brexit talks were at a ""crucial phase"". She said that a political framework for future relations needed to be clear by October. Jaguar boss: Brexit threatens investment Theresa May's new Brexit trade plan explained What kind of Brexit do voters want? Brexit: All you need to know Downing Street said Theresa May and Angela Merkel had ""constructive"" talks about Brexit in Berlin and the cabinet's discussions at Chequers would decide a ""substantial way forward which would enable the pace and intensity of negotiations to increase"". Meanwhile Brexiteer ministers including Boris Johnson, David Davis, Michael Gove, Liam Fox and Esther McVey were holding talks on Thursday evening, ahead of the meeting on Friday.

The two leaders' meeting came as Downing Street set out some of the detail of its new proposal for how trade between the UK and the EU could be handled after Brexit. There are differing views within the cabinet about how closely the UK should stick to EU rules after Brexit, and what compromises should be made to achieve ""as frictionless as possible"" trade. After months of tension and disagreement, the prime minster is gathering the entire cabinet at her country retreat, Chequers, with the aim of agreeing a UK proposal on how future relations with the EU will work. That would then be the subject of negotiations with the EU - which might have different ideas. The UK is due to leave the European Union at 23:00 GMT on 29 March 2019. But to allow time for parliaments in the UK and the EU to approve whatever deal is agreed, the aim is for the framework for future relations to be agreed this autumn. According to No 10, the new plan would allow the UK the freedom to set its own tariffs on goods arriving into the country. Technology would be used to determine where the goods will ultimately end up - and therefore whether UK or EU tariffs should be paid. Downing Street says it is confident the arrangement would be partly in place by the end of the proposed transition period in December 2020 - with the system being fully operational by the next general election, which is due in 2022. On regulations, it is understood that the UK would closely mirror the EU's rules - but Parliament would be able to decide where to deviate. However, the arrangement has not been explained in full - and it is not clear whether the cabinet will back the plan, or whether the EU would agree. A source close to Brexit Secretary David Davis refused to comment on aDaily Telegraph report,externalthat he had already told Mrs May the plan was unworkable. Mr Davis and Mrs May were ""working closely on what will be presented on Friday"", the source said. However Mr Davis is expected to ""forcefully"" express his doubts and reservations about the compromise plan, including the view that it could be a mistake to set out too much of the UK's negotiating position at this stage Please upgrade your browser Among the issues that need to be resolved is the need to avoid new border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland when the UK is outside the customs union. Eurosceptic MPs have warned Mrs May against tying the UK to the EU after it leaves, saying this will prevent it from striking its own trade deals with other countries. Meanwhile 46 other Conservative MPs have written to Mrs May urging her to listen to the voice of business and target a deal which enables ""frictionless trade to continue"". After Friday's meeting, the government is expected to publish a White Paper setting out its plans in detail. The European Union asked a series of questions about the UK's previous customs proposals and they are still relevant. Will it be temporary? Does it solve the Irish border issue fully or partly? Does it respect the integrity of EU customs policy? How is it supervised? How will the UK system evolve as the EU's does? Will the EU need to change its trade policy? But customs is only a fraction of the relationship between the UK and the EU and so the British idea of aligning to some European regulations is a much bigger deal. And the priority in Brussels is to find a solution to the Northern Irish border. ""If there isn't a deal on that then things could turn nasty quite quickly,"" a diplomat told me. The EU is waiting to see the full White Paper. Officials from the 27 remaining countries are primed to meet soon after it is published and ministers will give their reaction at a meeting on 20 July but civil servants in Brussels expect to be combing through it until the end of the month at least.
