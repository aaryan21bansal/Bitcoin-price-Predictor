"This video can not be played Former clerk Jenny McCullough alleges she was bullied by MP Keith Vaz Labour MP Keith Vaz bullied clerks who sought to uphold the rules and process of the Commons,Newsnighthas learned. One clerk claims Mr Vaz, who in 2016 quit as the head of a select committee after a tabloid reported he had hired prostitutes, told her she was bad at her job because she was ""not a mother"". Accounts of his behaviour were recorded in the clerk's appraisals but no one in the Commons intervened to protect her. Mr Vaz denies breaching any of the rules of the House and denies bullying. Jenny McCullough served as a clerk in the House of Commons from 2002 to 2011. She has claimed Mr Vaz repeatedly bullied and undermined her position in the House while he was chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee. Newsnight's Chris Cook: Analysis on Westminster bullying Other clerks have told Newsnight that this was part of a pattern of behaviour. They said that the Leicester East MP was prone to bullying clerks, particularly those who tried to stand up for the standards of the House. Ms McCullough alleges that Mr Vaz said she was a poor clerk because she was ""not a mother"". He also made jokes about whether Ms McCullough was a security threat, on account of her Northern Irish background and accent. Mr Vaz was chairman of the home affairs committee from 2007 until his resignation in 2016 - the Sunday Mirror reportedhe was caught hiring prostitutes and showing willing to pay for drugs.An inquiry into that is ongoing. Keith Vaz, MP for Leicester East Ms McCullough's relationship with Mr Vaz deteriorated rapidly on an official committee trip to Russia and Ukraine in 2008, when Ms McCullough raised concerns with Mr Vaz about his compliance with the rules and protocols of the House. The rules and standards around these trips demand, for example, that MPs arrange an itinerary before leaving that can be signed off. They also demand that hospitality is either arranged by the committee as part of the programme or appropriately declared. Newsnight has seen emails from Ms McCullough to her manager relating her concerns. For example, she was worried about who was paying for a dinner on the trip. ""The chairman refused to tell me who we would be meeting or what the arrangements were beyond that we would be dining with Ivan, a friend of his who was (or used to be, I couldn't find out) a 'senator',"" she wrote. But when she arrived, she discovered that it was what she called a ""large"" and ""opulent"" dinner, thrown in the MPs' honour.  She did not know who the guests at the dinner were. She emailed her manager saying: ""We didn't pay - I didn't know who did."" Ms McCullough says that when she stood up to Mr Vaz about her concerns he launched into a ""tirade"" against her in a hotel lobby. ""He then demanded to know what age I was. He told me that I didn't know how the House worked and that I didn't respect the authority of members - that I had an attitude problem."" She said this was when Mr Vaz told her she was bad at her job because she was not a mother. When they returned, Ms McCullough's colleagues recall Mr Vaz's criticism of Ms McCullough being unrelenting and personal. Ms McCullough told Newsnight that she was eventually asked to stop coming to team meetings, because his reaction to her presence was too disruptive, and prevented any work from being done by the team. She was eventually moved to another job elsewhere in the House. But, not feeling protected at work, later chose to leave. Her problems with Mr Vaz were known to the House of Commons management. Her annual appraisal for the year 2008 stated that ""Jenny had excellent relations with Home Office officials and other witnesses, and with all the committee apart from the chairman, who chose to try to bully her. Jenny understandably and properly stood her ground, which the chairman resented."" A representative for Mr Vaz told Newsnight that he denied any bullying, and said: ""No complaint or allegation of this nature has ever been brought to his attention. ""Our client had considered that he and Ms McCullough had previously had a good working relationship, and had always considered her to be very effective as a clerk."" He particularly denied making light of Ms McCullough's origins or motherhood. After Ms McCullough left the House, she complained about the way that she had been treated. She told Newsnight: ""I didn't feel able to complain about Keith Vaz because I was afraid of him. When I was on the home affairs committee I saw that he had friends in the police and friends in the law. ""He said that one of the principal clerks was a friend and by the time I was leaving the house he had a friend in the Speaker. I thought it could only end badly for me."" The House of Commons told Newsnight: ""We are aware that in the past the House has not had a robust process in place to deal with instances of bullying and harassment. ""We are confident that our new Independent Complaints and Grievance Policy will mean that allegations can be dealt with effectively and sensitively."" Keith Vaz accused of bullying clerks.

"This video can not be played Tommy Robinson: 'All the mainstream media do is lie' Former English Defence League (EDL) leader Tommy Robinson has been released on bail after winning an appeal against a contempt of court finding. The 35-year-old admitted the charge and was jailed in May for filming outside Leeds Crown Court during a trial. At the Court of Appeal, Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett ruled the case be reheard after identifying technical and other failings. Robinson's solicitors said everyone has the ""right to a fair hearing"". The far-right activist, from Luton, was not present for the ruling in London and was released from his 13-month sentence being served at Onley Prison, near Rugby just before 15:30 BST. Speaking to reporters, Robinson said: ""All the British media do is lie. I have a lot to say but nothing to you. ""I want to thank the British public for all their support."" Tommy Robinson supporters and protesters gathered outside The Royal Courts of Justice In his written judgement, Lord Burnett said: ""We are satisfied that the finding of contempt made in Leeds following a fundamentally flawed process, in what we recognise were difficult and unusual circumstances, cannot stand. ""We will direct that the matter be reheard before a different judge."" Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley Lennon, will attend the Old Bailey for the hearing, conducted by the Recorder of London, ""as soon as reasonably possible"". This morning, the Lord Chief Justice's ruling in Robinson's appeal underlined that the rule of law - the rules that apply to us all - must be applied fairly in all circumstances. And that's why the Court of Appeal ruled that Robinson's second conviction in a year for contempt of court was flawed. In essence, the five hours from arrest to sentence at Leeds Crown Court was rushed. Robinson wasn't told what specific parts of his activity at the court had been potentially prejudicial to a jury - meaning nobody to this day knows exactly what he did wrong. Further, he immediately removed the offending video from Facebook on the court's order and the judge should have then adjourned the matter to give him longer to prepare a defence. Tommy Robinson is still convicted of contempt in relation to his behaviour at Canterbury last year where he received his three month sentence for potentially derailing a fair trial. Today, the Court of Appeal said that very same right to a fair hearing means Robinson should have a full opportunity to put his case without rushing to judge. The case that brought Robinson to Leeds related to grooming and the second of three trials involving 28 men. The third trial is due to start in September. Footage, filmed by Robinson on a mobile phone and broadcast on social media, saw him discussing the criminal trial that was subject to reporting restrictions. The video, lasting about an hour-and-a-half, was watched 250,000 times within hours of being posted as a Facebook Live. Tommy Robinson founded the English Defence League in 2009 but quit the group in 2013 A statement from Robinson's solicitors said: ""The rule of law and right to a fair hearing are fundamental to every individual and this ruling is an example of the safeguards of our system. ""What makes the British system so unique is the ability to set aside personal feelings and deal with the law and each case on its merits."" More stories from Yorkshire Robinson had challenged two contempt of court findings but Lord Burnett said a suspended sentence he was given relating to a trial in Canterbury in May 2017 should stand. He was given 10 months for contempt of court in Leeds and a further three months for breaching the suspended sentence handed to him in Canterbury. Contempt of court laws are designed to protect the rule of law, ensure fair trials - and avoid trial by media. Contempt can be committed by a broad range of people and organisations including the press, jurors, and social media users. The maximum sentence for contempt of court is two years' imprisonment, but it can also be punished with a fine. The law on contempt is set out in case law and the 1981 Contempt of Court Act. Key areas that amount to contempt include: Publishing anything that creates a substantial risk of seriously prejudicing ""active"" criminal proceedings Bringing into a court building a device for recording sound Taking photographs or film in a court building is capable of being a contempt of court. Breaching a court order or undertakings given to the court can also amount to contempt. Robinson attended Canterbury Crown Court during a rape trial of four men and filmed on the steps of the court and inside the building while the jury was considering its verdicts. At an earlier hearing, Robinson's QC argued that procedural ""deficiencies"" had caused ""prejudice"" in Leeds. Lord Burnett said the judge should not have commenced contempt proceedings the same day he was arrested. He explained ""no particulars of the contempt were formulated or put to the appellant"", and there was ""a muddle over the nature of the contempt being considered"". Tommy Robinson had been serving a 13-month sentence at Onley Prison, near Rugby Robinson's bail conditions order that he does not ""approach within 400m (0.2 miles) of Leeds Crown Court"". His lawyers had argued that a rehearing was not necessary due to the length of time he served in prison. But the Court of Appeal said the ""alleged contempt was serious"" and the sentence might be longer than that already served. Rival groups of Robinson supporters and ""Stand Up To Racism"" protesters had gathered outside the Royal Courts of Justice and swapped chants. Both groups of about 30 people were outnumbered by watching police. BBC White House reporter, Tara McKelvey, said his case has generated ""a united front among nationalists"" from across the Atlantic, with Robinson gaining support from the likes of Steve Bannon and Donald Trump Junior. Born in 1982, Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, describes himself as ""a working-class man from Luton"". Aged 20, he joined the far-right British National Party but soon left saying ""it was not for me"" In 2009 he set up the English Defence League (EDL) - an organisation set up to counter what its members saw as the threat of Islamist extremism The EDL organised street marches and demonstrations which often clashed with anti-racism campaigners He married in 2011 and is the father of three children He left the EDL in 2013 expressing concern that he no longer felt he could keep extremist elements within the organisation at bay In 2015, he joined demonstrations with the German anti-immigration group Pegida, Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West, and announced the founding of the British chapter In 2017, he started contributing to Canadian-based far-right political commentary site The Rebel Media 'All the mainstream media do is lie' Video, 00:00:34'All the mainstream media do is lie' Court of Appeal 'Bradford has borne the brunt of austerity policies - with devastating consequences' Council to sell Lord Mayorâs number plate with hope of raising more than Â£500,000 'Robbie Williams' to play at Calderdale indie cinema's showing of new biopic One of Halifax's best-loved restaurants announces new premises and bar Leeds man and teenager to appear in court charged with violent disorder and arson following Harehills disorder Director of Yorkshire firms given nine-year ban for âscheme designed to undermine the insolvency systemâ Hollywood Hills in flames amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

"In 2012, Ms Brookes brought a successful civil action against Facebook over previous online abusers A ""cowardly predator"" who cyber-stalked a disabled campaigner against online abuse has been jailed. Nicky Wright, 39, of Lewisham, south London, was convicted of stalking Nicola Brookes from Brighton. Despite never meeting Ms Brookes, Wright trolled her, wrote defamatory blogs and created disturbing images of her, Brighton Magistrates' Court heard. Wright handed himself in after he was convicted in his absence and was sentenced on Wednesday. Magistrates jailed him for six months and issued a restraining order to protect Ms Brookes. District Judge Amanda Kelly described his stalking as ""about as serious as it can get"". She described him as a ""cowardly predator"" who hid behind the anonymity of the internet to wage a ""sinister and deeply personal campaign"". And she said: ""I find you deliberately chose not to come to court because you lacked the courage to face your victim in the flesh."" Ms Brookes's victim impact statement revealed how Wright used 28 Twitter and 25 Facebook accounts as well as blogs, online radio and video channels to target her from June 2016 to September last year. She said he doctored comments she made, made sexually suggestive comments and posted hate mail. Ms Brooks said the ordeal shattered her faith in human nature, caused her Crohn's disease to flare up and left her feeling like a ""sitting duck"". Nicky Wright used the social media alias ""Prickly Finger"" During the hearing, Wright, who had used the social media alias ""Prickly Finger"", complained the press were in court and he did not want ""certain information going everywhere online"", before pleading guilty to failing to attend the trial. He said he missed the trial because he overslept, sat with his fingers in his ears during the sentencing and stuck two fingers up as he was led to the cells. Facebook to release ID of trolls Web abuse woman tackles 'trolls' After the hearing, Ms Brookes called for tougher punishments for stalkers and said she did not believe his sentence would stop him targeting her or someone else when he leaves jail. She called on social media sites to do more to stop trolls and also criticised how police handled the case. ""It should not have taken three years and 12 different officers for the case to come to court,"" she said. ""The onus is on the victim to prove the crime and gather evidence. I was sending officers around 150 screenshots a day of his persistent behaviour.""

"A conservationist counted eight different species and 40 butterflies in the field the day before it was destroyed A meadow being watched for Sir David Attenborough's Big Butterfly Count has been destroyed by a council employee who ""misunderstood"" his job. East Devon District Council instructed the employee to cut a pathway through the field - but he instead razed the entire nine acres of wildflower. The council apologised for the worker flattening the field at The Knowle, in Sidmouth, Devon. Conservationist Ed Dolphin said the wildlife in the meadow was ""precious"". More Devon stories Attenborough backs biggest butterfly count Brilliant butterflies in your back garden He said: ""All the butterflies had gone. There were wild flowers including orchids growing there. ""Hopefully they'll come back next year; I'm just hoping there are already eggs and caterpillars there with enough for them to eat."" The field was being used as part of the Big Butterfly Count, a national survey backed by Sir David in which the public is being asked to spot and record 17 species of butterfly. Mr Dolphin had spotted eight different species and counted 40 butterflies flying around when he carried out a count in the field the day before it was destroyed. The council has said that areas of wild flower planting remain uncut Mr Dolphin said he watched the council employee mowing the field last year. ""I was actually in there when he was mowing the area, but at the time he was doing the right section,"" he said. ""I wish now I'd stopped and asked him. The whole area is destroyed."" A spokesperson for East Devon District Council, said: ""We regret that one of our operatives misunderstood the instructions he was given and cut the arena area by mistake, instead of just cutting some pathways and a flat area to help those using the park for walking through. ""We agree this shouldn't have happened and will be taking measures to ensure that this doesn't happen again next year.""

"This video can not be played Harry Kane fiver: Merthyr shop owner and locals react A Â£5 note engraved with the image of England striker Harry Kane has gone into circulation in Merthyr Tydfil. Micro-engraver Graham Short made six of the notes after Kane won the Golden Boot for scoring the most goals during the 2018 World Cup. He used the note at a shop in Cefn Coed last Wednesday. The artist previously etchedJane Austen on to new Â£5 notes when they were first circulated and those have been valued at Â£50,000. Mr Short, from Birmingham, chose Merthyr Tydfil because his father was born in nearby Dowlais. This video can not be played Graham Short's portrait of the Queen on a pinhead fetched Â£100,000 The other notes were spent in Meriden in the West Midlands, and the Elephant House in Edinburgh - where JK Rowling used to write. A fourth note will be spent in Northern Ireland. Harry Kane's portrait put on Â£5 notes 'Â£50,000' fiver sent in Christmas card What happened to the fivers 'worth Â£50,000'? He gifted the other two notes to the Football Association and to Tottenham Hotspur forward Kane himself. Harry Kane won the Golden Boot for scoring the most goals during the 2018 World Cup Mr Short uses very fine needles to scratch the images into clear sections of the notes. They remain legal tender, so it is up to sharp-eyed customers or shopkeepers to see if they have one. Explaining his decision to spend the money in Merthyr, Mr Short said: ""I wanted someone to find it who perhaps needed the money, and they can perhaps sell it for whatever - holidays or Christmas. ""I like the magical feeling of it and just want people to be as excited as I am. ""It's just a bit of fun, but it also puts my art beyond the walls of a gallery. My art sells for a lot of money now and it's really out of reach for most people. ""But if they find this and sell it and make a lot of money, I'll be really pleased with that."" It is not the first time Mr Short's sterling work has been valued highly, with a portrait of the Queen being sold for Â£100,000 in 2016. The valuation comes from the Tony Huggins-Haig Gallery, which insures his etchings at Â£50,000 each. Money specialist website Change Checker says the phenomenon of people spending big money on banknotes depends on the notes having ""an interesting story behind them"". It said: ""AA01 banknotes were part of the first batch of banknotes printed or serial number AK47 have been particularly popular thanks to the machine gun connotations. ""It really is just personal preference and what someone is willing to pay to have a certain banknote in their collection."" Manpreet Kaur, who owns the off licence where the Harry Kane Â£5 note was spent - but failed to spot it for herself - said: ""You don't think. Someone will give you a note and then another customer comes in and needs a five pounds note. ""That's why I missed it.""

"Mr Trump said Mr Manafort was being treated worse than the Prohibition-era Chicago mobster Al Capone US President Donald Trump has ramped up his attacks on the Russia investigation by demanding it end ""right now"". In a series of tweets, he said Attorney General Jeff Sessions must halt the inquiry into alleged election meddling. Mr Trump also labelled special counsel Robert Mueller, who leads the probe, ""totally conflicted"". His remarks are notable because he himself has previously acknowledged the US Department of Justice should be free from political interference. According to US media, some Trump aides believe that Mr Mueller will report soon on the findings of his 14-month investigation as they relate to the president. Allow Twitter content?

In a fusillade of tweets on Wednesday, the Republican president also lashed out at the case against his former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, whose trial is entering its second day. Mr Manafort's trial is the first arising from Mr Mueller's investigation. Mr Trump also said Mr Manafort was being treated worse than the Prohibition-era Chicago mobster Al Capone.

White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders later said at a press briefing that the tweet is ""not an order"". She described it as Mr Trump's ""opinion"", adding: ""I think he's been crystal clear about how he feels about the investigation from the beginning."" Analysis by Jon Sopel, BBC North America Editor There is nothing new about the president's frustration, agitation and anger at the special counsel investigation. But this is the first time in overt terms that he has called on the attorney general to fire Robert Mueller. The timing is interesting too - his former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, has just gone on trial, accused of failing to declare the extent of his business connections with pro-Moscow Ukrainian politicians. It also comes as the Mueller inquiry starts moving closer to the Trump family circle - in particular, the behaviour of his son, Donald Jr and son-in-law Jared Kushner over a meeting at Trump Tower during the campaign with a Russian lawyer who had close links to the Kremlin. Technically the Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, can't fire Mueller as he has recused himself from the Russia investigation. Ironically, one of the areas the Mueller investigation is looking at is whether the president has used Twitter to try to pressurise or intimidate his attorney general. The president's tweet today might be seen as relevant. Mr Manafort, 69, led Mr Trump's campaign for three months until August 2016. He is charged with tax evasion and money-laundering stemming from his political consultancy work in Ukraine. Trump ex-campaign chief 'lied', court told A courtroom sketch shows Mr Manafort seated during the opening day of his trial on Tuesday But Mr Manafort is not accused of aiding Russia's alleged attempts to sway the 2016 presidential election Mr Trump's way, a focus of the Mueller investigation. The special counsel is also scrutinising whether there were any attempts by the president to obstruct justice. The president wields significant constitutional authority over the Department of Justice since it belongs to the executive branch of US government. But it has been a US civic tenet ever since the Nixon-era Watergate scandal that the agency should be free from political interference. Mr Trump has previously acknowledged it is ""the saddest thing"" that he is not supposed to meddle with the law agency. Utah's Republican Senator Orrin Hatch told journalists that many ""wish the Mueller investigation would go away,"" but added, ""that's not going to happen"". The third highest-ranking Senate Republican, John Thune of South Dakota, told reporters on Capitol Hill: ""Most of us up here believe the process needs to play out, and it will."" Democratic congressman Adam Schiff called the president's words ""an attempt to obstruct justice hiding in plain sight"". On Wednesday, District Judge TS Ellis took issue with the term ""oligarch"" - which prosecutors used to describe the Ukrainian politicians for whom Mr Manafort worked - calling the word ""pejorative"". ""We're not going to have a case tried that he associated with despicable people and, therefore, he's despicable,"" the judge said. ""That's not the American way."" On Tuesday, prosecutors called as their first witness Democratic strategist Tad Devine, who worked for presidential candidate Bernie Sanders during the 2016 election. Mr Devine described how in 2010 they both assisted now-deposed Ukrainian leader Viktor Yanukovych during his presidential campaign. Mr Manafort ""worked harder than anybody"" during the campaign, he said. The court also heard on Wednesday from an FBI agent who led the raid on Mr Manafort's Virginia home, an incident that has been heavily criticised by Mr Trump. Matthew Mikuska testified that he knocked three times on the door before using a key to open it.

"Caucher Birkar was born in Iran but now works at the University of Cambridge A Cambridge professor who won one of the most prestigious prizes in mathematics, the Fields Medal, has had his award stolen in Brazil. Professor Caucher Birkar, a Kurd, came to the UK as a refugee from Iran. He was one of four people honoured for their contributions to mathematicsand had said that he ""couldn't imagine that this would come true"". But just minutes later, he discovered that the 14-carat gold medal had gone missing. According to Brazil's TV Globo, he left it along with his wallet and phone in a briefcase on a table at the convention centre where the event was taking place. He alerted security staff when he noticed the case was missing and they later found the case, but both his medal and his wallet were no longer there. Caucher Birkar was born on a farm in Kurdistan Province, near the Iran-Iraq border, and was raised during the eight-year war between the two neighbouring countries that broke out in 1980. He told Quanta magazine,externalthat while he was growing up, his maths club in Tehran had pictures of Fields Medal winners lining the walls. ""I looked at them and said to myself, 'will I ever meet one of these people?' At that time in Iran, I couldn't even know that I'd be able to go to the West,"" he said. While studying for his undergraduate degree at the University of Tehran, he travelled to the UK and sought political asylum there. He established a reputation within academia with his work on birational geometry and has previously won the prestigious Leverhulme Prize. The Fields Medals are awarded every four years to the most promising mathematicians under the age of 40. Each winner receives a C$15,000 ($11,500; Â£8,800) cash prize.

"Scores of residents gathered outside Northamptonshire County Council headquarters to protest over proposed cuts Angry residents gathered outside an emergency meeting of a cash-strapped local authority earlier to protest about proposed cuts to services. Northamptonshire County Council, which must save Â£70m by March, met to discuss how to tackle the funding crisis. Council leader Matthew Golby said councillors had to examine ""what we can realistically provide"" for residents. The Conservative-led council has been forced toimpose spending controlstwice in six months. It has vowed to protect children and vulnerable adults but a financial expert warned essential services may be ""cut to the very bone"". One public speaker attending the meeting at County Hall on Wednesday evening, described the situation as a ""shambles"" and demanded Mr Golby resigned. Protesters also stood for a minute's silence to ""mourn"" likely cuts to services. Mr Golby acknowledged the council faced ""a massive task"" but said bosses would ""do everything within our powers"" to get the authority ""back on track"". The authority has called an emergency meeting to discuss how to make Â£70m of savings by March 2019 Labour councillor John McGee said the proposals would leave the authority ""on the brink of providing illegal services to the vulnerable people of Northamptonshire"". Meanwhile, Tory councillor Rob Gough called on his colleagues to ""make sure we make the cuts that need to be made"". He said: ""Throwing money at the problem like we have in the past is not going to solve the issue. ""We cannot balance the books by fleecing the taxpayer. Why should they suffer for the folly of the state?"" Labour councillor Mick Scrimshaw said the authority had been placed ""at the vanguard of the austerity project"", claiming funding cuts were ""an excuse by some to reduce the powers and size of local government"". ""There's not a cat in hell's chance that this year's budget will actually balance,"" he added. ""We need to send a clear and strong message to the government - we cannot manage because of stupid local decisions."" Labour's Winston Strachan described the council's situation as ""an absolute disaster"". He said: ""I have been a councillor since 2001 and for the first time yesterday, I had to say to someone who asked for help: 'I am sorry, we have no money'."" Of the 57 county councillors, only 43 attended the meeting that has now ended. Many of the protesters displayed banners outside simply saying ""No more cuts"", while others urged the government to ""bail out"" the council. Teacher Pat Markey said: ""The cuts we have faced over the last few years and the cuts that are about to happen are criminal."" Louise Stubbs chairs a campaign group that is fighting to save Brackley library in the county. She said: ""Our library service is the most efficient in the entire country... that is why we have had to fight so hard to try and save them."" Northamptonshire County Council has been forced to sell its Â£53m HQ, which it moved in to in October Mr Golby has proposed services be reduced to a ""core offer"" and said the authority had to decide what it could ""realistically provide"". He said the authority would ""safeguard all children and young people"" while ensuring a ""robust safeguarding system to protect vulnerable adults"". The ""core offer"" would also see the authority carry out ""sufficient maintenance"" of public highways and plan for school places, he added. A council source told the BBC the scale of possible cuts was ""huge... completely unprecedented"". Could it happen elsewhere? Council 'ignored 2015 crisis warning' County council 'misappropriated' Â£8m A section 114 notice issued last week, severely curtailing spending at the council, followsthe issuing of the same notice in February. Prior to this, there had been only two issued in the UK since 1988. Brian Roberts,one of two government-appointed commissionersoverseeing the council, said the authority's finances were in a ""truly perilous state"". Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy chief executive Rob Whiteman warned services could be ""cut to the bone"". The council has said a ""robust"" system would be retained to safeguard children and vulnerable adults 'Perilous' council to hold crisis talks Troubled council bans spending again County Hall sale can go ahead Council rethink over County Hall sale Council to sell its historic County Hall Safety fears sparked fire service move Council services boss gets Â£66k pay-off Cash-strapped council sells off old sites Commissioners take over troubled council Spend ban council savings 'insufficient' Cash-strapped council to sell Â£53m HQ Northamptonshire County Council I went to see the A6's 'worst' pothole and watched repair disintegrate before my eyes Mayor's indoor curling night to raise funds for Dementia UK, RBL and Rushden Sea Cadets Local business at Rushden Lakes calls it a dayÂ after increase to rent forces departure from shopping centre East Midlands Ambulance Service stands down critical incident but remains on highest action plan level Hollywood Hills in flames amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

"Caucher Birkar was born in Iran but now works at the University of Cambridge One of the most prestigious prizes in mathematics, the Fields Medal, has been handed out at a ceremony in Brazil. Caucher Birkar, Alessio Figalli and Peter Scholze, and Akshay Venkatesh are all honoured for major contributions to their respective areas in mathematics. Professor Birkar, a Kurd, came to the UK as a while studying in Tehran and applied for asylum. The University of Cambridge mathematician said he ""couldn't imagine that this would come true"". However, it emerged that the 14-carat gold medal given to Dr Birkar at the ceremony in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, had been stolen just minutes later.

The Fields Medals are awarded every four years to the most promising mathematicians under the age of 40. Each winner receives a C$15,000 ($11,500; Â£8,800) cash prize. Alessio Figalli, 34, was born in Rome but works at ETH Zurich, a science and technology university in Switzerland. He is an expert on calculus of variations and partial differential equations. ""This prize gives me so much joy,"" Professor Figallitold the Italian news agency Ansa,external. ""It is such a big thing that I'm struggling to believe that I have received it. ""It is a great stimulus for the future,"" he added. ""It will motivate me to work in my research fields to try to produce studies of a very high level"". The youngest of the four, Peter Scholze, who is 30, works at the University of Bonn. His research focuses on the intersection between number theory and geometry. He was widely tipped to win the prize ahead of the announcement. Prof Hairer, who was awarded the Fields Medal in 2014, says things can change ""instantly"" for winners The Australian Professor Venkatesh, 36, studies number theory and representation theory. Professor Martin Hairer, from Imperial College London, who was awarded the Fields Medal in 2014, said the award could be transformative for the winners. He told BBC News: ""As you can imagine, their status will instantly change from 'highly respected researcher in the area of XXX' to 'celebrity in the mathematics community'. In the short term, this will give them a level of exposure that mathematicians are typically not used to and they'll have to figure out how to deal with that. ""At a less ephemeral level, it makes them figureheads within mathematics for their area of research, so they will spend much more time communicating to a broader audience than what they are probably used to."" There have been 56 winners, thoughone of them - the Russian Grigori Perelman - declined the award in 2006,external. Dr Perelman was famously reclusive and shunned attention in favour of working on his favoured fields. Cedric Villani made a move into politics after winning the medal There has been onlyone woman winner - the Iranian Maryam Mirzakhani. A professor at Stanford University in the US,she died in 2017. CÃ©dric Villani made a move into politics after winning the prize in 2010. Last year, he became a National Assembly member in his native France for Emmanuel Macron's En Marche party. Martin Hairer added: ""At the end of the day, while some of the laureates have capitalised on their medal to initiate a change of career (CÃ©dric Villani comes to mind), most of them continue to produce outstanding research in their chosen area and, to a large extent, lead the same kind of life as any other highly successful mathematician."" At least two, and preferably four people, are always honoured in the award ceremony. The prize was inaugurated in 1932 at the request of Canadian mathematician John Charles Fields, who ran the 1924 Mathematics Congress in Toronto.

"Siddique Kamara was known by his rap name Incognito A rapper in London's drill music scene, who was cleared of murder earlier this year, has been stabbed to death. Three men were found with stab wounds on Warham Street, Camberwell, at 19:20 BST on Wednesday. Victim Siddique Kamara, also known as Incognito and SK, was cleared at the Old Bailey in January ofmurdering Abdirahman Mohamed. Two men are in custody on suspicion of murder. The Met said ""one line of inquiry is this being gang-related"". Mr Kamara, 23, was friends with fellow rapperRhyhiem Ainsworth Barton, who was found with fatal gunshot wounds in Warham Street in May. Friends have paid tribute to the performer, who was part of the Moscow17 group. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Met said he was pronounced dead at the scene. The two men in custody, aged 18 and 19, were arrested nearby, officers added. The two other wounded men, aged 16 and 31, were airlifted to hospital, where they remain. Drill is a dark form of rap music often featuring violent lyrics. In an interview earlier this year, Mr Kamara spoke about its effect on crime in London. ""You see with the crime that's happening right now, music does influence it. You've got to put your hands up and say drill music does influence it,"" he said. ""But knife crime and gun crime has been going on way before drill music, so if you want to talk about 10 years, 20 years, people were still getting cheffed up [attacked with knives]."" Abdirahman Mohamed was attacked in Peckham in June 2017 - Mr Kamara was cleared of his murder in January Incognito's music videos have been watched hundreds of thousands of times on YouTube. Some feature references to other groups in the capital, including long-running rivals Zone 2 from Peckham. In one track, Moscow17 tell Zone 2 to ""check the scoreboard"", while another asks ""how you gonna make it even?"". Mr Kamara was accused and cleared of murdering Mr Mohamed - a brother of a member of Zone 2 - alongside another member of Moscow17, Kevin Aka-Kadjo. Earlier this year, Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick calledon social media platforms such as YouTubeto take down videos that glamorise violence. A police cordon remains in place at the scene on Warham Street, Camberwell Speaking outside the family home, Mr Kamara's father Lamin Kama said: ""Our family are in a lot of distress at the moment."" He declined to comment further, adding only that his son had three brothers. A neighbour, who gave his name only as Andy, said: ""My dog was going crazy and when I looked out there was this guy lying on the floor. There was blood."" Andy, who said he has lived in the area on and off for about 15 years, added: ""It's getting really rough around here."" Reality Check: is London's murder rate still higher than New York's? Drill: Is it right to blame the music genre for violence? Another neighbour, Sidney Virgo, 80, said: ""I knew this was going to happen. As soon as kids start gathering that's when something like this happens."" He said his neighbour's son had also been seriously stabbed on the estate just over a week ago. Rhyhiem Ainsworth Barton, also part of the Moscow17 drill group, was found with fatal gunshot wounds in the same street in which Mr Kamara was stabbed At the time of his death, 17-year-old Rhyhiem Ainsworth Barton's mother, Pretana Morgan, called for a halt in the wave of violence in the capital. ""Let my son be the last and be an example to everyone. Just let it stop. What must be, must be,"" she said. ""It's not about race, it's not about nation, it's not about culture. Nothing. It's just a human race."" Wednesday's stabbing happened hours after Cressida Dickreportedly said rates of violence in the capital were stabilising,external. It is the 85th homicide in the capital so far this year. A spike in the number of killings earlier in the year saw London's murder rate overtake that of New York, with knife crime a major factor. Harriet Harman, MP for Camberwell and Peckham, said ""anxiety"" about recent local violence has now turned to ""anger"". She said her constituents believe a reduction in police officers means the area has become ""a safe haven for people to carry out their criminal acts"". Is it right to blame drill music for violence?

"Nothing shows the desperate state of Zimbabwe's economy more than the severe shortage of cash. Banks limit how much cash can be taken out and the black market has become the main source of money for many people. Card payments can be made, but there are extra charges and not every shop or vendor accepts cards. A mobile phone money system called EcoCash can also be used, but once again this costs more than using cash. Zimbabweans are hoping that things will improve after elections next week. This is the first vote since Robert Mugabe was forced to resign as president last November, after 37 years in power. Four people in the capital, Harare, have been telling me how they survive day-to-day. Two of them asked to remain anonymous. I've been working in the health profession as a nurse for nine years. We are greatly underpaid. I get $300 (Â£230) a month, and what makes it worse is that with the money situation in Zimbabwe you can't even access your salary when you need it - it's like working for nothing. People have to queue to get their money out of their bank accounts I have opened accounts with two banks, one has a weekly withdrawal limit of $20, the other of $40. The idea is that I use both banks at once to try and access the money I need for the week. It means spending hours in bank queues, but there's no guarantee I'll get money. Stems back to rampant inflation, which killed off the old Zimbabwean dollar in 2009 The US dollar and South African rand became the main currencies in daily use In order to stop US dollar notes leaving the country, leading to the cash shortage, local ""bond notes"" were introduced in 2016 Bond notes were intended to replace dollar notes They were meant to be pegged to the US dollar but $1 usually exchanges for between 1.20 and 1.50 bond notes Because of a fear of inflation people do not like to hang on to bond notes for long - and prefer US dollars or EcoCash, a mobile phone payment system Banks now only issue businesses with US dollars 10 numbers that tell the story of Zimbabwe I am spending more time looking for cash at the moment than at work and it is affecting my job. Sometimes I can't buy food for the house because I can't get hard cash. In those cases I have to go and negotiate with the street money changers and I lose even more money there. I am forced to buy food in the supermarket where I can use my card but it's pricier than if I were buying from a vendor so that means less groceries in the basket and less food for my family. I don't know if things will ever change but I know there's something wrong with being a hardworking professional and not being able to even get my salary. It's not fair and it's all I ever think about. I feel cheated. I've been working in car sales for a few years but the prices aren't certain there and sometimes the market is slow and that's what got me into money-changing. Here on the streets there is always money to be made. Money changers have plenty of cash, but charge a commission People think money-changing is a lawless business, but it actually has a lot of unofficial rules. We make our money from commission. There's a lot of competition and everyone wants to get a good deal. Fifth Street is one of our main areas - it's more than a kilometre long. People come from all over come to see us - there's a big demand.  Just on this street, there could be up to $1m between all of us. Social media has been effective in helping us establish our own community. We've created groups on WhatsApp and Facebook where we know what the official rates for different currencies are then we work out what rates we are going to use on that day. 'Magic owls', ghost voters and Zimbabwe's election The story behind Zimbabwe's scarf What happened to Zimbabwe's land reforms? Emmerson Mnangagwa - the 'crocodile' who snapped back The crusader taking on Zimbabwe's 'crocodile' Have Zimbabwe's generals turned into democrats? The police give us problems. They sometimes come and tell us what we're doing is not allowed, and they threaten to shut us down. But everyone has a price in Zimbabwe and you can buy your way out trouble. The reality is that everyone is desperate for money, even the police and we are able to help with that. The money changers also deal in mobile EcoCash There's no limit to how much money I can get for a client, unlike the banks who will say you can only access $200 per month and also don't issue dollars to private citizens unless under special circumstances. In a good month I can make up to $400 extra money [on top of my sales job]. One of the reasons we are here is the bond notes. After the economy crashed many people here don't trust the banks. Some of our clients are high-profile people, they come in their big cars and we do the deals inside the cars, worth thousands of dollars. Between ourselves as money changers we also lend each other money if you have to process a big deal. It takes connections to live like this. Surviving in Zimbabwe is about a daily hustle. I know this business won't be around forever. For tomorrow's sake, things need to change - I have younger siblings and I want them to live a differently to how we're having to live I am from a village called Domboshava. I travel 20km (12 miles) everyday to come and sell vegetables in Harare. This has been my only source of income for six years now. Barbara Choto can only buy from her supplier if she gets hard cash from her customers It's not the life I wanted for myself but there are no jobs in Zimbabwe so you take what you can get. As prices keep on going up, I've been making less money than I used to. In the past in a good month I could make up to $150. Now most months I make just $75. Many people don't have hard cash and so many vendors like myself have had to start using EcoCash, but EcoCash takes a portion from every transaction. Many of my clients prefer to use EcoCash, which I am happy to accept because it at least means I can buy food for my children. The difficultly with this is that my supplier only accepts cash, so I can't order stock unless some of my clients use cash. If not I'm forced to go to the black market and exchange some of my EcoCash money for hard money such as bond notes or dollars. The money trading on the streets is unreliable and if you're someone like me who makes little money, the additional costs matter. Sometimes you can only get half the value of the money you put in. I have five children to feed and I'm a single mother.  Three of my children are still in school so most of the money I make goes towards them, I need them to get a good education so they're not forced to spend their days here in the street like their mother. I have never had a job in my life and it's not because of not trying. Unemployment is high even for young people who are well educated. How much more for us? I didn't get an opportunity to further my studies to university because I come from a poor family. I had to leave school and am willing to do any job - I survive by whatever little I get from occasional manual work. Mathias Mpangi is constantly checking his phone looking out for any job openings I never know how much cash I will be able to get a day, if any. Every day for me is about survival, most days are difficult. I am hoping that after the election big businesses will come back so Zimbabwe can get back on the right track. The system has been broken for many years. I know people who left Zimbabwe after losing their jobs as teachers and went and worked as gardeners in neighbouring countries so they can take care of their families. When times get really bad for me, it's tempting to leave but I want things to change here so I'm not forced to ever separate from my children. My babies are five years old and three years old. I would love to own my own business one day, to become someone they can be proud of. I know over the last few months people have been talking about a new Zimbabwe but I haven't seen this new Zimbabwe. Life has been the same for me.

"Mikaela Bennett will play Maria Mikaela Bennett will play Maria in the BBC Proms production of West Side Story, it has been announced. It's after the show's previous star, Sierra Boggess, withdrew from the role over complaints of ""whitewashing"".

"This video can not be played PM Ardern talks about going back to work after having baby Neve New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has returned to work after spending ""the fastest six weeks"" of her life on maternity leave. Ms Ardern, 38, had her daughter, Neve Te Aroha, in June, making her the second world leader to give birth while in office. The leader passed her duties to her deputy, Winston Peters, while on leave.

""But of course, this is a unique circumstance and I'm really very keen to get back to work."" The family have spent the first few weeks of Neve's life in a ""bubble"" at home in Auckland, but will return to Wellington, where New Zealand's parliament is based, on Saturday. Ms Ardern took six weeks of maternity leave Ms Ardern's partner Clarke Gayford, a television presenter, will be a stay-at-home dad, allowing her to focus on running the country. It is, she says, a privilege many other women do not have. ""I'm very very lucky,"" she told Radio NZ,external. ""I have a partner who can be there alongside me, who's taking up a huge part of that joint responsibility because he's a parent too, he's not a babysitter."" Ms Ardern, who was elected in October, announced in January that she and Mr Gayford were expecting a baby. ""I am not the first woman to multi-task. I am not the first woman to work and have a baby - there are many women who have done this before,"" she said at the time. Indeed, even when on maternity leave, Ms Ardern - New Zealand's youngest prime minister since 1856 - continued to read cabinet papers and was consulted on significant issues.

"Facebook and Instagram say the new tools were developed based on collaboration with mental health experts and organisations Facebook and Instagram are releasing a new tool to limit how much time people spend on their apps. The announcement follows concerns that excessive social media use can have a negative impact on mental health. Users will now be able to check how much time they've spent scrolling, set a reminder for when they've reach their allotted time, and mute notifications for a period of time. But some people say it doesn't go far enough. ""I wouldn't say it's a radical change or that it's going to really change a lot about the way that most people use Facebook or Instagram,"" Grant Blank, from the Oxford Internet Institute, tells Newsbeat. ""It strikes me as a way to balance their corporate interest of keeping people spending as much time as possible on Facebook, while still being responsive to people who find the continual notifications to be disturbing or distracting."" You can access the tools on the settings page on either app by tapping ""Your Activity"" on Instagram or ""Your Time on Facebook"" on Facebook Facebook published a blog post in December 2017 thatacknowledged the negative effects,externalof spending too much time on the platform. In one experiment, students at the University of Michigan who were randomly assigned to scroll through Facebook for 10 minutes were ""in a worse mood"" at the end of the day than those assigned to be more active on the site - posting or talking to friends. Another study from UC San Diego and Yale showed people who clicked on four times as many links or liked twice as many posts ""reported worse mental health than average"". Lifestyle vlogger and Instagrammer Em Sheldon, 24, tells Newsbeat that checking up on her friends is an ""all-day thing"". Allow Instagram content?

"This video can not be played Former clerk Jenny McCullough alleges she was bullied by MP Keith Vaz Labour MP Keith Vaz bullied clerks who sought to uphold the rules and process of the Commons,Newsnighthas learned. One clerk claims Mr Vaz, who in 2016 quit as the head of a select committee after a tabloid reported he had hired prostitutes, told her she was bad at her job because she was ""not a mother"". Accounts of his behaviour were recorded in the clerk's appraisals but no one in the Commons intervened to protect her. Mr Vaz denies breaching any of the rules of the House and denies bullying. Jenny McCullough served as a clerk in the House of Commons from 2002 to 2011. She has claimed Mr Vaz repeatedly bullied and undermined her position in the House while he was chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee. Newsnight's Chris Cook: Analysis on Westminster bullying Other clerks have told Newsnight that this was part of a pattern of behaviour. They said that the Leicester East MP was prone to bullying clerks, particularly those who tried to stand up for the standards of the House. Ms McCullough alleges that Mr Vaz said she was a poor clerk because she was ""not a mother"". He also made jokes about whether Ms McCullough was a security threat, on account of her Northern Irish background and accent. Mr Vaz was chairman of the home affairs committee from 2007 until his resignation in 2016 - the Sunday Mirror reportedhe was caught hiring prostitutes and showing willing to pay for drugs.An inquiry into that is ongoing. Keith Vaz, MP for Leicester East Ms McCullough's relationship with Mr Vaz deteriorated rapidly on an official committee trip to Russia and Ukraine in 2008, when Ms McCullough raised concerns with Mr Vaz about his compliance with the rules and protocols of the House. The rules and standards around these trips demand, for example, that MPs arrange an itinerary before leaving that can be signed off. They also demand that hospitality is either arranged by the committee as part of the programme or appropriately declared. Newsnight has seen emails from Ms McCullough to her manager relating her concerns. For example, she was worried about who was paying for a dinner on the trip. ""The chairman refused to tell me who we would be meeting or what the arrangements were beyond that we would be dining with Ivan, a friend of his who was (or used to be, I couldn't find out) a 'senator',"" she wrote. But when she arrived, she discovered that it was what she called a ""large"" and ""opulent"" dinner, thrown in the MPs' honour.  She did not know who the guests at the dinner were. She emailed her manager saying: ""We didn't pay - I didn't know who did."" Ms McCullough says that when she stood up to Mr Vaz about her concerns he launched into a ""tirade"" against her in a hotel lobby. ""He then demanded to know what age I was. He told me that I didn't know how the House worked and that I didn't respect the authority of members - that I had an attitude problem."" She said this was when Mr Vaz told her she was bad at her job because she was not a mother. When they returned, Ms McCullough's colleagues recall Mr Vaz's criticism of Ms McCullough being unrelenting and personal. Ms McCullough told Newsnight that she was eventually asked to stop coming to team meetings, because his reaction to her presence was too disruptive, and prevented any work from being done by the team. She was eventually moved to another job elsewhere in the House. But, not feeling protected at work, later chose to leave. Her problems with Mr Vaz were known to the House of Commons management. Her annual appraisal for the year 2008 stated that ""Jenny had excellent relations with Home Office officials and other witnesses, and with all the committee apart from the chairman, who chose to try to bully her. Jenny understandably and properly stood her ground, which the chairman resented."" A representative for Mr Vaz told Newsnight that he denied any bullying, and said: ""No complaint or allegation of this nature has ever been brought to his attention. ""Our client had considered that he and Ms McCullough had previously had a good working relationship, and had always considered her to be very effective as a clerk."" He particularly denied making light of Ms McCullough's origins or motherhood. After Ms McCullough left the House, she complained about the way that she had been treated. She told Newsnight: ""I didn't feel able to complain about Keith Vaz because I was afraid of him. When I was on the home affairs committee I saw that he had friends in the police and friends in the law. ""He said that one of the principal clerks was a friend and by the time I was leaving the house he had a friend in the Speaker. I thought it could only end badly for me."" The House of Commons told Newsnight: ""We are aware that in the past the House has not had a robust process in place to deal with instances of bullying and harassment. ""We are confident that our new Independent Complaints and Grievance Policy will mean that allegations can be dealt with effectively and sensitively."" Keith Vaz accused of bullying clerks.

"This video can not be played BBC captures footage of post-election violence in Harare Three people were killed in Zimbabwe's capital Harare after troops opened fire on rioting opposition supporters, police say. The government says the army was deployed in central Harare to help police restore order. The opposition MDC Alliance condemned the crackdown, saying it was  a reminder of the ""dark days"" of Robert Mugabe's rule. It alleges that the governing Zanu-PF party has rigged Monday's elections. Zimbabwe violence: As it happened Harare chaos in pictures Parliamentary results show Zanu-PF heading for a big majority in the first elections since long-serving ruler Mr Mugabe was ousted from power. The presidential result has yet to be declared. However, the MDC Alliance insists that its presidential candidate, Nelson Chamisa, won Monday's election. European Union monitors have expressed concern over the length of time it is taking to declare the presidential result. President Emmerson Mnangagwa was quoted by state broadcaster ZBC as saying: ""We hold the opposition MDC Alliance and its whole leadership responsible for this disturbance of national peace, which was meant to disrupt the electoral process."" He later took to Twitter to urge peace: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Justice Minister Ziyambi Ziyambi said the army had been deployed in Harare to disperse a violent crowd and to restore ""peace and tranquillity"". He added: ""The presence of the army is not to intimidate people but to ensure that law and order is maintained. They are there to assist the police."" A spokesman for Mr Chamisa condemned the deployment of soldiers and the subsequent loss of life. ""Soldiers are trained to kill during war. Are civilians enemies of the state?"" he asked. ""There is no explanation whatsoever for the brutality that we saw today."" Correspondents say the violence was confined to the centre of Harare - an opposition stronghold - while other parts of the country remain calm. Latest reports from the capital suggest the security forces are in control of the streets. By Pumza Fihlani, BBC News, Harare Army vehicles and police trucks rolled into Zimbabwe's main city on Wednesday after the wait for the election results took an ugly turn. MDC Alliance supporters had been gathering in various parts of Harare since the morning, but when news came that Zanu-PF had won the majority of seats in parliament and that the presidential results were not ready, the previously upbeat mood changed. Opposition supporters went on the rampage down Harare's busy streets, heading towards an old Zanu-PF office and carrying large stones, sticks and anything else they could grab along the way. The crowd chanted: ""We want Chamisa."" They believe the election has been stolen, and are demanding the MDC be announced as the winner. Riot police using water cannon and tear gas arrived to a chaotic scene of burning tyres and an unrelenting crowd. There were hundreds of them. They jeered and pelted the police vans with stones. In another part of the city where more opposition protesters had gathered, the army used whips to disperse them. Today's clashes may not have been on the scale of the ""days of old"", where intimidation by security police was the order of the day, but it's certainly not the peace many had been praising until now. Something has changed here. The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (Zec) has announced 140 seats for Zanu-PF so far, and 58 for the MDC Alliance, ZBC state media reported. There are 210 seats in the National Assembly's lower house. More than five million people were registered to vote, and there was a high turnout of 70%. ZBC had reported that the electoral commission would announce the presidential results at 12:30 local time (10:30 GMT) on Wednesday, but only parliamentary results were read out. The BBC's Shingai Nyoka reports that the announcement on the presidential poll was not made because representatives of some of the 23 candidates had failed to turn up to verify the results. A presidential candidate needs more than 50% of the vote to win outright. Otherwise, a run-off election will be held on 8 September. The EU mission has criticised the delay in announcing the presidential results. Zec has until Saturday to do so. The electoral commission says 70% of registered voters took part in the election It said it had observed several problems, including media bias, voter intimidation and mistrust in the electoral commission, adding that there was an ""improved political climate, but un-level playing field and lack of trust"". This is the first time in 16 years that the government has allowed EU and US election monitors into the country. The African Union mission has said the elections ""took place in a very peaceful environment"" and ""were highly competitive"". It added that it could not confirm opposition parties' complaints of vote-buying, intimidation by the state and bias by traditional leaders. A preliminary report by the Southern African Development Community (Sadc) observers said the elections were largely peaceful and conducted in accordance with the law.

President-elect Emmerson Mnangagwa has concluded his press conference at State House in the capital, Harare, where he defended the legitimacy of his win at the polls. He said he was validated by both the national electoral commission and EU observers - a statement at odds with the head of the EU observer mission's conclusion that an ""un-level playing field and lack of trust"" had marred the election process. Mr Mnangagwa said: The constitution, as well as domestic and municipal law, states that Zec [the electoral commission] pronounces the one who has won the election. I have accepted it.  The EU told me there was peace, transparency and freedom during the campaign period. They also told me the voting process was peaceful, transparent and well-organised.  But we can improve... in areas of access to polling stations."" Emmerson Mnangagwa, President-elect of Zimbabwe ""Zimbabwe is open for business, we want to leapfrog and catch up with the rest of developing countries and the rest of Sadc [Southern African Development Community],"" President-elect Emmerson Mnangagwa has told reporters at an ongoing press conference in the capital, Harare. ""Zimbabwe is open for business"" has been one of his favourite campaign phrases. President-elect Emmerson Mnangagwa has called the deaths of six people from clashes between protesters and police on Wednesday ""an unfortunate incident"" and says he will set up an independent commission to investigate what happened. He also pledged to provide support to bereaved families once in office. He told reporters at an ongoing press conference in Harare: I'm informed that after the burning of several vehicles and the locking up of people in a room to burn them, the police was overwhelmed and they summoned assistance from the army to stop the wanton destruction.  I've told the nation I am going to institute an independent commission to inquire into these issues. It will be composed of our nationals as well as foreign nationals.  He also addressed the opposition MDC Alliance's plans to challenge the results of the polls in court: Zimbabwe is enjoying democracy. Any party can proceed to challenge the results in the courts.""

Congolese security forces have fired shots to disperse the several thousand followers of opposition leader MoÃ¯se Katumbi who are waiting to welcome him as he attempts to cross the border from Zambia, says the BBC's Poly Muzalia. Latest reports indicate that Mr Katumbi is currently at immigration on the Zambian side of border town Kasumbalesa, meanwhile his supporters have gathered on the Congolese side. Congolese opposition leader MoÃ¯se Katumbi has crossed
no-manâs land between Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo with
thousands of his supporters who came to meet him. He is currently at immigration, reports the BBCâs senior Africa correspondent Anne
Soy. Earlier we quoted his supporters as saying he had crossed the border. On Friday morning, the authorities said he would not be allowed to
enter the country. He had requested authorisation to fly back from South Africa, but when this was denied he decided to fly to Zambia and then cross the border into DR Congo by road. The border town of Kasumbalesa is about 95km (59 miles)
to his hometown Lubumbashi. A wealthy businessman and former governor, Mr Katumbi left
DR Congo in 2016. He was later sentenced in absentia to 36 months in prison
on charges he says are politically motivated. He wants to return before a deadline for people to
register their candidacy for the long-delayed presidential elections â now
scheduled to take place in December. Who is MoÃ¯se Katumbi? Zimbabwe's opposition leader Nelson Chamisa addressed Wednesday's violence, where troops and riot police clashed with MDC Alliance protesters, during a Friday press conference in Harare. ""The thank you we are getting for being peaceful was a thank you of bullets, guns and tanks."" Here are some images from Friday's Friday's conference:  Opposition leader Nelson Chamisa, from the MDC Alliance, has called the Zimbabwe election result a ""coup"" against the will of the people. ""Yesterday's coup against your will is temporary,"" he said at a press conference in the capital, Harare, which was delayed by riot police. He said they had ""back-ups"" of voter tallies, which he alleged the ruling Zanu-PF wanted to destroy when police raided the MDC headquarters on Thursday. President Emmerson Mnangagwa won the vote with 50.8% of the vote, the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission announced on Thursday evening. The president avoided a run-off by just 36,464 votes out of more than 4.8 million cast. The opposition MDC Allicance will negate the results of Zimbabwe's July presidential election as it was rigged, the party's leader Nelson Chamisa has told journalists. He said their collated results ""indicated that we won"" by 2.3 million. According to the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (Zec), President Emmerson Mnangagwa received 2.46 million votes (50.8%) and Mr Chamisa 2.15 million (44.3%).

Opposition leader Nelson Chamisa called Zimbabwe's election result, which President Emmerson Mnangagwa won with 50.8% of the vote, ""fraudulent, illegal, and illegitimate"" during a press conference that was delayed by riot police in the capital Harare. Speaking to journalists at the Bronte Hotel, the MDC Alliance party leader reiterated his allegation that the election ""rigged"". ""Mr Mnangagwa did not win the election in this country â¦ we won this election emphatically,"" he said. âWe won this election and we are ready to form the next government.â He also referred to the riot police disrupting the event. ""This is not the behaviour of people who had won, it is behaviour of
people who had lost.""  Zimbabwe's President Emmerson Mnangagwa says the disruption at a MDC Alliance press conference by riot police is being investigated and has ""no place in our society"".

Will RossAfrica editor, BBC World Service The largest independent election observer mission in Zimbabwe says the official results from the presidential poll are broadly consistent with its own findings. The Zimbabwe Election Support Network (Zesn) studied a sample from 750 polling stations and whilst agreeing that the incumbent Emmerson Mnangagwa won the most votes, it says it cannot definitely confirm whether or not there should have been a run-off. The electoral commission said Mr Mnangagwa had secured 50.8%, narrowly avoiding the need for a second round. The opposition leader, Nelson Chamisa, says he will produce evidence to back up his claim that the election result was rigged. The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (Zec), which announced the results, said there was ""no skulduggery"" involved in the vote tally. But EU observers said they had found an ""un-level playing field and lack of trust"" in the election process. EU and Commonwealth observers have criticised the four-day delay in announcing the results A legal adviser for Nelson Chamisa, Zimbabwe's opposition MDC Alliance leader, has told reporters in the capital, Harare, that the press conference will now go ahead. He said the police had dispersed journalists and cameramen because they had mistaken it for a political gathering. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played BBC captures footage of post-election violence in Harare Three people were killed in Zimbabwe's capital Harare after troops opened fire on rioting opposition supporters, police say. The government says the army was deployed in central Harare to help police restore order. The opposition MDC Alliance condemned the crackdown, saying it was  a reminder of the ""dark days"" of Robert Mugabe's rule. It alleges that the governing Zanu-PF party has rigged Monday's elections. Zimbabwe violence: As it happened Harare chaos in pictures Parliamentary results show Zanu-PF heading for a big majority in the first elections since long-serving ruler Mr Mugabe was ousted from power. The presidential result has yet to be declared. However, the MDC Alliance insists that its presidential candidate, Nelson Chamisa, won Monday's election. European Union monitors have expressed concern over the length of time it is taking to declare the presidential result. President Emmerson Mnangagwa was quoted by state broadcaster ZBC as saying: ""We hold the opposition MDC Alliance and its whole leadership responsible for this disturbance of national peace, which was meant to disrupt the electoral process.""

Justice Minister Ziyambi Ziyambi said the army had been deployed in Harare to disperse a violent crowd and to restore ""peace and tranquillity"". He added: ""The presence of the army is not to intimidate people but to ensure that law and order is maintained. They are there to assist the police."" A spokesman for Mr Chamisa condemned the deployment of soldiers and the subsequent loss of life. ""Soldiers are trained to kill during war. Are civilians enemies of the state?"" he asked. ""There is no explanation whatsoever for the brutality that we saw today."" Correspondents say the violence was confined to the centre of Harare - an opposition stronghold - while other parts of the country remain calm. Latest reports from the capital suggest the security forces are in control of the streets. By Pumza Fihlani, BBC News, Harare Army vehicles and police trucks rolled into Zimbabwe's main city on Wednesday after the wait for the election results took an ugly turn. MDC Alliance supporters had been gathering in various parts of Harare since the morning, but when news came that Zanu-PF had won the majority of seats in parliament and that the presidential results were not ready, the previously upbeat mood changed. Opposition supporters went on the rampage down Harare's busy streets, heading towards an old Zanu-PF office and carrying large stones, sticks and anything else they could grab along the way. The crowd chanted: ""We want Chamisa."" They believe the election has been stolen, and are demanding the MDC be announced as the winner. Riot police using water cannon and tear gas arrived to a chaotic scene of burning tyres and an unrelenting crowd. There were hundreds of them. They jeered and pelted the police vans with stones. In another part of the city where more opposition protesters had gathered, the army used whips to disperse them. Today's clashes may not have been on the scale of the ""days of old"", where intimidation by security police was the order of the day, but it's certainly not the peace many had been praising until now. Something has changed here. The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (Zec) has announced 140 seats for Zanu-PF so far, and 58 for the MDC Alliance, ZBC state media reported. There are 210 seats in the National Assembly's lower house. More than five million people were registered to vote, and there was a high turnout of 70%. ZBC had reported that the electoral commission would announce the presidential results at 12:30 local time (10:30 GMT) on Wednesday, but only parliamentary results were read out. The BBC's Shingai Nyoka reports that the announcement on the presidential poll was not made because representatives of some of the 23 candidates had failed to turn up to verify the results. A presidential candidate needs more than 50% of the vote to win outright. Otherwise, a run-off election will be held on 8 September. The EU mission has criticised the delay in announcing the presidential results. Zec has until Saturday to do so. The electoral commission says 70% of registered voters took part in the election It said it had observed several problems, including media bias, voter intimidation and mistrust in the electoral commission, adding that there was an ""improved political climate, but un-level playing field and lack of trust"". This is the first time in 16 years that the government has allowed EU and US election monitors into the country. The African Union mission has said the elections ""took place in a very peaceful environment"" and ""were highly competitive"". It added that it could not confirm opposition parties' complaints of vote-buying, intimidation by the state and bias by traditional leaders. A preliminary report by the Southern African Development Community (Sadc) observers said the elections were largely peaceful and conducted in accordance with the law.

"The future of House of Fraser has been thrown into doubt after its potential new owner walked away from a rescue. C.banner, which owns the toy store Hamley's, had planned to take control of the struggling department store chain and inject Â£70m of cash. However, the Chinese firm said it would no longer proceed with its investment, plunging House of Fraser into crisis. That deal would have involved closing 31 of its 59 stores, with the loss of 6,000 jobs. House of Fraser agreed a controversial restructuring deal with its landlords in June to cut stores and save money. A legal challenge contesting the process has been made by landlords. The retailer employs 17,500 people - 6,000 direct and 11,500 concession staff. Loan offer from Mike Ashley Landlords challenge House of Fraser rescue By Emma Simpson, BBC business correspondent Things have taken a sudden turn for the worse for House of Fraser. A looming battle with some of its landlords over its controversial restructuring deal has now been overtaken by events. C.Banner was not only taking a majority stake in the 169-year-old chain, but also providing a crucial Â£70m cash injection. The question now is who would be willing to put money into this business in its current form. House of Fraser is already heavily indebted with onerous interest payments every quarter. That is one of the reasons it is struggling to make the sums add up in today's incredibly challenging climate for retailers. House of Fraser has some big bills looming on the horizon, including quarterly rent and paying for Christmas stock. The clock is ticking for this business to somehow come up with a solution. Andrew Busby, of the consultancy Retail Reflections, said the chain's only hope for survival could be a merger with rival Debenhams. ""House of Debenhams is becoming more and more of a reality - that's the best outcome for House of Fraser,"" he said. ""Unless you are Harrods or Selfridges the department store concept is not quite dead, but severely challenged."" Richard Lim of Retail Economics said: ""This is a real blow to House of Fraser. They're in desperate need of a rescue deal and without this fresh injection of around Â£70m, it's almost inevitable that they'll fall in to administration. This could be within a matter of weeks."" This video can not be played Why is House of Fraser failing? C.banner had been planning to raise the money needed to invest in House of Fraser by issuing new shares. However, the Hong Kong-listed company's shares have fallen by 70% in the past two months and it issued a profit warning on Wednesday. In a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange, C.banner said the share placing had been ""rendered impracticable and inadvisable"" and the agreement was therefore being terminated immediately. House of Fraser's flagship store on Oxford Street had been threatened with closure under the rescue deal In response, House of Fraser said it was in talks with other investors and was exploring other financing options: ""Discussions are ongoing and a further announcement will be made as and when appropriate."" The loss-making department store chain is now understood to be talking to new potential buyers. On Monday, it emerged thatHouse of Fraser had been approached by Sports Direct founder Mike Ashleyover a fresh investment deal. He controls an 11.1% stake in House of Fraser and a near-30% stake in Debenhams.

"Scores of residents gathered outside Northamptonshire County Council headquarters to protest over proposed cuts Angry residents gathered outside an emergency meeting of a cash-strapped local authority earlier to protest about proposed cuts to services. Northamptonshire County Council, which must save Â£70m by March, met to discuss how to tackle the funding crisis. Council leader Matthew Golby said councillors had to examine ""what we can realistically provide"" for residents. The Conservative-led council has been forced toimpose spending controlstwice in six months. It has vowed to protect children and vulnerable adults but a financial expert warned essential services may be ""cut to the very bone"". One public speaker attending the meeting at County Hall on Wednesday evening, described the situation as a ""shambles"" and demanded Mr Golby resigned. Protesters also stood for a minute's silence to ""mourn"" likely cuts to services. Mr Golby acknowledged the council faced ""a massive task"" but said bosses would ""do everything within our powers"" to get the authority ""back on track"". The authority has called an emergency meeting to discuss how to make Â£70m of savings by March 2019 Labour councillor John McGee said the proposals would leave the authority ""on the brink of providing illegal services to the vulnerable people of Northamptonshire"". Meanwhile, Tory councillor Rob Gough called on his colleagues to ""make sure we make the cuts that need to be made"". He said: ""Throwing money at the problem like we have in the past is not going to solve the issue. ""We cannot balance the books by fleecing the taxpayer. Why should they suffer for the folly of the state?"" Labour councillor Mick Scrimshaw said the authority had been placed ""at the vanguard of the austerity project"", claiming funding cuts were ""an excuse by some to reduce the powers and size of local government"". ""There's not a cat in hell's chance that this year's budget will actually balance,"" he added. ""We need to send a clear and strong message to the government - we cannot manage because of stupid local decisions."" Labour's Winston Strachan described the council's situation as ""an absolute disaster"". He said: ""I have been a councillor since 2001 and for the first time yesterday, I had to say to someone who asked for help: 'I am sorry, we have no money'."" Of the 57 county councillors, only 43 attended the meeting that has now ended. Many of the protesters displayed banners outside simply saying ""No more cuts"", while others urged the government to ""bail out"" the council. Teacher Pat Markey said: ""The cuts we have faced over the last few years and the cuts that are about to happen are criminal."" Louise Stubbs chairs a campaign group that is fighting to save Brackley library in the county. She said: ""Our library service is the most efficient in the entire country... that is why we have had to fight so hard to try and save them."" Northamptonshire County Council has been forced to sell its Â£53m HQ, which it moved in to in October Mr Golby has proposed services be reduced to a ""core offer"" and said the authority had to decide what it could ""realistically provide"". He said the authority would ""safeguard all children and young people"" while ensuring a ""robust safeguarding system to protect vulnerable adults"". The ""core offer"" would also see the authority carry out ""sufficient maintenance"" of public highways and plan for school places, he added. A council source told the BBC the scale of possible cuts was ""huge... completely unprecedented"". Could it happen elsewhere? Council 'ignored 2015 crisis warning' County council 'misappropriated' Â£8m A section 114 notice issued last week, severely curtailing spending at the council, followsthe issuing of the same notice in February. Prior to this, there had been only two issued in the UK since 1988. Brian Roberts,one of two government-appointed commissionersoverseeing the council, said the authority's finances were in a ""truly perilous state"".

White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders later said at a press briefing that the tweet is ""not an order"". She described it as Mr Trump's ""opinion"", adding: ""I think he's been crystal clear about how he feels about the investigation from the beginning."" Analysis by Jon Sopel, BBC North America Editor There is nothing new about the president's frustration, agitation and anger at the special counsel investigation. But this is the first time in overt terms that he has called on the attorney general to fire Robert Mueller. The timing is interesting too - his former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, has just gone on trial, accused of failing to declare the extent of his business connections with pro-Moscow Ukrainian politicians. It also comes as the Mueller inquiry starts moving closer to the Trump family circle - in particular, the behaviour of his son, Donald Jr and son-in-law Jared Kushner over a meeting at Trump Tower during the campaign with a Russian lawyer who had close links to the Kremlin. Technically the Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, can't fire Mueller as he has recused himself from the Russia investigation. Ironically, one of the areas the Mueller investigation is looking at is whether the president has used Twitter to try to pressurise or intimidate his attorney general. The president's tweet today might be seen as relevant. Mr Manafort, 69, led Mr Trump's campaign for three months until August 2016. He is charged with tax evasion and money-laundering stemming from his political consultancy work in Ukraine. Trump ex-campaign chief 'lied', court told A courtroom sketch shows Mr Manafort seated during the opening day of his trial on Tuesday But Mr Manafort is not accused of aiding Russia's alleged attempts to sway the 2016 presidential election Mr Trump's way, a focus of the Mueller investigation. The special counsel is also scrutinising whether there were any attempts by the president to obstruct justice. The president wields significant constitutional authority over the Department of Justice since it belongs to the executive branch of US government. But it has been a US civic tenet ever since the Nixon-era Watergate scandal that the agency should be free from political interference. Mr Trump has previously acknowledged it is ""the saddest thing"" that he is not supposed to meddle with the law agency. Utah's Republican Senator Orrin Hatch told journalists that many ""wish the Mueller investigation would go away,"" but added, ""that's not going to happen"". The third highest-ranking Senate Republican, John Thune of South Dakota, told reporters on Capitol Hill: ""Most of us up here believe the process needs to play out, and it will."" Democratic congressman Adam Schiff called the president's words ""an attempt to obstruct justice hiding in plain sight"". On Wednesday, District Judge TS Ellis took issue with the term ""oligarch"" - which prosecutors used to describe the Ukrainian politicians for whom Mr Manafort worked - calling the word ""pejorative"". ""We're not going to have a case tried that he associated with despicable people and, therefore, he's despicable,"" the judge said. ""That's not the American way."" On Tuesday, prosecutors called as their first witness Democratic strategist Tad Devine, who worked for presidential candidate Bernie Sanders during the 2016 election. Mr Devine described how in 2010 they both assisted now-deposed Ukrainian leader Viktor Yanukovych during his presidential campaign. Mr Manafort ""worked harder than anybody"" during the campaign, he said. The court also heard on Wednesday from an FBI agent who led the raid on Mr Manafort's Virginia home, an incident that has been heavily criticised by Mr Trump. Matthew Mikuska testified that he knocked three times on the door before using a key to open it.

"Scores of residents gathered outside Northamptonshire County Council headquarters to protest over proposed cuts Angry residents gathered outside an emergency meeting of a cash-strapped local authority earlier to protest about proposed cuts to services. Northamptonshire County Council, which must save Â£70m by March, met to discuss how to tackle the funding crisis. Council leader Matthew Golby said councillors had to examine ""what we can realistically provide"" for residents. The Conservative-led council has been forced toimpose spending controlstwice in six months. It has vowed to protect children and vulnerable adults but a financial expert warned essential services may be ""cut to the very bone"". One public speaker attending the meeting at County Hall on Wednesday evening, described the situation as a ""shambles"" and demanded Mr Golby resigned. Protesters also stood for a minute's silence to ""mourn"" likely cuts to services. Mr Golby acknowledged the council faced ""a massive task"" but said bosses would ""do everything within our powers"" to get the authority ""back on track"". The authority has called an emergency meeting to discuss how to make Â£70m of savings by March 2019 Labour councillor John McGee said the proposals would leave the authority ""on the brink of providing illegal services to the vulnerable people of Northamptonshire"". Meanwhile, Tory councillor Rob Gough called on his colleagues to ""make sure we make the cuts that need to be made"". He said: ""Throwing money at the problem like we have in the past is not going to solve the issue. ""We cannot balance the books by fleecing the taxpayer. Why should they suffer for the folly of the state?"" Labour councillor Mick Scrimshaw said the authority had been placed ""at the vanguard of the austerity project"", claiming funding cuts were ""an excuse by some to reduce the powers and size of local government"". ""There's not a cat in hell's chance that this year's budget will actually balance,"" he added. ""We need to send a clear and strong message to the government - we cannot manage because of stupid local decisions."" Labour's Winston Strachan described the council's situation as ""an absolute disaster"". He said: ""I have been a councillor since 2001 and for the first time yesterday, I had to say to someone who asked for help: 'I am sorry, we have no money'."" Of the 57 county councillors, only 43 attended the meeting that has now ended. Many of the protesters displayed banners outside simply saying ""No more cuts"", while others urged the government to ""bail out"" the council. Teacher Pat Markey said: ""The cuts we have faced over the last few years and the cuts that are about to happen are criminal."" Louise Stubbs chairs a campaign group that is fighting to save Brackley library in the county. She said: ""Our library service is the most efficient in the entire country... that is why we have had to fight so hard to try and save them."" Northamptonshire County Council has been forced to sell its Â£53m HQ, which it moved in to in October Mr Golby has proposed services be reduced to a ""core offer"" and said the authority had to decide what it could ""realistically provide"". He said the authority would ""safeguard all children and young people"" while ensuring a ""robust safeguarding system to protect vulnerable adults"". The ""core offer"" would also see the authority carry out ""sufficient maintenance"" of public highways and plan for school places, he added. A council source told the BBC the scale of possible cuts was ""huge... completely unprecedented"". Could it happen elsewhere? Council 'ignored 2015 crisis warning' County council 'misappropriated' Â£8m A section 114 notice issued last week, severely curtailing spending at the council, followsthe issuing of the same notice in February.

"Detectives are set to complete their 13-month investigation at the Grenfell Tower site in west London The government will take responsibility for Grenfell Tower when the police release the site as a crime scene. The housing ministry will take over safety and security until the community decides how the site should be used. Kensington and Chelsea Council, which owns the site but will not have a management role, welcomed the decision.

Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Natasha Elcock, a member of survivor and bereaved group Grenfell United, said: ""It's hard to put into words how personal what happens to the site is to all of us who lived in the tower, lost loved ones in the fire and for the wider community. ""The people we lost that night will be forever in our hearts and it will be survivors, bereaved families and the community that will make decisions together about what happens to the site now and how we remember the loved ones we lost."" A march marking the first anniversary of the Grenfell Tower fire The government, which is set to take over management of the site in the autumn, has said access for those involved inthe Grenfell Tower Inquiryremains the priority. Decisions taken by central government will be implemented by the independent team - led by the chief executive of Bromley Council - which has overseen day-to-day management of the site since last July. The land will be transferred to a body representing the bereaved and survivors once an appropriate body is set up and when the land is ready for use - as set out in an agreement between the government, the local council and community groups. A spokesman for Kensington and Chelsea Council said it should be for the Grenfell community to decide on the tower's future.

"Bournemouth School is bidding for money to expand There are 11,000 more grammar school pupils in England now than in 2010, BBC analysis of official data shows. And by 2021, the data suggests, the number of extra places created will be equivalent to 24 new grammar schools compared to eight years ago. The analysis shows a rise in numbers even before the distribution ofa new Â£50m growth fund, announced in May. The government says schools will be eligible for funding only if they improve access for poorer pupils. Grammar schools are state-funded secondary schools which allocate places to pupils on the basis of their performance in an extra academic test at the end of primary school. Prime Minister Theresa May had to drop controversial plans to overturn the ban on new schools after the last election, but the expansion of existing grammar schools has been encouraged. Green light for grammar expansion Do grammars boost social mobility? Reality check: Selective schools and social mobility More than 30 existing grammar schools are bidding for some of the first Â£50m slice of a new Â£200m government expansion fund. Schools bidding for the cash will have to show how they intend to admit more disadvantaged pupils. Using newly-published government data, the BBC has found that grammar schools have been continuing to grow, even before the distribution of those funds. If schools maintain their intake at current rates, the equivalent of eight extra schools will be added by 2021 compared with this year, and 24 more compared with 2010. This video can not be played Grammar schools: How do children cope when they don't make the grade? Grammar schools remain controversial because they take a big slice of the children already doing well at school, making it harder for neighbouring schools to get similarly good GCSE results. Some better-off parents invest heavily in paying for tutoring for the test, and overall very few pupils from poorer backgrounds have attended grammar schools in the past decade. So a key part of the debate in England about grammar schools has been whether they make an effort to give places to children from families on benefits or low earnings. If a child has received free school meals in the past six years, the school gets extra money called pupil premium funding. We looked at the admission policies of all 163 grammar schools in England for the school year 2018-19. You need a modern browser and a working internet connection to view the interactive content in this page. Source: BBC research and Department for Education pupil population data 2016-17 If you can't see the postcode search, taphere,external The number not giving any priority to poorer, pupil premium children has fallen from 90 to 61 since the current school year. Looking ahead to next year, 93 of England's 163 grammar schools have a priority policy of some kind. A further nine will only use pupil premium status as a tiebreaker to decide between two children with the same test score. If a school uses results from the top test score down it may never need to use the tiebreaker, and children who have been tutored, or come from better-off homes, may get most of the places. Prof Anna Vignoles, from Cambridge University, says quotas are a better way of getting more poorer pupils into grammar schools as they set a lower bar for those pupils. ""Tiebreakers are less effective, and the reason is you are still admitting pupils on the basis of their test score and on average, poorer students have lower scores. ""So what you are doing is ranking students on their test score and the richest students will be at the top, and you rarely get to use your tiebreaker."" More than 30 grammar schools are bidding for a share of the first wave of expansion cash. The government says those schools asking for money need to show how they will make sure more disadvantaged children get places, through measures such as a lower test mark or a quota of places. A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""Any good school - whether it is a comprehensive, academy or selective school - is able to expand if there is a need and a parental demand. By 2020 this government will have created a million new school places, so it's no surprise that grammars, some of the highest performing schools in the country, are part of that. ""The criteria for grants from the Selective School Expansion Fund is clear. If applicants cannot show how they will increase access, they will not be eligible for funding."" Schools willing to ask for some of the money as a loan will also win points that could help their bid. Heath Monk is the executive director of the King Edward VI group of schools in Birmingham. ""There is a real opportunity to use the fund to leverage more fair access, but that's clouded by the financial considerations. ""The question is whether if you have weaker fair access plans, could those bids get through because of a willingness of the school to borrow more?"" Grammar school success 'down to privilege' How parent power boosts grammars Four of the schools bidding do not have any policy in place for this year or next to give poorer children priority. These are Chislehurst and Sidcup, Highworth, and Wilmington, all in Kent and Westcliff grammar school in Essex. Some, like the highly oversubscribed Colchester County High School for Girls, and Tiffin school in Kingston-upon-Thames, only use pupil premium to decide as a tiebreaker. Others, like Bournemouth grammar school have already made very radical changes to make their admissions policy more inclusive. Next year, all pupil premium children passing the test will be awarded places first regardless of where they live, followed by other local children from Bournemouth and parts of Christchurch. ""I think we're going back to why grammar schools were established, to serve the most able children no matter what their background,"" says head teacher Dorian Lewis. He says changes made already in admissions have more than doubled the proportion of pupils on free school meals from 3% to 7%. He describes the school buildings as ""crumbling"" and says they have previously missed out on money to rebuild. The anti-selection campaign group Comprehensive Future, asked grammar schools how many pupil premium or free school meals children had been given places for the school year starting in September 2017. It was made as a Freedom of Information request, and the data, seen by the BBC, shows that 564 places were awarded to poorer pupils. Northern Ireland also has grammar schools but each part of the UK manages its budget and policy for schools separately. Additional reporting by Christine Jeavans, Wesley Stephenson and Katherine Smith. Correction 2 August 2018: An earlier version of this story reported that according to data gathered by Comprehensive Future, Colchester County High School for Girls did not admit a single pupil premium or free school meals pupil in the current school year. The school has contacted us to say that 10 such pupils were admitted in the current school year. We have amended the story to reflect this.

Mr Corbyn said he ""completely rejects"" the views of some people he had shared platforms with in the past. A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims How widespread is anti-Semitism in the UK? What's the difference between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism? It comes as an ally of the leader faces calls to quit the party's ruling body after criticising ""Trump fanatics"" in the Jewish community, and with the party facing criticism from Jewish leaders and some of its MPs over its new anti-Semitism code of conduct. Mr McDonnell said: ""None of us fail to appreciate, I suppose, the way this has upset people including ourselves. It really has shaken us to the core really, but we'll resolve it, we've got to."" Mr McDonnell said Jewish people were ""really suffering out there"", citing a ""massive increase in attacks"", graffiti daubed on cemeteries and security guards for Jewish schools. ""So we've got to resolve the issue within our party and then get out there to assist the Jewish community campaigning against anti-Semitism within our society overall,"" he added. The House of Commons event hosted by Mr Corbyn took place on Holocaust Memorial Day in 2010. Jewish Auschwitz survivor and anti-Zionist Hajo Meyer, who died in 2014 aged 90, compared Israeli policy to the Nazi regime. The Commons meeting came during a wider tour by Mr Meyer entitled ""Never again for anyone - Auschwitz to Gaza"". Jeremy Corbyn says he has sometimes shared platforms with people he disagrees with The Times said that Palestinian activist Haidar Eid also addressed the meeting, saying, ""the world was absolutely wrong to think that Nazism was defeated in 1945. Nazism has won because it has finally managed to Nazify the consciousness of its own victims"". Mr Corbyn said views were expressed which he did not ""accept or condone"". He added: ""In the past, in pursuit of justice for the Palestinian people and peace in Israel/Palestine, I have on occasion appeared on platforms with people whose views I completely reject. ""I apologise for the concerns and anxiety that this has caused."" By BBC political correspondent Ben Wright Prominent Jewish voices inside and outside Labour are furious that the leadership seems to claim a clearer idea about what constitutes anti-Semitism than they do. Neither the actions nor words of Jeremy Corbyn have managed to calm this argument down. And while the government struggles to keep its plan for Brexit on the road, Labour appears to be stuck in a cul-de-sac of blame and recrimination on how it's tackling anti-Semitism. Read more from Ben Wright A Labour MP has also called for an investigation into Mr Corbyn after a video of him praising the release of convicted terrorists from Hamas emerged. The Times shared the video,externalof the Labour leader who appeared on Iranian state TV in 2012. He referred to the terrorists as ""brothers"" and questioned whether there was a ""serious case"" against them. Joan Ryan, who represents Enfield North, has told the paper the interview was ""abhorrent"" and ""brings the Labour party into disrepute"". Joan Ryan says she is calling on her party to investigate Mr Corbyn's appearance on Iranian state TV Labour has facedcriticism over its new code of conducton anti-Semitism, which critics claim does not sign up fully to the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's working definition. Labour says it has included the full International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition but has rewritten four of the examples included to expand and contextualise them ""to produce legally robust guidelines that a political party can apply to disciplinary cases"". One of the examples changed was the IHRA's one saying: ""Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis."" Labour's code of conduct instead says: ""Discourse about international politics often employs metaphors drawn from examples of historic misconduct. It is not anti-Semitism to criticise the conduct or policies of the Israeli state by reference to such examples unless there is evidence of anti-Semitic intent. ""Shami Chakrabarti recommended that Labour members should resist the use of Hitler, Nazi and Holocaust metaphors, distortions and comparisons in debates about Israel-Palestine in particular. In this sensitive area, such language carries a strong risk of being regarded as prejudicial or grossly detrimental to the party."" Following the row, the party's MPs will vote in September on whether to adopt the full IHRA wording after passing an emergency motion last week. Labour MP John Mann, a long-standing critic of Mr Corbyn, toldBBC Radio 4 Todaythat hosting an event called ""Auschwitz to Gaza"" on Holocaust Memorial Day breached anti-Semitism rules and ""breaches any form of normal decency"". ""I've no idea how he got himself into that situation, but I'm glad that he has apologised and on the back of that apology is the opportunity to do something significant,"" he said. Ann Black, a member of Labour's National Executive Committee and a supporter of Mr Corbyn, urged him to follow the advice of shadow cabinet colleagues and adopt the working definition on anti-Semitism. She told Today that, if necessary, the party could add assurances that members were free to defend Palestinians or criticise the Israeli government. ""I don't think Jeremy Corbyn is in any way racist or anti-Semitic. I do believe he has the authority and the ability to break the current impasse,"" she said.

"There are more than 200,000 Freemasons in England and Wales under the United Grand Lodge of England Transgender women should be allowed to remain Freemasons if they joined as men, the largest UK lodge has said. Expelling masons for transitioning was ""unlawful discrimination"", the United Grand Lodge of England (UGLE) warned. Women who transition to become men should also be allowed to join, its new gender reassignment policy states. The guidance document says that a Freemason's gender reassignment should be ""treated with the utmost compassion and sensitivity"". Irrespective of gender identity, the UGLE's 200,000 members will still formally be referred to as ""brothers"", the document says. But informally they should be addressed ""by the name and title he/she has chosen"". It warns that using a mason's transition as a reason for excluding them from a men-only lodge would be ""unlawful discrimination and so could never constitute sufficient cause"". The document issued to 7,000 lodges across the country, says: ""If a Freemason who is a member of UGLE wishes to change gender and become a woman, we expect that the Freemason would receive the full support of their brethren."" This video can not be played The head of the Freemasons in England and Wales says he can't show the BBC the handshake. Freemasonry, known in popular culture for arcane rituals and secret handshakes, raises millions of pounds for charity and has some six million members worldwide. Famous Freemasons have included Sir Winston Churchill, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Rudyard Kipling and Oscar Wilde. Each lodge holds four official meetings a year to welcome new members, and the ceremonies' contents have always been a closely-guarded secret. Those now eligible to become a member of a male-only lodge include: Men A Freemason who joined as a man, but later underwent gender reassignment to become a woman A woman who underwent reassignment to become a man before applying to become a Freemason While women cannot join the UGLE, there are two female-only lodges, the Order of Women Freemasons (OWF) and the Honourable Fraternity of Ancient Freemasons (HFAF), which also refer to members as ""brothers"". There are about 4,700 female Freemasons in the UK. The document says that it does not ""impose binding rules"" and ""does not constitute legal advice"". But it adds: ""A Freemason who after initiation ceases to be a man does not cease to be a Freemason. ""We expect that Freemasons will act with compassion and sensitivity towards their fellow Freemasons."" The secret ceremonies and rituals of female Freemasons Freemasons explain the rituals and benefits of membership The United Grand Lodge of England said it wanted members to act with 'compassion and sensitivity' towards transgender masons A spokesman for the UGLE said: ""While there has been no general request for guidance on gender reassignment, questions on the subject are likely to become increasingly common in future, and now appears to be an opportune time to issue general guidance to our members."" In January the UGLE rejected a claim from the head of the Police Federation that Freemasons were blocking reforms and preventing women and minority groups from progressing David Staples, the lodge's chief executive,said the suggestion was ""laughable""and insisted Freemasons had a history of treating people ""as equals"".

"Caucher Birkar was born in Iran but now works at the University of Cambridge One of the most prestigious prizes in mathematics, the Fields Medal, has been handed out at a ceremony in Brazil. Caucher Birkar, Alessio Figalli and Peter Scholze, and Akshay Venkatesh are all honoured for major contributions to their respective areas in mathematics. Professor Birkar, a Kurd, came to the UK as a while studying in Tehran and applied for asylum. The University of Cambridge mathematician said he ""couldn't imagine that this would come true"". However, it emerged that the 14-carat gold medal given to Dr Birkar at the ceremony in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, had been stolen just minutes later. According to Brazil's TV Globo, he left the medal along with his wallet and phone in a briefcase on a table at the convention centre where the event was taking place. He alerted security staff when he noticed the case was missing and they later found the case, but the medal and wallet were not there. Caucher Birkar was born on a farm in Kurdistan Province, near the Iran-Iraq border, and was raised during the eight-year war between the two neighbouring countries that broke out in 1980. He told Quanta magazine,externalthat while growing up, his maths club in Tehran had pictures of Fields Medal winners lining the walls. ""I looked at them and said to myself, 'Will I ever meet one of these people?' At that time in Iran, I couldn't even know that I'd be able to go to the West,"" he said. While studying for his undergraduate degree at the University of Tehran, he travelled to the UK and sought political asylum there. He established a reputation within academia with his work on birational geometry and has previously won the prestigious Leverhulme Prize. The Fields Medals are awarded every four years to the most promising mathematicians under the age of 40. Each winner receives a C$15,000 ($11,500; Â£8,800) cash prize. Alessio Figalli, 34, was born in Rome but works at ETH Zurich, a science and technology university in Switzerland. He is an expert on calculus of variations and partial differential equations. ""This prize gives me so much joy,"" Professor Figallitold the Italian news agency Ansa,external. ""It is such a big thing that I'm struggling to believe that I have received it. ""It is a great stimulus for the future,"" he added. ""It will motivate me to work in my research fields to try to produce studies of a very high level"". The youngest of the four, Peter Scholze, who is 30, works at the University of Bonn. His research focuses on the intersection between number theory and geometry. He was widely tipped to win the prize ahead of the announcement. Prof Hairer, who was awarded the Fields Medal in 2014, says things can change ""instantly"" for winners The Australian Professor Venkatesh, 36, studies number theory and representation theory. Professor Martin Hairer, from Imperial College London, who was awarded the Fields Medal in 2014, said the award could be transformative for the winners. He told BBC News: ""As you can imagine, their status will instantly change from 'highly respected researcher in the area of XXX' to 'celebrity in the mathematics community'. In the short term, this will give them a level of exposure that mathematicians are typically not used to and they'll have to figure out how to deal with that. ""At a less ephemeral level, it makes them figureheads within mathematics for their area of research, so they will spend much more time communicating to a broader audience than what they are probably used to."" There have been 56 winners, thoughone of them - the Russian Grigori Perelman - declined the award in 2006,external. Dr Perelman was famously reclusive and shunned attention in favour of working on his favoured fields. Cedric Villani made a move into politics after winning the medal There has been onlyone woman winner - the Iranian Maryam Mirzakhani. A professor at Stanford University in the US,she died in 2017. CÃ©dric Villani made a move into politics after winning the prize in 2010. Last year, he became a National Assembly member in his native France for Emmanuel Macron's En Marche party. Martin Hairer added: ""At the end of the day, while some of the laureates have capitalised on their medal to initiate a change of career (CÃ©dric Villani comes to mind), most of them continue to produce outstanding research in their chosen area and, to a large extent, lead the same kind of life as any other highly successful mathematician."" At least two, and preferably four people, are always honoured in the award ceremony. The prize was inaugurated in 1932 at the request of Canadian mathematician John Charles Fields, who ran the 1924 Mathematics Congress in Toronto.

"Tens of thousands of lion's mane jellyfish inundated a single German beach Ninety people at a single beach in Germany were treated for jellyfish stings in just three days, amid a surge of the creatures in European waters. Regional newspaper Ostsee Zeitung said ""tens of thousands"" of lion's mane jellyfish washed ashore at the weekend. The lion's mane is the largest jellyfish species, and while its sting is rarely fatal it often requires medical attention. One of the 90 people affected had a severe allergic reaction. Jellyfish numbers have dropped since the weekend peak, but the relief may only be temporary. Germany's lifeguard association said only a few specimens had been counted on Tuesday. But jellyfish tend to drift on currents, meaning water temperatures or a change in the wind could wash them ashore in droves again. Sudden plagues of jellyfish have been spotted across Europe in recent weeks. Sweden's west coast has suddenly found itself home to the clinging jellyfish - a species that Swedish broadcaster SVT said had not been seen there in 88 years. The tiny creatures are barely a few centimetres in diameter, and were only discovered when a marine biologist investigated reports of bathers being stung in the waters off TjÃ¶rn. Are swarms of jellyfish taking over the ocean? Channel swimmer in 'jellyfish paranoia' Another swimmer in the same area, Tobias Karlsson, told Aftonbladet newspaper that an hour after his run-in with the jellyfish, he had trouble breathing and suffered from cramps. The same lion's mane jellyfish that plagued Germany's coast have been spotted in the waters around Britain and Ireland. Larger than usual numbers of jellyfish have been spotted off some French beaches, too. For several years, reports have emerged that jellyfish numbers have boomed leading to unbalanced ecosystems, damage to fish farms, and many more underfoot on the sand. Jellyfish surface in ""blooms"" that carpet the surface of the sea. They can appear in huge numbers, moving like a swarm - lending credence to the idea that their numbers are ever-growing. Nomura's Jellyfish gathered off the coast of Japan in 2009 - and were considered a major nuisance The popular explanation is that human activity has over-fished the creatures' predators and that pollution has de-oxygenated the water - which eliminates their competition. Warmer ocean waters are said to help them grow faster, too. It is not entirely clear. A 2012 paper examining the claims of a boom in ""gelatinous zooplankton species"",externalfound the data was inconsistent, and the idea that the ocean was filling up with them could not be backed up Another report, in 2013, declared ""a small linear increase in jellyfish since the 1970s"",external- but suggested that jellyfish breeding numbers just fluctuate up and down in decades-long cycles A 2016 paper then found bad citation in scientific papers stretching back years, which BBC Earth covered in depth at the time Some 10,000 species fall under the generic ""jellyfish"" name - and they don't all behave, breed, or bloom the same. Still, that hasn't stopped attempts to solve the problem. An EU project called GoJelly has been launched to take the ""annoying and even dangerous"" creatures and turn them into something useful. While their main project is creating a microplastic filter out of jellyfish mucus to clean the oceans, they also think jellyfish populations could be controlled if humans ate them. They plan a jellyfish cookbook, and promise that the finished foodstuffs won't taste bad - ""as long as the end product is no longer slimy"".

"Welfare payments are turning the clock back to the 1950s and allowing abusers to control family finances, MPs say. Under Universal Credit, payments are made to one person per household, often leaving abuse victims and their children dependent,a report,externalby the Work and Pensions Committee said. One abuse survivor said she feared the new system could leave her and her children with ""nothing for weeks"". The government said abuse support teams are on hand in every Jobcentre. The Universal Credit system, which has been rolling out across the UK since 2015, aims to simplify the benefits and tax credits system with a single monthly payment. Claimants typically provide details of one bank account for payments. The committee heard that they can request split payments, but Jobcentres are advised to only offer them in ""very exceptional circumstances"". What is universal credit? Universal Credit 'not value for money' Labour's Frank Field, the committee chairman, said: ""This is not the 1950s. Men and women work independently, pay taxes as individuals, and should each have an independent income. ""Not only does UC's single household payment bear no relation to the world of work, it is out of step with modern life and turns back the clock on decades of hard-won equality for women."" MPs heard evidence that people living with abuse can see their entire monthly income, including money meant for their children, go into their abusive partner's bank account. The report said that the single household payment made it harder for victims to leave and said ""there is a serious risk of Universal Credit increasing the powers of abusers"". One victim of financial abuse told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme that her ex-partner had exploited the child benefit system, filing claims while she was still in hospital after giving birth, and denying her access to funds. She said the government's approach with Universal Credit placed more women at risk of this ""psychological stranglehold"". ""They have no understanding about economic abuse, the control that is exerted,"" she said. ""We're keeping women in situations where we're risking their lives - that's not being overdramatic."" Conservative committee member Heidi Allen said Universal Credit was supposed to mirror the world of work, but no employer would pay wages into a partner's bank account. ""In the 21st Century women deserve to be treated as independent citizens, with their own aspirations, responsibilities and challenges,"" she said. The report said that the Department for Work and Pensions had a ""moral duty"" to ensure payments did not help abusers maintain their control. It called for a private room in every Jobcentre so people at risk of abuse could communicate with staff in confidence. Each centre should also have a domestic violence specialist who understands the warning signs and can advise other members of staff, the report said. Frontline workers told MPs that work coaches currently lack information about support for abuse victims. Scotland has said it wants to split Universal Credit payments by default, but it needs the DWP to change its IT system. The committee said the department should ""seize the opportunity"" to work with Scotland to test a new split payment system. Women's Aid chief executive Katie Ghose called on the government to implement the recommendations. ""The government needs to take a long, hard look at Universal Credit through the lens of a survivor of domestic abuse. Safety first should be the principle,"" she said. A government spokesman said that ""the vast majority"" of Jobcentres already had private interview facilities, and that alternative arrangements could be made in the others. Centres also have specialist teams who can support domestic abuse victims, he said. ""Tackling domestic abuse is something this government takes incredibly seriously,"" the spokesman said. ""Staff do everything they can to make sure people fleeing domestic abuse get the help they need as quickly as possible.""

"The council said a ""robust"" system would be retained to safeguard children and vulnerable adults A council facing ""unprecedented"" cuts is set to hold emergency talks, but has vowed to protect vulnerable people. Northamptonshire County Council needs to make drastic cutbacks in order to save Â£70m by next March. Its leader is proposing services are cut back to a ""core offer"" but said a ""robust"" system would be retained to safeguard children and vulnerable adults. The authority hasimposed emergency spending controlstwice in six months. An extraordinary meeting will be held on Wednesday, with the aim of discussing cuts which would see services stripped back to the legal minimum. Brian Roberts,one of two government-appointed commissionersoverseeing the council, said the authority's finances were in a ""truly perilous state"". Council leader Matthew Golby warned the authority has to decide what it can ""realistically provide"". He said they would ""safeguard all children and young people"" while ensuring a ""robust safeguarding system to protect vulnerable adults"". The ""core offer"" would also see the Conservative-led authority carry out ""sufficient maintenance"" of public highways and plan for school places, Mr Golby added. A council source told the BBC the scale of possible cuts was ""huge...completely unprecedented"". Prof Tony Travers, a local government expert at the London School of Economics, warned 15 to 20 councils were at risk of ending up in a similar position to Northamptonshire. ""It won't just be Northamptonshire, but they are the council that has got nearest to the precipice as it were so far,"" he said. Government commissioner Brian Roberts said the council needed to make ""difficult decisions"" Opposition Labour county councillor Danielle Stone said she was concerned cuts could hit support structures in children's services and ""threaten the stability of families"". A section 114 notice issued last week, severely curtailing spending at the council, followsthe issuing of the same notice in February. Prior to this, there had only been two issued in the UK since 1988. Mr Roberts said: ""To put itself on a secure financial footing very difficult decisions will need to be taken. It is clear the time for these decisions is now."" Meanwhile, the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy has warned that other authorities are facing similar pressures. Its chief executive, Rob Whiteman, has said more than 20 councils were ""similarly vulnerable to financial failure"". He told the BBC: ""All of local government is finding it hard at the moment. Northamptonshire is finding it particularly difficult because I'm afraid it's been badly led."" Northamptonshire County Council is the only authority so far to have formally declared itself at risk of spending more than the money it has available. However, the National Audit Office (NAO) haswarned as many as one in 10 larger local authorities in England with responsibility for social care,externalare draining their reserves and will have exhausted them completely in three years unless something changes. Another one in 10 would run out in five years. These reserves are sometimes seen as ""rainy day"" funds. They are there for unplanned expenses or planned one-off costs. They do not get topped back up again unless the council finds the money from somewhere else. The NAO found that between 2011-12 and 2016-17, a growing number of councils found themselves spending more than they expected to on social care and dipped into their reserves. Official government figures show that between 2015-16 and 2017-18, the amount of day-to-day spending funded by reserves and ""other items"" (including money transferred from other authorities or anything left over from previous years) increased to almost Â£2bn, equivalent to just over 2p in every Â£1 spent by local authorities. This is now expected to drop in 2018-19 to about Â£1.3bn, or 1.4p in every Â£1. The government has allowed councils responsible for social care to charge more in council tax to cover the increased cost of an ageing population. The NAO has warned councils cannot continue to rely on their reserves if they are struggling to make savings. ""A financial model based on dwindling reserves and difficulties in delivering savings is not financially sustainable over the medium term,"" it said. The Local Government Association (LGA) said the ""next Spending Review will be make or break for local services"". One of the councils facing similar financial pressures is Somerset County Council, which in May announcedplans to sell off seven farms to raise Â£8m. A Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesman said: ""It is essential residents are able to have faith in their council, particularly in the responsible use of taxpayers' money. ""The financial challenges facing the council are clearly serious and reinforce how important it was that we took swift action to appoint commissioners. ""These commissioners will continue to work closely with the council as it takes the necessary steps to rebalance its finances."" There have been many arguments about how Northamptonshire County Council got to this point. Many say underfunding by central government has played a part, buta report earlier this year by a government-appointed inspectorwas clear that problems are down to years of mismanagement by senior officers and councillors. It's left the authority in a situation no council has been in before. Today it will agree new priorities for the future that in effect leave it just fulfilling its legal obligations. We should then get more clarity on specific cuts in the coming weeks. But these are all stop-gap measures. The authority is expected to be replaced with a new, unitary council in 2020.

"Bournemouth School is bidding for money to expand There are 11,000 more grammar school pupils in England now than in 2010, BBC analysis of official data shows. And by 2021, the data suggests, the number of extra places created will be equivalent to 24 new grammar schools compared to eight years ago. The analysis shows a rise in numbers even before the distribution ofa new Â£50m growth fund, announced in May. The government says schools will be eligible for funding only if they improve access for poorer pupils. Grammar schools are state-funded secondary schools which allocate places to pupils on the basis of their performance in an extra academic test at the end of primary school. Prime Minister Theresa May had to drop controversial plans to overturn the ban on new schools after the last election, but the expansion of existing grammar schools has been encouraged. Green light for grammar expansion Do grammars boost social mobility? Reality check: Selective schools and social mobility More than 30 existing grammar schools are bidding for some of the first Â£50m slice of a new Â£200m government expansion fund. Schools bidding for the cash will have to show how they intend to admit more disadvantaged pupils. Using newly-published government data, the BBC has found that grammar schools have been continuing to grow, even before the distribution of those funds. If schools maintain their intake at current rates, the equivalent of eight extra schools will be added by 2021 compared with this year, and 24 more compared with 2010. This video can not be played Grammar schools: How do children cope when they don't make the grade? Grammar schools remain controversial because they take a big slice of the children already doing well at school, making it harder for neighbouring schools to get similarly good GCSE results. Some better-off parents invest heavily in paying for tutoring for the test, and overall very few pupils from poorer backgrounds have attended grammar schools in the past decade. So a key part of the debate in England about grammar schools has been whether they make an effort to give places to children from families on benefits or low earnings. If a child has received free school meals in the past six years, the school gets extra money called pupil premium funding. We looked at the admission policies of all 163 grammar schools in England for the school year 2018-19. You need a modern browser and a working internet connection to view the interactive content in this page. Source: BBC research and Department for Education pupil population data 2016-17 If you can't see the postcode search, taphere,external The number not giving any priority to poorer, pupil premium children has fallen from 90 to 61 since the current school year. Looking ahead to next year, 93 of England's 163 grammar schools have a priority policy of some kind. A further nine will only use pupil premium status as a tiebreaker to decide between two children with the same test score. If a school uses results from the top test score down it may never need to use the tiebreaker, and children who have been tutored, or come from better-off homes, may get most of the places. Prof Anna Vignoles, from Cambridge University, says quotas are a better way of getting more poorer pupils into grammar schools as they set a lower bar for those pupils. ""Tiebreakers are less effective, and the reason is you are still admitting pupils on the basis of their test score and on average, poorer students have lower scores. ""So what you are doing is ranking students on their test score and the richest students will be at the top, and you rarely get to use your tiebreaker."" More than 30 grammar schools are bidding for a share of the first wave of expansion cash. The government says those schools asking for money need to show how they will make sure more disadvantaged children get places, through measures such as a lower test mark or a quota of places. A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""Any good school - whether it is a comprehensive, academy or selective school - is able to expand if there is a need and a parental demand. By 2020 this government will have created a million new school places, so it's no surprise that grammars, some of the highest performing schools in the country, are part of that. ""The criteria for grants from the Selective School Expansion Fund is clear. If applicants cannot show how they will increase access, they will not be eligible for funding."" Schools willing to ask for some of the money as a loan will also win points that could help their bid. Heath Monk is the executive director of the King Edward VI group of schools in Birmingham. ""There is a real opportunity to use the fund to leverage more fair access, but that's clouded by the financial considerations. ""The question is whether if you have weaker fair access plans, could those bids get through because of a willingness of the school to borrow more?"" Grammar school success 'down to privilege' How parent power boosts grammars Four of the schools bidding do not have any policy in place for this year or next to give poorer children priority. These are Chislehurst and Sidcup, Highworth, and Wilmington, all in Kent and Westcliff grammar school in Essex. Some, like the highly oversubscribed Colchester County High School for Girls, and Tiffin school in Kingston-upon-Thames, only use pupil premium to decide as a tiebreaker. Others, like Bournemouth grammar school have already made very radical changes to make their admissions policy more inclusive. Next year, all pupil premium children passing the test will be awarded places first regardless of where they live, followed by other local children from Bournemouth and parts of Christchurch. ""I think we're going back to why grammar schools were established, to serve the most able children no matter what their background,"" says head teacher Dorian Lewis. He says changes made already in admissions have more than doubled the proportion of pupils on free school meals from 3% to 7%. He describes the school buildings as ""crumbling"" and says they have previously missed out on money to rebuild. The anti-selection campaign group Comprehensive Future, asked grammar schools how many pupil premium or free school meals children had been given places for the school year starting in September 2017. It was made as a Freedom of Information request, and the data, seen by the BBC, shows that 564 places were awarded to poorer pupils. Northern Ireland also has grammar schools but each part of the UK manages its budget and policy for schools separately. Additional reporting by Christine Jeavans, Wesley Stephenson and Katherine Smith. Correction 2 August 2018: An earlier version of this story reported that according to data gathered by Comprehensive Future, Colchester County High School for Girls did not admit a single pupil premium or free school meals pupil in the current school year. The school has contacted us to say that 10 such pupils were admitted in the current school year. We have amended the story to reflect this.

"This video can not be played BBC captures footage of post-election violence in Harare Three people were killed in Zimbabwe's capital Harare after troops opened fire on rioting opposition supporters, police say. The government says the army was deployed in central Harare to help police restore order. The opposition MDC Alliance condemned the crackdown, saying it was  a reminder of the ""dark days"" of Robert Mugabe's rule. It alleges that the governing Zanu-PF party has rigged Monday's elections. Zimbabwe violence: As it happened Harare chaos in pictures Parliamentary results show Zanu-PF heading for a big majority in the first elections since long-serving ruler Mr Mugabe was ousted from power. The presidential result has yet to be declared. However, the MDC Alliance insists that its presidential candidate, Nelson Chamisa, won Monday's election. European Union monitors have expressed concern over the length of time it is taking to declare the presidential result. President Emmerson Mnangagwa was quoted by state broadcaster ZBC as saying: ""We hold the opposition MDC Alliance and its whole leadership responsible for this disturbance of national peace, which was meant to disrupt the electoral process.""

Justice Minister Ziyambi Ziyambi said the army had been deployed in Harare to disperse a violent crowd and to restore ""peace and tranquillity"". He added: ""The presence of the army is not to intimidate people but to ensure that law and order is maintained. They are there to assist the police."" A spokesman for Mr Chamisa condemned the deployment of soldiers and the subsequent loss of life. ""Soldiers are trained to kill during war. Are civilians enemies of the state?"" he asked. ""There is no explanation whatsoever for the brutality that we saw today."" Correspondents say the violence was confined to the centre of Harare - an opposition stronghold - while other parts of the country remain calm. Latest reports from the capital suggest the security forces are in control of the streets. By Pumza Fihlani, BBC News, Harare Army vehicles and police trucks rolled into Zimbabwe's main city on Wednesday after the wait for the election results took an ugly turn. MDC Alliance supporters had been gathering in various parts of Harare since the morning, but when news came that Zanu-PF had won the majority of seats in parliament and that the presidential results were not ready, the previously upbeat mood changed. Opposition supporters went on the rampage down Harare's busy streets, heading towards an old Zanu-PF office and carrying large stones, sticks and anything else they could grab along the way. The crowd chanted: ""We want Chamisa."" They believe the election has been stolen, and are demanding the MDC be announced as the winner. Riot police using water cannon and tear gas arrived to a chaotic scene of burning tyres and an unrelenting crowd. There were hundreds of them. They jeered and pelted the police vans with stones. In another part of the city where more opposition protesters had gathered, the army used whips to disperse them. Today's clashes may not have been on the scale of the ""days of old"", where intimidation by security police was the order of the day, but it's certainly not the peace many had been praising until now. Something has changed here. The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (Zec) has announced 140 seats for Zanu-PF so far, and 58 for the MDC Alliance, ZBC state media reported. There are 210 seats in the National Assembly's lower house. More than five million people were registered to vote, and there was a high turnout of 70%. ZBC had reported that the electoral commission would announce the presidential results at 12:30 local time (10:30 GMT) on Wednesday, but only parliamentary results were read out. The BBC's Shingai Nyoka reports that the announcement on the presidential poll was not made because representatives of some of the 23 candidates had failed to turn up to verify the results. A presidential candidate needs more than 50% of the vote to win outright. Otherwise, a run-off election will be held on 8 September. The EU mission has criticised the delay in announcing the presidential results. Zec has until Saturday to do so. The electoral commission says 70% of registered voters took part in the election It said it had observed several problems, including media bias, voter intimidation and mistrust in the electoral commission, adding that there was an ""improved political climate, but un-level playing field and lack of trust"". This is the first time in 16 years that the government has allowed EU and US election monitors into the country. The African Union mission has said the elections ""took place in a very peaceful environment"" and ""were highly competitive"". It added that it could not confirm opposition parties' complaints of vote-buying, intimidation by the state and bias by traditional leaders. A preliminary report by the Southern African Development Community (Sadc) observers said the elections were largely peaceful and conducted in accordance with the law.

By Pumza Fihlani, BBC News, Harare Watching the results trickling in from the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (Zec) in the early hours, it became apparent that the ruling Zanu-PF would have a majority in parliament. Races in some constituencies were so close that they could have gone to the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), had it not been split between Nelson Chamisa's MDC Alliance and Thokozani Khupe's MDC-T. The MDC broke into factions after the death in February of its veteran leader Morgan Tsvangirai as his deputies battled over who his successor should be. In the polls that split showed.  It is a lesson for the opposition that in future they should not lose sight of the bigger prize. Zimbabwe's main opposition has said Mr Chamisa won the presidential election, sparking street celebrations by supporters on Tuesday. The MDC Alliance said the ruling Zanu-PF party was attempting to rig the vote to allow President Mnangagwa to win, and the delay in releasing official results was unacceptable. Opposition supporters celebrated in Harare on Tuesday, believing Mr Chamisa had won MDC Alliance's Tendai Biti said there was a clear attempt by Zanu-PF  to interfere ""with the people's will"" and warned the party not to ""plunge Zimbabwe into chaos"". However, Douglas Mwonzora, a top MDC Alliance official, told the BBC's Andrew Harding that the endorsement on Sunday of their candidate by Mr Mugabe had cost the party votes. He also alleged that the ruling party had bribed voters in rural areas. A Zanu-PF spokesman dismissed the opposition's allegations of interference, telling the BBC he had ""no clue"" what Mr Biti was talking about.

"Officers at the pre-raid briefing Homes and businesses have been raided in Glasgow as part of a major crackdown on ""industrial scale"" benefit fraud. Police said Operation Arnos, which targeted addresses in Govanhill, led to 16 arrests and the seizure of over 200 productions from a business. More than 100 officers were joined by staff from the Department of Work and Pensions, HM Revenue & Customs and Home Office Immigration Enforcement. An organised crime group is behind the fraud, which could be as much as Â£4.6m. Police said the first phase targeted members of the crime gang while the second focused on the facilitators. The force confirmed 14 individuals were arrested on suspicion of benefit fraud, mortgage fraud and money laundering. A woman was arrested on warrant and a man was arrested in connection with a cannabis cultivation, which included several hundred plants with a potential street value of about Â£200,000. Fraudulent documentation was also recovered from a vehicle which had been used as a mobile office. Assistant Chief Constable Gillian MacDonald said the problem was on an ""industrial scale"" Assistant Chief Constable Gillian MacDonald said the offensive has been planned since late last year. She said: ""Today's operation is the largest of its kind since Police Scotland came into being. ""Quite simply it is targeting organised crime in one of our local communities here in Govanhill. ""What we are dealing with today is an almost industrial scale benefit fraud, an attack on the UK benefits system by an organised crime group."" Assistant Chief Constable MacDonald said the group had been active for some time. She added: ""This gang has been operating in and around Govanhill using local premises and a mobile office to carry out a variety of crimes, which are undoubtedly impacting on the local community. ""People have been claiming benefits to which they are not entitled and using false IDs but this activity has been orchestrated by individuals who are reaping millions of pounds from the benefits system while also claiming benefits themselves. ""We fully expect there will be more arrests as a result of this operation over the coming weeks and months."" Officers are also looking for evidence of people trafficking and illegal immigration. A total of 37 premises were visited on Wednesday and a number searched. The haul of more than 200 productions from a business in Govanhill included documentation and electronic devices. Officers attended a number of addresses intending to speak to residents claiming housing benefit but several had clearly been empty for a prolonged period. To date about Â£1.5m of fraudulent benefit claims have already been stopped Bob Gallacher, senior investigations leader at the DWP, warned this type of criminality is occurring in cities throughout the UK. And Joe Hendry, assistant director of HMRC's Fraud Investigation Service, said: ""This is suspected benefit fraud on a massive scale. ""Benefit fraud is theft - it takes taxpayers' money from our vital public services and puts it into the pockets of criminals. ""We will continue working with our partners to investigate and stop these offences.""

"Tens of thousands of lion's mane jellyfish inundated a single German beach Ninety people at a single beach in Germany were treated for jellyfish stings in just three days, amid a surge of the creatures in European waters. Regional newspaper Ostsee Zeitung said ""tens of thousands"" of lion's mane jellyfish washed ashore at the weekend. The lion's mane is the largest jellyfish species, and while its sting is rarely fatal it often requires medical attention. One of the 90 people affected had a severe allergic reaction. Jellyfish numbers have dropped since the weekend peak, but the relief may only be temporary. Germany's lifeguard association said only a few specimens had been counted on Tuesday. But jellyfish tend to drift on currents, meaning water temperatures or a change in the wind could wash them ashore in droves again. Sudden plagues of jellyfish have been spotted across Europe in recent weeks. Sweden's west coast has suddenly found itself home to the clinging jellyfish - a species that Swedish broadcaster SVT said had not been seen there in 88 years. The tiny creatures are barely a few centimetres in diameter, and were only discovered when a marine biologist investigated reports of bathers being stung in the waters off TjÃ¶rn. Are swarms of jellyfish taking over the ocean? Channel swimmer in 'jellyfish paranoia' Another swimmer in the same area, Tobias Karlsson, told Aftonbladet newspaper that an hour after his run-in with the jellyfish, he had trouble breathing and suffered from cramps. The same lion's mane jellyfish that plagued Germany's coast have been spotted in the waters around Britain and Ireland. Larger than usual numbers of jellyfish have been spotted off some French beaches, too. For several years, reports have emerged that jellyfish numbers have boomed leading to unbalanced ecosystems, damage to fish farms, and many more underfoot on the sand. Jellyfish surface in ""blooms"" that carpet the surface of the sea. They can appear in huge numbers, moving like a swarm - lending credence to the idea that their numbers are ever-growing. Nomura's Jellyfish gathered off the coast of Japan in 2009 - and were considered a major nuisance The popular explanation is that human activity has over-fished the creatures' predators and that pollution has de-oxygenated the water - which eliminates their competition. Warmer ocean waters are said to help them grow faster, too. It is not entirely clear. A 2012 paper examining the claims of a boom in ""gelatinous zooplankton species"",externalfound the data was inconsistent, and the idea that the ocean was filling up with them could not be backed up Another report, in 2013, declared ""a small linear increase in jellyfish since the 1970s"",external- but suggested that jellyfish breeding numbers just fluctuate up and down in decades-long cycles A 2016 paper then found bad citation in scientific papers stretching back years, which BBC Earth covered in depth at the time Some 10,000 species fall under the generic ""jellyfish"" name - and they don't all behave, breed, or bloom the same. Still, that hasn't stopped attempts to solve the problem. An EU project called GoJelly has been launched to take the ""annoying and even dangerous"" creatures and turn them into something useful. While their main project is creating a microplastic filter out of jellyfish mucus to clean the oceans, they also think jellyfish populations could be controlled if humans ate them. They plan a jellyfish cookbook, and promise that the finished foodstuffs won't taste bad - ""as long as the end product is no longer slimy"".

"Labour's Jeremy Corbyn has apologised for appearing on platforms with people whose views he ""completely rejects"". Mr Corbyn's statement was in response tothe Times reporting,externalthat he hosted an event in 2010 at which a Holocaust survivor compared Israel to Nazism. Hajo Meyer's House of Commons talk was entitled 'The Misuse of the Holocaust for Political Purposes'. Labour MP Louise Ellman told BBC Newsnight she was ""absolutely appalled"" to hear about Mr Corbyn's involvement. The Labour leader's apology comes after one of his supporters in the party's National Executive Committee suggested that Jewish ""Trump fanatics"" were behind accusations of anti-Semitism in Labour ranks.

What's the difference between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism? At the event, which happened on Holocaust Memorial Day 2010, Jewish Auschwitz survivor and anti-Zionist Hajo Meyer, who died in 2014 aged 90, compared Israeli policy to the Nazi regime. The Commons meeting came during a tour by Mr Meyer entitled 'Never again for anyone - Auschwitz to Gaza'. The Times said that Palestinian activist Haidar Eid also addressed the meeting, saying: ""The world was absolutely wrong to think that Nazism was defeated in 1945. ""Nazism has won because it has finally managed to Nazify the consciousness of its own victims."" Mr Corbyn said views were expressed which he did not ""accept or condone"". He added: ""In the past, in pursuit of justice for the Palestinian people and peace in Israel/Palestine, I have on occasion appeared on platforms with people whose views I completely reject. ""I apologise for the concerns and anxiety that this has caused."" By BBC political correspondent Ben Wright Prominent Jewish voices inside and outside Labour are furious that the leadership seems to claim a clearer idea about what constitutes anti-Semitism than they do.

"The environment secretary, Michael Gove, has promised support for farmers hit by the impact of the dry weather. Following a drought summit with the National Farmers' Union (NFU), he said the government would do ""whatever it takes"" to maintain food supplies. The NFU had requested relief from the ""crippling impact"" of the heatwave, including the relaxation of rules over accessing additional water supplies. Mr Gove promised to remove bureaucracy where it was hindering farmers. ""We will make sure farmers have what they need in order to provide us with high-quality food and ensure their businesses survive,"" he said. The record summer heatwave has put huge pressure on farmers. Meat and milk producers, salad, fruit and vegetable growers, have said harvests and yields are being severely affected by some of the driest months since 1961. Heavy rain in recent days has given farmers some relief, but the NFU was still ""seeking urgent action"" to help farmers. UK heatwave 2018: The winners and losers Heatwave threatens shortage of peas Lettuce shortage 'imminent' NFU President Minette Batters said: ""Today's summit was a wake-up call to government and policy makers about the importance of British food production and the critical need to manage the volatility that comes with it. She welcomed Mr Gove's pledge to support the sector. At the meeting she had sought more flexibility for farmers who want to take water from rivers, or have increased access to the public supply water when there is spare capacity in the system. The Environment Agency, the government body which oversees water use,said farmers would be allowed some short-term flexibility,externalwithin their water abstraction licences. ""We must also balance farmers' needs with those of wildlife and other water users so we will only allow these arrangements where we are satisfied there won't be any adverse effects on the environment,"" said Paul Hickey, the EA's head of water resources. Dairy farmer Abi Reader has already sent four milking cows to slaughter and she's planning to send four more as the cost of feeding them soars. For livestock farmers like her the lack of rain means animals can't just be put out to pasture as usual. Near Cardiff in Wales, where Abi Reader farms her 180-strong milking herd, grass is usually green and lush throughout the summer, she says, but the heat has dried it to a crisp yellow. It's costing her Â£210 a day to keep them fed using silage and hay. ""We're breaking into winter stocks, that's the frightening thing,"" she says. It doesn't make economic sense to feed so many. So they're ""shedding passengers"" - cutting down the number of mouths by sending cows to slaughter that would in better circumstances have continued milking. Two were cows that aborted calves due to the stress of the hot weather. ""We've lost a lot of money on them. The cheapest option is get rid of them and cut our losses,"" she says. In April Abi Reader's fields were ""green and lush"" she says By July the fields were dry and not providing enough nutrients for her herd Ms Reader says she's not the only farmer taking this course of action. It was hard to find a slot for them in abattoir, she says. John O'Farrell, who runs an abattoir in Camarthenshire, Wales, says many farmers are culling animals earlier than they would normally, following a bad grass growing season due to the harsh weather in March, which delayed the start of outdoor grazing, followed by the heatwave. ""Our volume of work is considerably higher than we would expect at this time of year,"" he told BBC Radio Four's Farming Today programme. ""Farmers are taking the view if the animals are to be culled it's best to cull early."" The same factors are having an impact on beef and sheep herds too, according to Nick Allen from the British Meat Processors Association. ""The first thing we noticed was people sending lambs in for slaughter at slightly lighter weights than normal,"" he says. ""The moment they're running out of grass on the farm they get rid of them earlier."" He says if farmers go into winter short of feed and relying on expensive concentrates it will push up costs and could result in lower overall production of UK meat and milk. ""It could translate into meat being in shorter supply and prices having to go up because the cost of production is going to have to go up, without a shadow of a doubt,"" he added.

Two priceless crowns and an orb belonging to a 17th Century king and queen were taken at around midday on Tuesday in StrÃ¤ngnÃ¤s, near Stockholm. Witnesses said they saw two men running from the cathedral, which was open to the public and hosting a lunch fair. They were seen motoring off into Lake Malaren, and have not been seen since. Police have launched a huge search operation, but currently have no suspects. ""It's 1-0 to them right now,"" police spokesperson Thomas Agnevik told Swedish media. ""It is not possible to put an economic value on this, it is invaluable items of national interest."" Jewellery thefts that shocked the world Texas thieves kidnap shark in baby's pram Crown jewels hidden in biscuit tin in WW2 The royal jewels are adorned with gold, precious stones and pearls, and come from the 1611 funeral regalia of Sweden's Charles IX and Kristina the Elder. A witness, who is getting married in the StrÃ¤ngnÃ¤s Cathedral next week, told local news channel Aftonbladet he contacted the police. ""I knew immediately they were burglars because of the way they were behaving,"" Tom Rowell said. ""It's despicable that people would steal from a holy building and a historical building."" Mr Agnevik said that the crown jewels would have been kept in locked and alarmed glass displays that the thieves would have had to break into.

"This video can not be played Lorenzo Nunez described a ""strong explosion"" moments after take off A passenger plane has crashed in the capital of Mexico's Durango state, just moments after take-off. All 103 passengers and crew on board the AeromÃ©xico flight survived the crash but 97 of them are injured. State Governor JosÃ© Rosas Aispuro said the plane was hit by a gust of wind which caused a sudden descent. Its left wing then touched the ground and two engines broke off. Most of the passengers were able to walk away before it caught fire. How likely are you to survive a plane crash? AeromÃ©xico flight AM2431 was flying from Guadalupe Victoria International Airport in Durango to Mexico City when it crashed at around 16:00 local time (21:00 GMT). Initial reports spoke of 97 passengers and four crew, but Governor Rosas said that two children were also on board - bringing the total to 103. The plane's pilot is one of two who were seriously injured. He needed an operation on his spine but is reportedly in a stable condition. A young girl sustained burns. Many other passengers had only ""very light"" injuries, officials said. Ramin Parsa told the BBC that ""shortly after the plane took off, I knew something was wrong. The plane began to shake,"" he recalled. He said the plane hit the ground and ""started bouncing, shaking and sliding"" until it hit some trees and finally stopped when it fell into a ditch. ""All the lights went off and then there was smoke inside the cabin, people were panicking and screaming."" Mr Parsa said it was ""a miracle of God that we survived"". The fire spread through the aircraft after the crash Passenger Jacqueline Flores described the moment she and her daughter escaped the plane. ""I think we fell back on the runway because it was a hard surface, then we skidded on the ground until it stopped,"" the 47-year-old told the Agence France Press news agency. ""I undid my seatbelt and saw flames, and realised we had to jump. There was a hole right next to us where the plane had broken up. I told my girl, 'We have to jump over here', and we jumped,"" she added. A local politician on board the flight, RÃ³mulo Campuzano, said he had been ""very lucky because I was able to get out by the main door"". He said the door had been torn off and was lying next to the plane ""acting as a ramp"". ""I walked away from the plane, turning around to see if the other passengers were getting out, too. It started raining very hard and I think that helped put out the flames,"" he said. Governor Rosas said the crew were able to deploy the evacuation slides shortly after the crash, allowing those still on board to leave the plane safely before the flames spread. Most of the injured were released quickly and able to get home with a little help The airline AeromÃ©xico has a good safety record, according to local media. Its last deadly accident was in 1981, when 32 people were killed when an AeromÃ©xico plane crashed on landing in northern Chihuahua state. The airport operator, Grupo Aeroportuario Centro Norte, said early data suggested bad weather was the cause, and that the plane had taken off during a heavy hailstorm before being forced to attempt an emergency landing. One passenger said the plane had been hit by lightning. The plane crashed shortly after take-off In a statement,AeromÃ©xico said they ""deeply regret"" the accident,external, while Brazilian plane company Embraer said it had sent a team to the crash site.

"The regular members of the cast of Monty Python's Flying Circus, John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Terry Jones, Eric Idle and Michael Palin Unseen sketches from Monty Python have been discovered in Michael Palin's archives. He gave the material to the British Library in 2017 and after examination they were found to contain several unused script ideas. These included Wild West bookshop and ""amorous Pink Knight"" storylines cut from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. According to The Times,external, the sketches will go on display to the public at the British Library later this month. More than 50 notebooks containing notes on two Pythons films - Holy Grail and Life Of Brian - will also be part of the exhibition. They show how much both the films changed throughout the drafting process, as controversial material was cut to prevent causing offence to the viewing public. 'The Beatles of comedy' The sketches also reveal how Holy Grail was meant to have a different ending, whilst the film about King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table was also set to feature a Wild West saloon scene. The final performance of Monty Python Live was at the O2 in 2014 It sees a man appear from the desert, in need of a beer, only to find out the Wild West saloon is actually bookshop. ""The last bookshop before you get to Mexico,"" the bookseller says. The selection of items showcase Palin's creative life over a timespan of more than 20 years - from 1965 to 1987. Palin, Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle and Terry Jones last produced a film in 1983. The 75-year-old writer, actor and comedian gave his blessing for sketches to be reproduced and put on display and says he can't think why some of them weren't used. ""The Holy Grail took shape gradually and at the beginning it had far more ideas in it than ended up on screen because you had to have a narrative. In the end the story of the knights was strong enough,"" he said. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

"This video can not be played Tommy Robinson: 'All the mainstream media do is lie' Former English Defence League (EDL) leader Tommy Robinson has been released on bail after winning an appeal against a contempt of court finding. The 35-year-old admitted the charge and was jailed in May for filming outside Leeds Crown Court during a trial. At the Court of Appeal, Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett ruled the case be reheard after identifying technical and other failings. Robinson's solicitors said everyone has the ""right to a fair hearing"". The far-right activist, from Luton, was not present for the ruling in London and was released from his 13-month sentence being served at Onley Prison, near Rugby just before 15:30 BST. Speaking to reporters, Robinson said: ""All the British media do is lie. I have a lot to say but nothing to you. ""I want to thank the British public for all their support."" Tommy Robinson supporters and protesters gathered outside The Royal Courts of Justice In his written judgement, Lord Burnett said: ""We are satisfied that the finding of contempt made in Leeds following a fundamentally flawed process, in what we recognise were difficult and unusual circumstances, cannot stand. ""We will direct that the matter be reheard before a different judge."" Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley Lennon, will attend the Old Bailey for the hearing, conducted by the Recorder of London, ""as soon as reasonably possible"". This morning, the Lord Chief Justice's ruling in Robinson's appeal underlined that the rule of law - the rules that apply to us all - must be applied fairly in all circumstances. And that's why the Court of Appeal ruled that Robinson's second conviction in a year for contempt of court was flawed. In essence, the five hours from arrest to sentence at Leeds Crown Court was rushed. Robinson wasn't told what specific parts of his activity at the court had been potentially prejudicial to a jury - meaning nobody to this day knows exactly what he did wrong. Further, he immediately removed the offending video from Facebook on the court's order and the judge should have then adjourned the matter to give him longer to prepare a defence. Tommy Robinson is still convicted of contempt in relation to his behaviour at Canterbury last year where he received his three month sentence for potentially derailing a fair trial. Today, the Court of Appeal said that very same right to a fair hearing means Robinson should have a full opportunity to put his case without rushing to judge. The case that brought Robinson to Leeds related to grooming and the second of three trials involving 28 men. The third trial is due to start in September. Footage, filmed by Robinson on a mobile phone and broadcast on social media, saw him discussing the criminal trial that was subject to reporting restrictions. The video, lasting about an hour-and-a-half, was watched 250,000 times within hours of being posted as a Facebook Live. Tommy Robinson founded the English Defence League in 2009 but quit the group in 2013 A statement from Robinson's solicitors said: ""The rule of law and right to a fair hearing are fundamental to every individual and this ruling is an example of the safeguards of our system. ""What makes the British system so unique is the ability to set aside personal feelings and deal with the law and each case on its merits."" More stories from Yorkshire Robinson had challenged two contempt of court findings but Lord Burnett said a suspended sentence he was given relating to a trial in Canterbury in May 2017 should stand. He was given 10 months for contempt of court in Leeds and a further three months for breaching the suspended sentence handed to him in Canterbury. Contempt of court laws are designed to protect the rule of law, ensure fair trials - and avoid trial by media. Contempt can be committed by a broad range of people and organisations including the press, jurors, and social media users. The maximum sentence for contempt of court is two years' imprisonment, but it can also be punished with a fine. The law on contempt is set out in case law and the 1981 Contempt of Court Act. Key areas that amount to contempt include: Publishing anything that creates a substantial risk of seriously prejudicing ""active"" criminal proceedings Bringing into a court building a device for recording sound Taking photographs or film in a court building is capable of being a contempt of court. Breaching a court order or undertakings given to the court can also amount to contempt. Robinson attended Canterbury Crown Court during a rape trial of four men and filmed on the steps of the court and inside the building while the jury was considering its verdicts. At an earlier hearing, Robinson's QC argued that procedural ""deficiencies"" had caused ""prejudice"" in Leeds. Lord Burnett said the judge should not have commenced contempt proceedings the same day he was arrested. He explained ""no particulars of the contempt were formulated or put to the appellant"", and there was ""a muddle over the nature of the contempt being considered"". Tommy Robinson had been serving a 13-month sentence at Onley Prison, near Rugby Robinson's bail conditions order that he does not ""approach within 400m (0.2 miles) of Leeds Crown Court"". His lawyers had argued that a rehearing was not necessary due to the length of time he served in prison. But the Court of Appeal said the ""alleged contempt was serious"" and the sentence might be longer than that already served. Rival groups of Robinson supporters and ""Stand Up To Racism"" protesters had gathered outside the Royal Courts of Justice and swapped chants. Both groups of about 30 people were outnumbered by watching police. BBC White House reporter, Tara McKelvey, said his case has generated ""a united front among nationalists"" from across the Atlantic, with Robinson gaining support from the likes of Steve Bannon and Donald Trump Junior. Born in 1982, Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, describes himself as ""a working-class man from Luton"". Aged 20, he joined the far-right British National Party but soon left saying ""it was not for me"" In 2009 he set up the English Defence League (EDL) - an organisation set up to counter what its members saw as the threat of Islamist extremism The EDL organised street marches and demonstrations which often clashed with anti-racism campaigners He married in 2011 and is the father of three children He left the EDL in 2013 expressing concern that he no longer felt he could keep extremist elements within the organisation at bay In 2015, he joined demonstrations with the German anti-immigration group Pegida, Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West, and announced the founding of the British chapter In 2017, he started contributing to Canadian-based far-right political commentary site The Rebel Media 'All the mainstream media do is lie' Video, 00:00:34'All the mainstream media do is lie' Court of Appeal 'Bradford has borne the brunt of austerity policies - with devastating consequences' Council to sell Lord Mayorâs number plate with hope of raising more than Â£500,000 'Robbie Williams' to play at Calderdale indie cinema's showing of new biopic One of Halifax's best-loved restaurants announces new premises and bar Leeds man and teenager to appear in court charged with violent disorder and arson following Harehills disorder Director of Yorkshire firms given nine-year ban for âscheme designed to undermine the insolvency systemâ Hollywood Hills in flames amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

"Labour's leadership is beset by claims of anti-Semitism among members and accusations it hasn't done enough to stop the problem. What is all this doing to the party and its standing? For more than two years, the Labour Party has been mired in a row about the extent of anti-Semitism within its ranks. There have been suspensions, inquiries, bitter internal rows and promises to tackle the issue from the top of the party. But the subject is as toxic as ever. Earlier this month, the UK's three main Jewish newspapers all carried thesame front page under the headline ""United we stand"",claiming Jeremy Corbyn posed an ""existential threat"" to Jewish life in Britain. Tom Watson calls NEC member a 'loud-mouthed bully' Jewish newspapers unite against Labour 'threat' How widespread is anti-Semitism in the UK? Two Labour MPs with Jewish family backgrounds, Margaret Hodge and Ian Austin, face disciplinary inquiries after separately berating the party leadership over its policy for dealing with anti-Semitism - in particular, the decision of Labour's ruling National Executive Committee not to adopt in full the list of anti-Semiticexamples as defined by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance(IHRA). The leadership insists it has adopted the definitions of anti-Semitism in a way that also allows people to criticise the actions of Israel. But following strong complaints by a number of Labour figures, the party's MPs will now get a chance to show their support for the full IHRA definition when they return to Westminster in September. The latest evidence of Labour's failure to close this row down is a recording of Peter Willsman, a long-standing ally of Mr Corbyn on the NEC, berating some members of the Jewish community for being ""Trump fanatics"" and questioning where the evidence is of widespread anti-Semitism within the party. Mr Willsman apologised before this recording came to light. If you dip into the raucous maelstrom that characterises conversation between some Labour supporters online, you will find supporters of Mr Willsman. There are activists within Labour who see the focus on anti-Semitism within the party as a means of smearing Mr Corbyn by right-wing Blairites, supporters of Israel and critics within the mainstream media (including the BBC). There are many who strongly argue anti-Semitism in the Labour Party is not widespread. But for other supporters of Mr Corbyn, Mr Willsman's remarks were beyond the pale. The Labour-supporting musician Billy Bragg said Mr Willsman could not deal with the problem of anti-Semitism within the party if he didn't think it existed. Several high-profile Corbyn supporters took to Twitter to say Mr Willsman should withdraw from the NEC elections, which he is contesting on Momentum's slate. One of those, the journalist Owen Jones, said anti-Semitism did exist on the fringe of the left but the issue was also being used to smear Mr Corbyn. Both statements, he insisted, could be true. Margaret Hodge criticised Jeremy Corbyn's handling of the issue In its response to Mr Willsman's outburst, Labour said it was committed to tackling and eradicating anti-Semitism in all its forms. But the fact is, after two years, relations between Britain's Jewish communities and the party are at a historical low. Prominent Jewish voices inside and outside Labour are furious that the leadership seems to claim a clearer idea about what constitutes anti-Semitism than they do. Neither the actions or words of Jeremy Corbyn have managed to calm this argument down. And while the government struggles to keep its plan for Brexit on the road, Labour appears to be stuck in a cul-de-sac of blame and recrimination on how it's tackling anti-Semitism.

"This video can not be played Listen: Norman Smith on what Willsman said and why it matters Labour is facing growing calls to take action against an ally of Jeremy Corbyn after he was recorded criticising members of the Jewish community. During a meeting of the ruling National Executive Committee, Peter Willsman suggested Jewish ""Trump fanatics"" were behind accusations of anti-Semitism in Labour ranks. Mr Willsman also said he had never seen anti-Semitism in the party. He has apologised and said not all his remarks were accurately reported. He also said he would be referring himself for equalities training. What's the anti-Semitism row doing to Labour? How widespread is anti-Semitism in the UK? Councillor suspended in anti-Semitism row Jewish newspapers unite against Labour But Marie van der Zyl, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews said he should be ""summarily expelled"", and the Jewish Labour Movement called for his suspension and a disciplinary investigation. Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson accused Mr Willsman of being a ""loud-mouthed bully"" and high-profile supporters of Mr Corbyn have also taken to Twitter to urge Mr Willsman to withdraw from the elections to the NEC. He was supported by Labour MP and former frontbencher Chris Williamson who endorsed him for the ruling body vote. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said the row had added significance because Mr Willsman had been a ""fellow traveller politically"" of the Labour leader over the years and was a leading ""Corbynite"". The recording,published by the Jewish Chronicle,external, was made at an NEC meeting earlier this month which took place after more than 60 British rabbis signed an open letter that said anti-Semitism in sections of the Labour Party was ""severe and widespread"". This followedcriticism of the party's new code of conducton anti-Semitism, which  critics claimed did not sign up fully to the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's working definition.

In the recording, Mr Willsman can be heard discussing the rabbis' open letter with other NEC members. Mr Willsman says he does not want to be ""lectured to by Trump fanatics"", and argues the NEC should ask the rabbis for ""evidence of severe and widespread anti-Semitism"" in the party. He then asks those at the meeting to raise their hands if they had witnessed anti-Semitism in the Labour party - and said he was ""amazed"" when some said they had. Labour said it was ""committed to tackling and eradicating anti-Semitism in all its forms, in our party and our society"". Asked about Mr Willsman's remarks, it said: ""We don't comment on individual cases."" The Jewish Labour Movement also accused the party of ""double standards"" over its decision to pursue disciplinary action against MPs Margaret Hodge and Ian Austin - both critics of Mr Corbyn and the new code of conduct. A Labour source said Mr Willsman's case had been treated ""like any other"", saying he had apologised and that meant the matter had been resolved. How widespread is anti-Semitism in the UK? Jewish newspapers unite against Labour Following the publication of the recording, the NEC member said he had supported ""the decision to confirm the adoption of the code of conduct on anti-Semitism and to reopen development of the code in consultation with Jewish community organisations"". He added: ""Not all of what I said has been accurately reported. But I accept that what I did say, and the way I said it, fell short of the requirement, which I accept, for discussions of contentious issues to be conducted in a fully civil and respectful way."" He said he ""deeply"" apologised for any offence caused. Mr Willsman apologised again when speaking at the meeting of Labour's NEC, saying: ""I recognise the offensive nature of my comments.""

An extraordinary meeting will be held on Wednesday, with the aim of discussing cuts which would see services stripped back to the legal minimum. Brian Roberts,one of two government-appointed commissionersoverseeing the council, said the authority's finances were in a ""truly perilous state"". Council leader Matthew Golby warned the authority has to decide what it can ""realistically provide"". He said they would ""safeguard all children and young people"" while ensuring a ""robust safeguarding system to protect vulnerable adults"". The ""core offer"" would also see the Conservative-led authority carry out ""sufficient maintenance"" of public highways and plan for school places, Mr Golby added. A council source told the BBC the scale of possible cuts was ""huge...completely unprecedented"". Prof Tony Travers, a local government expert at the London School of Economics, warned 15 to 20 councils were at risk of ending up in a similar position to Northamptonshire. ""It won't just be Northamptonshire, but they are the council that has got nearest to the precipice as it were so far,"" he said. Government commissioner Brian Roberts said the council needed to make ""difficult decisions"" Opposition Labour county councillor Danielle Stone said she was concerned cuts could hit support structures in children's services and ""threaten the stability of families"". A section 114 notice issued last week, severely curtailing spending at the council, followsthe issuing of the same notice in February. Prior to this, there had only been two issued in the UK since 1988. Mr Roberts said: ""To put itself on a secure financial footing very difficult decisions will need to be taken. It is clear the time for these decisions is now."" Meanwhile, the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy has warned that other authorities are facing similar pressures. Its chief executive, Rob Whiteman, has said more than 20 councils were ""similarly vulnerable to financial failure"". He told the BBC: ""All of local government is finding it hard at the moment. Northamptonshire is finding it particularly difficult because I'm afraid it's been badly led."" Northamptonshire County Council is the only authority so far to have formally declared itself at risk of spending more than the money it has available. However, the National Audit Office (NAO) haswarned as many as one in 10 larger local authorities in England with responsibility for social care,externalare draining their reserves and will have exhausted them completely in three years unless something changes. Another one in 10 would run out in five years. These reserves are sometimes seen as ""rainy day"" funds. They are there for unplanned expenses or planned one-off costs. They do not get topped back up again unless the council finds the money from somewhere else. The NAO found that between 2011-12 and 2016-17, a growing number of councils found themselves spending more than they expected to on social care and dipped into their reserves. Official government figures show that between 2015-16 and 2017-18, the amount of day-to-day spending funded by reserves and ""other items"" (including money transferred from other authorities or anything left over from previous years) increased to almost Â£2bn, equivalent to just over 2p in every Â£1 spent by local authorities. This is now expected to drop in 2018-19 to about Â£1.3bn, or 1.4p in every Â£1. The government has allowed councils responsible for social care to charge more in council tax to cover the increased cost of an ageing population. The NAO has warned councils cannot continue to rely on their reserves if they are struggling to make savings. ""A financial model based on dwindling reserves and difficulties in delivering savings is not financially sustainable over the medium term,"" it said. The Local Government Association (LGA) said the ""next Spending Review will be make or break for local services"". One of the councils facing similar financial pressures is Somerset County Council, which in May announcedplans to sell off seven farms to raise Â£8m. A Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesman said: ""It is essential residents are able to have faith in their council, particularly in the responsible use of taxpayers' money. ""The financial challenges facing the council are clearly serious and reinforce how important it was that we took swift action to appoint commissioners. ""These commissioners will continue to work closely with the council as it takes the necessary steps to rebalance its finances."" There have been many arguments about how Northamptonshire County Council got to this point. Many say underfunding by central government has played a part, buta report earlier this year by a government-appointed inspectorwas clear that problems are down to years of mismanagement by senior officers and councillors. It's left the authority in a situation no council has been in before. Today it will agree new priorities for the future that in effect leave it just fulfilling its legal obligations. We should then get more clarity on specific cuts in the coming weeks. But these are all stop-gap measures. The authority is expected to be replaced with a new, unitary council in 2020.

"This video can not be played Lorenzo Nunez described a ""strong explosion"" moments after take off A passenger plane has crashed in the capital of Mexico's Durango state, just moments after take-off. All 103 passengers and crew on board the AeromÃ©xico flight survived the crash but 97 of them are injured. State Governor JosÃ© Rosas Aispuro said the plane was hit by a gust of wind which caused a sudden descent. Its left wing then touched the ground and two engines broke off. Most of the passengers were able to walk away before it caught fire. How likely are you to survive a plane crash? AeromÃ©xico flight AM2431 was flying from Guadalupe Victoria International Airport in Durango to Mexico City when it crashed at around 16:00 local time (21:00 GMT). Initial reports spoke of 97 passengers and four crew, but Governor Rosas said that two children were also on board - bringing the total to 103. The plane's pilot is one of two who were seriously injured. He needed an operation on his spine but is reportedly in a stable condition. A young girl sustained burns. Many other passengers had only ""very light"" injuries, officials said. Ramin Parsa told the BBC that ""shortly after the plane took off, I knew something was wrong. The plane began to shake,"" he recalled. He said the plane hit the ground and ""started bouncing, shaking and sliding"" until it hit some trees and finally stopped when it fell into a ditch. ""All the lights went off and then there was smoke inside the cabin, people were panicking and screaming."" Mr Parsa said it was ""a miracle of God that we survived"". The fire spread through the aircraft after the crash Passenger Jacqueline Flores described the moment she and her daughter escaped the plane. ""I think we fell back on the runway because it was a hard surface, then we skidded on the ground until it stopped,"" the 47-year-old told the Agence France Press news agency. ""I undid my seatbelt and saw flames, and realised we had to jump. There was a hole right next to us where the plane had broken up. I told my girl, 'We have to jump over here', and we jumped,"" she added. A local politician on board the flight, RÃ³mulo Campuzano, said he had been ""very lucky because I was able to get out by the main door"". He said the door had been torn off and was lying next to the plane ""acting as a ramp"". ""I walked away from the plane, turning around to see if the other passengers were getting out, too. It started raining very hard and I think that helped put out the flames,"" he said. Governor Rosas said the crew were able to deploy the evacuation slides shortly after the crash, allowing those still on board to leave the plane safely before the flames spread. Most of the injured were released quickly and able to get home with a little help The airline AeromÃ©xico has a good safety record, according to local media. Its last deadly accident was in 1981, when 32 people were killed when an AeromÃ©xico plane crashed on landing in northern Chihuahua state. The airport operator, Grupo Aeroportuario Centro Norte, said early data suggested bad weather was the cause, and that the plane had taken off during a heavy hailstorm before being forced to attempt an emergency landing. One passenger said the plane had been hit by lightning. The plane crashed shortly after take-off In a statement,AeromÃ©xico said they ""deeply regret"" the accident,external, while Brazilian plane company Embraer said it had sent a team to the crash site.

"This video can not be played Tommy Robinson: 'All the mainstream media do is lie' Former English Defence League (EDL) leader Tommy Robinson has been released on bail after winning an appeal against a contempt of court finding. The 35-year-old admitted the charge and was jailed in May for filming outside Leeds Crown Court during a trial. At the Court of Appeal, Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett ruled the case be reheard after identifying technical and other failings. Robinson's solicitors said everyone has the ""right to a fair hearing"". The far-right activist, from Luton, was not present for the ruling in London and was released from his 13-month sentence being served at Onley Prison, near Rugby just before 15:30 BST. Speaking to reporters, Robinson said: ""All the British media do is lie. I have a lot to say but nothing to you. ""I want to thank the British public for all their support."" Tommy Robinson supporters and protesters gathered outside The Royal Courts of Justice In his written judgement, Lord Burnett said: ""We are satisfied that the finding of contempt made in Leeds following a fundamentally flawed process, in what we recognise were difficult and unusual circumstances, cannot stand. ""We will direct that the matter be reheard before a different judge."" Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley Lennon, will attend the Old Bailey for the hearing, conducted by the Recorder of London, ""as soon as reasonably possible"". This morning, the Lord Chief Justice's ruling in Robinson's appeal underlined that the rule of law - the rules that apply to us all - must be applied fairly in all circumstances. And that's why the Court of Appeal ruled that Robinson's second conviction in a year for contempt of court was flawed. In essence, the five hours from arrest to sentence at Leeds Crown Court was rushed. Robinson wasn't told what specific parts of his activity at the court had been potentially prejudicial to a jury - meaning nobody to this day knows exactly what he did wrong. Further, he immediately removed the offending video from Facebook on the court's order and the judge should have then adjourned the matter to give him longer to prepare a defence. Tommy Robinson is still convicted of contempt in relation to his behaviour at Canterbury last year where he received his three month sentence for potentially derailing a fair trial. Today, the Court of Appeal said that very same right to a fair hearing means Robinson should have a full opportunity to put his case without rushing to judge. The case that brought Robinson to Leeds related to grooming and the second of three trials involving 28 men. The third trial is due to start in September. Footage, filmed by Robinson on a mobile phone and broadcast on social media, saw him discussing the criminal trial that was subject to reporting restrictions. The video, lasting about an hour-and-a-half, was watched 250,000 times within hours of being posted as a Facebook Live. Tommy Robinson founded the English Defence League in 2009 but quit the group in 2013 A statement from Robinson's solicitors said: ""The rule of law and right to a fair hearing are fundamental to every individual and this ruling is an example of the safeguards of our system. ""What makes the British system so unique is the ability to set aside personal feelings and deal with the law and each case on its merits."" More stories from Yorkshire Robinson had challenged two contempt of court findings but Lord Burnett said a suspended sentence he was given relating to a trial in Canterbury in May 2017 should stand. He was given 10 months for contempt of court in Leeds and a further three months for breaching the suspended sentence handed to him in Canterbury. Contempt of court laws are designed to protect the rule of law, ensure fair trials - and avoid trial by media. Contempt can be committed by a broad range of people and organisations including the press, jurors, and social media users. The maximum sentence for contempt of court is two years' imprisonment, but it can also be punished with a fine. The law on contempt is set out in case law and the 1981 Contempt of Court Act. Key areas that amount to contempt include: Publishing anything that creates a substantial risk of seriously prejudicing ""active"" criminal proceedings Bringing into a court building a device for recording sound Taking photographs or film in a court building is capable of being a contempt of court. Breaching a court order or undertakings given to the court can also amount to contempt. Robinson attended Canterbury Crown Court during a rape trial of four men and filmed on the steps of the court and inside the building while the jury was considering its verdicts. At an earlier hearing, Robinson's QC argued that procedural ""deficiencies"" had caused ""prejudice"" in Leeds. Lord Burnett said the judge should not have commenced contempt proceedings the same day he was arrested. He explained ""no particulars of the contempt were formulated or put to the appellant"", and there was ""a muddle over the nature of the contempt being considered"". Tommy Robinson had been serving a 13-month sentence at Onley Prison, near Rugby Robinson's bail conditions order that he does not ""approach within 400m (0.2 miles) of Leeds Crown Court"". His lawyers had argued that a rehearing was not necessary due to the length of time he served in prison. But the Court of Appeal said the ""alleged contempt was serious"" and the sentence might be longer than that already served. Rival groups of Robinson supporters and ""Stand Up To Racism"" protesters had gathered outside the Royal Courts of Justice and swapped chants. Both groups of about 30 people were outnumbered by watching police. BBC White House reporter, Tara McKelvey, said his case has generated ""a united front among nationalists"" from across the Atlantic, with Robinson gaining support from the likes of Steve Bannon and Donald Trump Junior. Born in 1982, Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, describes himself as ""a working-class man from Luton"". Aged 20, he joined the far-right British National Party but soon left saying ""it was not for me"" In 2009 he set up the English Defence League (EDL) - an organisation set up to counter what its members saw as the threat of Islamist extremism The EDL organised street marches and demonstrations which often clashed with anti-racism campaigners He married in 2011 and is the father of three children He left the EDL in 2013 expressing concern that he no longer felt he could keep extremist elements within the organisation at bay In 2015, he joined demonstrations with the German anti-immigration group Pegida, Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West, and announced the founding of the British chapter In 2017, he started contributing to Canadian-based far-right political commentary site The Rebel Media 'All the mainstream media do is lie' Video, 00:00:34'All the mainstream media do is lie' Court of Appeal 'Bradford has borne the brunt of austerity policies - with devastating consequences' Council to sell Lord Mayorâs number plate with hope of raising more than Â£500,000 'Robbie Williams' to play at Calderdale indie cinema's showing of new biopic One of Halifax's best-loved restaurants announces new premises and bar Leeds man and teenager to appear in court charged with violent disorder and arson following Harehills disorder Director of Yorkshire firms given nine-year ban for âscheme designed to undermine the insolvency systemâ Hollywood Hills in flames amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

"One version of a 3D printed gun A US federal judge in Seattle has blocked the release of software that allows consumers to 3D-print firearms. Gun access advocacy group Defense Distributed published downloadable gun blueprints five days early on Friday. The firm had reached a settlement with the Trump administration in June to allow it to legally publish the plans. But eight states and the District of Columbia sued the government on Monday to block the settlement, arguing the untraceable guns were a safety risk. US District Judge Robert Lasnik issued a temporary restraining order halting the release hours before the 1 August deadline, saying the blueprints could fall into the wrong hands. Are 'ghost guns' a step too far? Will 3D printing change my world? ""There are 3D printers in public colleges and public spaces and there is the likelihood of potential irreparable harm,"" he said. Judge Lasnik scheduled another hearing for 10 August. Although Defense Distributed had been expected to publish the blueprints on Wednesday, it uploaded files for nine types of gun to its website last week.Between Friday and Sunday, more than 1,000 people downloaded the filesfor building a gun apparently modelled on the AR-15 rifle - the gun used in many of America's mass shootings. Thelawsuit,externalagainst the Trump administration was filed in Seattle by the Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson. New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Oregon, Maryland and District of Columbia are involved. The complaint calls the 1 August release of gun blueprints ""a bell that cannot be un-rung"". It raises concerns about national security implications and the safety of citizens. The Liberator became the first gun to be made wholly with 3D-printed parts in 2013 The 3-D printed guns are untraceable and no background checks are required. So there are fears that known criminals could easily access them. Security experts also fear that the DIY guns could evade metal detectors used in public buildings and airports. Speaking outside the court, Washington attorney general Bob Ferguson called the judge's decision a ""complete, total victory"". ""Everything we asked for we got from Judge Lasnik,"" he said, and called on President Trump to make it ""unlawful for anyone to make this information available for anyone"". The president had tweeted on Tuesday before the ruling that selling 3D guns to the public ""doesn't seem to make much sense"" after settling with Defense Distributed in June. Allow Twitter content?

But the group's founder Cody Wilson told the BBC the 3D gun was not a threat to public safety. ""I haven't watched any crimes be committed with it,"" he said. ""As far as I know only one person's ever been arrested because of this gun and it was a gentleman in Japan who was curious about making it."" The arguments began in 2013 when Mr Wilson, a self-styled crypto-anarchist, showed off the world's first 3D-printed gun. Files showing how to replicate the process were immediately made available on the Defense Distributed website and downloaded hundreds of thousands of times. It led the US State Department to order them to be removed from the internet. There followed a four-year legal battle, with Defense Distributed joining forces with the Second Amendment Foundation - which defends the right to own guns - to sue the State Department. Last month, in a surprise move, it won its case, with the US Justice Department ruling that Americans may ""access, discuss, use and reproduce"" the technical data. Mr Wilson hailed his victory as the beginning of ""the age of the downloadable gun"". But critics are concerned it will see a massive rise in so-called ghost guns, unregistered weapons the government is unaware of and is unable to trace. Since the legal action began, Defense Distributed has been working on new gun designs and has also created a milling device - known as Ghost Gunner - that can turn parts purchased online into a fully working weapon.

"Shares in clothing retailer Next have fallen 6% in early trading, despite a faster-than-expected rise in sales. The High Street chain said that thanks to the ""prolonged"" hot weather, it had sold more lightweight summer clothing earlier in the season. Revenue grew by 2.8% in the three months to 28 July compared with 2017. However, the retailer was cautious on its prospects for the rest of the summer, saying it had already sold stock it had hoped to sell in August. Online sales were up 12.5%, but in its retail stores, trade fell by 5.9%. Next maintained its full-year profit forecast at Â£717m, down 1.3% on 2017. The retailer said it had expected the sales rise for the quarter to be just 1%. It added: ""We believe that this over-achievement in sales was due to the prolonged period of exceptionally warm weather, which greatly assisted the sales of summer weight product. ""It is almost certain that some of these sales have been pulled forward from August, so we are maintaining our sales and profit guidance for the year to January 2019."" George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""Hopes had been high that the sunny weather, which boosts sales of all things summer season, would have led to Next upgrading profit expectations for the year. That's not been the case. ""Next says it'd rather wait and see how the remainder of the summer goes before moving guidance. This seems fair enough, but it will have left a few wondering if the best summer in years isn't enough to upgrade profits, then what is?""

"The stolen jewels belonged to the Swedish monarchs who lived in the early 1600s Police in Sweden have launched a manhunt after thieves swiped some of the country's crown jewels from a cathedral and escaped by speedboat. Two priceless crowns and an orb belonging to a 17th Century king and queen were taken at around midday on Tuesday in StrÃ¤ngnÃ¤s, near Stockholm. Witnesses said they saw two men running from the cathedral, which was open to the public and hosting a lunch fair. They were seen motoring off into Lake Malaren, and have not been seen since.

The pub said it took ""immediate action"" after receiving the complaint and an investigation was under way. Ms White, from St Austell, Cornwall, said the harassment started with a wolf-whistle but soon became more intimidating, with the doorman leering at her and making comments about her breasts.

"Lloyds Banking Group has said it has put aside another Â£460m in costs for payment protection insurance (PPI) mis-selling claims. That means it has now allocated more than Â£19.2bn to settle the claims. The bank said it expected 13,000 PPI complaints a week until August 2019. The provision came as Lloyds said its profits for the first six months of the year rose by nearly a quarter. It made pre-tax profits of Â£3.1bn, 23% higher than the same time last year. Chief executive AntÃ³nio Horta-OsÃ³rio said: ""We have delivered another strong and sustainable financial performance with increased statutory profits, higher returns and a strong capital build."" Lloyds said the latest PPI charge was ""largely driven by a potentially higher total volume of complaints and associated administration costs due to higher reactive complaint volumes received over the past six months and ongoing volatility"". It added: ""The remaining provision is consistent with an average of approximately 13,000 complaints per week through to the industry deadline of the end of August 2019."" It said that every extra 1,000 complaints a week above that level would cost it another Â£150m. The bank said it had sold an estimated 16 million PPI policies since 2000, including policies that were not mis-sold and those that had been successfully claimed upon. It has already dealt with about 53% of those policies. PPI mis-selling was a huge financial scandal and now, for many, the reason for a lot of unwanted calls about claiming compensation. But it is worth stepping back for a minute to look at the staggering numbers involved. Latest figures from the regulator show that in May alone, compensation of more than Â£400m was paid out by the industry. No wonder banks were so delighted when a claims deadline was set for 29 August 2019. On the flipside, claims management companies (CMCs) are furious. This week a trade body for CMCs claimed that half of us are unaware of the cut-off date. They will be busy in the next 12 months, so expect more calls. Despite those efforts, many people are missing out on compensation that is rightfully theirs and that they can claim themselves without charge. Lloyds said it was committed to maintaining the UK's largest network of branches, despiteits announcement of 49 branch closures in April. It said it also had the largest digital bank in the UK, with active users increasing to almost 14 million, including about 10 million mobile banking users. Lloyds said its balance sheet remained strong, with its common equity tier one capital ratio increasing to 15.1% pre-dividend. It said it would pay an interim dividend of 1.07 pence a share. The government sold its last shares in Lloyds in May 2017, eight years after pumping in Â£20bn to save it. Lloyds' share price rose nearly 2%, but remains slightly lower than it was a year ago. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""AntÃ³nio Horta-OsÃ³rio must be wondering just what he has to pull out of the bag to push the stock price up. ""Since taking over the reins in 2011, Horta-OsÃ³rio has presided over a bank which has swung from an annual loss of Â£260m to a profit of Â£3.5bn. The share price, meanwhile, is at roughly the same level it stood at when he became CEO. ""That's largely because Brexit means some investors don't want to touch UK domestic companies like Lloyds with a bargepole. ""While this sentiment doesn't look like shifting any time soon, Lloyds shareholders are being paid to wait. The bank is expected to deliver a total dividend of 3.44p this year, equivalent to a 5.5% income yield. Not bad, if you can get it.""

"This video can not be played CCTV captures gang stealing Â£1m-worth of jewellery in log baskets Thieves climbed a two-metre high wall to steal antiques from the country home of a multi-millionaire entrepreneur. The four suspects, who were captured on CCTV, raided the home of Prof Sir Christopher Evans in Bibury, Gloucestershire, on 9 July and took diamond rings, tiaras and bracelets. The theft had a ""devastating"" effect on his wife Lady Anne, due to the sentimental nature of the items. A ""substantial cash reward"" has been offered for information. The CCTV footage captured the gang carrying items in a log basket across the grounds before putting them in a silver or grey Audi S5 and heading towards Cirencester. Antique items taken include diamond rings, gold brooches, a tiara, a Cartier bracelet, a choker, silver candlesticks and three Art Nouveau silver rose bowls. It is estimated the items stolen in the burglary - which happened between 17:00 and 20:00 on Monday 9 July - have a value of at least Â£1m. In a statement, Sir Christopher, an internationally renowned life sciences entrepreneur originally from Port Talbot, said: ""The real pain comes from what these stolen items mean and symbolise in our lives. 'Cocky' bouncer barred after woman's tweet Snowboarder 'feared letting others down' 'Enormous' wasp nest found in cupboard ""Anne's engagement ring was her late father's signet ring - the only thing she has left of him.

He added the couple had ""always taken security around the property very seriously and we have obviously stepped up security with 24-hour dog patrols around the property"". Det Con Faye Satchwell-Bennett, from Gloucestershire Constabulary, said the burglary has had a ""marked impact"" on the victims, and asked that antiques dealers be on the lookout for any of the items.

"The environment secretary, Michael Gove, has promised support for farmers hit by the impact of the dry weather. Following a drought summit with the National Farmers' Union (NFU), he said the government would do ""whatever it takes"" to maintain food supplies. The NFU had requested relief from the ""crippling impact"" of the heatwave, including the relaxation of rules over accessing additional water supplies. Mr Gove promised to remove bureaucracy where it was hindering farmers. ""We will make sure farmers have what they need in order to provide us with high-quality food and ensure their businesses survive,"" he said. The record summer heatwave has put huge pressure on farmers. Meat and milk producers, salad, fruit and vegetable growers, have said harvests and yields are being severely affected by some of the driest months since 1961. Heavy rain in recent days has given farmers some relief, but the NFU was still ""seeking urgent action"" to help farmers. UK heatwave 2018: The winners and losers Heatwave threatens shortage of peas Lettuce shortage 'imminent' NFU President Minette Batters said: ""Today's summit was a wake-up call to government and policy makers about the importance of British food production and the critical need to manage the volatility that comes with it. She welcomed Mr Gove's pledge to support the sector. At the meeting she had sought more flexibility for farmers who want to take water from rivers, or have increased access to the public supply water when there is spare capacity in the system. The Environment Agency, the government body which oversees water use,said farmers would be allowed some short-term flexibility,externalwithin their water abstraction licences. ""We must also balance farmers' needs with those of wildlife and other water users so we will only allow these arrangements where we are satisfied there won't be any adverse effects on the environment,"" said Paul Hickey, the EA's head of water resources. Dairy farmer Abi Reader has already sent four milking cows to slaughter and she's planning to send four more as the cost of feeding them soars. For livestock farmers like her the lack of rain means animals can't just be put out to pasture as usual. Near Cardiff in Wales, where Abi Reader farms her 180-strong milking herd, grass is usually green and lush throughout the summer, she says, but the heat has dried it to a crisp yellow. It's costing her Â£210 a day to keep them fed using silage and hay. ""We're breaking into winter stocks, that's the frightening thing,"" she says. It doesn't make economic sense to feed so many. So they're ""shedding passengers"" - cutting down the number of mouths by sending cows to slaughter that would in better circumstances have continued milking. Two were cows that aborted calves due to the stress of the hot weather. ""We've lost a lot of money on them. The cheapest option is get rid of them and cut our losses,"" she says. In April Abi Reader's fields were ""green and lush"" she says By July the fields were dry and not providing enough nutrients for her herd Ms Reader says she's not the only farmer taking this course of action. It was hard to find a slot for them in abattoir, she says. John O'Farrell, who runs an abattoir in Camarthenshire, Wales, says many farmers are culling animals earlier than they would normally, following a bad grass growing season due to the harsh weather in March, which delayed the start of outdoor grazing, followed by the heatwave. ""Our volume of work is considerably higher than we would expect at this time of year,"" he told BBC Radio Four's Farming Today programme. ""Farmers are taking the view if the animals are to be culled it's best to cull early."" The same factors are having an impact on beef and sheep herds too, according to Nick Allen from the British Meat Processors Association. ""The first thing we noticed was people sending lambs in for slaughter at slightly lighter weights than normal,"" he says. ""The moment they're running out of grass on the farm they get rid of them earlier."" He says if farmers go into winter short of feed and relying on expensive concentrates it will push up costs and could result in lower overall production of UK meat and milk. ""It could translate into meat being in shorter supply and prices having to go up because the cost of production is going to have to go up, without a shadow of a doubt,"" he added.

"This video can not be played Lorenzo Nunez described a ""strong explosion"" moments after take off A passenger plane has crashed in the capital of Mexico's Durango state, just moments after take-off. All 103 passengers and crew on board the AeromÃ©xico flight survived the crash but 97 of them are injured. State Governor JosÃ© Rosas Aispuro said the plane was hit by a gust of wind which caused a sudden descent. Its left wing then touched the ground and two engines broke off. Most of the passengers were able to walk away before it caught fire. How likely are you to survive a plane crash? AeromÃ©xico flight AM2431 was flying from Guadalupe Victoria International Airport in Durango to Mexico City when it crashed at around 16:00 local time (21:00 GMT). Initial reports spoke of 97 passengers and four crew, but Governor Rosas said that two children were also on board - bringing the total to 103. The plane's pilot is one of two who were seriously injured. He needed an operation on his spine but is reportedly in a stable condition. A young girl sustained burns. Many other passengers had only ""very light"" injuries, officials said. Ramin Parsa told the BBC that ""shortly after the plane took off, I knew something was wrong. The plane began to shake,"" he recalled. He said the plane hit the ground and ""started bouncing, shaking and sliding"" until it hit some trees and finally stopped when it fell into a ditch. ""All the lights went off and then there was smoke inside the cabin, people were panicking and screaming."" Mr Parsa said it was ""a miracle of God that we survived"". The fire spread through the aircraft after the crash Passenger Jacqueline Flores described the moment she and her daughter escaped the plane. ""I think we fell back on the runway because it was a hard surface, then we skidded on the ground until it stopped,"" the 47-year-old told the Agence France Press news agency. ""I undid my seatbelt and saw flames, and realised we had to jump. There was a hole right next to us where the plane had broken up. I told my girl, 'We have to jump over here', and we jumped,"" she added. A local politician on board the flight, RÃ³mulo Campuzano, said he had been ""very lucky because I was able to get out by the main door"". He said the door had been torn off and was lying next to the plane ""acting as a ramp"". ""I walked away from the plane, turning around to see if the other passengers were getting out, too. It started raining very hard and I think that helped put out the flames,"" he said. Governor Rosas said the crew were able to deploy the evacuation slides shortly after the crash, allowing those still on board to leave the plane safely before the flames spread. Most of the injured were released quickly and able to get home with a little help The airline AeromÃ©xico has a good safety record, according to local media. Its last deadly accident was in 1981, when 32 people were killed when an AeromÃ©xico plane crashed on landing in northern Chihuahua state. The airport operator, Grupo Aeroportuario Centro Norte, said early data suggested bad weather was the cause, and that the plane had taken off during a heavy hailstorm before being forced to attempt an emergency landing. One passenger said the plane had been hit by lightning. The plane crashed shortly after take-off In a statement,AeromÃ©xico said they ""deeply regret"" the accident,external, while Brazilian plane company Embraer said it had sent a team to the crash site.

"Gatwick Express's claims of reaching London in 30 minutes were ruled misleading Gatwick Express must no longer claim it runs ""non-stop to Victoria Station in half an hour"" unless it manages it most of the time, a regulator has ruled. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the 30-minute claim was not substantiated and was ""misleading"". The watchdog's ruling followed two complaints about a poster and website. The ASA found 20.1% of Gatwick Express trains between London Victoria and Gatwick Airport were delayed between 30 April and 26 May. It ruled that a ""significant proportion"" of the delayed services during that period were due to reasons within the operator's control. Read other stories in the South East David Watling from Crawley, who was one of the two complainants to the ASA, told the BBC: ""It surprised me there weren't more complaints. I get the Gatwick Express on a daily basis and it's very rarely on time. ""It's mainly tourists who use the line and they don't have the time, or are not in the country long enough, to make the complaints. ""They exploit that and charge a premium price."" When is a train on time? Are UK trains the 'envy' of Europe? Rail industry 'has failed passengers' Govia Thameslink Railway, which runs Gatwick Express services, said it was difficult to mitigate against certain causes of delays, such as staff sickness. Gatwick Express ran adverts saying trains reached Victoria in ""half an hour"" and ""just 30 minutes"" The ASA said rail travellers would expect Gatwick Express to achieve the stated journey time barring exceptional circumstances. It said: ""Whilst we acknowledged that a proportion of services were delayed due to exceptional or unforeseeable circumstances outside of Gatwick Express's control, such as track faults, fatalities and power supply failures, we considered that a significant proportion of services were delayed for reasons that were within Gatwick Express's control. ""As such, we concluded that the claims 'Non-stop to Victoria station in half an hour' and 'in just 30 minutes' had not been substantiated and were misleading."" A spokesman for Gatwick Express said: ""Just a third of Gatwick Express delay minutes were within our control. However we acknowledge the ASA ruling and began withdrawing these adverts many months ago.""

"Lloyds Banking Group has said it has put aside another Â£460m in costs for payment protection insurance (PPI) mis-selling claims. That means it has now allocated more than Â£19.2bn to settle the claims. The bank said it expected 13,000 PPI complaints a week until August 2019. The provision came as Lloyds said its profits for the first six months of the year rose by nearly a quarter. It made pre-tax profits of Â£3.1bn, 23% higher than the same time last year. Chief executive AntÃ³nio Horta-OsÃ³rio said: ""We have delivered another strong and sustainable financial performance with increased statutory profits, higher returns and a strong capital build."" Lloyds said the latest PPI charge was ""largely driven by a potentially higher total volume of complaints and associated administration costs due to higher reactive complaint volumes received over the past six months and ongoing volatility"". It added: ""The remaining provision is consistent with an average of approximately 13,000 complaints per week through to the industry deadline of the end of August 2019."" It said that every extra 1,000 complaints a week above that level would cost it another Â£150m. The bank said it had sold an estimated 16 million PPI policies since 2000, including policies that were not mis-sold and those that had been successfully claimed upon. It has already dealt with about 53% of those policies. PPI mis-selling was a huge financial scandal and now, for many, the reason for a lot of unwanted calls about claiming compensation. But it is worth stepping back for a minute to look at the staggering numbers involved. Latest figures from the regulator show that in May alone, compensation of more than Â£400m was paid out by the industry. No wonder banks were so delighted when a claims deadline was set for 29 August 2019. On the flipside, claims management companies (CMCs) are furious. This week a trade body for CMCs claimed that half of us are unaware of the cut-off date. They will be busy in the next 12 months, so expect more calls. Despite those efforts, many people are missing out on compensation that is rightfully theirs and that they can claim themselves without charge. Lloyds said it was committed to maintaining the UK's largest network of branches, despiteits announcement of 49 branch closures in April. It said it also had the largest digital bank in the UK, with active users increasing to almost 14 million, including about 10 million mobile banking users. Lloyds said its balance sheet remained strong, with its common equity tier one capital ratio increasing to 15.1% pre-dividend. It said it would pay an interim dividend of 1.07 pence a share. The government sold its last shares in Lloyds in May 2017, eight years after pumping in Â£20bn to save it. Lloyds' share price rose nearly 2%, but remains slightly lower than it was a year ago. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""AntÃ³nio Horta-OsÃ³rio must be wondering just what he has to pull out of the bag to push the stock price up. ""Since taking over the reins in 2011, Horta-OsÃ³rio has presided over a bank which has swung from an annual loss of Â£260m to a profit of Â£3.5bn. The share price, meanwhile, is at roughly the same level it stood at when he became CEO. ""That's largely because Brexit means some investors don't want to touch UK domestic companies like Lloyds with a bargepole. ""While this sentiment doesn't look like shifting any time soon, Lloyds shareholders are being paid to wait. The bank is expected to deliver a total dividend of 3.44p this year, equivalent to a 5.5% income yield. Not bad, if you can get it.""

"This video can not be played CCTV captures gang stealing Â£1m-worth of jewellery in log baskets Thieves climbed a two-metre high wall to steal antiques from the country home of a multi-millionaire entrepreneur. The four suspects, who were captured on CCTV, raided the home of Prof Sir Christopher Evans in Bibury, Gloucestershire, on 9 July and took diamond rings, tiaras and bracelets. The theft had a ""devastating"" effect on his wife Lady Anne, due to the sentimental nature of the items. A ""substantial cash reward"" has been offered for information. The CCTV footage captured the gang carrying items in a log basket across the grounds before putting them in a silver or grey Audi S5 and heading towards Cirencester. Antique items taken include diamond rings, gold brooches, a tiara, a Cartier bracelet, a choker, silver candlesticks and three Art Nouveau silver rose bowls. It is estimated the items stolen in the burglary - which happened between 17:00 and 20:00 on Monday 9 July - have a value of at least Â£1m. In a statement, Sir Christopher, an internationally renowned life sciences entrepreneur originally from Port Talbot, said: ""The real pain comes from what these stolen items mean and symbolise in our lives. 'Cocky' bouncer barred after woman's tweet Snowboarder 'feared letting others down' 'Enormous' wasp nest found in cupboard ""Anne's engagement ring was her late father's signet ring - the only thing she has left of him.

He added the couple had ""always taken security around the property very seriously and we have obviously stepped up security with 24-hour dog patrols around the property"".

"This video can not be played Joanne Rand acid death: Man jailed for 17 years A man has been jailed for 17 years for the manslaughter of a woman who died 11 days after being splashed with acid. Xeneral Webster, 19, was arguing with another man in High Wycombe when he took out a bottle of acid which splashed Joanne Rand head-to-toe. Ms Rand, 47, was sitting on a bench after visiting her daughter's grave when the acid hit her on 3 June 2017. Webster, of Westway, west London, had admitted manslaughter during his murder trial at Reading Crown Court. The court had heard Webster travelled to Frogmoor, High Wycombe, with sulphuric acid which was knocked from his grasp by another man during a scuffle over a bicycle. After the corrosive liquid hit Ms Rand she screamed in pain and ran to a nearby restaurant to douse herself with water. Xeneral Webster, 19, retrieved the bottle of acid before fleeing the scene in a balaclava The mother-of-three was treated in hospital and discharged but died on 14 June last year from multi-organ failure after contracting septicaemia. During the trial, prosecutor Alison Hunter QC said it ""made no difference"" the care home worker was not the intended victim because Webster knew the consequences of having the chemical in public, having been the victim of an acid attack himself just months before. Retailers sign up to voluntary ban What has led to the rise in acid attacks? How to treat a chemical burn Sentencing Webster, Judge Angela Morris said: ""You and your actions bear the responsibility for her tragic demise. ""The cost of your actions were incalculable and irreparable for her family and friends and there is no sentence which this court can pass which can replace the value of her life. ""The fact remains, you had this substance with you in a public place and you cannot have failed to realise the significant harm its contents would have caused to others had it been released. ""Because it is a liquid it is all the more likely to be indiscriminate in its spread."" Xeneral Webster was aware of the dangers of acid, having been a victim of an acid attack, his trial heard Det Ch Insp Nick Glister, from Thames Valley Police, described Ms Rand as a ""completely innocent party who was in the wrong place at the wrong time"". Her older sister, Lynn Ryan, described her sibling as ""a very caring person, she wouldn't want to harm anybody"". ""When it [the acid injury] happened to her, she was shocked as to why."" Joanne Rand's daughter, Katie Pitwell (right) called for tougher sentences for acid-related crimes Webster was also sentenced for two counts of possessing an offensive weapon, namely a samurai sword and ammonia, criminal damage and making threats to kill relating to a separate incident to which he pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing. Ms Rand's daughter, Katie Pitwell, has since called for tougher sentences for acid cases. ""I think the buying of acid needs to be restricted, but also, if someone is carrying it, there should be tougher sentences because most of the time they do intend to use it for harm,"" she said. ""People need to know that if they're carrying that type of stuff, it's going to hurt someone or kill someone."" Joanne Rand's 19-year-old daughter died in a road accident in 2011, she had visited her grave on the day she was injured Jacqueline Joiner, said her sister's death had revived painful memories of when Ms Rand's other daughter, Charlotte Pitwell, died in a road accident in 2011, aged 19.

"Labour's Jeremy Corbyn has apologised for appearing on platforms with people whose views he ""completely rejects"". Mr Corbyn's statement was in response tothe Times reporting,externalthat he hosted an event in 2010 at which a Holocaust survivor compared Israel to Nazism. Hajo Meyer's House of Commons talk was entitled 'The Misuse of the Holocaust for Political Purposes'. Labour MP Louise Ellman told BBC Newsnight she was ""absolutely appalled"" to hear about Mr Corbyn's involvement. The Labour leader's apology comes after one of his supporters in the party's National Executive Committee suggested that Jewish ""Trump fanatics"" were behind accusations of anti-Semitism in Labour ranks. Peter Willsman has apologisedand said not all his remarks were accurately reported. A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims How widespread is anti-Semitism in the UK? What's the difference between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism? At the event, which happened on Holocaust Memorial Day 2010, Jewish Auschwitz survivor and anti-Zionist Hajo Meyer, who died in 2014 aged 90, compared Israeli policy to the Nazi regime. The Commons meeting came during a tour by Mr Meyer entitled 'Never again for anyone - Auschwitz to Gaza'. The Times said that Palestinian activist Haidar Eid also addressed the meeting, saying: ""The world was absolutely wrong to think that Nazism was defeated in 1945. ""Nazism has won because it has finally managed to Nazify the consciousness of its own victims."" Mr Corbyn said views were expressed which he did not ""accept or condone"". He added: ""In the past, in pursuit of justice for the Palestinian people and peace in Israel/Palestine, I have on occasion appeared on platforms with people whose views I completely reject. ""I apologise for the concerns and anxiety that this has caused."" By BBC political correspondent Ben Wright Prominent Jewish voices inside and outside Labour are furious that the leadership seems to claim a clearer idea about what constitutes anti-Semitism than they do. Neither the actions nor words of Jeremy Corbyn have managed to calm this argument down. And while the government struggles to keep its plan for Brexit on the road, Labour appears to be stuck in a cul-de-sac of blame and recrimination on how it's tackling anti-Semitism. Read more from Ben Wright Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Labour needed to resolve the anti-Semitism issue ""as soon as possible"". ""It's shaken us to the core really,"" he said. ""We've got to resolve the issue within the party and then get out there and assist the Jewish community in tackling anti-Semitism."" In July, Labour facedcriticism over its new code of conducton anti-Semitism, which critics claimed did not sign up fully to the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's working definition. Labour says it has included the full International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition but has rewritten four of the examples included to expand and contextualise them ""to produce legally robust guidelines that a political party can apply to disciplinary cases"". One of the examples changed was the IHRA's one saying:""Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis."" Labour's code of conduct instead says:""Discourse about international politics often employs metaphors drawn from examples of historic misconduct. It is not anti-Semitism to criticise the conduct or policies of the Israeli state by reference to such examples unless there is evidence of anti-Semitic intent. Chakrabarti recommended that Labour members should resist the use of Hitler,  Nazi and Holocaust metaphors, distortions and comparisons in debates about Israel-Palestine in particular. In this sensitive area, such language carries a strong risk of being regarded as prejudicial or grossly detrimental to the party."" Following the row the party's MPs will vote in September on whether to adopt the full IHRA wording after passing an emergency motion last week. Allow Twitter content?

Louise Ellman said she was ""exceedingly disturbed"" by the situation, adding that by diluting the definition of anti-Semitism - a charge which the Labour Party rejects - Labour had ""made it possible to compare Israel with the Nazis"". She added: ""Jeremy is our leader, we want to be the next government, we need to change the way that this country is run to address the injustices in our society. ""But we can't do that while we are engulfed in this crisis of the Labour Party's inability to deal with anti-Semitism in its own ranks."" Labour MP John Mann, a long-standing critic of Mr Corbyn, told BBC Radio 4 Today that hosting an event called ""Auschwitz to Gaza"" on Holocaust Memorial Day breached anti-Semitism rules and ""breaches any form of normal decency"". ""I've no idea how he got himself into that situation, but I'm glad that he has apologised and on the back of that apology is the opportunity to do something significant,"" he said. Ann Black, a member of Labour's National Executive Committee and a supporter of Mr Corbyn, urged him to follow the advice of shadow cabinet colleagues and adopt the working definition on anti-Semitism. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that if necessary the party could add assurances that members were free to defend Palestinians or criticise the Israeli government. ""I don't think Jeremy Corbyn is in any way racist or anti-Semitic. I do believe he has the authority and the ability to break the current impasse,"" she said.

"Gatwick Express's claims of reaching London in 30 minutes were ruled misleading Gatwick Express must no longer claim it runs ""non-stop to Victoria Station in half an hour"" unless it manages it most of the time, a regulator has ruled. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the 30-minute claim was not substantiated and was ""misleading"". The watchdog's ruling followed two complaints about a poster and website. The ASA found 20.1% of Gatwick Express trains between London Victoria and Gatwick Airport were delayed between 30 April and 26 May. It ruled that a ""significant proportion"" of the delayed services during that period were due to reasons within the operator's control. Read other stories in the South East David Watling from Crawley, who was one of the two complainants to the ASA, told the BBC: ""It surprised me there weren't more complaints. I get the Gatwick Express on a daily basis and it's very rarely on time. ""It's mainly tourists who use the line and they don't have the time, or are not in the country long enough, to make the complaints. ""They exploit that and charge a premium price."" When is a train on time? Are UK trains the 'envy' of Europe? Rail industry 'has failed passengers' Govia Thameslink Railway, which runs Gatwick Express services, said it was difficult to mitigate against certain causes of delays, such as staff sickness. Gatwick Express ran adverts saying trains reached Victoria in ""half an hour"" and ""just 30 minutes"" The ASA said rail travellers would expect Gatwick Express to achieve the stated journey time barring exceptional circumstances. It said: ""Whilst we acknowledged that a proportion of services were delayed due to exceptional or unforeseeable circumstances outside of Gatwick Express's control, such as track faults, fatalities and power supply failures, we considered that a significant proportion of services were delayed for reasons that were within Gatwick Express's control. ""As such, we concluded that the claims 'Non-stop to Victoria station in half an hour' and 'in just 30 minutes' had not been substantiated and were misleading."" A spokesman for Gatwick Express said: ""Just a third of Gatwick Express delay minutes were within our control. However we acknowledge the ASA ruling and began withdrawing these adverts many months ago.""
