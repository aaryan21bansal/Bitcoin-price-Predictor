"King Charles III has stepped back from royal duties while he is treated for cancer. His elder son Prince William - along with other senior royals - will take on some of his engagements. Find out more about the Royal Family and the line of succession below. Born: 1948 Charles has been King since his mother Elizabeth II died on 8 September 2022. The now former Prince of Wales married Lady Diana Spencer, who became the Princess of Wales, on 29 July 1981. The couple had two sons, William and Harry. They later separated and their marriage was dissolved in 1996. On 31 August 1997, the princess was killed in a car crash in Paris. He married Camilla Parker Bowles on 9 April 2005. When Charles became King, she became Queen Consort, as per the wishes of the late queen. Following the coronation she is now known as Queen Camilla. King Charles III, the new monarch Camilla, the new Queen Consort Complete guide to King Charles III's Coronation Born: 1982 Prince William is the elder son of King Charles III and Diana, Princess of Wales, and is nowfirst in line to the throne. He was 15 when his mother died. He went on to study at the University of St Andrews, where he met his future wife, Kate Middleton. The couple were married in 2011. On his 21st birthday he was appointed a Counsellor of State - standing in for the late queen on official occasions. He and his wife had their first child, George, in July 2013, their second, Charlotte, in 2015 and third, Louis, in 2018. The prince trained with the Army, Royal Navy and RAF before spending three years as an RAF search-and-rescue pilot with RAF Valley on Anglesey, north Wales. He also worked part-time for two years as a co-pilot with the East Anglian Air Ambulance alongside his royal duties. He left the role in July 2017 to take on more royal duties on behalf of his grandparents. William inherited the Duchy of Cornwall estate from his father and is now the Prince of Wales. Catherine is now the Princess of Wales. As heir to the throne, his main duties are to support the King in his royal commitments. Born: 2013 George Alexander Louis was born on 22 July 2013 at St Mary's Hospital in London. His father was present for the birth of his son, who weighed 8lb 6oz (3.8kg). Prince George of Wales, as he is formally known, issecond in line to the throne, after his father. Born: 2015 Catherine, Princess of Wales gave birth to her second child, Charlotte Elizabeth Diana, on 2 May 2015, again at St Mary's Hospital. William was present for the birth of the 8lb 3oz (3.7kg) baby. She isthird in line to the throne,after her father and older brother, and is known as Her Royal Highness Princess Charlotte of Wales. Born: 2018 The new Princess of Wales gave birth to her third child, a boy weighing 8lbs 7oz, on 23 April 2018, at St Mary's Hospital in London. William was present for the birth of Louis Arthur Charles, who isfourth in line to the throne. Born: 1984 Prince Harry trained at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and went on to become a lieutenant in the Army, serving as a helicopter pilot. During his 10 years in the armed forces, Capt Wales, as he became known, saw active service in Afghanistan twice, in 2012 to 2013 as an Apache helicopter co-pilot and gunner. He left the Army in 2015 and now focuses on charitable work, including conservation in Africa and organising the Invictus Games for injured members of the armed forces. He has been a Counsellor of State since his 21st birthday and stood in for the late queen on official duties. He married US actress Meghan Markle on 19 May 2018, at Windsor Castle. In January 2020, the royal couple said they would step back as ""senior"" royals and divide their time between the UK and North America. They said they intended to ""work to become financially independent"". Just over a year later, Buckingham Palace confirmed the couple would not be returning to royal duties, and would give up their honorary military appointments and royal patronages. Born: 2019 The Sussexes' first child, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, was born on 6 May 2019, weighing 7lbs 3oz, with the duke present for his birth. Archie was not automatically a prince when he was born because he was not a grandson of the monarch. But he gained the right to that title when King Charles acceded to the throne. Harry and Meghan are understood to want their children to decide for themselves whether or not to use their titles when they are older. Born: 2021 The Duchess of Sussex gave birth to her second child in Santa Barbara, California, on 4 June 2021. Lilibet Diana Mountbatten-Windsor - to be known as Lili - is named after the Royal Family's nickname for the late queen. She was given the middle name Diana in honour of Prince Harry's mother, who died in a car crash in 1997 when he was 12 years old. Like her brother, she gained the right to use the royal title when her grandfather became king. Born: 1960 Prince Andrew,eighth in line to the throne,was the third child of Elizabeth II and Prince Philip - but the first to be born to a reigning monarch for 103 years. He was created the Duke of York on his marriage to Sarah Ferguson, who became Duchess of York, in 1986. They had two daughters - Beatrice, in 1988, and Eugenie, in 1990. In March 1992 it was announced the duke and duchess were to separate. They divorced in 1996. The duke served for 22 years in the Royal Navy and saw active service in the Falklands War in 1982. In addition to royal engagements, he served as a special trade representative for the government until 2011. Prince Andrew stepped away from royal duties in 2019 after an interview with the BBC about his relationship with US financier Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking and conspiracy charges. In February 2022, the dukeagreed to pay an undisclosed sum to settle a civil sexual assault case brought against himin the US by one of Epstein's victims, although he made no admission of liability and had repeatedly denied the allegations. Born: 1988 Princess Beatrice is the elder daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York. Her full title is Her Royal Highness Princess Beatrice. She married property tycoonEdoardo Mapelli Mozziat The Royal Chapel of All Saints at Royal Lodge, Windsor, in July 2020. The couple had been due to marry in May, but coronavirus delayed the plans.

Complete guide to the King's coronation 360Â° video: Explore inside Westminster Abbey Born: 1990 Princess Eugenie is the younger daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York. Her full title is Her Royal Highness Princess Eugenie and she is11th in line to the throne. Like her sister Princess Beatrice, she has no official surname, but uses York. She married her long-term boyfriend Jack Brooksbank at Windsor Castle on 12 October 2018. Born: 2021 Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank's son, August, born on 9 February 2021. Born: 2023 Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank's second son was born on 30 May 2023. It is the first royal birth since the coronation of King Charles, Eugenie's uncle. Ernest is13th in line to the throne, moving the Duke of Edinburgh down to 14th place. Born: 1964 Prince Edward was given the title Duke of Edinburgh on his 59th birthday, almost two years after the death of his father Prince Philip, who previously held the title. It was understood that Philip had wanted Edward to take on the title, but the decision was left to King Charles. Prince Edward's wife Sophie becomes the Duchess of Edinburgh and the prince's former title, the Earl of Wessex, has now been given to his son James, Viscount Severn. The couple also have a daughter, Lady Louise, born in 2003. After a brief period with the Royal Marines, the prince formed his own TV production company. He subsequently supported the late queen in her official duties and carried out public engagements for charities. He is14th in line to the throne. Born: 2007 James, Earl of Wessex is the younger child of the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh. He was given the title after his father Prince Edward became the Duke of Edinburgh in March 2023. When James was born, he was given the title Viscount Severn - a ""courtesy"" title as son of an earl, rather than using prince. It is thought his parents made this decision to avoid some of the burdens of royal titles. Born: 2003 Born in 2003, Lady Louise Windsor is the elder child of the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh. However, she is lower in the line of succession than her younger brother because she was born before a law came into force scrapping the system that meant a younger son could displace an older daughter. Born: 1950 Anne, Princess Royal is Elizabeth II and Prince Philip's second child and only daughter. When she was born she was third in line to the throne, but is now17th. She was given the title Princess Royal in June 1987. Princess Anne has married twice; her first husband Captain Mark Phillips is the father of her two children, Peter and Zara, while her second is Vice-Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence. The princess was the first royal to use the surname Mountbatten-Windsor in an official document, in the marriage register after her wedding to Capt Phillips. She competed in equestrian events for Great Britain in the 1976 Montreal Olympics and is involved with a number of charities, including Save the Children, of which she has been president since 1970. Born: 1977 Peter Phillips is the eldest of the late queen's grandchildren. He married Canadian Autumn Kelly in 2008 and together they have two daughters, Savannah, born in 2010, and Isla, born in 2012. The children of the Princess Royal do not have royal titles, as they are descended from the female line. Mark Phillips refused the offer of an earldom when he married so their children do not have courtesy titles. Peter Phillips and his wife announced they were getting divorced in February 2020. Born: 2010 Savannah, born in 2010, is the elder daughter of Peter Phillips and Autumn Kelly and was the late queen's first great-grandchild. Born: 2012 Isla, born in 2012, is the second daughter of Peter Phillips and Autumn Kelly. Born: 1981 Zara Tindall followed her mother and father with a highly successful riding career - including winning a silver medal at the London 2012 Olympics. She married former England rugby player Mike Tindall in 2011 and the couple had their first child, Mia Grace, in 2014. The children of the Princess Royal do not hold a royal title, as they are descended from the female line, but she remains21st in line to the throne.Their father, Mark Phillips, turned down an earldom when he married Princess Anne, so they do not have courtesy titles. Born: 2014 Zara Tindall gave birth to her first child, Mia Grace, in January 2014. Born: 2018 The couple's second child was born on 18 June 2018 at Stroud Maternity Unit, Gloucestershire, weighing 9lb 3oz. Lena Elizabeth was named in honour of her great-grandmother. Like her sister, Lena does not have a royal title and so will also be known as Miss Tindall. Born: 2021 Zara and Mike Tindall's son Lucas Philip, their third child was born on 21 March 2021 weighing 8lbs 4oz. Read the latest from our royal correspondent Sean Coughlan -sign up here.

In it, the two icons shared a chaotic cream tea at Buckingham Palace, with the famous bear gulping down his tea straight from the teapot and accidentally spraying a splodge of cream at the footman. He then revealed that he always carries an emergency stash of his favourite treat: a marmalade sandwich. Smiling and laughing, the Queen responded ""so do I"", before opening her bag and saying: ""I keep mine in here.""

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children Charlotte and George had front row seats, while Boris Johnson and his wife Carrie sat further back Thousands of people filled The Mall to watch the concert Taking to the stage, Prince Charles remarked on what he said was an ""outpouring of warmth and affection over the Jubilee weekend"". ""On behalf of us all, I wanted to pay my own tribute to your lifetime of selfless service."" He went on to talk about the Queen's ""strength and stay"", his father, theDuke of Edinburgh, who died last year. He said he was sure he was there in spirit. ""My papa would have enjoyed the show and joined us wholeheartedly in celebrating all you continue to do for your country and your people,"" he said. Images of the Queen over the decades was projected on to Buckingham Palace during the show He went on to say that the Queen continued to make history - and had made the Commonwealth an important force for good. ""And there was still time for fun amongst the work,"" he added. She had pledged to serve her whole life, and she continued to deliver, he said. ""You have been with us in our difficult times. And you bring us together to celebrate moments of pride, joy and happiness,"" he said. As pictures of the Queen throughout her reign were projected on to the front of Buckingham Palace, he said: ""These pictures on your house are the story of your life - and ours. ""So, Your Majesty, that is why we all say: 'Thank you.'"" The Queen's grandson, Prince William, spoke at the event during a section of the show dedicated to environmental issues. It opened with words from Sir David Attenborough, and as images of the natural world were projected on to Buckingham Palace and music from Hans Zimmer was played, the crowd heard archive audio of the Queen speaking about the future of the planet in 1989. Prince William spoke in front of a backdrop of images of forests and oceans Prince William, who champions environmental issues, said that throughout the Queen's lifetime, the natural world had become more fragile. The Queen had spent decades making the case for taking better care of the world, he said, and restoring it has never been more urgent. ""Together, if we harness the very best of humankind, and restore our planet, we will protect it for our children, for our grandchildren and for future generations to come,"" he said. This was a deeply personal speech by Prince Charles - addressing ""mummy"". It was intimate and simple, despite the grand setting. It was a son thanking a mother who had persevered for 70 years rather than a speech commending a head of state. It was also a reminder of how long Prince Charles and the Queen have been there together, soldiering on side by side. This is also the 70th anniversary of Prince Charles becoming heir to the throne. In this family moment he remembered his ""papa"", the Duke of Edinburgh, who died last year. If Prince Charles was looking back on changes over 70 years, Prince William was looking forward, with a rallying cry for the conservation work that is close to his heart. In the London twilight, it was framed as a message of hope. Invoking the Queen, he said: ""Like her, I am an optimist."" Diana Ross's performance was lit up by a massive glitterball Earlier in the day, the members of the Royal Family spent the day at events across the UK. Prince William and his wife the Duchess of Cambridge met performers and crew ahead of a special show in Cardiff. On Sunday morning, the couple tweeted images of their children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis,baking cupcakes for a street party,externalin the Welsh capital. Princess Anne represented her mother at the Epsom Derby where Zara Tindall, the Queen's granddaughter, said the Queen would be tuning in from home. ""She'll be sat on the sofa watching the TV.

"There was a heavy police presence in Hong Kong on Saturday, with some activists detained by police Six people have been arrested in Hong Kong as authorities moved to restrict public commemoration of the Tiananmen Square massacre. Saturday was the 33rd anniversary of the highly sensitive incident in which China's rulers crushed peaceful protests with tanks and troops. Until recently, Hong Kong was one of the few Chinese territories which commemorated the event. But Beijing has effectively banned the city's annual public vigil. Hong Kong Police confirmed five men and one woman had been arrested in the vicinity of Victoria Park, where a candlelight vigil marking the 1989 crackdown in Beijing would have been held. The six are now in police custody. Some images shared on social media appeared to show people being detained and led away by police officers in the city. Others were seen being searched. Hundreds of police, some with sniffer dogs, were also seen patrolling the area around the park in the evening. Dozens of people - in an apparent attempt to replicate the annual candlelit vigil - turned on their mobile phone torches in an area near to the park on Saturday. They were then warned by police to turn them off, Reuters news agency reports. Officials earlier warned that any unauthorised assembly could see demonstrators facing prison sentences of up to five years. ""For 33 years it has always been peaceful, but today it's like [the police] are facing a big enemy,"" one activist, Chan Po-ying, told AFP. ""The hearts of people will live on."" This video can not be played Tiananmen's tank man: The image that China forgot The Tiananmen Square protests in Beijing became the focus for national demonstrations calling for greater political freedoms in 1989. Thousands of people - mainly students - camped for weeks in the square before the military moved in on 4 June and opened fire. One unidentified protester became an international symbol of protest for blocking an advancing column of tanks in video footage which was seen around the world. The Chinese government says 200 civilians and several dozen security personnel died. Other estimates have ranged from hundreds to as many as 10,000. The actions of the authorities have been seen by activists as part of China's broader agenda to snuff out political dissent in Hong Kong. ON THE GROUND:Students hide tiny Tiananmen 'goddesses' on campus CONTEXT:Hong Kong's year under China's controversial law HISTORY:What happened in the protests of 1989? EXPLAINED:China and Taiwan: A really simple guide China's erasure of public displays of June Fourth - as the Tiananmen anniversary is popularly known in Chinese - has become near-total in Hong Kong since Beijing enacted a national security law on the island in 2020. Self-ruled Taiwan is one of the only parts of the Chinese-speaking world where it can be commemorated openly, and on Saturday hundreds of people gathered in the capital Taipei. Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen criticised the ""collective memory of 4 June being systematically erased in Hong Kong"". ""But we believe that such brute force cannot erase people's memories,"" she wrote on social media. ""It's a symbol of how democracy is precious and fragile at the same time, and how people who care about democracy need to stand up,"" Jeremy Chiang, who attended the event in Taipei, told Reuters.

"This video can not be played Root gives England hope of unlikely victory First LV= Insurance Test, Lord's (day three) New Zealand 132 & 285Mitchell 108, Blundell 96 England 141 & 216-5Root 77*, Stokes 54; Jamieson 4-59 England need 61 runs to win, New Zealand five wickets Scorecard Joe Root and Ben Stokes gave England huge hope of a stunning victory on a gripping third day of the first Test against New Zealand at Lord's. Chasing a challenging 277, England reached 216-5, needing another 61 runs. Though captain Stokes was out for 54, former skipper Root remains on 77, having added 57 with Ben Foakes. The fifth-wicket pair dragged the home side from 69-4 and England would have been 76-5 had Colin de Grandhomme not overstepped in bowling Stokes when he had only one. The Stokes-Root partnership added 90 and was only ended by Stokes trying a needless uppercut that gave impressive pace bowler Kyle Jamieson a fourth wicket. England's turnaround began in the morning session, when they took three wickets in three balls to spark a New Zealand collapse of 6-34. Daryl Mitchell completed a century, but after he was out for 108 and Tom Blundell for 96, the Black Caps were dismissed for 285. Then came the ups and downs of the England chase, leaving the prospect of a grandstand conclusion on the fourth morning. Broad has 'good feeling' England can beat New Zealand This video can not be played 'He can't believe it!' Captain Stokes falls for 54 This was a fascinating, fluctuating day of Test cricket, one on which each side enjoyed periods of momentum and ultimately ended with the match balanced on a knife-edge. The Stuart Broad over in which England claimed the triple strike was electric, the hosts' top-order collapse depressingly familiar, and the Root-Stokes fightback filled with tension. In the case of Stokes, the captain evoked memories of the 2019 World Cup final, when he hauled England to a famous victory on this ground against the same opponents. Stokes' reprieve was a huge moment, a present on his 31st birthday. It was part of a miserable day for De Grandhomme, who was run out from the only ball he faced, took the wicket off a no-ball then hobbled out of the game with a heel strain. If Stokes had remained, England would have started the fourth day as overwhelming favourites and probably much closer to victory, but New Zealand will return knowing they need only one wicket to expose a lengthy tail. A second new ball is still 15 overs away, yet England are likely to have to come through that challenge if they are to win. This video can not be played Commentatorâs curse! Pope out after Vaughan praise After England lost four wickets for 38 runs, it would have taken the most optimistic supporter to believe they would not lose inside three days, let alone end Saturday possessing such a chance of winning. With Jamieson causing havoc, Alex Lees shouldered arms to one that kissed off stump, Zak Crawley offered his trademark edge and Jonny Bairstow was bowled playing a booming drive. In between, Ollie Pope was twisted inside out in being bowled by Trent Boult. Even skipper Stokes looked skittish, often dancing down the pitch, just as he did when was bowled off the De Grandhomme no-ball. In among the chaos, Root was a reassuring presence, the former captain closing in on 10,000 Test runs with flicks, punches and busy running. As Stokes settled, he launched spinner Ajaz Patel over mid-wicket with three thrilling sweeps for six. Just as England were getting on top, Stokes looked for an ambitious ramp and gloved Jamieson behind. Though Foakes only moved to nine, he offered determined support to Root, who sensed a weariness in a New Zealand attack missing De Grandhomme and accelerated late in the day. This video can not be played England take three wickets in three balls for team hat-trick To have any hope of winning this match, England had to utilise the second new ball to restrict New Zealand's second innings, which began Saturday on 236-4. Mitchell moved from 97 to 100 from the first ball he faced, only to edge Broad and become the first of the three wickets to fall in as many balls. With Broad revving up the crowd, De Grandhomme was distracted by an lbw appeal and was run out by Pope's direct hit from fourth slip, then Jamieson was bowled off his pad. After watching the chaos from the other end, Blundell got trapped leg before by one that James Anderson got to nip back. When Tim Southee slashed to slip for Matt Parkinson's first Test wicket, England had taken the last six New Zealand wickets in the space of eight overs. England bowler Stuart Broad, speaking to BBC Sport:""It was really enjoyable, great to get the crowd going. We knew that new ball had to count, if they got past 300-320 it was a taller ask. ""Things went our way, we had to execute our chance and as a bowling group we should be very proud. ""It's game on, isn't?"" New Zealand all-rounder Daryl Mitchell:""Scoring a Test century at Lord's is a big honour. It was nice to get it done nice and early. It hasn't sunk in just yet. ""We will show up tomorrow morning with the chance to open up an end and get stuck into their bowlers."" Former England captain Michael Vaughan:""I have England as the favourites, despite the fact it will do more in the morning. It always does more in the morning at Lord's.

"Children were among those affected by tear gas and pepper spray launched by French police An MP who saw ""horrific"" scenes at last weekend's Champions League final wants ""a retraction of the smears"" against Liverpool fans. Europe's football governing body Uefa and French authorities initially blamed late arrivals and fake tickets for chaos at the game in Paris. Uefa has apologised but Ian Byrne, who was at the match, wants a full retraction. The Liverpool West Derby MP is planning a parliamentary motion about the issue. Mr Byrne, who was also at the 1989 Hillsborough disaster that led to the deaths of 97 Liverpool fans after a stadium crush, told BBC Radio 4 Today that there was ""a shambolic breakdown of stadium management"" and ""extremely hostile"" policing in Paris. Ian Byrne MP will present a parliamentary motion to ""crank up pressure"" for a full apology ""It was the worst event I've ever seen around a football match since 1989 at Hillsborough and it could have been as serious as Hillsborough with the lives lost,"" he said. ""It was only the patience of the Liverpool supporters that prevented that from happening because we got absolutely nothing from the authorities."" Following a week of widespread criticism,Uefa apologisedon Friday to Liverpool and Real Madrid fans after sections of supporters, including children and elderly people, were targeted with tear gas and pepper spray by French police outside the stadium. How the Champions League final trouble unfolded Harrowing accounts of post-match violence spark debate It has also emerged that fans, including Liverpool City Region mayorSteve Rotheram, were robbed and assaulted. Mr Byrne said Uefa's apology was ""a welcome acknowledgement of the horrors that were suffered by both sets of supporters"". He added: ""But we need to continue to demand a full public apology and retraction of the smears that were given about the Liverpool fans regarding the delayed kick-off and everything else that's happened"". Images show several fans had been queuing for more than two hours The chaos led to the match being delayed by 36 minutes, with Uefa initially blaming late arrivals even though footage showed thousands of fans had started queuing at least two hours before kick-off. The claim was condemned by Merseyside Police officers working at the match as well as journalists reporting on the final who said ""fans did not arrive late"". France's interior minister Gerald Darmanin later claimed there had been ""industrial-scale"" ticket fraud and that more than 30,000 Liverpool fans had fake tickets or no tickets outside the stadium. However this was disputed by several supporters andLiverpool defender Andy Robertsonwho said a friend to whom he had given a ticket was denied entry. Mr Darmanin's claim that only English fans had caused problems at the final also prompted widespread criticism including from Liverpool chief executive Billy Hogan who described it as ""disgraceful"". French sports minister Amelie Oudea-Castera and interior minister Gerald Darmanin initially blamed Liverpool fans after the final French president Emmanuel Macron later said he had asked his government ""to clarify what happened, to determine the responsibilities and to explain them in detail to our compatriots, the British and the Spanish."" He said ticket-holders who were blocked from entering the stadium should be reimbursed ""as fast as possible"". Real Madrid, whose fans were also caught up in the turmoil ahead of the club's 1-0 win, asked for answers on who was ""responsible for leaving the fans abandoned and defenceless"". Uefa has previously announced that an independent review of what happened at the final will be led by former Portugese sports minister Dr Tiago BrandÃ£o Rodrigues. Mr Byrne said he was concerned about anyone being appointed by Uefa without ""due process"" and that he hoped people with ""huge experience"" from the Hillsborough inquests would be approached to assist. He added that he planned to submit an early day motion in parliament on Monday to ""crank up pressure"" on the French government.

"This video can not be played Root gives England hope of unlikely victory First LV= Insurance Test, Lord's (day three) New Zealand 132 & 285Mitchell 108, Blundell 96 England 141 & 216-5Root 77*, Stokes 54; Jamieson 4-59 England need 61 runs to win, New Zealand five wickets Scorecard Joe Root and Ben Stokes gave England huge hope of a stunning victory on a gripping third day of the first Test against New Zealand at Lord's. Chasing a challenging 277, England reached 216-5, needing another 61 runs. Though captain Stokes was out for 54, former skipper Root remains on 77, having added 57 with Ben Foakes. The fifth-wicket pair dragged the home side from 69-4 and England would have been 76-5 had Colin de Grandhomme not overstepped in bowling Stokes when he had only one. The Stokes-Root partnership added 90 and was only ended by Stokes trying a needless uppercut that gave impressive pace bowler Kyle Jamieson a fourth wicket. England's turnaround began in the morning session, when they took three wickets in three balls to spark a New Zealand collapse of 6-34. Daryl Mitchell completed a century, but after he was out for 108 and Tom Blundell for 96, the Black Caps were dismissed for 285. Then came the ups and downs of the England chase, leaving the prospect of a grandstand conclusion on the fourth morning. Broad has 'good feeling' England can beat New Zealand This video can not be played 'He can't believe it!' Captain Stokes falls for 54 This was a fascinating, fluctuating day of Test cricket, one on which each side enjoyed periods of momentum and ultimately ended with the match balanced on a knife-edge. The Stuart Broad over in which England claimed the triple strike was electric, the hosts' top-order collapse depressingly familiar, and the Root-Stokes fightback filled with tension. In the case of Stokes, the captain evoked memories of the 2019 World Cup final, when he hauled England to a famous victory on this ground against the same opponents. Stokes' reprieve was a huge moment, a present on his 31st birthday. It was part of a miserable day for De Grandhomme, who was run out from the only ball he faced, took the wicket off a no-ball then hobbled out of the game with a heel strain. If Stokes had remained, England would have started the fourth day as overwhelming favourites and probably much closer to victory, but New Zealand will return knowing they need only one wicket to expose a lengthy tail. A second new ball is still 15 overs away, yet England are likely to have to come through that challenge if they are to win. This video can not be played Commentatorâs curse! Pope out after Vaughan praise After England lost four wickets for 38 runs, it would have taken the most optimistic supporter to believe they would not lose inside three days, let alone end Saturday possessing such a chance of winning. With Jamieson causing havoc, Alex Lees shouldered arms to one that kissed off stump, Zak Crawley offered his trademark edge and Jonny Bairstow was bowled playing a booming drive. In between, Ollie Pope was twisted inside out in being bowled by Trent Boult. Even skipper Stokes looked skittish, often dancing down the pitch, just as he did when was bowled off the De Grandhomme no-ball. In among the chaos, Root was a reassuring presence, the former captain closing in on 10,000 Test runs with flicks, punches and busy running. As Stokes settled, he launched spinner Ajaz Patel over mid-wicket with three thrilling sweeps for six. Just as England were getting on top, Stokes looked for an ambitious ramp and gloved Jamieson behind. Though Foakes only moved to nine, he offered determined support to Root, who sensed a weariness in a New Zealand attack missing De Grandhomme and accelerated late in the day. This video can not be played England take three wickets in three balls for team hat-trick To have any hope of winning this match, England had to utilise the second new ball to restrict New Zealand's second innings, which began Saturday on 236-4. Mitchell moved from 97 to 100 from the first ball he faced, only to edge Broad and become the first of the three wickets to fall in as many balls. With Broad revving up the crowd, De Grandhomme was distracted by an lbw appeal and was run out by Pope's direct hit from fourth slip, then Jamieson was bowled off his pad. After watching the chaos from the other end, Blundell got trapped leg before by one that James Anderson got to nip back. When Tim Southee slashed to slip for Matt Parkinson's first Test wicket, England had taken the last six New Zealand wickets in the space of eight overs. England bowler Stuart Broad, speaking to BBC Sport:""It was really enjoyable, great to get the crowd going. We knew that new ball had to count, if they got past 300-320 it was a taller ask. ""Things went our way, we had to execute our chance and as a bowling group we should be very proud. ""It's game on, isn't?"" New Zealand all-rounder Daryl Mitchell:""Scoring a Test century at Lord's is a big honour. It was nice to get it done nice and early. It hasn't sunk in just yet. ""We will show up tomorrow morning with the chance to open up an end and get stuck into their bowlers."" Former England captain Michael Vaughan:""I have England as the favourites, despite the fact it will do more in the morning. It always does more in the morning at Lord's. ""England have shown great character. They looked vulnerable, it looked tricky with the bat and, when Jonny Bairstow got out, I thought that was it. ""Joe Root just read the game and upped his rate once Ben Stokes got out.""

"An ex-top White House adviser has been charged with contempt of Congress for refusing to co-operate with the inquiry into last year's US Capitol riot. Peter Navarro is the second Trump aide to be arrested after defying a legal summons from the congressional committee investigating the attack. In court, Mr Navarro, 72, accused prosecutors and the FBI of misconduct. His indictment comes a week before the committee is due to begin televised hearings on its inquiry. The US House of Representatives panel, made up of seven Democrats and two Republicans, has interviewed more than 1,000 witnesses. Steve Bannon, who was chief strategist to former President Donald Trump, faced contempt of Congress charges last November after he too defied a subpoena. What happened in the US Capitol riot? Mr Navarro has been charged with refusing to provide testimony or documents to the committee investigating the riot at the US Capitol on 6 January 2021. A China hawk who advised Mr Trump on trade issues and also served on the Covid task force, he did not enter a plea at his hearing on Friday in Washington DC. Mr Navarro faces the possibility of up to two years in jail or a fine. He condemned the manner of his arrest earlier in the day by FBI agents at a Washington airport as he was boarding a flight to Nashville, Tennessee. ""Who are these people? This is not America,"" the former economics professor said in court, according to the Associated Press news agency. ""I was a distinguished public servant for four years!"" Outside, Mr Navarro protested that he had been placed in handcuffs and leg irons as he was taken into custody, reports Fox News. He said he would represent himself, because he was not willing to spend several hundred thousand dollars on legal counsel. The former aide has already acknowledged in media interviews that he helped co-ordinate an effort - known as the ""Green Bay Sweep"" - to keep Mr Trump, a Republican, in power after he lost the November 2020 election to his Democratic challenger Joe Biden. The House panel has also recommended contempt charges for Dan Scavino, a former deputy chief of staff to Mr Trump, and Mark Meadows, who was White House chief of staff. But it emerged on Friday evening that the US Department of Justice will not act on those two referrals. Mr Trump has urged his former associates not to co-operate with the Democratic-led investigation, deeming it politically motivated. Mr Navarro has claimed his communications with the former president were protected under the legal principle of executive privilege. Critics of the investigation have pointed out that in 2012, former US Attorney General Eric Holder was not criminally charged after he was found in contempt of Congress for refusing to co-operate with an inquiry. Then-President Barack Obama, a Democrat, had asserted executive privilege in that case.

"Children were among those affected by tear gas and pepper spray launched by French police An MP who saw ""horrific"" scenes at last weekend's Champions League final wants ""a retraction of the smears"" against Liverpool fans. Europe's football governing body Uefa and French authorities initially blamed late arrivals and fake tickets for chaos at the game in Paris. Uefa has apologised but Ian Byrne, who was at the match, wants a full retraction. The Liverpool West Derby MP is planning a parliamentary motion about the issue. Mr Byrne, who was also at the 1989 Hillsborough disaster that led to the deaths of 97 Liverpool fans after a stadium crush, told BBC Radio 4 Today that there was ""a shambolic breakdown of stadium management"" and ""extremely hostile"" policing in Paris. Ian Byrne MP will present a parliamentary motion to ""crank up pressure"" for a full apology ""It was the worst event I've ever seen around a football match since 1989 at Hillsborough and it could have been as serious as Hillsborough with the lives lost,"" he said. ""It was only the patience of the Liverpool supporters that prevented that from happening because we got absolutely nothing from the authorities."" Following a week of widespread criticism,Uefa apologisedon Friday to Liverpool and Real Madrid fans after sections of supporters, including children and elderly people, were targeted with tear gas and pepper spray by French police outside the stadium. How the Champions League final trouble unfolded Harrowing accounts of post-match violence spark debate It has also emerged that fans, including Liverpool City Region mayorSteve Rotheram, were robbed and assaulted. Mr Byrne said Uefa's apology was ""a welcome acknowledgement of the horrors that were suffered by both sets of supporters"". He added: ""But we need to continue to demand a full public apology and retraction of the smears that were given about the Liverpool fans regarding the delayed kick-off and everything else that's happened"". Images show several fans had been queuing for more than two hours The chaos led to the match being delayed by 36 minutes, with Uefa initially blaming late arrivals even though footage showed thousands of fans had started queuing at least two hours before kick-off. The claim was condemned by Merseyside Police officers working at the match as well as journalists reporting on the final who said ""fans did not arrive late"". France's interior minister Gerald Darmanin later claimed there had been ""industrial-scale"" ticket fraud and that more than 30,000 Liverpool fans had fake tickets or no tickets outside the stadium. However this was disputed by several supporters andLiverpool defender Andy Robertsonwho said a friend to whom he had given a ticket was denied entry. Mr Darmanin's claim that only English fans had caused problems at the final also prompted widespread criticism including from Liverpool chief executive Billy Hogan who described it as ""disgraceful"". French sports minister Amelie Oudea-Castera and interior minister Gerald Darmanin initially blamed Liverpool fans after the final French president Emmanuel Macron later said he had asked his government ""to clarify what happened, to determine the responsibilities and to explain them in detail to our compatriots, the British and the Spanish."" He said ticket-holders who were blocked from entering the stadium should be reimbursed ""as fast as possible"". Real Madrid, whose fans were also caught up in the turmoil ahead of the club's 1-0 win, asked for answers on who was ""responsible for leaving the fans abandoned and defenceless"". Uefa has previously announced that an independent review of what happened at the final will be led by former Portugese sports minister Dr Tiago BrandÃ£o Rodrigues. Mr Byrne said he was concerned about anyone being appointed by Uefa without ""due process"" and that he hoped people with ""huge experience"" from the Hillsborough inquests would be approached to assist. He added that he planned to submit an early day motion in parliament on Monday to ""crank up pressure"" on the French government.

"The UN says around 20 million tonnes of grain are currently stuck in Ukraine from the previous harvest Russia's invasion of Ukraine could soon cause a global food crisis that may last for years, the UN has warned. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the war had worsened food insecurity in poorer nations due to rising prices. Some countries could face long-term famines if Ukraine's exports are not restored to pre-war levels, he added. The conflict has cut off supplies from Ukraine's ports, which once exported vast amounts of cooking oil as well as cereals such as maize and wheat. This has reduced the global supply and caused the price of alternatives to soar. Global food prices are almost 30% higher than the same time last year, according to the UN. Speaking in New York on Wednesday, Mr Guterres said the conflict - combined with the effects of climate change and the pandemic - ""threatens to tip tens of millions of people over the edge into food insecurity followed by malnutrition, mass hunger and famine"". ""There is enough food in our world now if we act together. But unless we solve this problem today, we face the spectre of global food shortage in the coming months,"" he added. He warned that the only effective solution to the crisis was reintegrating Ukraine's food production, as well as fertiliser produced by both Russia and Belarus, back into the global market. MILITARY:Retired colonel speaks out on Russian TV MARIUPOL:'I hid below ground at steelworks for 60 days' ANALYSIS:The spy war within the war READ MORE:Full coverage of the crisis,external Mr Guterres also said he was in ""intense contact"" with Russia and Ukraine, as well as the US and the EU, in an effort to restore food exports to normal levels. ""The complex security, economic and financial implications require goodwill on all sides,"" he said. His comments came on the same day the World Bank announced extra funding worth $12bn (Â£9.7bn) for projects addressing food insecurity. The move will bring the total amount available for such projects to more than $30bn over the next 15 months. Russia and Ukraine produce 30% of the world's wheat supply and - prior to the war - Ukraine was seen as the world's bread basket, exporting 4.5 million tonnes of agricultural produce per month through its ports. But since Russia launched its invasion in February, exports have collapsed and prices have skyrocketed. They climbed even further after India banned wheat exports on Saturday. The UN says around 20 million tonnes of grain are currently stuck in Ukraine from the previous harvest which, if released, could ease pressure on global markets. This video can not be played Watch: Ros Atkins on why the war in Ukraine is pushing up food prices - and the likely impact on poorer countries While the number of people facing food insecurity had been growing even before the invasion, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, accused Moscow of making a difficult situation even worse on Wednesday. ""Russia has launched a grain war, stoking a global food crisis,"" Berlin's top diplomat said. ""It is doing so at a time when millions are already being threatened by hunger, particularly in the Middle East and Africa."" Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the world faced the ""greatest global food security crisis of our time"" which had been exacerbated by what he called Russian President Vladimir Putin's ""war of choice"".
