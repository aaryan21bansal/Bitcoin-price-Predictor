"A large proportion of NHS doctors are from an ethnic minority background UK scientists are to receive millions of pounds of government funding for a raft of studies to learn why people from an ethnic minority background are at greater risk from Covid-19. Six projects will analyse data on social circumstances, health and day-to-day activities, as well as investigating genetic risk factors. One will follow 30,000 health and social-care staff for a year. Researchers say there will be rapid action based on the findings. Prof Kamlesh Khunti, director of the Centre for BME Health at the University of Leicester, who is involved in three of the studies, told BBC News he expected results to be translated into guidance that would help save black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) lives within months. ""We will definitely get answers to the things that are putting people at much higher risk,"" he said. ""As soon as we get results that might make a difference, it is important that we get them out straight away."" The results will also be shared with the leaders of black and South Asian communities, professional bodies and health regulators who will take rapid action, said Prof Khunti. ""If we find that living in crowded, multi-generational housing, not getting enough physical activity, are high on the list of factors associated with certain communities dying from Covid, we can look at the evidence and transform them into the most culturally appropriate messages."" This video can not be played BAME coronavirus deaths: What's the risk for ethnic minorities? Emerging evidence shows people from ethnic minoritiesare significantly more likely to die from Covid-19than the white population. But no-one knows exactly why ethnic groups are more vulnerable, though there are a number of ideas about why people from BAME backgrounds have been harder hit. These include: working in occupations with greater levels of contact with people in frontline health and social care living in deprived circumstances a greater proportion having underlying health conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension, which increase the risk of serious illness Prof Chris Whitty, the UK's chief medical adviser, welcomed the research. ""With evidence showing that people from BAME backgrounds are more severely affected by Covid-19, it is critical that we understand what factors are driving this risk to address them effectively,"" he said. ""The diverse range of projects funded will help examine this association in detail so that new treatments and approaches to care can be developed to target BAME groups."" The projects include: a study looking at age, gender and deprivation data on more than two million health and social-care workers. The study will also follow 30,000 doctors, nurses, porters and cleaners of all ethnic backgrounds over the course of a year and look at workplace routines, such as redeployments and the provision of protective equipment Oxford and Southampton University teams will look at the health conditions of BAME patients who were treated in hospital and died from Covid-19, using a database of 40 million GP records across England a project analysing information gathered by the UK Biobank project, which has been monitoring the genetics, mental wellbeing and physical activity of 500,000 people since 2006 and collects blood, urine and saliva samples. Dr Manish Pareek, an associate clinical professor at the University of Leicester, is leading the study of health and social-care workers. He says the aim is to quantify the risk for different groups. ""What is the risk of a doctor from an Asian group compared with that of a nurse of black ethnicity? ""If there is a clear signal we are seeing that a particular group is at high risk we will put these forward and recommend action be taken. This may include enhanced health assessments or that those at really high risk should not be working in Covid wards."" He added: ""Even taking into account factors such as deprivation, household structure, age and gender, ethnicity is still is an important predictor of getting infected and having adverse outcomes."" Prof Dame Ottoline Leyser, chief executive of the UK Research and Innovation agency, which has part-funded the research, along with the National Institute of Health Research, said the studies would lead to lives being saved. ""Urgent action must be taken to determine and address the factors underlying this disparity,"" she said. ""There is unlikely to be a simple answer and we must consider all possibilities, reflected in the range of projects we have funded, so that we can save as many lives as possible during this pandemic and any future outbreaks.""

"Oldham has brought in new measures in a bid to avoid a local lockdown New measures to stop the spread of Covid-19 have been introduced in Oldham following a ""dramatic"" rise in cases. Residents are being asked not to have social visitors to their homes and to keep two metres apart when outside. Anyone shielding has been asked to continue to do so until 14 August and care homes will not relax restrictions. The new measures are essential to prevent a ""strict local lockdown""like in Leicester,Oldham Council's deputy leader councillor Arooj Shah said. ""The best way to avoid infection is to limit contact with others as much as possible and to stay home wherever you can, including working from home,"" she added. Many aspects of the coronavirus lockdownhave now eased across the UKbut certain areas have introduced new measures to halt the spread of the virus. Oldham followsRochdale, its neighbouring Greater Manchester borough, andBlackburn with DarwenandPendlein Lancashire, in introducing new restrictions. The new restrictions were agreed ""after the number of cases of coronavirus in the borough increased dramatically over the last week"", Oldham Council said. Two weeks ago Oldham was on Public Health England's (PHE) ""watchlist"" as an area of concern but was removed last Thursday. Data published on Tuesday evening by PHE is showing another spike, with 119 cases recorded in the week to 24 July equivalent to more than 50 per 100,000 population. The week before saw 26 cases recorded. Oldham has England's third highest rate of new cases per 100,000 people for the week to 24 July. PHE's data shows the number of new cases for the week has risen to 119, with a further 30 cases already recorded for 25 and 26 July. Blackburn with Darwen recorded 77.2 cases per 100,000 population in the week to 24 July, followed by Leicester with 61.9 and Oldham with 50.5. Bradford is fourth with 46.4 per 100,000 and Hyndburn in Lancashire is fifth with 39.6 per 100,000. Nick Triggle, BBC Health correspondent The action being taken in Oldham is, unfortunately, the way of life now. With infection levels low, health officials want to quickly stamp down on any signs of local flare ups. The rate of new infections is about three times lower than it was in Leicester when a local lockdown was announced. But the point is it had started rising rapidly in Oldham. By taking what may seem like small extra precautions, the council will be hoping it has a profound impact on the way people are behaving. There seems to be some real hotspots in the north west of England and parts of the Midlands at the moment. It is unclear exactly why, although there is certainly a link to deprivation. People living in closer quarters and working in manual jobs where it is harder to social distance are factors in why infections are bucking the trend. There is also concern the way public health messaging has been communicated has not been as effective in areas with a higher proportion of ethnic minorities, where English may not be the first language. The next few weeks will prove crucial for not just Oldham, but other areas too. Oldham Council said a ""significant proportion"" of recent cases involve multiple people testing positive within a household. This shows that the spread within a household is a ""real issue"", the council added. Katrina Stephens, director of Public Health for Oldham, urged residents to ""all do our bit and stick to the restrictions,"" adding ""we can help stop the spread of coronavirus, and protect ourselves and our loved ones"".

"MacKenzie Scott with ex-husband Jeff Bezos prior to their split MacKenzie Scott, Amazon boss Jeff Bezos's ex-wife, says that she has given $1.7bn (Â£1.3bn) to charity to date. She has made donations to historically black US colleges, climate change groups and health organisations. Ms Scott posted about the gifts on social media, also saying that she has changed her surname from Bezos. She is the second-richest woman in the world, with a fortune of more than $62bn, according to Forbes. She and Mr Bezos divorced last year. The novelist, who married Mr Bezos a year before he founded Amazon and was one of the firm's first employees, received a 4% stake after the split. Shortly after announcing the divorce, Ms Scott signed the Giving Pledge, joining a campaign founded by billionaire investor Warren Buffett and ex-Microsoft boss Bill Gates and his wife Melinda. It commits the wealthy to give away the majority of their fortunes to charity. Ms Scott said she had ""watched the first half of 2020 with a mixture of heartbreak and horror"" and was providing an update on the donations to draw attention to the causes during the coronavirus pandemic. ""My own reflection after recent events revealed a dividend of privilege I'd been overlooking: the attention I can call to organizations and leaders driving change,""she wrote in a blog post on Medium,external.

Ms Scott's announcement comes the day before Mr Bezos is scheduled to testify before US lawmakers in Washington. The hearing is part of a wider investigation into the power held by tech giants, including Amazon, Google and Facebook. Amazon in particular has been under fire in recent months, including from its own staff, over its environmental record and coronavirus safety measures. The online giant has faced calls to be broken up,including from Tesla boss Elon Musk. Mr Bezos, the richest man in the world, has also been subject to personal criticism for not giving away more of his wealth. In 2018, he established a charitable fund with a starting pledge of $2bn.This year, he committed $10bn to fight climate changeand $100m to hunger relief fund, Feeding America. MacKenzie Bezos: Novelist and Amazon shareholder worth $35.6bn Amazon's Jeff Bezos: The richest person in the world Amazon's hand-washing policy in spotlight He has not joined the Giving Pledge. As well as Ms Scott, other signatories include Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and wife Priscilla Chan, Elon Musk and eBay founder Pierre Omidyar and wife Pam. Ms Scott said she had given more than $586m to racial justice organisations and $399.5m to groups aimed at advancing economic mobility. Other causes included gender equality, global development and LGBTQ equality. The list of organisations includes those linked to former US presidents Barack Obama and George W Bush, the labour advocacy group One Fair Wage, and other non-profits such as Black Girls Who Code. The $20m gift to Tuskegee University, a historically black college, is the largest in the school's history, president Lily McNair said. Allow Twitter content?

""There's no question in my mind that anyone's personal wealth is the product of a collective effort, and of social structures which present opportunities to some people, and obstacles to countless others,"" Ms Scott wrote in a blog post on Medium. The groups ""offer an opportunity to invest our good fortune in change, no matter what form our good fortune has taken"", she added. Ms Scott's approach differs from that of many other high-profile billionaires, said Brian Mittendorf, a professor at Ohio State University, who researches charity finances. He said announcements are often built up in advance, with donors opting to create new organisations to distribute funds, which can make it more difficult to see how the money is being put to use. ""If the goal of doing this was to generate publicity, you wouldn't have done it the way she did,"" he said. ""If the goal was to generate impact... this looks like a pretty good way of doing it."" The donations come at a time of need as many charities are seeing a spike in demand due to the pandemic as gifts from smaller donors are declining, Prof. Mittendorf said. The list of recipients suggests Ms Scott is trying to address root causes of inequality and racial injustice - priorities that are ""more typical"" of female than male donors, said Una Osili, a professor of economics and philanthropic studies at Indiana University's Lily School of Philanthropy. The effort to promote a diverse group of organisations - both big and small, led by people of colour and women, also stands out, she said.

"This video can not be played US President Trump on Dr Fauci's approval rating: ""Nobody likes me"" US President Donald Trump has again defended the use of hydroxychloroquine to ward off coronavirus, contradicting his own public health officials. He said the malaria medication was only rejected as a Covid-19 treatment because he had recommended its use. His remarks come after Twitter banned his eldest son for posting a clip promoting hydroxychloroquine. There is no evidence the drug can fight the virus, and regulators warn it may cause heart problems. On Wednesday Dr Anthony Fauci, a leading member of the White House coronavirus task force, told the BBC that hydroxychloroquine was not effective against the virus. ""We know that every single good study - and by good study I mean randomised control study in which the data are firm and believable - has shown that hydroxychloroquine is not effective in the treatment of Covid-19,"" he said. Last month, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)cautioned against using the drug to treat coronavirus patients,external, following reports of ""serious heart rhythm problems"" and other health issues. The FDA also revoked its emergency-use authorisation for the drug to treat Covid-19. The World Health Organization (WHO) says ""there is currently no proof"" that it is effective as a treatment or prevents Covid-19. In other developments: Coronavirus deaths in the US reached 149,250, according to Johns Hopkins University, as states in the south and west, including Florida and California, reported record daily death tolls. But Mr Trump claimed that large parts of the US were ""corona-free"" The US biotech company Moderna said its experimental coronavirus vaccine had induced a strong immune response in a study on monkeys. It said the vaccine protected against infection in the lungs and nose, and prevented lung disease Better known for making cameras,Kodak has moved into drug making and has just secured a $765m (Â£592m) loan from the US government.The fallen giant of the photography industry will make ingredients used in generic drugs to help fight the virus Studies commissioned by the WHO, the US National Institutes of Health and other researchers around the world have found no evidence that hydroxychloroquine - when used with or without the antibiotic azithromycin, as repeatedly recommended by President Trump - helps treat coronavirus. Hydroxychloroquine was first touted by Mr Trump in March. Two months later he surprised journalists by saying he had begun taking the unproven medication to ward off the virus. Why a video promoted by Trump was pulled on social media Madonna's Instagram flagged over conspiracy video The millions of Americans 'hanging by a thread' What do we know about hydroxychloroquine? On Tuesday the president told reporters at the White House: ""I can only say that from my standpoint, and based on a lot of reading and a lot of knowledge about it, I think it could have a very positive impact in the early stages. ""I don't think you lose anything by doing it, other than politically it doesn't seem too popular."" He added: ""When I recommend something, they like to say 'don't use it'."" The comments were made as he prepared to visit Odessa, Texas for a fundraising event on Wednesday, despite concerns over surges of Covid-19 cases in the state. Joe Biden, Mr Trump's presumptive rival in the November general election, criticised the trip. ""Texas families are suffering. They're suffering because President Trump's inability to lead this country and combat the spread of Covid-19,"" Mr Biden said. President Trump and his son Donald Trump Jr were among social media users who shared video late on Monday of a group called America's Frontline Doctors advocating hydroxychloroquine as a Covid-19 treatment. Facebook and Twitter removed the content, flagging it as misinformation, but not before more than 17 million people had seen one of the clips. Twitter also banned the US president's eldest son from tweeting for 12 hours as a penalty for sharing the clip. In the past, Twitter has declined to remove tweets by President Trump himself and other world leaders, citing public interest and newsworthiness. This video can not be played 'Weâre still waiting at home for them to come back' The video in question showed doctors speaking outside the US Supreme Court building at an event organised by Tea Party Patriots Action, a group that has helped fund a pro-Trump political action committee. In the video, Dr Stella Immanuel, a doctor from Houston, says she has successfully treated 350 coronavirus patients ""and counting"" with hydroxychloroquine. The president said on Tuesday: ""I think they're very respected doctors. There was a woman who was spectacular in her statements about it."" This video can not be played The lost six weeks when the US failed to control the virus According to the Daily Beast,external, Dr Immanuel has previously claimed the government is run by ""reptilians"" and that scientists are developing a vaccine to stop people being religious, among other bizarre views. America's Frontline Doctors' founder Simone Gold accused social media companies of censorship for removing the hydroxychloroquine video. ""Treatment options for COVID-19 should be debated, and spoken about among our colleagues in the medical field,"" she tweeted. ""They should never, however, be censored and silenced."" This video can not be played 'We already lost prom and graduation...' Late on Monday, Mr Trump also retweeted several tweets critical of Dr Fauci. But in Tuesday's briefing the president denied he was criticising the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, insisting: ""I get along with him very well."" Asked about hydroxychloroquine earlier on Tuesday, Dr Fauci said the medication was not an appropriate treatment for Covid-19. This video can not be played Why the US struggled with its reopening He told ABC News' morning show that the drug was ""not effective in coronavirus disease"".

"This video can not be played Prince William takes a curry delivery for Peter Crouch The guest on this week's That Peter Crouch Podcast is none other than Prince William. As president of the Football Association, the Duke of Cambridge has been keen to use his role to start conversations around mental health, including helping to rename the 2020 FA Cup final theHeads Up FA Cup final. ""We're hoping that renaming it is a big enough statement that the UK will show the world, and the football world in particular, that mental health really matters,"" William - making his first appearance on a podcast - tells Crouch. The podcast team met William at Kensington Palace before lockdown - and even shared a curry - before a follow-up Zoom call this month. Here are the highlights: Download the full episode here Prince William says he finds it very important to talk to people about football Asked if football is his ""release"", William replies: ""It is now. Since becoming a dad, without a doubt, football has become way more important than it used to be. ""I need to go and be amongst other guys and let out some steam, shout a bit,"" he explains, joking he stops short of abusing the referee. ""I'm the president of the FA and I can't do that!"" William adds: ""It has become a lot more relevant to me and I need it. Talking about football helps a lot."" Later in the podcast, he says: ""This period of time has allowed us to all revalue things. The thing about lockdown is that it has been a little bit of an awakening that we maybe take our lives a bit for granted sometimes and there's a lot of things out there that can wobble all of us at any time. ""I think particularly now, as a parent, it starts to make you look a bit more to the future at what kind of world we are going to hand over to the next generation. There's been a lot of time to think - and you can also have too much time to think, and that's also what worries me."" William says he really missed football during its hiatus. ""I was trying to pretend I didn't care too much it wasn't around,"" he says. ""But by the end of the third weekend, I was really missing it. It just goes with the weekend."" And he's all for having crowd noise in empty stadiums. ""It's better than hearing the players puffing and swearing at each other,"" he says. What are among the things a royal worries about during lockdown? Home-schooling and keeping young kids entertained, apparently. ""I found it pretty testing, trying to keep the children engaged and interested in some sort of work,"" he says. ""It's been an interesting few months. ""I've learned my patience is a lot shorter than I thought it was! That's probably the biggest eye-opener for me, and my wife has super patience."" He goes on to admit he's struggled with year two maths. Comforting. This video can not be played Prince William is asked whether his son Prince George could be a professional footballer. Prince William is famously a Villa fan. He says he fell in love during his first trip to an FA Cup game - Villa against Bolton - when he was 11. ""I sat there among all the Villa fans and I loved it. I thought the atmosphere was great,"" he recalls. He says at the time he ""desperately"" didn't want to support ""someone like Manchester United or Chelsea"" - like everyone else at school did. He was also attracted to Villa's proud history - William was born in 1982, when they, as English champions, won the European Cup. ""I felt a real connection with the club,"" he says. ""I felt Villa was a very proud Midlands club and it felt very special. ""Only in the last few years have I got a grip of Villa as my real team and I watch them a lot and I get into the stats."" After being put on the spot, William says he's the only person in his team who wears shin pads. There is a good reason. ""In school, I basically got targeted the whole time,"" says William, who says he usually plays at right-back. Apparently, aged 15, he once asked a police officer with him to use a laser pen and 'red dot' one of the opposition players. ""I kept saying to him, 'see, he's following you',"" William laughed: ""It put him off for about 10 minutes!"" When Crouch and the team ask William if - in his role as president of the FA - he might get rid of Gareth Southgate were England to have a bad run of games, he concedes that ""that might be a bit difficult!"". ""Gareth is a legend, I really like Gareth and I think he's doing a great job with the England team,"" he says. ""That's not to say that conversations haven't been had where I give him a little nudge and say: 'Why isn't Grealish in the England squad?'"" he jokes. ""That would be the end of my life - you'd never see me on a balcony again,"" he says. ""I'd be locked in."" William tells a great story about watching Blackpool, then managed by Ian Holloway, on a stag do with friends from the Royal Air Force. Apparently the manager came to meet the group at half-time, which William says surprised him - given he should probably have been delivering his team talk at that point. ""He was just like, 'there's no point doing a team talk, they're not listening anyway',"" William says. When the team talked about bad presents they had given their wives, William admitted he once bought the Duchess of Cambridge a pair binoculars, despite her not being a keen birdwatcher. ""That was early on in the courtship. I think that sealed the deal,"" he jokes. ""I even tried convincing myself by saying: 'These are amazing, look how far you can see.'"" Asked about Kate's reaction to the gift, he said: ""Kate opened them and said: 'But they're binoculars, what's going on?''"" ""They deliberately keep me away from that. When Liverpool won that amazing Champions League semi-final against Barcelona [in May 2019], I grabbed hold of the Twitter thing and just posted. ""It was an amazing match, I was blown away by it. It was one of the best games of football I've ever seen. I got completely out of control. I was like: 'Tweet that! Get it out!' ""And nearly every Villa match we've won  - which isn't many this season - I've been trying to get hold of it, but they keep it away from me now."" ""I've met a lot of players. It's very interesting, how different sports and different teams behave in a changing room,"" William says. ""Whenever I go into the England dressing room there does always feel a lot more pressure. I don't know what it is, but you do notice guys find it much more difficult to relax. ""We talk about physical fitness. We never really talk about mental fitness. We all need to stay mentally fit, none more so than professional athletes who - under special circumstances playing for England under huge pressure - have got to have their heads razor sharp as well as their feet and legs."" This video can not be played ""People talk about physical fitness, we never really talk about mental fitness"" And the answer to the question you never realised that you had always wanted to know. It would be Queen, wouldn't it? ""It's one of the few songs I know all the lyrics to,"" he explains.

"This video can not be played Virgin Galactic gives a glimpse of what it will look like inside the Unity vehicle Virgin Galactic is about to start a key series of powered test flights of its passenger rocket plane. The company's Unity vehicle has so far conducted only glide flights after moving into its operational base in New Mexico earlier this year. The powered ascents will see Unity ignite its hybrid rocket motor to climb to the edge of space. These tests will set the stage for Virgin Galactic to introduce its commercial service. Branson space rocket fails on debut flight Virgin spaceship moves to operational base Virgin's Unity plane rockets skyward Six hundred individuals have so far paid deposits to take a ride on Unity, with many of these individuals having put down their money a good number of years ago. But George Whitesides, the company's chief space officer, said their wait would soon be over. ""Our next flight will be just purely two pilots in the front to do a systems check,"" he told BBC News. ""And then, once we've done that - well, we're in pretty exciting territory because the plan is to start putting [four of our] people in the back. We haven't shared exactly how many flights that will be because we've got to see how it goes. But it could be a fairly small number."" Commercial service would begin thereafter. Artwork: The cabin has a big mirror at the rear so passengers can see themselves weightless To whet the appetite of its would-be astronauts, Virgin Galactic released details on Tuesday of the look of Unity's six-person passenger cabin. It's a collaborative effort with the London design agency Seymourpowell. Individually sized seats will move to manage G-forces in the different phases of flight - on the boost up to space and on the descent back to Earth. Personal seat-back screens will display live flight data, and the 12 large windows will ensure no passenger ever has to compete for a view when they unbuckle at the top of the climb to float free inside the cabin. Sixteen cameras will also capture and record their experience. ""This is going to be the most amazing cabin ever to fly in space,"" enthused Mr Whitesides, who recently stepped aside from the CEO role. ""We've got this amazing mirror in the back of the cabin. I think that's going to be one of the coolest things because people will have the experience of being able to see themselves in space."" Virgin Galactic already has its commercial operating licence from the US Federal Aviation Administration, but it has to work through a list of ""verification and validation"" milestones before it can welcome passengers aboard. The company also needs to practise the cabin procedures that will keep those passengers safe and ensure they get the most pleasurable ride possible. The upcoming powered flights are in large part about locking down these procedures. As well as installing ex-Disney Parks president Michael Colglazier as the new chief executive, Virgin Galactic has signed a couple of agreements recently with the US space agency. These will see Galactic work with Nasa on developing technologies for advanced passenger flight at supersonic and hypersonic speeds; and on efforts to further commercialise activities in low-Earth orbit. Virgin Galactic was founded in 2004 by British entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson. His goal was to take the concept behindSpaceShipOne, the first private rocket plane to reach sub-orbital space,externalthat same year, and turn it into a ""tourist"" venture. But developing this idea has proven extremely difficult, technically. Barring any unexpected events in the next few months, however, Sir Richard does now seem very close to realising his dream.

"This video can not be played Amber Heard's statement outside court in July An article in the Sun describing Johnny Depp as a ""wife-beater"" was ""one-sided"" and ""not researched at all"", the actor's lawyer told the High Court. In closing submissions for Mr Depp, David Sherborne said the paper acted as ""both judge and jury"". Mr Depp is suing the newspaper's publisher and editor for libel, saying the allegation is ""completely untrue"". The Sun's lawyers said on Monday there was ""no doubt"" he had ""systematically abused"" his former wife Amber Heard. What is libel and how does it work? Heard: I loved Depp, but he could be a monster Video shows Heard 'attacked' sister - Depp lawyers Around 30 fans of the actor were gathered in the main hall of the Royal Courts of Justice and screamed as the 57-year-old Hollywood star entered the building on the final day of the most high-profile British libel case so far in the 21st Century. Mr Depp is suing News Group Newspapers (NGN) - publisher of the Sun - and executive editor Dan Wootton over an article published on the Sun's website on 27 April 2018 with the headline: ""Gone Potty: How can JK Rowling be 'genuinely happy' casting wife beater Johnny Depp in the new Fantastic Beasts film?"" Mr Sherborne told the court the article meant Mr Depp was ""guilty, on overwhelming evidence, of serious domestic violence"" against Ms Heard, an actress and model, during their marriage. He said it meant that the actor was unfit to work in the film industry and had paid Â£5m to compensate Ms Heard for causing significant injuries and making her fear for her life. Crowds of reporters and fans surrounded Mr Depp as he arrived at court It also suggests Mr Depp had been ""tried, convicted and sentenced"", his barrister said. Mr Sherborne referred sarcastically to the ""journalistic excellence"" the Sun was seeking to defend and said ""this court has not heard from a single journalist"" about the article. It was presented in a ""deliberately and wholly one-sided manner"", although Mr Depp had never faced any criminal charge of violence against Ms Heard, the lawyer said. He said Mr Depp knows the allegations are ""completely untrue"", as do the friends and other witnesses who testified during the three-week case. ""Why else would Mr Depp, this private man as he explained, expose all the most intimate details of his personal life?"" Mr Sherborne said. Mr Sherborne said the publisher relied on evidence from Ms Heard, ""a complex individual with a complex history"". ""We say from the big points even to the smaller ones, Ms Heard has proven herself to be a wholly unreliable witness and, frankly, a compulsive liar - and I don't say that lightly,"" he said. He said she ""blatantly lied"" in her evidence, ""invented incidents"" and ""improvised allegations"" such as Mr Depp allegedly attacking a flight attendant, which had not been mentioned before in seven witness statements. Mr Sherborne said originally the Sun had relied on two alleged violent incidents, which had been mentioned in Ms Heard's application for a restraining order. But those had now risen to 14 ""far more serious, more horrific allegations"", the lawyer said. ""I stand by my testimony,"" Ms Heard said in a statement outside court ""It is quite clear that they do not add up, so what does Ms Heard do? She invents more, sometimes by retro-engineering texts she has seen,"" the lawyer said. He said audio recordings also revealed Ms Heard making a ""straightforward, unambiguous, unequivocal admission of hitting"" Mr Depp. ""Her physical violence towards him, her starting physical violence as she admits, make her the domestic abuser, not him,"" said Mr Sherborne. In a statement outside court as the hearing ended, Ms Heard said that despite the ""significance"" of the case she would have preferred not to have had to be involved in it, adding that, after obtaining a restraining order against Mr Depp in 2016, she had ""just wanted to move on with my life"". She added: ""It has been incredibly painful to relive the break-up of my relationship, to have my motives and my truth questioned, and the most traumatic, intimate details of my life with Johnny shared in court and broadcast to the entire world,"" she said. ""I stand by my testimony and I now place my faith in British justice."" On Monday, the legal team for NGN made its closing submissions, defending the Sun's article as true. Sasha Wass, representing the publisher, said: ""Having heard all the evidence in this case and all the supporting evidence of the incidents of violence, we suggest that there is no doubt that Mr Depp regularly and systematically abused his wife. ""The characterisation that he is a wife-beater is entirely truthful."" She said Mr Depp's lifestyle, ""surrounded by a clique of ageing, male rabble-rousers with alcohol and drugs shared together"", was ""destroying his life, his career and his health"". Ms Wass said the actor had sought stability with Ms Heard, but ""he grew to hate her for her protectiveness"" and resented her telling him how he could end his addiction. ""Mr Depp has spent his entire adult life doing exactly what he wanted, and he was not about to answer to a woman at this stage in his life,"" she said. Mr Depp waved at fans and supporters as he arrived in court for the final day of his libel case The lawyer for NGN presented the relationship as a generational clash between a ""modern and ambitious woman"" and a ""self-scripted Southern gentleman"" who ""required a supplicant wife"". She said Mr Depp did not expect his wife to continue working with ""young and attractive actors"". Ms Wass said the Hollywood star was subject to ""irrational mood swings and abnormal behavioural patterns"" because of his substance abuse. She told the court he gave these changes in behaviour a nickname - ""The Monster"". She also said Mr Depp's memory of his ""disgraceful conduct"" was ""so severely impaired by drug misuse that he may not even have been aware of the extent of his violence and terrifying behaviour"". In more than one incident, Ms Heard was put in fear of her life, the lawyer said. Mr Justice Nicol has said that his judgement will be reserved for a later date. What is libel and how does it work?

"Twitter has banned the US president's eldest son from tweeting for 12 hours. The action followed a post by Donald Trump Jr containing a video clip discussing the benefits of hydroxychloroquine. Some, including President Trump, have suggested the anti-malaria drug works as a preventative measure against coronavirus, despite medical studies that indicate the contrary. Twitter said the post had violated its Covid-19 misinformation rules. Donald Trump Jr will still be able to browse Twitter and send direct messages in the interim. Twitter told the BBC: ""We are taking action in line with our policy."" The main US social media sites have all taken measures to crack down on misinformation about the coronavirus. Donald Trump Jr has 5.3 million followers Andy Surabian, a spokesman for Donald Trump Jr told the BBC the decision had been ""beyond the pale"". ""Twitter suspending Don Jr for sharing a viral video of medical professionals discussing their views on hydroxychloroquine is further proof that big tech is intent on killing free expression online, and is another instance of them committing election interference to stifle Republican voices,"" he said. ""While there is indeed much disagreement in the medical community about the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in treating coronavirus, there have been studies reported by mainstream outlets like CNN, suggesting that it may in fact by an effective treatment. ""Those pretending otherwise are lying for political reasons."" By Marianna Spring, Specialist disinformation and social media reporter This is the latest move by Twitter to crack down on coronavirus misinformation - and the latest escalation in its clash with President Trump and his allies. This latest step to restrict the account of the President's son will no doubt add fuel to the fire, with more cries of censorship from the President's supporters. Misleading, harmful claims about hydroxychloroquine have been promoted by public figures and politicians throughout the pandemic. Discussions about the drug have become just as polarised as the ongoing debate about masks that is happening online. The video shared by Donald Trump Jr yesterday was emblematic of this, featuring people claiming to be doctors who support Trump. They suggested that studies indicating the drug was not effective were ""fake science"". With pressure mounting on social media sites to act more quickly and decisively about coronavirus misinformation, this move perhaps should not come as a surprise. But Twitter has not flagged claims the US President has made about hydroxychlorquine himself. Where it opts to draw the line will be a difficult - and politicised - decision. In signs that the conflict between Trump and Twitter is not abating, the President has asked the National Telecommunications and Information Administration to file a petition to look at how social media companies moderate content. The petition asks the Federal Communications Commission to reconsider rules that shield social media providers from liability for content posted by their users, but still let them remove posts they deem to be objectionable.

"The National Trust is a charity that looks after places of historic interest and natural beauty The UK's National Trust is among a growing list of organisations to issue data breach alerts after an attack on cloud computing provider Blackbaud. Others include homeless charities The Wallich and Crisis, the terminal illness charity Sue Ryder, and the mental health group Young Minds. The UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) told the BBC that 125 organisations had reported to it in relation to the incident ""so far"". They include dozens of universities. And internationally, museums, schools, churches and food banks have also been affected. ""BlackBaud has reported a data breach incident which has potentially affected a large number of UK organisations using its services and we are making enquiries,"" a spokeswoman for the ICO said. ""Organisations involved should be getting in touch with their customers to inform them if their personal data has been impacted."" The BBC has also been told that as of 29 July, 33 charities had also reported related incidents to the UK's Charities Commission. The National Trust said that data about its volunteering and fundraising communities had been involved, but not that of its wider 5.6 million members. The organisation - which looks after historic buildings and gardens - added that an internal investigation was under way to assess if further action was needed. ""We are currently in the process of identifying and informing those affected,"" Jon Townsend, the trust's chief information officer, explained. ""We have reported the incident to the UK's regulator for data protection, the Information Commissioner's Office and the Charity Commission.""Â The University of Newcastlewas another body to make a public disclosure,externalafter being contacted by the BBC. ""We were made aware of a security incident involving a service provider we use, Blackbaud, one ofÂ the world's largest providers of alumni database software,"" said a spokeswoman. ""We apologise for any concern or inconvenience caused... and we have initiated a security review."" Other universities have said that data on current staff and students was involved, in addition to that of past graduates. Blackbaud has said that it became aware of the matter in May, and subsequently paid the attackers a ransom. However, the US firm only advised its clients of the breach this month, which is why notices are only now being sent to members of the public. Some of them specifically makemention of two of Blackbaud's platforms,external- Raiser's Edge and NetCommunity - which are commonly used to keep track of donors and the sums they have given. Blackbaud markets its software as a way to find ""untapped potential in your existing donor database"" Blackbaud has said the data did not include bank account or payment card details. But a source has told the BBC that in some cases it involved donors details including: names, ages and addresses car licence details employers estimated wealth and identified assets total number and value of past donations to the organisation in question wider history of philanthropic and political gifts spouses' identity and past gift-giving likelihood to make a bequest triggered by their death Although Blackbaud has said the cyber-criminals had providedconfirmation that the stolen data was destroyed,external, one expert questioned whether such an assurance could be trusted. ""The hackers would know these people have a propensity to support good causes,"" commented Pat Walshe from the consultancy Privacy Matters. This would be valuable information to fraudsters, he added, who could use it to fool victims into thinking they were making further donations when in fact they would be giving away their payment card details. Mr Walshe also questioned if there had been a breach of the GDPR privacy law, which requires major personal data breaches to be flagged to regulators within 72 hours of discovery. Blackbaud has said that at ""every point we were working closely with law enforcement and other specialists"". ""We take our regulatory responsibilities seriously and comply with GDPR at all times, including in this instance,"" the company told the BBC. However, neither it nor the ICO has yet revealed when the UK watchdog was notified. Blackbaud has declined to name or number the organisations impacted, beyond saying it is a ""subset"" of its thousands of clients. However, the BBC has identified some of these by contacting them directly and tracking down online notices of the security breaches. The problem is so widespread across the higher education sector that some universities -including the University of Edinburgh,externalandAston University, Birmingham,external- have posted notices to say their data was not involved. Some schools have also been affected,including St Albans in Hertfordshire,external, Radley College in Abingdon, and St Aloysius in Glasgow. ACS International, which teaches children in London, Surrey and Qatar,has also said there is a ""low threat"" risk,externalto its ""alumni's and friends' information"". In addition, Maccabi GB - an organisation that provides services to 44 Jewish primary and secondary schools -has told supporters their data was among that compromised,external. Beyond the UK, Hungary's Central European University is among those to have confirmed involvement. New Zealand's University of Auckland and the National University of Ireland Galaway have also contacted alumni and donors. But the other international organisations confirmed by the BBC have all been US and Canada-based.

"Rapper Wiley sent messages naming his Jewish critics on Facebook following an anti-Semitic tirade Facebook has deleted the accounts of rapper Wiley after he shared abusive posts aimed at his Jewish critics and others. His comments came after an anti-Semitic tirade on Twitter. He has also been banned from that network. The BBC found Facebook posts under his real name Richard Kylea Cowie. He specifically named Jewish celebrities - including Lord Alan Sugar, comedian David Baddiel and BBC presenter Emma Barnett. A Facebook spokesperson said Wiley's account was removed for ""repeated violations"" of its policies. After the BBC contacted the social network to ask about the recent posts, it initially suspended, then deleted the grime artist's Facebook and Instagram profiles. The BBC has contacted the musician for comment. The posts aimed abuse at Jewish celebrities who had expressed their dismay about Wiley's tweets. Several of his posts mentioned ""Golders Green"" - a London neighbourhood with a large Jewish community. Wiley's personal Facebook page, where he has been posting abuse about Jewish critics Wiley wrote: ""Listen Golders Green ring my sister and let's meet asap""; ""David Baddiel come and talk to my face""; and ""Who called the police? Are you from Golders Green? I am coming to sit down with you... Labyrinth you could come along as you have forgotten what colour you are.""

Several of Wiley's tweets were taken down and his Twitter account was suspended - initially a temporary measure - after he went on ananti-Semitic tirade on Friday. One tweet read: ""I don't care about Hitler, I care about black people"", and compared the Jewish community to the Ku Klux Klan. Most of the posts spread anti-Semitic tropes.

has warned there are signs of a second wave of the virus in parts of Europe and
further quarantines for holidaymakers could be on the cards. Meanwhile here in Scotland First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is ""increasingly concerned"" about the risk from coronavirus after a ""worrying resurgence"" in several other countries. We'll be back with more live coverage in the morning. Have a good evening and stay safe. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Donald Macaskill, chief executive
of Scottish Care, which represents the private care home sector, believes a ""root and branch review"" is required to decide how much the public purse should provide to the sector. Most care is delivered by private
and charitable organisations on behalf of the state, he points out, with staff pay pegged to the minimum wage and the Scottish living wage. Just how much do we value care? At the moment you can get more money by walking a dog in Edinburgh than you can for caring for a human being.â Donald Macaskill, Scottish Care Less than 16% of Scotlandâs care homes are owned by the 'big five' chains -  which include wealthy equity firms - with the vast majority owned by private family-owned businesses, Mr Macaskill adds. ""The vast majority deliver excellent care. This isnât an issue of individuals seeking profit; itâs an issue of the failure to value care."" You can watch the BBC Scotland documentary,The Care Home Scandal,on BBC One tonight at 22:45 or on the BBC iPlayer. If you are just joining us here are the main points from today's Scottish government coronavirus briefing: There were nearly 200 warnings about staff shortages in care homes in Scotland during lockdown, according to the Care Inspectorate. Their figures have been published for the first time, following a BBC Freedom of Information request. Care homes had to flag up red and amber staffing alerts to inspectors for eleven weeks from the start of April. Thirty red warnings were issued - this meant homes didnât have enough staff to properly care for their residents. This video can not be played Coronavirus in care homes: ''Thousands are dead, it's too little, too late' The Care Inspectorate received another one hundred and forty-nine amber warnings that staffing was stretched and close to impacting on the quality of care.

Mr Briggs denied the situation arose from Conservative government cuts a decade ago, insisting there have been record amounts of money invested by the UK and Scottish governments in the social care network. ""We didnât have the workforce
in place in Scotland; we need to really  tackle that at the end of this
crisis,"" he told BBC Radio Scotland. ""The care home sector should
have been put on the same emergency response as our NHS. We should have seen testing
and PPE put in place on the same levels for the care home sector. ""That way we could
have tried to prevent the infections that we saw."" Mr Briggs added he does not think Scotland is ""in a good place"" in preparations for a possible second
wave of infections, especially care homes that have not seen any infections. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Nicola Sturgeon was âreally bluntâ in saying she âwouldnât be
booking a foreign holiday right nowâ at her briefing earlier and people should be âvery cautious about
non-essential foreign travel right nowâ. Shona Thorne, from Thorne Travel in Ayrshire, said agents were ""extremely disappointed"" in the first minister's response. ""Weâve always said if itâs not
safe, we shouldnât be flying,"" she told BBC Radio Scotland. ""The government then said it is safe to fly, and we
have followed all the guidelines. ""For the first minister to then say she wouldnât
be recommending it seems very, very strange indeed."" Ms Thorne says the travel industry needs more information about how decisions are being made - ""Are we going for figures, projected figures, the R number?"" - and called for regional strategies for each country rather than blanket bans. ""The Canary Islands are closer to Africa than Spain, so it doesn't make logical sense, or statistically,"" she adds. If we have a spike in Athens, does that mean all the islands should close? Should we say âdonât come to Scotland' if thereâs a spike in Blackpool?"" Shona Thorne, Travel agent  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

first minister warned earlier that although the majority of hospitality businesses are
following the rules, some guidance measures - such as seating
areas not being cleaned thoroughly, staff not wearing face coverings and contact details not being taken - are being breached. Paul Waterson from the Scottish Licensed
Trade Association, told BBC Radio Scotland Nicola Sturgeon's message was ""well made"" and something his organisation ""certainly supports"". ""We
have always said itâs very important we follow the rules and make sure
customers feel safe and comfortable and enjoy the experience,"" he says. ""That is what will
bring them back into your premises. ""If places are not doing basic stuff like taking details, wearing face masks, cleaning tables, then customers will not support them,
and theyâre right to do that. The guidance is clear and thereâs not really any excuse.""

The pandemic cost Â£248bn to the global tourism industry in lost revenue between January and May, according to the UN World Tourism Organization (UNWTO). In a report, the organisation said this loss was three times greater than that of the global financial crisis of 2009"". Tourist numbers also fell by 300 million during the period - a 56% drop from the same time last year - as lockdown measures brought a stop to international travel. âThis latest data makes clear the importance of restarting tourism as soon as it is safe to do so,"" said UNWTO Secretary-General Zurab Pololikashvili. ""The dramatic fall in international tourism places many millions of livelihoods at risk, including in developing countries."" Numerous studies have concluded that face masks can prevent people from spreading airway germs to others. But nowa new paper,external, due to be published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine, has found that masks also protect the people wearing them too - lessening the severity of symptoms, or preventing infection entirely in some cases. Using animal experiments and observations during the pandemic, the group of scientists says people wearing face coverings take in fewer coronavirus particles, making it easier for their immune systems to combat any viral spread. Dr. Tsion Firew, a doctor at Columbia University in the US - who wasnât involved in the work, - told the New York Times that a relationship between masking and milder disease had not yet been proven. But the new research paper âreiterates what we say about masks,â said Dr Firew. âItâs not just a selfless act.â  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The experience of people who were already marginalised and facing the most isolation during lockdown is to be researched at Glasgow University. A 25-member team is funded by the Scottish government until November to gather evidence from some of the poorest communities, refugees and asylum- eekers, victims of abuse, families with a parent in prison, and those who have been required to shield in their homes. The intention is to help guide Holyrood policy, and also to report on effective coping strategies and resilience among those facing some of the hardest circumstances. Angie BrownEdinburgh and East reporter A student visiting her mother in Spain fears she will relapse into depression on her return to Scotland following the reintroduction of quarantine for travellers from the country. Mirjana Gavrilovic Nilsson, 28, said she struggled during the four-month lockdown and could not do another two week-stint in her Edinburgh home. She said she felt anxious when the rule change was announced on Saturday. The PhD student is currently staying with her mother in Mallorca.

It said sales were running at 72% of 2019's level, with all but a handful of its 2,025 outlets now trading again. Although many people are still away from their workplaces, chief executive Roger Whiteside said Greggs was not that dependent on office workers and the vast majority of its customers ""simply can't work from home"". Mr Whiteside was speaking as Greggs unveiled a Â£65.2m loss for the first half of 2020. In the same period a year earlier, it made a profit of Â£36.7m.

"The National Trust is a charity that looks after places of historic interest and natural beauty The UK's National Trust is among a growing list of organisations to issue data breach alerts after an attack on cloud computing provider Blackbaud. Others include homeless charities The Wallich and Crisis, the terminal illness charity Sue Ryder, and the mental health group Young Minds. The UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) told the BBC that 125 organisations had reported to it in relation to the incident ""so far"". They include dozens of universities. And internationally, museums, schools, churches and food banks have also been affected. ""BlackBaud has reported a data breach incident which has potentially affected a large number of UK organisations using its services and we are making enquiries,"" a spokeswoman for the ICO said. ""Organisations involved should be getting in touch with their customers to inform them if their personal data has been impacted."" The BBC has also been told that as of 29 July, 33 charities had also reported related incidents to the UK's Charities Commission. The National Trust said that data about its volunteering and fundraising communities had been involved, but not that of its wider 5.6 million members. The organisation - which looks after historic buildings and gardens - added that an internal investigation was under way to assess if further action was needed. ""We are currently in the process of identifying and informing those affected,"" Jon Townsend, the trust's chief information officer, explained. ""We have reported the incident to the UK's regulator for data protection, the Information Commissioner's Office and the Charity Commission.""Â The University of Newcastlewas another body to make a public disclosure,externalafter being contacted by the BBC. ""We were made aware of a security incident involving a service provider we use, Blackbaud, one ofÂ the world's largest providers of alumni database software,"" said a spokeswoman. ""We apologise for any concern or inconvenience caused... and we have initiated a security review."" Other universities have said that data on current staff and students was involved, in addition to that of past graduates. Blackbaud has said that it became aware of the matter in May, and subsequently paid the attackers a ransom. However, the US firm only advised its clients of the breach this month, which is why notices are only now being sent to members of the public. Some of them specifically makemention of two of Blackbaud's platforms,external- Raiser's Edge and NetCommunity - which are commonly used to keep track of donors and the sums they have given. Blackbaud markets its software as a way to find ""untapped potential in your existing donor database"" Blackbaud has said the data did not include bank account or payment card details. But a source has told the BBC that in some cases it involved donors details including: names, ages and addresses car licence details employers estimated wealth and identified assets total number and value of past donations to the organisation in question wider history of philanthropic and political gifts spouses' identity and past gift-giving likelihood to make a bequest triggered by their death Although Blackbaud has said the cyber-criminals had providedconfirmation that the stolen data was destroyed,external, one expert questioned whether such an assurance could be trusted. ""The hackers would know these people have a propensity to support good causes,"" commented Pat Walshe from the consultancy Privacy Matters. This would be valuable information to fraudsters, he added, who could use it to fool victims into thinking they were making further donations when in fact they would be giving away their payment card details. Mr Walshe also questioned if there had been a breach of the GDPR privacy law, which requires major personal data breaches to be flagged to regulators within 72 hours of discovery. Blackbaud has said that at ""every point we were working closely with law enforcement and other specialists"". ""We take our regulatory responsibilities seriously and comply with GDPR at all times, including in this instance,"" the company told the BBC. However, neither it nor the ICO has yet revealed when the UK watchdog was notified. Blackbaud has declined to name or number the organisations impacted, beyond saying it is a ""subset"" of its thousands of clients. However, the BBC has identified some of these by contacting them directly and tracking down online notices of the security breaches. The problem is so widespread across the higher education sector that some universities -including the University of Edinburgh,externalandAston University, Birmingham,external- have posted notices to say their data was not involved. Some schools have also been affected,including St Albans in Hertfordshire,external, Radley College in Abingdon, and St Aloysius in Glasgow. ACS International, which teaches children in London, Surrey and Qatar,has also said there is a ""low threat"" risk,externalto its ""alumni's and friends' information"". In addition, Maccabi GB - an organisation that provides services to 44 Jewish primary and secondary schools -has told supporters their data was among that compromised,external. Beyond the UK, Hungary's Central European University is among those to have confirmed involvement. New Zealand's University of Auckland and the National University of Ireland Galaway have also contacted alumni and donors. But the other international organisations confirmed by the BBC have all been US and Canada-based. They include several cancer charities, human rights campaigns, public radio stations and religious groups, in addition to schools, colleges and universities.

"The seven women posed for photographs outside Milton Keynes Magistrates' Court A group of environmental campaigners who are accused of trying to stop a tree being chopped down to make way for HS2 have denied trespassing. The women, who dubbed themselves ""7 Sisters"", were accused of preventing contractors working at Poor's Piece in Steeple Claydon, Buckinghamshire. The group claim the 200-year-old oak tree, which is still standing, is home to species such as bats and red kites. They denied aggravated trespass and were bailed to face trial in January. The oak tree will be cut down to make way for the high-speed railway Milton Keynes Magistrates' Court was told that 30 police officers were sent to the camp set up next to the tree and that the women were held in cells for 12 hours after being arrested. The defendants are Miriam Instone, 22, Mina Jaf, 23, Jessica Walker, 29 and Samantha Smithson, 38, all of Poor's Piece, Steeple Claydon, Buckinghamshire Also accused are Imogen May, 48, of High Street, Crediton, Devon, Morgana Donfrancesco, 29, of Emlyn Road, Bristol, and Michelle MacDonagh, 33, whose address was not disclosed.

Our colleagues in London and around the world will be back with more for you on Wednesday. Until then, thanks for joining us and goodbye. As we near the end of our coverage, here is a quick summary of what's been happening around the UK today.  This video can not be played Living through lockdown when the love of your life is in a care home Here are some of the biggest global developments of the day: Most patients having planned surgery in England will no longer be told they need to isolate for two weeks before going into hospital. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence hasupdated its guidelines,externalfollowing a decline in coronavirus cases. Anyone having a non-emergency operation will need to have a Covid test three days before the procedure and isolate until they are admitted. The surgery will only go ahead if the test is negative. Most routine operations ground to a halt during the pandemic and it is hoped the changes will help clear the waiting list and also lead to more patients coming forward for treatment. Dr Layla McCay, director at the NHS Confederation, said: âWe have heard anecdotally from NHS leaders that some of their patients had been put off from coming in for planned treatments because of the blanket rule that required everyone to self-isolate at home for 14 days prior to their elective care, including those whose personal circumstances such as their employment would not easily allow it.â In Scotland the 14-day quarantine guidelines will remain and the rest of the UK is considering the advice. This video can not be played Return to Lombardy, the 'Wuhan of the West' Italy's Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has asked the country's parliament to approve extending a state of emergency until October. The current measure is due to expire at the end of the month. An extension would ensure existing decrees issued to fight the virus would continue in force. It gives greater powers to both state and central government and bolsters hospital resources. ""The virus continues to evolve and has not run its course,"" Mr Conte said earlier today. ""It would be incongruous to abruptly suspend such an effective measure."" The state of emergency enables central and regional governments to shut down areas in the event of further outbreaks. Some opposition groups say it would give Mr Conte too many powers. Italy's lockdown rules have now been largely regionalised but face masks are mandatory on public transport and in shops, and social distancing of one metre is required in public spaces. People who have been hospitalised with coronavirus are being warned that they could be at risk of sepsis. One in five people who required hospital treatment for Covid-19 are at risk from sepsis within a year of being discharged, according to the UK Sepsis Trust (UKST). Sepsis is a reaction to infection which happens when the body's immune system overreacts, which can lead to organ failure. Dr Ron Daniels, founder of UKST, said: ""We urgently need all health professionals, as well as the general public, to be aware of the signs of sepsis and subsequently avoid adding to the magnitude of this issue."" He said there were six signs that spell out the word sepsis - S for slurred speech or confusion, E for extreme pain in muscles or joints, P for passing no urine in a day, S for severe breathlessness, I for ""it feels like I'm going to die"" and S for skin that is mottled or discoloured. Daily walk Like most of us, photographer Jo de Banzie spent the spring of 2020 in lockdown, living at home with her family. That time was overshadowed by the loss of her brother-in-law, who contracted the virus while working as an NHS paramedic. From the daily exercise to lockdown haircuts, she captured the impact of the pandemicthrough a series of photographstaken on an antique camera. Bart's sourdough Zoom call Barney's haircut If you have been feeling like you might have put on a little weight during lockdown then you are not alone after scientists found hundreds of thousands of people have piled on the pounds. Almost 450,000 people who have contributed to the Covid Symptom Study app revealed that their weight had increased during lockdown. According to the findings from the app, almost a third of those taking part said they had gained weight since March, with 35% saying they had increased snacking, 34% said they had decreased physical activity and 27% said they were drinking more alcohol. Lead researcher Professor Tim Spector said the UK had a problem with obesity before the pandemic but ""lockdown has made it worse"". The average increase in body weight was found to be 0.78kg (1.6lbs). A report published by Public Health England on Friday found being overweight or obese dramatically increased a person's risk of hospitalisation or death from coronavirus. Earlier this week the government announced a crackdown on junk food advertisingas part of a range of measures to curb obesity in light of the coronavirus pandemic.  Tom BurridgeTransport correspondent People entering the UK from at-risk countries who test negative for Covid-19 twice within several days might be allowed to leave quarantine early. The UK government is close to backing a trial, sources in the travel industry say. Under current rules, those arriving in the UK from certain countries must self-isolate for 14 days. Details of the programme are being worked out but one of the key areas of debate is the number of days between tests. The government, which is keeping its quarantine measures under review, is said to be considering an eight-day stretch while figures within the travel sector are hoping for a five-day period. The number of days required between each test is critical in reducing the possibility of ""false negative"" results. The Department for Transport (DfT) declined to comment. France is about to launch a compulsory two-test regime for people arriving from 16 at-risk countries, including the United States. Read more here. The Italian opera singer Andrea Bocelli has said he felt ""humiliated and offended"" by lockdown measures imposed in the country due to coronavirus. ""I could not leave the house even though I had committed no crime,"" Bocelli said. He also admitted to disobeying lockdown rules and believing the severity of the pandemic had been overblown. His comments will surprise many as he had become a symbol of national unity at the height of the lockdown. Bocelli made the remarks at a conference in Italy's Senate attended by opposition politicians including Matteo Salvini, leader of the far-right League party. Salvini has attacked the government of Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte over the handling of the health crisis in Italy. Read more here. David ShukmanScience editor, BBC News There are rises in coronavirus cases in many parts of Europe but most health professionals would avoid describing them as a second wave of infections. That would usually be when a disease returns after being all but wiped out. As things stand now, the numbers are far lower than in the worst days back in March and April. And the pattern is different too: generally itâs no longer whole countries in the grip of the virus. Instead weâre seeing more localised outbreaks, for example on a large farm in Bavaria, in the Belgian city of Antwerp and in several regions of Spain. The Dutch government singles out Leicester as having a higher risk than the rest of the UK. But thereâs no doubt that these are nervous times. German officials say theyâre âvery concernedâ about the increase in cases. And there is the potential for these relatively small flare-ups to escalate â thatâs always been the risk as the lockdowns were relaxed. So what matters more than ever now is rapid detection of new cases and then a swift response to isolate everyone infected, and the hope is that every country is able to do that. Some tourists and business owners in Spain are continuing to express their disappointmentat the quarantine rule change. Jason Ward was on holiday in Ibiza with his wife when he heard the rules had changed. The couple, from Stevenage, in Hertfordshire, arrived on Saturday for a two-week holiday. ""Both of us are key workers and have worked through lockdown,"" Mr Ward tells the BBC. ""We feel safer here than back at home."" Meanwhile, those who work in the Spanish tourism industry could be in for a big setback, as nearly a quarter of all foreign tourists are from the UK. Dario, who owns a bar in Gran Canaria, says: âWe thought it was slowly
picking up and slowly getting back into business time, even if we were just
trying to cover costs. ""But this is absolutely a killer.â Maura, a bar owner in Lanzarote, says a blanket rule for all of Spain was the wrong decision. âWeâre a long way from mainland Spain,"" she tells BBC Outside Source. ""All the flights are direct from the UK, so it would be quite easy to police.â Lothar Wieler warned this could be the start of a ""second wave"" Let's take a look at Germany now, where the head of the public health agency has said they are ""very concerned"" by rising infections. ""We are in the middle of a rapidly developing pandemic,"" Lothar Wieler, head of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), told reporters earlier today. He said Germans had become ""negligent"" and urged people to wear masks and respect social distancing and hygiene rules. In the past week the country has recorded 3,611 new infections. ""We don't know yet if this is the beginning of a second wave but of course it could be,"" Mr Wieler said. ""But I am optimistic that if we follow the hygiene rules we can prevent it, it's up to us."" Read more here. A charity concert featuring US band The Chainsmokers is being investigated after footage appeared to show fans ignoring social distancing regulations. The concert, called Safe & Sound, took place on Saturday night in Southampton - a town in an affluent area known as The Hamptons, east of New York City. It was billed as a ""drive-in music experience"", but video taken from the stage showed crowds of people outside their cars, standing in close proximity. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said he was ""appalled"" by the footage. Read more here. The 40-year-old mayor said on Tuesday that he'd tested positive The mayor of the Colombian city of MedellÃ­n, Daniel Quintero, says he has tested positive for coronavirus. Mr Quintero has been praised for his early and data-driven approach to containing the virus in Colombia's second-largest city. He began holding preparedness meetings as early as January, when many politicians did not yet take the threat from the virus seriously. His strategy seemed to pay off in the early stages of the pandemic. On 21 April, only two people had died with Covid in MedellÃ­n, while 29 had died in Cali, which has fewer inhabitants. But in recent weeks the number of cases in MedellÃ­n and surrounding Antioquia province has shot up and now the mayor himself has Covid. He told Colombian radio that his love of coffee may be to blame. ""I have a lot of coffee and in order to drink it you have to take your mask off, so that may have been when I got it,"" he said. He has urged fellow coffee lovers to suppress their urge for a cup or at least carry their own thermos flask to minimise the risk of contracting the virus from cups.

A $1tn (Â£77bn) pandemic recovery plan proposed by US Senate Republicans has included $53m of funding to protect the development of a coronavirus vaccine from hackers. According toa summary of the bill,external, funding will be given to America's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (Cisa), and will be used to improve network security in the wake of ""increased attacks"" on government agencies which are helping to develop a vaccine. The $53m is a dramatic increase from the $9.1m given to Cisa under the Cares Act - showing the government's concern about the dangers of cyber attacks against coronavirus research centres. The issue has been a source of immense diplomatic tensions during recent months. Last week America ordered China to close its consulate in Texas.

"The seven women posed for photographs outside Milton Keynes Magistrates' Court A group of environmental campaigners who are accused of trying to stop a tree being chopped down to make way for HS2 have denied trespassing. The women, who dubbed themselves ""7 Sisters"", were accused of preventing contractors working at Poor's Piece in Steeple Claydon, Buckinghamshire. The group claim the 200-year-old oak tree, which is still standing, is home to species such as bats and red kites. They denied aggravated trespass and were bailed to face trial in January. The oak tree will be cut down to make way for the high-speed railway Milton Keynes Magistrates' Court was told that 30 police officers were sent to the camp set up next to the tree and that the women were held in cells for 12 hours after being arrested. The defendants are Miriam Instone, 22, Mina Jaf, 23, Jessica Walker, 29 and Samantha Smithson, 38, all of Poor's Piece, Steeple Claydon, Buckinghamshire Also accused are Imogen May, 48, of High Street, Crediton, Devon, Morgana Donfrancesco, 29, of Emlyn Road, Bristol, and Michelle MacDonagh, 33, whose address was not disclosed. All seven women denied aggravated trespass and a second charge of hiding or obstructing tools on a property under the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act. A trial is due to start on 25 January.

"Oldham has brought in new measures in a bid to avoid a local lockdown New measures to stop the spread of Covid-19 have been introduced in Oldham following a ""dramatic"" rise in cases. Residents are being asked not to have social visitors to their homes and to keep two metres apart when outside. Anyone shielding has been asked to continue to do so until 14 August and care homes will not relax restrictions. The new measures are essential to prevent a ""strict local lockdown""like in Leicester,Oldham Council's deputy leader councillor Arooj Shah said. ""The best way to avoid infection is to limit contact with others as much as possible and to stay home wherever you can, including working from home,"" she added. Many aspects of the coronavirus lockdownhave now eased across the UKbut certain areas have introduced new measures to halt the spread of the virus. Oldham followsRochdale, its neighbouring Greater Manchester borough, andBlackburn with DarwenandPendlein Lancashire, in introducing new restrictions. The new restrictions were agreed ""after the number of cases of coronavirus in the borough increased dramatically over the last week"", Oldham Council said. Two weeks ago Oldham was on Public Health England's (PHE) ""watchlist"" as an area of concern but was removed last Thursday. Data published on Tuesday evening by PHE is showing another spike, with 119 cases recorded in the week to 24 July equivalent to more than 50 per 100,000 population. The week before saw 26 cases recorded. Oldham has England's third highest rate of new cases per 100,000 people for the week to 24 July. PHE's data shows the number of new cases for the week has risen to 119, with a further 30 cases already recorded for 25 and 26 July. Blackburn with Darwen recorded 77.2 cases per 100,000 population in the week to 24 July, followed by Leicester with 61.9 and Oldham with 50.5. Bradford is fourth with 46.4 per 100,000 and Hyndburn in Lancashire is fifth with 39.6 per 100,000. Nick Triggle, BBC Health correspondent The action being taken in Oldham is, unfortunately, the way of life now. With infection levels low, health officials want to quickly stamp down on any signs of local flare ups. The rate of new infections is about three times lower than it was in Leicester when a local lockdown was announced. But the point is it had started rising rapidly in Oldham. By taking what may seem like small extra precautions, the council will be hoping it has a profound impact on the way people are behaving. There seems to be some real hotspots in the north west of England and parts of the Midlands at the moment. It is unclear exactly why, although there is certainly a link to deprivation. People living in closer quarters and working in manual jobs where it is harder to social distance are factors in why infections are bucking the trend. There is also concern the way public health messaging has been communicated has not been as effective in areas with a higher proportion of ethnic minorities, where English may not be the first language. The next few weeks will prove crucial for not just Oldham, but other areas too. Oldham Council said a ""significant proportion"" of recent cases involve multiple people testing positive within a household. This shows that the spread within a household is a ""real issue"", the council added. Katrina Stephens, director of Public Health for Oldham, urged residents to ""all do our bit and stick to the restrictions,"" adding ""we can help stop the spread of coronavirus, and protect ourselves and our loved ones"".

Today's live page was the work of Joshua Cheetham, Gareth Evans, Vanessa Buschschluter, Becky Morton, Dulcie Lee, Doug Faulkner, Henri Astier and Marie Jackson. Our colleagues in London and around the world will be back with more for you on Wednesday. Until then, thanks for joining us and goodbye. As we near the end of our coverage, here is a quick summary of what's been happening around the UK today.  This video can not be played Living through lockdown when the love of your life is in a care home Here are some of the biggest global developments of the day: Most patients having planned surgery in England will no longer be told they need to isolate for two weeks before going into hospital. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence hasupdated its guidelines,externalfollowing a decline in coronavirus cases. Anyone having a non-emergency operation will need to have a Covid test three days before the procedure and isolate until they are admitted. The surgery will only go ahead if the test is negative. Most routine operations ground to a halt during the pandemic and it is hoped the changes will help clear the waiting list and also lead to more patients coming forward for treatment. Dr Layla McCay, director at the NHS Confederation, said: âWe have heard anecdotally from NHS leaders that some of their patients had been put off from coming in for planned treatments because of the blanket rule that required everyone to self-isolate at home for 14 days prior to their elective care, including those whose personal circumstances such as their employment would not easily allow it.â In Scotland the 14-day quarantine guidelines will remain and the rest of the UK is considering the advice. This video can not be played Return to Lombardy, the 'Wuhan of the West' Italy's Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has asked the country's parliament to approve extending a state of emergency until October. The current measure is due to expire at the end of the month. An extension would ensure existing decrees issued to fight the virus would continue in force. It gives greater powers to both state and central government and bolsters hospital resources. ""The virus continues to evolve and has not run its course,"" Mr Conte said earlier today. ""It would be incongruous to abruptly suspend such an effective measure."" The state of emergency enables central and regional governments to shut down areas in the event of further outbreaks. Some opposition groups say it would give Mr Conte too many powers. Italy's lockdown rules have now been largely regionalised but face masks are mandatory on public transport and in shops, and social distancing of one metre is required in public spaces. People who have been hospitalised with coronavirus are being warned that they could be at risk of sepsis. One in five people who required hospital treatment for Covid-19 are at risk from sepsis within a year of being discharged, according to the UK Sepsis Trust (UKST). Sepsis is a reaction to infection which happens when the body's immune system overreacts, which can lead to organ failure. Dr Ron Daniels, founder of UKST, said: ""We urgently need all health professionals, as well as the general public, to be aware of the signs of sepsis and subsequently avoid adding to the magnitude of this issue."" He said there were six signs that spell out the word sepsis - S for slurred speech or confusion, E for extreme pain in muscles or joints, P for passing no urine in a day, S for severe breathlessness, I for ""it feels like I'm going to die"" and S for skin that is mottled or discoloured. Daily walk Like most of us, photographer Jo de Banzie spent the spring of 2020 in lockdown, living at home with her family. That time was overshadowed by the loss of her brother-in-law, who contracted the virus while working as an NHS paramedic. From the daily exercise to lockdown haircuts, she captured the impact of the pandemicthrough a series of photographstaken on an antique camera. Bart's sourdough Zoom call Barney's haircut If you have been feeling like you might have put on a little weight during lockdown then you are not alone after scientists found hundreds of thousands of people have piled on the pounds. Almost 450,000 people who have contributed to the Covid Symptom Study app revealed that their weight had increased during lockdown. According to the findings from the app, almost a third of those taking part said they had gained weight since March, with 35% saying they had increased snacking, 34% said they had decreased physical activity and 27% said they were drinking more alcohol. Lead researcher Professor Tim Spector said the UK had a problem with obesity before the pandemic but ""lockdown has made it worse"". The average increase in body weight was found to be 0.78kg (1.6lbs). A report published by Public Health England on Friday found being overweight or obese dramatically increased a person's risk of hospitalisation or death from coronavirus. Earlier this week the government announced a crackdown on junk food advertisingas part of a range of measures to curb obesity in light of the coronavirus pandemic.  Tom BurridgeTransport correspondent People entering the UK from at-risk countries who test negative for Covid-19 twice within several days might be allowed to leave quarantine early. The UK government is close to backing a trial, sources in the travel industry say. Under current rules, those arriving in the UK from certain countries must self-isolate for 14 days. Details of the programme are being worked out but one of the key areas of debate is the number of days between tests. The government, which is keeping its quarantine measures under review, is said to be considering an eight-day stretch while figures within the travel sector are hoping for a five-day period. The number of days required between each test is critical in reducing the possibility of ""false negative"" results. The Department for Transport (DfT) declined to comment. France is about to launch a compulsory two-test regime for people arriving from 16 at-risk countries, including the United States. Read more here. The Italian opera singer Andrea Bocelli has said he felt ""humiliated and offended"" by lockdown measures imposed in the country due to coronavirus. ""I could not leave the house even though I had committed no crime,"" Bocelli said. He also admitted to disobeying lockdown rules and believing the severity of the pandemic had been overblown. His comments will surprise many as he had become a symbol of national unity at the height of the lockdown. Bocelli made the remarks at a conference in Italy's Senate attended by opposition politicians including Matteo Salvini, leader of the far-right League party. Salvini has attacked the government of Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte over the handling of the health crisis in Italy. Read more here. David ShukmanScience editor, BBC News There are rises in coronavirus cases in many parts of Europe but most health professionals would avoid describing them as a second wave of infections. That would usually be when a disease returns after being all but wiped out. As things stand now, the numbers are far lower than in the worst days back in March and April. And the pattern is different too: generally itâs no longer whole countries in the grip of the virus. Instead weâre seeing more localised outbreaks, for example on a large farm in Bavaria, in the Belgian city of Antwerp and in several regions of Spain. The Dutch government singles out Leicester as having a higher risk than the rest of the UK. But thereâs no doubt that these are nervous times. German officials say theyâre âvery concernedâ about the increase in cases. And there is the potential for these relatively small flare-ups to escalate â thatâs always been the risk as the lockdowns were relaxed. So what matters more than ever now is rapid detection of new cases and then a swift response to isolate everyone infected, and the hope is that every country is able to do that. Some tourists and business owners in Spain are continuing to express their disappointmentat the quarantine rule change. Jason Ward was on holiday in Ibiza with his wife when he heard the rules had changed. The couple, from Stevenage, in Hertfordshire, arrived on Saturday for a two-week holiday. ""Both of us are key workers and have worked through lockdown,"" Mr Ward tells the BBC. ""We feel safer here than back at home."" Meanwhile, those who work in the Spanish tourism industry could be in for a big setback, as nearly a quarter of all foreign tourists are from the UK. Dario, who owns a bar in Gran Canaria, says: âWe thought it was slowly
picking up and slowly getting back into business time, even if we were just
trying to cover costs. ""But this is absolutely a killer.â Maura, a bar owner in Lanzarote, says a blanket rule for all of Spain was the wrong decision. âWeâre a long way from mainland Spain,"" she tells BBC Outside Source. ""All the flights are direct from the UK, so it would be quite easy to police.â Lothar Wieler warned this could be the start of a ""second wave"" Let's take a look at Germany now, where the head of the public health agency has said they are ""very concerned"" by rising infections. ""We are in the middle of a rapidly developing pandemic,"" Lothar Wieler, head of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), told reporters earlier today. He said Germans had become ""negligent"" and urged people to wear masks and respect social distancing and hygiene rules. In the past week the country has recorded 3,611 new infections. ""We don't know yet if this is the beginning of a second wave but of course it could be,"" Mr Wieler said. ""But I am optimistic that if we follow the hygiene rules we can prevent it, it's up to us."" Read more here. A charity concert featuring US band The Chainsmokers is being investigated after footage appeared to show fans ignoring social distancing regulations. The concert, called Safe & Sound, took place on Saturday night in Southampton - a town in an affluent area known as The Hamptons, east of New York City. It was billed as a ""drive-in music experience"", but video taken from the stage showed crowds of people outside their cars, standing in close proximity. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said he was ""appalled"" by the footage. Read more here. The 40-year-old mayor said on Tuesday that he'd tested positive The mayor of the Colombian city of MedellÃ­n, Daniel Quintero, says he has tested positive for coronavirus. Mr Quintero has been praised for his early and data-driven approach to containing the virus in Colombia's second-largest city. He began holding preparedness meetings as early as January, when many politicians did not yet take the threat from the virus seriously. His strategy seemed to pay off in the early stages of the pandemic. On 21 April, only two people had died with Covid in MedellÃ­n, while 29 had died in Cali, which has fewer inhabitants. But in recent weeks the number of cases in MedellÃ­n and surrounding Antioquia province has shot up and now the mayor himself has Covid. He told Colombian radio that his love of coffee may be to blame. ""I have a lot of coffee and in order to drink it you have to take your mask off, so that may have been when I got it,"" he said. He has urged fellow coffee lovers to suppress their urge for a cup or at least carry their own thermos flask to minimise the risk of contracting the virus from cups. Dan RoanBBC Sports editor Sport has been held behind closed doors since its return, including England's Test series against West Indies The government is confident it can move towards a safe return for fans to watch sporting events in stadiums, sports minister Nigel Huddleston says.

"Rapper Wiley sent messages naming his Jewish critics on Facebook following an anti-Semitic tirade Facebook has deleted the accounts of rapper Wiley after he shared abusive posts aimed at his Jewish critics and others. His comments came after an anti-Semitic tirade on Twitter. He has also been banned from that network. The BBC found Facebook posts under his real name Richard Kylea Cowie. He specifically named Jewish celebrities - including Lord Alan Sugar, comedian David Baddiel and BBC presenter Emma Barnett. A Facebook spokesperson said Wiley's account was removed for ""repeated violations"" of its policies. After the BBC contacted the social network to ask about the recent posts, it initially suspended, then deleted the grime artist's Facebook and Instagram profiles. The BBC has contacted the musician for comment. The posts aimed abuse at Jewish celebrities who had expressed their dismay about Wiley's tweets. Several of his posts mentioned ""Golders Green"" - a London neighbourhood with a large Jewish community. Wiley's personal Facebook page, where he has been posting abuse about Jewish critics Wiley wrote: ""Listen Golders Green ring my sister and let's meet asap""; ""David Baddiel come and talk to my face""; and ""Who called the police? Are you from Golders Green? I am coming to sit down with you... Labyrinth you could come along as you have forgotten what colour you are."" East London rapper Labrinth posted a sharp rebuke of Wiley on Twitter over the weekend. A number of comments on Wiley's Facebook posts also included anti-Semitic abuse. This video can not be played Rapper Wiley's Twitter account has been suspended after anti-Semitic posts. The latest comments were shared on Wiley's personal Facebook profile, and not his official fan page, which has also been taken down. Although they had relatively little engagement - less than 100 likes and comments each - they were visible to the public. Several of Wiley's tweets were taken down and his Twitter account was suspended - initially a temporary measure - after he went on ananti-Semitic tirade on Friday. One tweet read: ""I don't care about Hitler, I care about black people"", and compared the Jewish community to the Ku Klux Klan. Most of the posts spread anti-Semitic tropes. A number of prominent users called for a48-hour boycott of Twitterwhich ran from Monday, saying that the social network did not take action quickly enough. Twitter banned the rapper on Wednesday.

"The head of the trade union Unite has warned British Airways that it plans to move towards industrial action against the airline ""with immediate effect"". Unite and BA have been at loggerheads for several weeks. In April, BA owner IAG warned it could cut up to 12,000 jobs due to the impact of coronavirus. Staff were warned that if agreement was not reached, they would be handed their notice and re-hired on new contracts. BA said it was disappointed by Unite's criticism. Many airlines are struggling to survive as the coronavirus pandemic has severely disrupted global travel. The plunge in travel will drive airline losses of more than $84bn (Â£66bn) this year, the International Air Transport Association has warned. It said last month that 2020 revenues would drop to $419bn, down 50% from 2019. For many long-serving staff, BA's plan would involve significant pay cuts, as well as changes to terms and conditions. Unite - which represents thousands of BA employees including cabin crew, engineers and maintenance staff - has accused the airline of operating a 'fire and rehire policy'. Airlines set for 'worst' year on record In a letter to BA's chief executive Alex Cruz, seen by the BBC, Unite general secretary Len McCluskey accuses Mr Cruz of ""arrogance"" in his dealings with the union. Mr McCluskey says: ""You have now published a timetable to fire and rehire thousands of your workforce on 7 August. ""We will work every hour between now and then to convince you not to do so. ""You can take this letter as our commitment to do that. However, you can also take this as an intention to defend our members by moving towards industrial action with immediate effect"". British Airways said the lockdown and halt in travel ""is the biggest challenge the airline and our industry has ever faced"". ""It is disappointing that a company doing everything it can to save jobs is being singled out by Unite for national criticism, when jobs are being lost across the country in every industry,"" it said in a statement responding to Unite's letter. The new contracts make BA competitive with lower-cost airlines, it said. It insists 40% of cabin crew would get a pay rise, while crew suffering cuts would see their basic pay drop by 20%, although they also stand to lose shift pay, meaning drops of around 40% are possible. ""If staff accept the changes to the way they work or their terms and conditions, we expect to be able to save more jobs."" BA may have reached a cost-saving deal with its pilots, but the confrontation with other employees shows no sign of easing. From cabin crew to engineers and office staff, there is deep concern about the effect BA's plans will have on livelihoods and families. But there's also anger at the way in which the company has approached the issue - particularly its plans to dismiss staff and rehire them on new contracts. BA insists it has no choice - and has consistently said it wants to engage with its workers in its attempts to cut costs. But Unite insiders claim their suggestions have been dismissed out of hand.

His comments came after an anti-Semitic tirade on Twitter. He has also been banned from that network. The BBC found Facebook posts under his real name Richard Kylea Cowie. He specifically named Jewish celebrities - including Lord Alan Sugar, comedian David Baddiel and BBC presenter Emma Barnett.

"Greg Clarke was appointed Football Association chairman in September 2016 Football Association chairman Greg Clarke says he is ""disappointed"" after claiming the professional game representatives on the FA board blocked a move to try to improve the diversity of its members. In aletter to the FA Council,,externalClarke said a number of options were discussed at last week's board meeting, including making Paul Elliott - chair of the Inclusion Advisory Board - a director. He says the representatives of the EFL and Premier League ""were against such a review"". He later said in a statement that he had ""not intended to be divisive"" in the letter and that he ""intended to highlight an issue that we all care deeply about across both the FA Board and the FA Council"". He said: ""Following high-level talks between all parties today, I recognise now that the views held by the members of the board were not as they first appeared, and that all parties do support a review of FA Board diversity."" A Premier League and EFL joint statement on Tuesday said Clarke's letter ""did not reflect the true nature of the discussions held at the FA Board meeting last week"" and they said they welcomed his clarification. The statement added: ""It was agreed at last week's FA Board meeting to undertake an evaluation of diversity and inclusion within the FA in a consultative but efficient manner."" Writing to the FA Council Clarke had said: ""Without the support of the professional game and national game, who have a majority of directors, a review of the FA board composition is not possible. ""I had hoped that the FA, as the game's governing body, would have been able to examine whether its own board was appropriately constituted to represent a diverse game and share its thinking with council. This process is happening across football but will not now happen with respect to the FA board."" He added: ""As FA chairman this disappoints me"". Other options discussed included giving the professional and national Games an extra board seat each ""that could provide the flexibility to allow appointment of diverse candidates should they be the best qualified person for the role."" Clarke also said: ""Both our independent directors offered to stand down to create opportunities for a more diverse board but the board was united in declining their offer."" BBC Sport spoke to one board member who described Clarke's statement as ""bizarre"" and ""divisive"" and said he had been urged not to issue it by members of the board this morning when he made them aware of his plans. A Premier League source has told the BBC it is not opposed to a review but it has to be a review, followed by consideration and change, not random declarations by Clarke. There are three representatives of the professional game on the FA board - former Premier League chairman Peter McCormick, who is chair of its legal advisory group, English Football League chairman Rick Parry and lawyer Rupinder Bains, who jointly represents the Premier League and the EFL. The reforms in 2017, which they deemed sufficient, led to BAME representation on the board reaching 10%, 10% representation from the LGBT+ community and 40% representation by women. The Premier League has shown its solidarity, with players' names replaced on the back of their shirts with 'Black Lives Matter' for the first 12 matches of the restarted season, and a Black Lives Matter badge will feature on all shirts for the rest of the campaign. Several high-profile players, including Manchester City winger Raheem Sterling, have called for greater diversity in the hierarchy of sports organisations following the the Black Lives Matter campaign. Kick It Out chair Sanjay Bhandari said: ""Black Lives Matter has rightfully caused organisations across all industries to consider how they attack systemic inequalities and better reflect society. ""That process must start at the top with the senior leadership team. It is only right that the FA should seek to seize the moment, to reflect on the composition of its leadership team and whether it represents the players, fans and participants in the game. ""I applaud Greg Clarke's effort to do so. It is disappointing that this effort has been rejected. Before commenting further, we would need to understand better the professional game's reasons for rejecting a review.""

"Upmarket department store chain Selfridges is cutting 450 staff after saying that the coronavirus outbreak has led to ""the toughest year we have experienced in our recent history"". In a letter to staff, boss Anne Pitcher said it was ""the toughest decision we have ever had to take"". The retailer has four stores - one each in London and Birmingham, and two in Manchester. However, Selfridges has not yet indicated where the job cuts will be. The company closed its stores in March when the government-mandated lockdown began, before reopening in June. Its restaurants and hair salons began welcoming customers again at the start of this month. In her message to staff, Ms Pitcher said: ""The Covid-19 pandemic has forced change and caused us to rethink so many aspects of our lives and, will continue to do so as we adapt and respond to a new and evolving reality."" She warned that Selfridges needed to make ""fundamental changes"", adding that the company had been examining every aspect of its business ""to ensure we are fit for purpose and the future"". Retail sales near pre-lockdown levels in June Thousands of UK jobs go in sweeping retail closures John Lewis and Boots to cut 5,300 jobs There will be a period of collective consultation to discuss the proposals with elected team member representatives and trade union representatives, she said. ""Nobody imagined when we started the year that things would unfold like this and lead us to having to make such momentous decisions. ""It is a huge responsibility and I appreciate how incredibly unsettling receiving this news today must feel, prompting all sorts of thoughts and emotions,"" Anne Pitcher said. The store chain was founded by American Harry Gordon Selfridge in 1908 with the flagship Oxford Street store in London opening in 1909. Other Selfridges stores opened in Manchester's Trafford Centre in 1998, Exchange Square in 2002, and in Birmingham's Bullring in 2003.

"Bakery chain Greggs has said its sales have recovered to ""encouraging"" levels since it reopened shops in the wake of the coronavirus lockdown. It said sales were running at 72% of 2019's level, with all but a handful of its 2,025 outlets now trading again. Although many people are still away from their workplaces, chief executive Roger Whiteside said Greggs was not that dependent on office workers. The vast majority of its customers ""simply can't work from home"", he said. Greggs said it would be breaking even when sales reached 80% of last year's level. Mr Whiteside was speaking as Greggs unveiled a Â£65.2m loss for the first half of 2020. In the same period a year earlier, it made a profit of Â£36.7m. The firm said it had limited its range to best-selling items for the time being, ""in anticipation of lower-than-normal sales levels under social distancing"". It added: ""It is clear that sales will be constrained whilst these conditions prevail, with an observed impact on both our capacity to serve and on customer demand."" Mr Whiteside told the BBC that sausage rolls, sandwiches and other favourites were now available at all Greggs' shops, except for seven in the Leicester area, which remained closed as part of a local lockdown. He said sales at town and city centre outlets were down 45%, while those near public transport hubs were 65% lower. However, Greggs had proved ""resilient"", with most of its shops ""nowhere near offices"". ""Office workers form a portion of our customer base, but the vast majority, over 80%, simply can't work from home or aren't working at all, they're students or retired or whatever,"" Mr Whiteside said. ""So yes, there's some exposure to office working, but it's not as complete as some people might think."" Mr Whiteside said that about three-quarters of Greggs' staff had now returned from furlough. He added that Greggs would keep the remaining 25% on the furlough scheme, which runs until the end of October. When asked what would happen then, he said: ""I am positive that the economy will continue to get back to normal, whatever that is.""

"Oldham has brought in new measures in a bid to avoid a local lockdown New measures to stop the spread of Covid-19 have been introduced in Oldham following a ""dramatic"" rise in cases. Residents are being asked not to have social visitors to their homes and to keep two metres apart when outside. Anyone shielding has been asked to continue to do so until 14 August and care homes will not relax restrictions. The new measures are essential to prevent a ""strict local lockdown""like in Leicester,Oldham Council's deputy leader councillor Arooj Shah said. ""The best way to avoid infection is to limit contact with others as much as possible and to stay home wherever you can, including working from home,"" she added. Many aspects of the coronavirus lockdownhave now eased across the UKbut certain areas have introduced new measures to halt the spread of the virus. Oldham followsRochdale, its neighbouring Greater Manchester borough, andBlackburn with DarwenandPendlein Lancashire, in introducing new restrictions. The new restrictions were agreed ""after the number of cases of coronavirus in the borough increased dramatically over the last week"", Oldham Council said. Two weeks ago Oldham was on Public Health England's (PHE) ""watchlist"" as an area of concern but was removed last Thursday. Data published on Tuesday evening by PHE is showing another spike, with 119 cases recorded in the week to 24 July equivalent to more than 50 per 100,000 population. The week before saw 26 cases recorded. Oldham has England's third highest rate of new cases per 100,000 people for the week to 24 July. PHE's data shows the number of new cases for the week has risen to 119, with a further 30 cases already recorded for 25 and 26 July. Blackburn with Darwen recorded 77.2 cases per 100,000 population in the week to 24 July, followed by Leicester with 61.9 and Oldham with 50.5. Bradford is fourth with 46.4 per 100,000 and Hyndburn in Lancashire is fifth with 39.6 per 100,000. Nick Triggle, BBC Health correspondent The action being taken in Oldham is, unfortunately, the way of life now. With infection levels low, health officials want to quickly stamp down on any signs of local flare ups. The rate of new infections is about three times lower than it was in Leicester when a local lockdown was announced. But the point is it had started rising rapidly in Oldham. By taking what may seem like small extra precautions, the council will be hoping it has a profound impact on the way people are behaving. There seems to be some real hotspots in the north west of England and parts of the Midlands at the moment. It is unclear exactly why, although there is certainly a link to deprivation. People living in closer quarters and working in manual jobs where it is harder to social distance are factors in why infections are bucking the trend. There is also concern the way public health messaging has been communicated has not been as effective in areas with a higher proportion of ethnic minorities, where English may not be the first language. The next few weeks will prove crucial for not just Oldham, but other areas too. Oldham Council said a ""significant proportion"" of recent cases involve multiple people testing positive within a household. This shows that the spread within a household is a ""real issue"", the council added. Katrina Stephens, director of Public Health for Oldham, urged residents to ""all do our bit and stick to the restrictions,"" adding ""we can help stop the spread of coronavirus, and protect ourselves and our loved ones"".

"Car loans that hand salespeople more commission if they charge higher interest rates are to be banned from next year. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) reckons the ban will save customers Â£165m a year in total, or around Â£100-Â£200 on a loan. The ban is long overdue, said debt experts, with Citizens Advice Scotland dubbing the commission ""outrageous"". The FCA said the ban ""will increase competition and protect consumers"". At the moment some brokers and car retailers make a commission on the interest rate they charge customers who take out a loan to buy a car. The way the scheme works, the higher the interest rate, the higher the commission. That effectively means ""brokers are rewarded for charging consumers higher rates,"" said Christopher Woolard, the FCA's interim chief executive. It said the ban would save consumers between Â£100-Â£200, about 6% of their costs, on a loan, although it expects some consumers to benefit much more substantially. Even though the FCAannounced the potential crackdown on the car financing industry last October, the ban will not take effect until 28 January 2021. ""In the light of consultation feedback and the additional operational pressures which the sector is facing at present the FCA has agreed to give firms limited additional time to implement the new rules,"" the financial watchdog said. ""The fact that some car dealers increase consumers' interest rates just so they themselves can benefit from a commission bump is outrageous,"" said Citizens Advice Scotland's financial health spokesperson, Myles Fitt. ""As motor finance options are on the up through schemes like contract purchases this is the time to make sure consumers are adequately protected against these conflicts of interests."" Debt adviser Sara Williams, who writes the Debt Camel blog, said the ban was ""long overdue"". ""The interest rate should reflect the risk that the lender is taking, not how much a car salesman thinks you will pay."" Banning the commission is the right thing to do, said debt campaigner Mick McAteer, co-director at the Financial Inclusion Centre. ""History and evidence tells us that the combination of fast-growing markets and conflicts of interest in the form of commission payments lead to huge consumer detriment. ""Every mis-selling scandal has that combination,"" said Mr McAteer. ""The announcement provides clarity for the industry,"" said Adrian Dally, head of motor finance at the Finance and Leasing Association, a trade body for lenders. ""We are also pleased that the regulator accepted our point about the need to monitor the consumer hire market as the ban on discretionary commissions does not extend to personal contract hire agreements."" Meanwhile Sara Williams warned that the commission linked to interest rates is only one of the ways car finances is mis-sold. ""Too often there isn't a proper check that people can afford to make the monthly payments for the long contracts,"" she said.

"Upmarket department store chain Selfridges is cutting 450 staff after saying that the coronavirus outbreak has led to ""the toughest year we have experienced in our recent history"". In a letter to staff, boss Anne Pitcher said it was ""the toughest decision we have ever had to take"". The retailer has four stores - one each in London and Birmingham, and two in Manchester. However, Selfridges has not yet indicated where the job cuts will be. The company closed its stores in March when the government-mandated lockdown began, before reopening in June. Its restaurants and hair salons began welcoming customers again at the start of this month. In her message to staff, Ms Pitcher said: ""The Covid-19 pandemic has forced change and caused us to rethink so many aspects of our lives and, will continue to do so as we adapt and respond to a new and evolving reality."" She warned that Selfridges needed to make ""fundamental changes"", adding that the company had been examining every aspect of its business ""to ensure we are fit for purpose and the future"". Retail sales near pre-lockdown levels in June Thousands of UK jobs go in sweeping retail closures John Lewis and Boots to cut 5,300 jobs There will be a period of collective consultation to discuss the proposals with elected team member representatives and trade union representatives, she said. ""Nobody imagined when we started the year that things would unfold like this and lead us to having to make such momentous decisions. ""It is a huge responsibility and I appreciate how incredibly unsettling receiving this news today must feel, prompting all sorts of thoughts and emotions,"" Anne Pitcher said. The store chain was founded by American Harry Gordon Selfridge in 1908 with the flagship Oxford Street store in London opening in 1909. Other Selfridges stores opened in Manchester's Trafford Centre in 1998, Exchange Square in 2002, and in Birmingham's Bullring in 2003.

"This video can not be played Amber Heard's statement outside court in July An article in the Sun describing Johnny Depp as a ""wife-beater"" was ""one-sided"" and ""not researched at all"", the actor's lawyer told the High Court. In closing submissions for Mr Depp, David Sherborne said the paper acted as ""both judge and jury"". Mr Depp is suing the newspaper's publisher and editor for libel, saying the allegation is ""completely untrue"". The Sun's lawyers said on Monday there was ""no doubt"" he had ""systematically abused"" his former wife Amber Heard. What is libel and how does it work? Heard: I loved Depp, but he could be a monster Video shows Heard 'attacked' sister - Depp lawyers Around 30 fans of the actor were gathered in the main hall of the Royal Courts of Justice and screamed as the 57-year-old Hollywood star entered the building on the final day of the most high-profile British libel case so far in the 21st Century. Mr Depp is suing News Group Newspapers (NGN) - publisher of the Sun - and executive editor Dan Wootton over an article published on the Sun's website on 27 April 2018 with the headline: ""Gone Potty: How can JK Rowling be 'genuinely happy' casting wife beater Johnny Depp in the new Fantastic Beasts film?"" Mr Sherborne told the court the article meant Mr Depp was ""guilty, on overwhelming evidence, of serious domestic violence"" against Ms Heard, an actress and model, during their marriage. He said it meant that the actor was unfit to work in the film industry and had paid Â£5m to compensate Ms Heard for causing significant injuries and making her fear for her life. Crowds of reporters and fans surrounded Mr Depp as he arrived at court It also suggests Mr Depp had been ""tried, convicted and sentenced"", his barrister said. Mr Sherborne referred sarcastically to the ""journalistic excellence"" the Sun was seeking to defend and said ""this court has not heard from a single journalist"" about the article. It was presented in a ""deliberately and wholly one-sided manner"", although Mr Depp had never faced any criminal charge of violence against Ms Heard, the lawyer said. He said Mr Depp knows the allegations are ""completely untrue"", as do the friends and other witnesses who testified during the three-week case. ""Why else would Mr Depp, this private man as he explained, expose all the most intimate details of his personal life?"" Mr Sherborne said. Mr Sherborne said the publisher relied on evidence from Ms Heard, ""a complex individual with a complex history"". ""We say from the big points even to the smaller ones, Ms Heard has proven herself to be a wholly unreliable witness and, frankly, a compulsive liar - and I don't say that lightly,"" he said. He said she ""blatantly lied"" in her evidence, ""invented incidents"" and ""improvised allegations"" such as Mr Depp allegedly attacking a flight attendant, which had not been mentioned before in seven witness statements. Mr Sherborne said originally the Sun had relied on two alleged violent incidents, which had been mentioned in Ms Heard's application for a restraining order. But those had now risen to 14 ""far more serious, more horrific allegations"", the lawyer said. ""I stand by my testimony,"" Ms Heard said in a statement outside court ""It is quite clear that they do not add up, so what does Ms Heard do? She invents more, sometimes by retro-engineering texts she has seen,"" the lawyer said. He said audio recordings also revealed Ms Heard making a ""straightforward, unambiguous, unequivocal admission of hitting"" Mr Depp. ""Her physical violence towards him, her starting physical violence as she admits, make her the domestic abuser, not him,"" said Mr Sherborne. In a statement outside court as the hearing ended, Ms Heard said that despite the ""significance"" of the case she would have preferred not to have had to be involved in it, adding that, after obtaining a restraining order against Mr Depp in 2016, she had ""just wanted to move on with my life"". She added: ""It has been incredibly painful to relive the break-up of my relationship, to have my motives and my truth questioned, and the most traumatic, intimate details of my life with Johnny shared in court and broadcast to the entire world,"" she said. ""I stand by my testimony and I now place my faith in British justice."" On Monday, the legal team for NGN made its closing submissions, defending the Sun's article as true. Sasha Wass, representing the publisher, said: ""Having heard all the evidence in this case and all the supporting evidence of the incidents of violence, we suggest that there is no doubt that Mr Depp regularly and systematically abused his wife. ""The characterisation that he is a wife-beater is entirely truthful."" She said Mr Depp's lifestyle, ""surrounded by a clique of ageing, male rabble-rousers with alcohol and drugs shared together"", was ""destroying his life, his career and his health"". Ms Wass said the actor had sought stability with Ms Heard, but ""he grew to hate her for her protectiveness"" and resented her telling him how he could end his addiction. ""Mr Depp has spent his entire adult life doing exactly what he wanted, and he was not about to answer to a woman at this stage in his life,"" she said. Mr Depp waved at fans and supporters as he arrived in court for the final day of his libel case The lawyer for NGN presented the relationship as a generational clash between a ""modern and ambitious woman"" and a ""self-scripted Southern gentleman"" who ""required a supplicant wife"". She said Mr Depp did not expect his wife to continue working with ""young and attractive actors"". Ms Wass said the Hollywood star was subject to ""irrational mood swings and abnormal behavioural patterns"" because of his substance abuse. She told the court he gave these changes in behaviour a nickname - ""The Monster"". She also said Mr Depp's memory of his ""disgraceful conduct"" was ""so severely impaired by drug misuse that he may not even have been aware of the extent of his violence and terrifying behaviour"". In more than one incident, Ms Heard was put in fear of her life, the lawyer said. Mr Justice Nicol has said that his judgement will be reserved for a later date. What is libel and how does it work?

"One end of Google's ""Curie"" cable, finished last year - a similar project will land in Cornwall in 2022 Google has announced plans to build a new undersea network cable connecting the US, UK and Spain. The tech giant says it is incorporating new technology into the cable, which it claims is a significant upgrade to older existing lines. The project is expected to be completed by 2022. Underwater data cables are vital to global communications infrastructure, carrying some 98% of the world's data, according to Google's estimate. The cables are usually built by communications firms - typically a group of them pooling resources - which then charge other companies to use them. The latest cable, named ""Grace Hopper"" after an American computer scientist and naval rear admiral, will hit the UK at Bude, in Cornwall. It is Google's fourth privately owned undersea cable. But Google needs ""an ever-increasing amount of transatlantic bandwidth"", according to John Delaney from telecoms analyst IDC. ""Building its own cables helps them choose cable routes that are most optimal,"" and near data centres, he said. ""It also minimises operational expenditure by reducing the need to pay telcos and other third-party cable owners for the use of their infrastructure."" Jayne Stowell, who oversees construction of Google's undersea cable projects, told the BBC it needed an internet connection that could be relied upon. ""It's not enough to have a single cable because any element in the network can break from time to time, and if it's 8,000 metres under the sea, it takes a while to repair,"" she said. The first ever transatlantic telecommunications cable was built in 1858, connecting Ireland and the US by telegraph. Around 750,000 miles of cable already run between continents to support the demand for communication and entertainment - enough to run around the world almost 17 times. Cables are required to withstand major hazards, including earthquakes and heavy currents, and have a lifespan of around 25 years. But Ms Stowell says some of the transatlantic cables are ""going out of service and we need newer, better and more sophisticated technology"". ""It served its need and purpose at the time, but it's old generation,"" she said. Google and Facebook too powerful, says watchdog Google announces $10bn investment in India Google has yet to build a cable that lands in mainland China, where its services are restricted by the state and Ms Stowell said there are no plans to build one in the foreseeable future. ""We understand, being an American company, and understand the legalities of what we must abide by,"" she said. But she pointed out that the Asia market was bigger than China. She also addressed growing fears that the world could soon see two internets: one controlled by the West and the other by China. ""The world wide web is dependent upon interconnected networks. One would hope networks would be regarded as neutral and continue to interconnect."" Internet usage has skyrocketed around the world since Covid-19 restrictions were introduced. In April, Ofcom revealed that a record number of UK adults spent a quarter of their waking day online during lockdown. As demand for high-speed internet increases around the world, companies are continuing to look for ways to reach more consumers. And Google is not alone in pursuing ownership of vital data infrastructure. Microsoft and Facebook, for example, are joint-owners with telecoms company Telxius of the Marea cable, which runs from the US to Spain. In May, Facebook announced another project to build a 37,000km (23,000-mile) undersea cable to supply faster internet to 16 countries in Africa. Ready for use by 2024, it will deliver three times the capacity of all current undersea cables serving the continent. Africa lags behind the rest of the world in terms of internet access, with only four in 10 people having access to the web. However, with a population of 1.3 billion, it has become a key emerging market for many businesses.

"Kylie Moore-Gilbert, a lecturer at Melbourne University, has been in jail since September 2018 A British-Australian woman serving a 10-year sentence in Iran for espionage has been transferred to a notorious prison in the desert, officials say. Kylie Moore-Gilbert, a lecturer at Melbourne University, has been in jail since September 2018. She was tried in secret and strongly denies all the charges against her. The Australian government has said it holds Iran responsible for Ms Moore-Gilbert's ""safety and well-being"" and is ""urgently seeking access"" to her. ""Dr Moore-Gilbert's case is one of the Australian government's highest priorities, including for our embassy officials in Tehran,"" Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said in a statement on Tuesday. The statement added that Iran had confirmed earlier reports from human rights activists that she had been moved to the notorious Qarchak prison. The jail is sometimes used as punishment for Iranian political prisoners and conditions have been described by former inmates as abysmal. Before being moved to Qarchak prison, Ms Moore-Gilbert, a lecturer in Middle East politics, had spent almost two years sleeping on the floor of a cell at Evin prison in the capital, Tehran, according to a friend. She has been in solitary confinement and on several hunger strikes, and she is said to have been beaten for trying to comfort new prisoners by passing notes and writing to them on prison walls. On Tuesday, the husband of British-Iranian charity worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe - who was jailed in Iran in 2016 on spying charges that she has always denied - said that Qarchak was a place where ""[Iranian] authorities sent women political prisoners when they wanted to break them"". ""It's in the middle of the desert with no clean running water, very poor food with the bread and rice drugged, and gang-ridden, so you can wait months to get a bed,"" Richard Ratcliffe said. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been on hunger strike in solidarity with Ms Moore-Gilbert. This video can not be played Why one mother's personal plight is part of a complicated history between Iran and the UK (video published August 2019 and last updated in October 2019) ""Qarchak jail is where common prisoners are held. It's overcrowded and some of them are dangerous,"" said Hadi Ghaemi, director of the Center for Human Rights in Iran. Referring to an earlier statement from Ms Moore-Gilbert that she had rejected an offer of freedom in return for becoming a spy for Iran, he added: ""They're not happy with her resilience and her refusal to co-operate."" A friend of the family told BBC World Affairs correspondent Caroline Hawley that Ms Moore-Gilbert ""feels abandoned"". ""The Australian government doesn't seem to have been very proactive - she's been short on money that she needs to buy basic provisions for herself in jail,"" they said. According to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Australian ambassador visited Ms Moore-Gilbert in Evin prison recently and had been in telephone contact with her over the past few months. Ms Moore-Gilbert told an Iranian human rights activist in a phone call earlier this week that she had not spoken to her family for about a month. Reza Khandan, the husband of imprisoned human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh, said in a Facebook post that Ms Moore-Gilbert was in ""a very bad condition"". He wrote that she had told him: ""I can't eat anything, I don't know, I'm so disappointed. I'm so very depressed."" Uncertain fate of Iran's jailed dual nationals In letters smuggled out of Tehran's Evin prison in January, the lecturer said she had ""never been a spy"" and feared for her mental health. She said she had rejected an offer from Iran to become a spy. ""I am not a spy. I have never been a spy, and I have no interest to work for a spying organisation in any country."" She also said she feared her health had ""deteriorated significantly"". ""I think I am in the midst of a serious psychological problem,"" she wrote, worsened by ""the ban on having any phone calls with my family"". Ms Moore-Gilbert remains adamant that she is ""an innocent woman... imprisoned for a crime I have not committed"". The Cambridge-educated academic was travelling on an Australian passport and was detained at Tehran airport in 2018 as she tried to leave following a conference. Last year, British-Australian woman Jolie King and her Australian boyfriend Mark Firkin were released after being jailed in Tehran for reportedly flying a drone without a permit.

"Bakery chain Greggs has said its sales have recovered to ""encouraging"" levels since it reopened shops in the wake of the coronavirus lockdown. It said sales were running at 72% of 2019's level, with all but a handful of its 2,025 outlets now trading again. Although many people are still away from their workplaces, chief executive Roger Whiteside said Greggs was not that dependent on office workers. The vast majority of its customers ""simply can't work from home"", he said. Greggs said it would be breaking even when sales reached 80% of last year's level. Mr Whiteside was speaking as Greggs unveiled a Â£65.2m loss for the first half of 2020. In the same period a year earlier, it made a profit of Â£36.7m. The firm said it had limited its range to best-selling items for the time being, ""in anticipation of lower-than-normal sales levels under social distancing"". It added: ""It is clear that sales will be constrained whilst these conditions prevail, with an observed impact on both our capacity to serve and on customer demand."" Mr Whiteside told the BBC that sausage rolls, sandwiches and other favourites were now available at all Greggs' shops, except for seven in the Leicester area, which remained closed as part of a local lockdown. He said sales at town and city centre outlets were down 45%, while those near public transport hubs were 65% lower. However, Greggs had proved ""resilient"", with most of its shops ""nowhere near offices"". ""Office workers form a portion of our customer base, but the vast majority, over 80%, simply can't work from home or aren't working at all, they're students or retired or whatever,"" Mr Whiteside said. ""So yes, there's some exposure to office working, but it's not as complete as some people might think."" Mr Whiteside said that about three-quarters of Greggs' staff had now returned from furlough. He added that Greggs would keep the remaining 25% on the furlough scheme, which runs until the end of October. When asked what would happen then, he said: ""I am positive that the economy will continue to get back to normal, whatever that is.""

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson defends adding Spain to the quarantine list Boris Johnson has warned there are signs of a ""second wave"" of coronavirus in Europe, as he defended a 14-day quarantine on travellers from Spain. The PM said the government had to be ""swift"" - and hinted at further action against other countries if necessary. But airline Jet2 said information from the government was ""contradictory and often comes with little or no notice"". It comes after the Spanish prime minister called the UK's decision to change the rules for Spain ""unjust"". Pedro SÃ¡nchez said tourists in most regions in Spain would be safer from coronavirus than in the UK. The UK is advising against all non-essential travel to Spain, including the Balearic and Canary Islands. It also removed Spain and its islands from the list of countries that are exempt from the 14-day quarantine rule. Mr Johnson said it was up to individuals to decide whether they wanted to take the risk of travelling during the pandemic. ""These are decisions for families, for individuals, about where they want to go,"" he said. Meanwhile, Germany hasadvised against travel to three areas of Spain. What are the UK's quarantine rules? Spain travel rules: What are my rights? Why isn't the UK testing travellers on arrival? Oldham brings in extra virus measures Speaking during a visit to Nottinghamshire, the PM said: ""What we have to do is take swift and decisive action where we think that the risks are starting to bubble up again. ""Let's be absolutely clear about what's happening in Europe, amongst some of our European friends, I'm afraid you are starting to see in some places the signs of a second wave of the pandemic."" It came as the UK reported a further 119 coronavirus deaths - taking the official number of deaths so far to 45,878 - but the daily figure is typically higher on Tuesdays due to delays in reporting deaths at the weekend. An additional 581 positive cases have also been reported across the UK, a small dip on recent days. Asked about reports inthe Daily Telegraph,externalthat the 14-day period could be reduced, Mr Johnson said: ""We are always looking at ways in which we can mitigate the impact of the quarantine. ""At the moment you have got to stick with the guidance that we are giving, we have given the guidance now about Spain and about some other places around the world."" When asked whether the 14-day quarantine period could be cut, transport minister Baroness Vere said the government was ""looking at a range of options"" including ""testing people on certain days"" after they arrive. Ministers are also ""certainly looking"" at the idea of restrictions on travel to regions rather than whole countries, she said during an urgent question in the House of Lords. Travel industry sources later told the BBC the governmentwas close to backing a trial of double-testing arrivalsfrom at-risk countries - allowing those who test negative twice a few days apart to leave quarantine early. Spain's rate of infection has risen in recent days but Britons have continued to travel to the country Mr Johnson said if the UK did see signs of a second wave in other countries, it was the government's duty to stop travellers returning and spreading the disease. ""It's vital that when people are coming back from abroad, if they are coming back from a place where I'm afraid there is another outbreak, they must go into quarantine,"" he said. ""That's why we have taken the action that we have and we will continue, throughout the summer, to take such action where it is necessary."" Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon echoed Mr Johnson's concerns, saying ""we are currently seeing a worrying resurgence of Covid"" in European countries. She warned potential travellers not to assume quarantine measures would remain the same at the time of booking a holiday as when they returned, adding: ""I wouldn't be booking a foreign holiday right now."" The Department of Health said there had been a handful of suspected cases this month where a person had tested positive for the coronavirus after returning to the UK from Spain. But it added these were not a factor in evidence presented to ministers and that the decision to reintroduce a quarantine for arrivals from Spain was taken because of rising infection rates there. In an interview with the Telecinco TV network, Spain's Mr SÃ¡nchez said his government was ""talking with British authorities to try to get them to reconsider"" the decision. He said the UK had made an ""error"" by considering the infection rate for the whole country. He added that ""64.5% of the new cases registered are in two territories"" and in most of Spain the prevalence of Covid-19 was ""very much inferior to the numbers registered in the United Kingdom"". The rate of infection in Spain is 47.2 cases per 100,000 people, while the UK is at 15,according to the latest figures,externalfrom the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. While the outbreak remains under control in many parts of Spain, certain areas - in particular Catalonia in the north-east, which includes the city Barcelona, and the neighbouring region of AragÃ³n - have seen a huge spike in infections. According todata,externalfrom the Spanish government, as of Monday, the infection rates in the Balearic and Canary Islands were 9.22 and 7.06 per 100,000 respectively. The same data showed infection rates in Catalonia, which includes Barcelona, was 132.4 per 100,000, and 28.21 in Madrid. On Tuesday,the UK government added,externalEstonia, Latvia, Slovakia, Slovenia and St Vincent and the Grenadines to the list of countries which are exempt from the quarantine rule. Travellers returning to the UK from anywhere not on the list - including Spain - must self-isolate for 14 days at a registered address. People who do not self-isolatecan be finedup to Â£1,000 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and those returning to Scotland could be fined Â£480, with fines up to Â£5,000 for persistent offenders. Government sources told the BBC that there are no plans to introduce testing at airports, and the priority isto get walk-in centres up and running. In Barcelona, some businesses are quiet as residents are being told to stay at home Tourism is important for Spain's economy, with about 18 million trips made by Britons last year Some travel agents say they are struggling to understand the logic of the UK government's advice. And MP Chris Bryant, who chairs the all-party parliamentary group for Spain, said: ""Why the Canaries - which are further away from Barcelona than Barcelona is to the UK - are on the list as well as mainland Spain, I simply don't understand. ""And there are many, many regions of Spain which have much lower infection rates than many areas in the UK. I think this has been terribly badly handled."" SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? BUBBLES:How do they work and who can be in yours? JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? Labour said the government's handling of the restrictions had been ""chaotic"", and urged it to step in to protect jobs in the travel industry. Holiday companies Jet2 and Tui were among those to announce sweeping flight cancellations following the UK announcement. ""What we need now is clarity and consistency from the government,"" Jet2 said. ""We want to provide customers, who work hard and save hard for their well-deserved holidays, with timely information and we need this from the government."" EasyJet, British Airways and Ryanair said they would continue to operate full schedules of flights to Spain, though EasyJet said its holidays would be cancelled for the next few weeks. Spain rushes to save tourism as cases surge Sun, sea and sanitiser: What your holiday will be like Sports minister confident fans will return safely to stadiums Among the thousands affected by the change in travel advice and quarantine requirement was Jason Ward who was on holiday in Ibiza with his wife when he heard the rules had changed. Jason Ward said he felt safer in Ibiza than in the UK The couple, from Stevenage, in Hertfordshire, arrived on Saturday for a two-week holiday and now face having to self-isolate for the same amount of time when they return to the UK. ""Both of us are key workers and have worked through lockdown,"" Mr Ward told the BBC. ""We feel safer here then back at home."" He called on ministers to ""remove the quarantine and allow the businesses here to have a chance to survive"".

"The split between genders in the amount of paid and unpaid work they do has shrunk over the last 40 years, according to a think tank. A new study by the Resolution Foundation found that men in the UK are doing fewer paid hours and women more. The foundation says that women and men are almost equal in terms of overall hours worked, clocking in 50 and 51 hours a week respectively. However, men get paid for 10 more of their weekly hours than women do. Since the 1970s, women have increased their paid working hours by more than five hours to 22 per week, and have cut unpaid hours, which include childcare duties and household chores, by almost three. Meanwhile, men have cut their paid hours by more than eight to 34 per week. The number of unpaid hours worked has increased by more than five a week. Will women have to work harder after the pandemic? 'We value men's work more than women's' How Covid-19 is changing women's lives Women still spend more time on childcare and spend slightly more time on ""personal care"". Men, by contrast, spend more time in front of the TV. Both spend the same amount of hours asleep. The report also highlights what it describes as a ""new divide"" across households. Women in higher-income households have seen the biggest increase in paid work, with men in lower-income households seeing a drop in their working hours - by as much as three hours a day - since the 1970s. The foundation suggests that, as a result, the gap in total hours of paid work between high and low-income households has grown from 40 minutes per week in 1974 to four hours and 20 minutes in 2014-15. One in seven workers in low-income households want to increase their hours of work, compared with just one in 30 workers in high-income households. George Bangham, economist at the Resolution Foundation, said that since the coronavirus outbreak, many households are reconsidering how they structure their days. ""Debates around how people spend their time often focus on a single goal - speeding up the move to a shorter working week to enable more time for socialising, sport and hobbies,"" he said. ""But this isn't how people's lives have changed over the past four decades, desirable as it may be. ""Men are doing less paid work, while women are doing more. Both have less time for 'play' with childcare up and leisure time down. He added that a new ""working time inequality"" has emerged. Labour's shadow women and equalities secretary, Marsha de Cordova, said: ""The government must carry out and publish an Equality Impact Assessment of the financial and social measures it has taken so far to support people through the pandemic.

That's all for today but check back in tomorrow morning for the latest news, stories and information. Have a good evening. BBC Radio 5 Live Retail workers have been talking to 5live about their experiences of people wearing face masks in shops. Emma in Manchester said: âFair play to the British public, we were worried, but
they have risen to the challenge, almost all shoppers wearing masks â which
means we donât have to wear masks. ""The company advises us to wear them, but we
donât have to if we sign a disclaimer and itâs so difficult to wear one over a
10 hour shift, so if customers wear them we can choose not to. âHonestly the British public has been brilliant â I would
say 98-99 per cent of shoppers are wearing them â weâve had a few complaints
but really itâs been brilliant.â Covid-19 has affected nearly all aspects of life, including people's work. The world of work is changing - and some sectors appear to be in a much stronger position than others. According to the latest jobs market report from employment website CV-Library, the number of vacancies in the UK fell by 62.7% in the second quarter of 2020. And for jobs being advertised, competition is stiff, with the average application-to-job ratio rising by 84%.Here's a guide to what jobs are available post-lockdown. Sales at pubs, restaurants and hotels across the UK plunged by Â£30bn during lockdown, according to the hospitality sector. UK Hospitality said that revenues plummeted by 87% between April and June, compared to the same period last year. Boss Kate Nicholls said it shows many firms still need government support. The trade body says sales for the three-month period came to Â£4.6bn, Â£29.6bnlower than in 2019. BBC Radio 5 Live Olympic champion cyclist Chris Boardman has praised todayâs government
announcement thataccess to bikes will be made available on the NHSas part of plans to boost cycling and walking. Thousands of miles of new protected cycle lanes, cycle training for children and adults, and the creation of the UK's first zero-emission transport city are also part of the plans to promote cycling and walking. Boardman, the cycling and walking commissioner for Greater Manchester, told 5live: âThis is the biggest step forward for active travel that I have seen in my lifetime. The bit that is really going to make to make the difference is provision of safe space. ""Lockdown turned off global travel and everyone showed that they would ride a bike, for work, exercise or shopping, if you made it safe. ""Cycling went up 300 per cent over lockdown when all other forms went down, by up to 90 per cent. We now know people will do it, if these proposals make it safe â and thatâs what they say they will do."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Advice is changing for people who have been shielding against catching coronavirus. When lockdown began, about 2.5 million people were advised to take extra steps to avoid contracting the disease, because they were considered more at risk of needing hospital treatment. Shielding will be paused in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland from 1 August. Wales will follow from 16 August. This is because infection levels in the community are now falling, so the risk of exposure is significantly less than it was. People will no longer have to ""stay at home"" andfollow shielding guidelines,external, although they are advised to take particular care when outside, and strictly maintain social distancing. Here's everything you need to know. Closing the government scheme which is paying furloughed workers' wages is a ""mistake"", an economic research group has said. It could push unemployment to 10% this year, the research suggests. The latest furlough figures show9.5 million people are using the scheme,external, the same as a week ago, and at a total cost of Â£31.7bn to the Treasury. But those figures are likely to drop quickly, says the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR).Read the full story. A holiday in Spain now means two weeks of quarantine on return to the UK to help stop the spread of coronavirus across borders. Some countries,such as Iceland,external, offer travellers a choice on arrival if they have stayed in areas with high virus levels. Anyone entering must either self-quarantine for 14 days or get tested for Covid-19. And Germany is planning compulsory tests at its airports for anyone arriving from a high-risk country. Why isn't the UK doing this?Read the full story. Newcastle International Airport says 34 permanent jobs are at risk as it continues to be affected by the impact of Covid-19. The figure is on top of 76 seasonal workers, let go early, who would normally be employed during the summer. A spokesperson said the airport did not expect to return to pre-pandemic levels until 2022 at the earliest. In June, EasyJet said it planned to close its operation in Newcastle,where 157 crew and three aircraft are based. An accommodation centre for asylum seekers where people have tested positive for Covid-19 ""needs to close immediately"", campaigners say. Dozens of residents have been dispersed from Urban House in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, afterthe outbreak earlier this month. Campaigners said it was ""not fit for purpose"" and needed a ""major overhaul"". Mears Group, which runs the centre, said the property would be reviewed once the dispersal was complete.Read the full story. Under theCoronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme,external, workers placed on furlough have been able to receive 80% of their pay, up to a maximum of Â£2,500 a month. Since July, these furloughed employees have been able to go back to work part-time. For example, an employer could pay someone to work two days a week, while the furlough scheme would cover the other three days not worked. From Saturday, employers will have to pay National Insurance and pension contributions for their staff. In September, employers will have to pay 10% of furloughed employees' salaries - rising to 20% in October. Here's everything you need to know about the new furlough rules. New measures to stop the spread of Covid-19 have been introduced in Oldham following a ""dramatic"" rise in cases. Residents are being asked not to have social visitors to their homes and to keep two metres apart when outside. Anyone shielding has been asked to continue to do so until 14 August. The new restrictions are essential to prevent a ""strict local lockdown""like in Leicester,Oldham Council's deputy leader councillor Arooj Shah said. Read the full story. Diners will soon be able to get money off their bill on certain days in August to encourage a return to cafes, pubs and restaurants. It's hoped the ''eat out to help out'' scheme will provide a boost to the struggling hospitality industry, now that the national lockdown is easing. But the scheme, which has been launched alongside the government'shealthy eating strategy, has faced criticism from some anti-obesity campaigners. The promotion gives people a discount of up to 50% when eating or drinking soft drinks in a participating restaurant or other food establishment. It is valid all day Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday from 3 to 31 August, in all parts of the UK that are not in alocal lockdown.

Traders at Nottingham's cattle market, which suffered a major fire in 2018, have returned to work following the coronavirus outbreak. It is the first market at the 134-year-old site since the country was forced into lockdown in March. Phil Poyser, from Arthur Johnson auctioneers, who run the market, said traders were ""desperate"" to work. He added that despite all the precautions, the challenge would be to convince customers it wassafe to visit. Bakery chain Greggs has saidits sales have recovered to ""encouraging"" levelssince it reopened shops in the wake of the coronavirus lockdown. It said sales were running at 72% of 2019's level, with all but a handful of its 2,025 outlets now trading again. Although many people are still away from their workplaces, chief executive Roger Whiteside said Greggs was not that dependent on office workers. The vast majority of its customers ""simply can't work from home"", he said. Greggs said it would be breaking even when sales reached 80% of last year's level. An emergency doctor's paintings of hospital staff at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic are going on display to recognise their work.

"One end of Google's ""Curie"" cable, finished last year - a similar project will land in Cornwall in 2022 Google has announced plans to build a new undersea network cable connecting the US, UK and Spain. The tech giant says it is incorporating new technology into the cable, which it claims is a significant upgrade to older existing lines. The project is expected to be completed by 2022. Underwater data cables are vital to global communications infrastructure, carrying some 98% of the world's data, according to Google's estimate. The cables are usually built by communications firms - typically a group of them pooling resources - which then charge other companies to use them. The latest cable, named ""Grace Hopper"" after an American computer scientist and naval rear admiral, will hit the UK at Bude, in Cornwall. It is Google's fourth privately owned undersea cable. But Google needs ""an ever-increasing amount of transatlantic bandwidth"", according to John Delaney from telecoms analyst IDC. ""Building its own cables helps them choose cable routes that are most optimal,"" and near data centres, he said. ""It also minimises operational expenditure by reducing the need to pay telcos and other third-party cable owners for the use of their infrastructure."" Jayne Stowell, who oversees construction of Google's undersea cable projects, told the BBC it needed an internet connection that could be relied upon. ""It's not enough to have a single cable because any element in the network can break from time to time, and if it's 8,000 metres under the sea, it takes a while to repair,"" she said. The first ever transatlantic telecommunications cable was built in 1858, connecting Ireland and the US by telegraph. Around 750,000 miles of cable already run between continents to support the demand for communication and entertainment - enough to run around the world almost 17 times. Cables are required to withstand major hazards, including earthquakes and heavy currents, and have a lifespan of around 25 years. But Ms Stowell says some of the transatlantic cables are ""going out of service and we need newer, better and more sophisticated technology"". ""It served its need and purpose at the time, but it's old generation,"" she said. Google and Facebook too powerful, says watchdog Google announces $10bn investment in India Google has yet to build a cable that lands in mainland China, where its services are restricted by the state and Ms Stowell said there are no plans to build one in the foreseeable future. ""We understand, being an American company, and understand the legalities of what we must abide by,"" she said. But she pointed out that the Asia market was bigger than China. She also addressed growing fears that the world could soon see two internets: one controlled by the West and the other by China. ""The world wide web is dependent upon interconnected networks. One would hope networks would be regarded as neutral and continue to interconnect."" Internet usage has skyrocketed around the world since Covid-19 restrictions were introduced. In April, Ofcom revealed that a record number of UK adults spent a quarter of their waking day online during lockdown. As demand for high-speed internet increases around the world, companies are continuing to look for ways to reach more consumers. And Google is not alone in pursuing ownership of vital data infrastructure. Microsoft and Facebook, for example, are joint-owners with telecoms company Telxius of the Marea cable, which runs from the US to Spain. In May, Facebook announced another project to build a 37,000km (23,000-mile) undersea cable to supply faster internet to 16 countries in Africa. Ready for use by 2024, it will deliver three times the capacity of all current undersea cables serving the continent. Africa lags behind the rest of the world in terms of internet access, with only four in 10 people having access to the web. However, with a population of 1.3 billion, it has become a key emerging market for many businesses.

"Najib Razak (centre) was prime minister from 2009 to 2018 A court in Malaysia has sentenced former PM Najib Razak to 12 years in jail after finding him guilty on all seven counts in the first of several multi-million dollar corruption trials. Najib had pleaded not guilty to the charges of criminal breach of trust, money laundering and abuse of power. The case against him is seen as a test of Malaysia's anti-corruption efforts. The 1MDB scandal around a state-owned wealth fund in Malaysia has uncovered a global web of fraud and corruption. It sent shockwaves through Malaysia's political establishment, leading to the toppling of Najib's UMNO party, which had governed the country for 61 years since it gained independence. Najib, in office from 2009 to 2018, was sentenced to 12 years in prison for abuse of power, and 10 years in jail for each of six counts of money laundering and breach of trust. The sentences - to run concurrently - will be suspended pending appeal. ""After considering all evidence in this trial, I find that the prosecution has successfully proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt,"" judge Mohamad Nazlan Mohamad Ghazali told the Kuala Lumpur High Court. ""I am surely not satisfied with the result,"" Najib told reporters. ""This is definitely not the end of the world, because there's a process of appeal, and we hope that we would be successful then,"" he added. Tuesday's verdicts centred on 42 million ringgit ($10m; Â£7.7m) transferred from the fund to the then-prime minister's private accounts. Najib denies all wrongdoing and says he was misled by financial advisers - in particular fugitive financier Jho Low. Jho Low has been charged in both the US and Malaysia, but also maintains his innocence. A supporter reacts after the verdicts were announced Najib's defence team argued he was led to believe the funds in his accounts were donated by the Saudi royal family - rather than misappropriated from the state fund. The charges carried as much as 15 to 20 years in prison each. 1MDB scandal: The playboys, PMs and partygoers Najib Razak: The fall of Malaysia's former PM How Malaysiaâs government collapsed in two years Goldman Sachs settles 1MDB with Malaysia for $3.9bn The case centres around the 1 Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), a sovereign wealth fund set up in 2009, when Najib Razak was prime minister. Sovereign wealth funds are government-owned investment funds that are used to boost a country's economic development. Built with state earnings, such as revenues from oil resources and exports, they have extraordinary flows of cash to invest and potentially enormous international clout. In 2015, questions were raised around 1MBD's activities after it missed payments owed to banks and bondholders. Malaysian and US authorities allege that $4.5bn was illicitly plundered from the fund and diverted into private pockets. The missing money has been linked to luxury real estate, a private jet, Van Gogh and Monet artworks - and even a Hollywood blockbuster, the Wolf of Wall Street. Last week,US bank Goldman Sachs reached a $3.9bn settlementwith the Malaysian government for its role in the multi-billion-dollar corruption scheme. The deal resolved charges in Malaysia that the bank misled investors when it helped raise $6.5bn for 1MDB. Since his dramatic election defeat two years ago, the first for his party in 60 years - and the humiliation of seeing luxury items wheeled from his home in shopping trolleys by the police - Najib Razak has enjoyed something of a political resurrection. Still a very powerful figure within UMNO, the former ruling party, he has successfully posed as a champion of ethnic Malays, many of whom became disillusioned with the reformist coalition which replaced him. When that coalition collapsed in February, and UMNO joined a new government, Najib expressed confidence that the series of trials would go his way. That confidence proved misplaced. This first criminal conviction of such a senior political figure must now hurt his standing within UMNO, and will improve the public standing of Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin - once a close colleague and stalwart of UMNO who was fired in 2016 over his objections to the 1MDB scandal. He now leads a fragile coalition with a wafer-thin parliamentary majority, pushing Malaysia into uncharacteristically choppy political waters. The former prime minister was cleared of all allegations by Malaysian authorities while he was still in office. Yet the accusations played a big part in his election defeat in 2018 - and the new government swiftly reopened investigations into the 1MDB case. While Tuesday's verdicts were the first, they were possibly not the most significant. A separate trial that began last Augustlooks at accusations the former prime minister illicitly obtained 2.28bn ringgit ($550m, Â£448m) from 1MDB between 2011 and 2014. He is facing 21 counts of money-laundering and four of abuse of power but again denies any wrongdoing. His wife, Rosmah Mansor, also faces money-laundering and tax evasion charges, to which she has pleaded not guilty.

"The pandemic cost $320bn (Â£248bn) to the global tourism industry in lost revenue between January and May, according to the World Tourism Organization The German foreign ministry advises against unnecessary travel to Catalonia, Navarra and Aragon ""due to high infection numbers"" Belgium tightens social restrictions to try to avert fresh lockdown UK PM Boris Johnson warns of signs of a second wave in Europe, as he defended a 14-day quarantine on travellers from Spain Authorities in Madrid make wearing face masks in public compulsory at all times A lack of translated coronavirus guidance is jeopardising the safety of non-English speakers in the UK, a joint letter to the health secretary claims US Republicans propose spending an additional $1tn (Â£776bn) to address the economic damage caused by the pandemic Worldwide, more than 16m cases have been recorded so far, with about 650,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University in the US Marie Jackson And that's where we'll end things. Today's live page was the work of Joshua Cheetham, Gareth Evans, Vanessa Buschschluter, Becky Morton, Dulcie Lee, Doug Faulkner, Henri Astier and Marie Jackson. Our colleagues in London and around the world will be back with more for you on Wednesday. Until then, thanks for joining us and goodbye. As we near the end of our coverage, here is a quick summary of what's been happening around the UK today.  This video can not be played Living through lockdown when the love of your life is in a care home Here are some of the biggest global developments of the day: Most patients having planned surgery in England will no longer be told they need to isolate for two weeks before going into hospital. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence hasupdated its guidelines,externalfollowing a decline in coronavirus cases. Anyone having a non-emergency operation will need to have a Covid test three days before the procedure and isolate until they are admitted. The surgery will only go ahead if the test is negative. Most routine operations ground to a halt during the pandemic and it is hoped the changes will help clear the waiting list and also lead to more patients coming forward for treatment. Dr Layla McCay, director at the NHS Confederation, said: âWe have heard anecdotally from NHS leaders that some of their patients had been put off from coming in for planned treatments because of the blanket rule that required everyone to self-isolate at home for 14 days prior to their elective care, including those whose personal circumstances such as their employment would not easily allow it.â In Scotland the 14-day quarantine guidelines will remain and the rest of the UK is considering the advice. This video can not be played Return to Lombardy, the 'Wuhan of the West' Italy's Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has asked the country's parliament to approve extending a state of emergency until October. The current measure is due to expire at the end of the month. An extension would ensure existing decrees issued to fight the virus would continue in force. It gives greater powers to both state and central government and bolsters hospital resources. ""The virus continues to evolve and has not run its course,"" Mr Conte said earlier today. ""It would be incongruous to abruptly suspend such an effective measure."" The state of emergency enables central and regional governments to shut down areas in the event of further outbreaks. Some opposition groups say it would give Mr Conte too many powers. Italy's lockdown rules have now been largely regionalised but face masks are mandatory on public transport and in shops, and social distancing of one metre is required in public spaces. People who have been hospitalised with coronavirus are being warned that they could be at risk of sepsis. One in five people who required hospital treatment for Covid-19 are at risk from sepsis within a year of being discharged, according to the UK Sepsis Trust (UKST). Sepsis is a reaction to infection which happens when the body's immune system overreacts, which can lead to organ failure. Dr Ron Daniels, founder of UKST, said: ""We urgently need all health professionals, as well as the general public, to be aware of the signs of sepsis and subsequently avoid adding to the magnitude of this issue."" He said there were six signs that spell out the word sepsis - S for slurred speech or confusion, E for extreme pain in muscles or joints, P for passing no urine in a day, S for severe breathlessness, I for ""it feels like I'm going to die"" and S for skin that is mottled or discoloured. Daily walk Like most of us, photographer Jo de Banzie spent the spring of 2020 in lockdown, living at home with her family. That time was overshadowed by the loss of her brother-in-law, who contracted the virus while working as an NHS paramedic. From the daily exercise to lockdown haircuts, she captured the impact of the pandemicthrough a series of photographstaken on an antique camera. Bart's sourdough Zoom call Barney's haircut If you have been feeling like you might have put on a little weight during lockdown then you are not alone after scientists found hundreds of thousands of people have piled on the pounds. Almost 450,000 people who have contributed to the Covid Symptom Study app revealed that their weight had increased during lockdown. According to the findings from the app, almost a third of those taking part said they had gained weight since March, with 35% saying they had increased snacking, 34% said they had decreased physical activity and 27% said they were drinking more alcohol. Lead researcher Professor Tim Spector said the UK had a problem with obesity before the pandemic but ""lockdown has made it worse"". The average increase in body weight was found to be 0.78kg (1.6lbs). A report published by Public Health England on Friday found being overweight or obese dramatically increased a person's risk of hospitalisation or death from coronavirus. Earlier this week the government announced a crackdown on junk food advertisingas part of a range of measures to curb obesity in light of the coronavirus pandemic.  Tom BurridgeTransport correspondent People entering the UK from at-risk countries who test negative for Covid-19 twice within several days might be allowed to leave quarantine early. The UK government is close to backing a trial, sources in the travel industry say. Under current rules, those arriving in the UK from certain countries must self-isolate for 14 days. Details of the programme are being worked out but one of the key areas of debate is the number of days between tests. The government, which is keeping its quarantine measures under review, is said to be considering an eight-day stretch while figures within the travel sector are hoping for a five-day period. The number of days required between each test is critical in reducing the possibility of ""false negative"" results. The Department for Transport (DfT) declined to comment. France is about to launch a compulsory two-test regime for people arriving from 16 at-risk countries, including the United States. Read more here. The Italian opera singer Andrea Bocelli has said he felt ""humiliated and offended"" by lockdown measures imposed in the country due to coronavirus. ""I could not leave the house even though I had committed no crime,"" Bocelli said. He also admitted to disobeying lockdown rules and believing the severity of the pandemic had been overblown. His comments will surprise many as he had become a symbol of national unity at the height of the lockdown. Bocelli made the remarks at a conference in Italy's Senate attended by opposition politicians including Matteo Salvini, leader of the far-right League party. Salvini has attacked the government of Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte over the handling of the health crisis in Italy. Read more here. David ShukmanScience editor, BBC News There are rises in coronavirus cases in many parts of Europe but most health professionals would avoid describing them as a second wave of infections. That would usually be when a disease returns after being all but wiped out. As things stand now, the numbers are far lower than in the worst days back in March and April. And the pattern is different too: generally itâs no longer whole countries in the grip of the virus. Instead weâre seeing more localised outbreaks, for example on a large farm in Bavaria, in the Belgian city of Antwerp and in several regions of Spain. The Dutch government singles out Leicester as having a higher risk than the rest of the UK. But thereâs no doubt that these are nervous times. German officials say theyâre âvery concernedâ about the increase in cases. And there is the potential for these relatively small flare-ups to escalate â thatâs always been the risk as the lockdowns were relaxed. So what matters more than ever now is rapid detection of new cases and then a swift response to isolate everyone infected, and the hope is that every country is able to do that. Some tourists and business owners in Spain are continuing to express their disappointmentat the quarantine rule change. Jason Ward was on holiday in Ibiza with his wife when he heard the rules had changed. The couple, from Stevenage, in Hertfordshire, arrived on Saturday for a two-week holiday. ""Both of us are key workers and have worked through lockdown,"" Mr Ward tells the BBC. ""We feel safer here than back at home."" Meanwhile, those who work in the Spanish tourism industry could be in for a big setback, as nearly a quarter of all foreign tourists are from the UK. Dario, who owns a bar in Gran Canaria, says: âWe thought it was slowly
picking up and slowly getting back into business time, even if we were just
trying to cover costs. ""But this is absolutely a killer.â Maura, a bar owner in Lanzarote, says a blanket rule for all of Spain was the wrong decision. âWeâre a long way from mainland Spain,"" she tells BBC Outside Source. ""All the flights are direct from the UK, so it would be quite easy to police.â Lothar Wieler warned this could be the start of a ""second wave"" Let's take a look at Germany now, where the head of the public health agency has said they are ""very concerned"" by rising infections. ""We are in the middle of a rapidly developing pandemic,"" Lothar Wieler, head of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), told reporters earlier today. He said Germans had become ""negligent"" and urged people to wear masks and respect social distancing and hygiene rules. In the past week the country has recorded 3,611 new infections. ""We don't know yet if this is the beginning of a second wave but of course it could be,"" Mr Wieler said. ""But I am optimistic that if we follow the hygiene rules we can prevent it, it's up to us."" Read more here. A charity concert featuring US band The Chainsmokers is being investigated after footage appeared to show fans ignoring social distancing regulations. The concert, called Safe & Sound, took place on Saturday night in Southampton - a town in an affluent area known as The Hamptons, east of New York City. It was billed as a ""drive-in music experience"", but video taken from the stage showed crowds of people outside their cars, standing in close proximity. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said he was ""appalled"" by the footage. Read more here. The 40-year-old mayor said on Tuesday that he'd tested positive The mayor of the Colombian city of MedellÃ­n, Daniel Quintero, says he has tested positive for coronavirus. Mr Quintero has been praised for his early and data-driven approach to containing the virus in Colombia's second-largest city. He began holding preparedness meetings as early as January, when many politicians did not yet take the threat from the virus seriously. His strategy seemed to pay off in the early stages of the pandemic. On 21 April, only two people had died with Covid in MedellÃ­n, while 29 had died in Cali, which has fewer inhabitants. But in recent weeks the number of cases in MedellÃ­n and surrounding Antioquia province has shot up and now the mayor himself has Covid. He told Colombian radio that his love of coffee may be to blame. ""I have a lot of coffee and in order to drink it you have to take your mask off, so that may have been when I got it,"" he said. He has urged fellow coffee lovers to suppress their urge for a cup or at least carry their own thermos flask to minimise the risk of contracting the virus from cups. Dan RoanBBC Sports editor Sport has been held behind closed doors since its return, including England's Test series against West Indies The government is confident it can move towards a safe return for fans to watch sporting events in stadiums, sports minister Nigel Huddleston says. Prime Minister Boris Johnson previously said spectators could be able to return to stadiums in England from October. Earlier,Warwickshire faced Worcestershire at Edgbastonas part of a pilot programme that saw a limited number of fans allowed inside the ground. Read morehere. A $1tn (Â£77bn) pandemic recovery plan proposed by US Senate Republicans has included $53m of funding to protect the development of a coronavirus vaccine from hackers. According toa summary of the bill,external, funding will be given to America's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (Cisa), and will be used to improve network security in the wake of ""increased attacks"" on government agencies which are helping to develop a vaccine. The $53m is a dramatic increase from the $9.1m given to Cisa under the Cares Act - showing the government's concern about the dangers of cyber attacks against coronavirus research centres. The issue has been a source of immense diplomatic tensions during recent months. Last week America ordered China to close its consulate in Texas. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the decision was taken because China was ""stealing"" intellectual property. UK supermarket Sainsbury's is trialing a new system which will allowpeople to queue virtually to help with social distancing. The smartphone app will mean shoppers can wait in line in their cars, or another remote location, before heading into the store when it is their turn. The trial began at five UK stores on Monday and will run until mid-August. Experts say retailers need to find new ways to alleviate queuing as the UK heads into autumn and winter. Sainsbury's customers will be able to download the app onto their smartphones, from where they can monitor their position. A further 119 people have died in the UK after contracting coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to 45,878. A word of warning - these figures use data from Public Health England, which is currently reviewing its methodology afterit was found to beincluding people who tested positive months before they died. Another 581 people have tested positive for the virus, the Department of Health and Social Caresays,external, bringing the total number of UK cases to 300,692. New measures to stop the spread of Covid-19 have beenintroduced in Oldham, a large town in northern England, following a ""dramatic"" rise in cases. Residents are being asked not to have social visitors to their homes and to keep two metres apart when outside, while those who are shielding are asked to continue to do so until 14 August. Oldham Council's deputy leader Arooj Shah said the measures were essential to preventa Leicester-style local lockdown. Oldham follows Rochdale, its neighbouring Greater Manchester borough, and Blackburn with Darwen and Pendle in Lancashire, in introducing new measures. Two weeks ago Oldham was on Public Health England's ""watchlist"" as an area of concern but was removed last Thursday. Now the data is showing another spike, with 114 cases recorded so far in the week to 24 July - equivalent to more than 48 per 100,000 population. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Kylie Moore-Gilbert, a lecturer at Melbourne University, has been in jail since September 2018 A British-Australian woman serving a 10-year sentence in Iran for espionage has been transferred to a notorious prison in the desert, officials say. Kylie Moore-Gilbert, a lecturer at Melbourne University, has been in jail since September 2018. She was tried in secret and strongly denies all the charges against her. The Australian government has said it holds Iran responsible for Ms Moore-Gilbert's ""safety and well-being"" and is ""urgently seeking access"" to her. ""Dr Moore-Gilbert's case is one of the Australian government's highest priorities, including for our embassy officials in Tehran,"" Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said in a statement on Tuesday. The statement added that Iran had confirmed earlier reports from human rights activists that she had been moved to the notorious Qarchak prison. The jail is sometimes used as punishment for Iranian political prisoners and conditions have been described by former inmates as abysmal. Before being moved to Qarchak prison, Ms Moore-Gilbert, a lecturer in Middle East politics, had spent almost two years sleeping on the floor of a cell at Evin prison in the capital, Tehran, according to a friend. She has been in solitary confinement and on several hunger strikes, and she is said to have been beaten for trying to comfort new prisoners by passing notes and writing to them on prison walls. On Tuesday, the husband of British-Iranian charity worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe - who was jailed in Iran in 2016 on spying charges that she has always denied - said that Qarchak was a place where ""[Iranian] authorities sent women political prisoners when they wanted to break them"". ""It's in the middle of the desert with no clean running water, very poor food with the bread and rice drugged, and gang-ridden, so you can wait months to get a bed,"" Richard Ratcliffe said. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been on hunger strike in solidarity with Ms Moore-Gilbert. This video can not be played Why one mother's personal plight is part of a complicated history between Iran and the UK (video published August 2019 and last updated in October 2019) ""Qarchak jail is where common prisoners are held. It's overcrowded and some of them are dangerous,"" said Hadi Ghaemi, director of the Center for Human Rights in Iran. Referring to an earlier statement from Ms Moore-Gilbert that she had rejected an offer of freedom in return for becoming a spy for Iran, he added: ""They're not happy with her resilience and her refusal to co-operate."" A friend of the family told BBC World Affairs correspondent Caroline Hawley that Ms Moore-Gilbert ""feels abandoned"". ""The Australian government doesn't seem to have been very proactive - she's been short on money that she needs to buy basic provisions for herself in jail,"" they said. According to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Australian ambassador visited Ms Moore-Gilbert in Evin prison recently and had been in telephone contact with her over the past few months. Ms Moore-Gilbert told an Iranian human rights activist in a phone call earlier this week that she had not spoken to her family for about a month. Reza Khandan, the husband of imprisoned human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh, said in a Facebook post that Ms Moore-Gilbert was in ""a very bad condition"". He wrote that she had told him: ""I can't eat anything, I don't know, I'm so disappointed. I'm so very depressed."" Uncertain fate of Iran's jailed dual nationals In letters smuggled out of Tehran's Evin prison in January, the lecturer said she had ""never been a spy"" and feared for her mental health. She said she had rejected an offer from Iran to become a spy. ""I am not a spy. I have never been a spy, and I have no interest to work for a spying organisation in any country."" She also said she feared her health had ""deteriorated significantly"". ""I think I am in the midst of a serious psychological problem,"" she wrote, worsened by ""the ban on having any phone calls with my family"". Ms Moore-Gilbert remains adamant that she is ""an innocent woman... imprisoned for a crime I have not committed"". The Cambridge-educated academic was travelling on an Australian passport and was detained at Tehran airport in 2018 as she tried to leave following a conference. Last year, British-Australian woman Jolie King and her Australian boyfriend Mark Firkin were released after being jailed in Tehran for reportedly flying a drone without a permit.

"Hilary Mantel has won the Booker Prize twice - for Wolf Hall in 2009 and 2012's Bring Up the Bodies Hilary Mantel's The Mirror & The Light is among the novels longlisted for this year's Booker Prize. It is the third book in the author's Cromwell trilogy, and was selected for its ""masterful exhibition of sly dialogue and exquisite description,"" the judges said. Mantel has previously won the prize twice - for the first two novels in the trilogy. The longlist will be whittled down from 13 to a shortlist of six in September. British nominees this year include Gabriel Krauze, Douglas Stuart and Sophie Ward. Zimbabwean writer Tsitsi Dangarembga was nominated, like Mantel, for the third novel in her own trilogy - entitled This Mournable Body. This year's longlist - nicknamed the 'Booker's dozen' - features eight debut novels. Atwood and Evaristo share Booker Prize Queenie author 'proud' but 'sad' to win book award The prize, which has been going since 1969, was last year won jointly by Margaret Atwood and Bernardine Evaristo. The annual longlist was compiled from 162 English-language novels published in the UK or Ireland. Margaret Busby, chair of the 2020 judges, said that each of the titles on this year's list was ""deserving of wide readership"". ""Included are novels carried by the sweep of history with memorable characters brought to life and given visibility, novels that represent a moment of cultural change, or the pressures an individual faces in pre- and post-dystopian society,"" she said in a statement. Atwood praised Evaristo for encouraging black female writers ""Some of the books focus on interpersonal relationships that are complex, nuanced, emotionally charged. There are voices from minorities often unheard, stories that are fresh, bold and absorbing,"" she added. ""The best fiction enables the reader to relate to other people's lives; sharing experiences that we could not ourselves have imagined is as powerful as being able to identify with characters."" The shortlist of six books will be announced on 15 September, with the Â£50,000-prize winning author being revealed in November.

"Efforts by the Foreign Office to bring home more than a million Britons at the start of the coronavirus pandemic have been criticised by MPs. The Foreign Affairs Committee said the repatriation operation had been too slow, whilst advice had been misleading or confusing. It also said the government had been too reliant on commercial airlines. The Foreign Office said it had mounted a ""large-scale"" effort to get people during an ""unprecedented"" crisis. Around 1.3 million British nationals were travelling abroad at the height of the pandemic earlier this year. In a report,,externalthe cross-party committee said despite some ""notable successes,"" the Foreign Office was ""outpaced by events"" as the pandemic unfolded. Too many UK citizens were not provided with support they should ""reasonably expect to receive,"" it added, whilst ""little was done"" to provide financial support for those facing hardship while stuck abroad. It added that although emergency loans were offered, awareness of them was low and people were initially advised to borrow money from friends and family. The committee also criticised communication efforts, adding that some were on the phone for ""long periods of time"" and whilst others' calls were not answered. It said respondents to a survey it had conducted had found official advice ""outdated or unhelpful,"" whilst four in ten were unable to contact their local embassy. MPs said the Foreign Office had relied too much on commercial flights. Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, who chairs the committee, said many people had received advice that was ""confusing, inconsistent and lacking in compassion"". At other times, he added, advice was ""misleading and outdated, and, in the worst cases, entirely absent."" ""The lack of accurate, helpful information meant many felt forgotten and as though they had been left to fend for themselves,"" he said. The committee said the government had ""placed too much reliance"" on flights provided by commercial operators to get people home. It found that countries which had instead opted for charter flights, such as Germany and France, had been able to bring their citizens home quicker. It added that whilst the UK had chartered 186 flights for 1.3m nationals, around 260 flights were chartered by Germany for 260,000 citizens. The committee said that by the end of June, only Â£40.5m from a Â£75m fund to pay for charter flights had been spent. A Foreign Office spokesman said: ""Against the background of local lockdowns and international flight bans, the team worked tirelessly to keep commercial routes open as long as possible,  while bringing stranded Brits home on 186 charter flights from 57 countries and territories. ""We have retained a repatriation team for the remainder of the year and boosted investment in our consular services and crisis management to ensure we are further prepared to support Brits caught up in the pandemic.""

"Nicola Sturgeon gives her first coronavirus briefing since Spain was removed from the list of countries exempt from quarantine measures The first minister urges people in Scotland to stay at home as she voices worries about the rise of positive cases internationally She adds that ""as a citizen"", and not first minister, she would not be personally booking a foreign holiday at this time For the 12th day there are no new deaths linked to Covid-19 During the last 24 hours, four positive tests were registered and two patients were in ICU having been confirmed as having the virus The BBC learns Scotland's care watchdog was warned multiple times about staff shortages at care homes BBC Scotland News That concludes our live coverage on the latest developments in Scotland on Tuesday, 28 July, a day when the prime minister
has warned there are signs of a second wave of the virus in parts of Europe and
further quarantines for holidaymakers could be on the cards. Meanwhile here in Scotland First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is ""increasingly concerned"" about the risk from coronavirus after a ""worrying resurgence"" in several other countries. We'll be back with more live coverage in the morning. Have a good evening and stay safe. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Donald Macaskill, chief executive
of Scottish Care, which represents the private care home sector, believes a ""root and branch review"" is required to decide how much the public purse should provide to the sector. Most care is delivered by private
and charitable organisations on behalf of the state, he points out, with staff pay pegged to the minimum wage and the Scottish living wage. Just how much do we value care? At the moment you can get more money by walking a dog in Edinburgh than you can for caring for a human being.â Donald Macaskill, Scottish Care Less than 16% of Scotlandâs care homes are owned by the 'big five' chains -  which include wealthy equity firms - with the vast majority owned by private family-owned businesses, Mr Macaskill adds. ""The vast majority deliver excellent care. This isnât an issue of individuals seeking profit; itâs an issue of the failure to value care."" You can watch the BBC Scotland documentary,The Care Home Scandal,on BBC One tonight at 22:45 or on the BBC iPlayer. If you are just joining us here are the main points from today's Scottish government coronavirus briefing: There were nearly 200 warnings about staff shortages in care homes in Scotland during lockdown, according to the Care Inspectorate. Their figures have been published for the first time, following a BBC Freedom of Information request. Care homes had to flag up red and amber staffing alerts to inspectors for eleven weeks from the start of April. Thirty red warnings were issued - this meant homes didnât have enough staff to properly care for their residents. This video can not be played Coronavirus in care homes: ''Thousands are dead, it's too little, too late' The Care Inspectorate received another one hundred and forty-nine amber warnings that staffing was stretched and close to impacting on the quality of care. BBCâs Disclosure hears from the granddaughter of a woman who died in a care home in East Kilbride, where 39 staff were off at the height of the pandemic. You can hear more on that story on Disclosure: The Care Home Scandal, tonight at 10:45 on BBC One Scotland, and on the BBC iPlayerDuring the coronavirus pandemic more people died with the virus in Scotland's care homes than in its hospitals. You can read more about this story here. A Glasgow Caledonian University professor has joined students on the nursing frontline to help with Covid-19 testing. Andrea Nelson, dean of the school of health and life sciences, takes Fridays off as annual leave to cover her NHS shift. She also donates her salary to the GCU Foundation Common Good Fund. Prof Nelson, a registered adult nurse, has been working alongside undergraduates at the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde Covid-19 Community Assessment Centre in north Glasgow. She re-registered in April and was assigned to the centre after eight hours of mandatory update training. Prof Nelson said: ""Getting ready for deployment, navigating all of the processes to register my application and completing the training, gave me renewed respect for our students who are doing this in addition to their studies, clinical placement and university assessments."" Miles Briggs, health
spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives, says he is not surprised by BBC Scotland's revelation that the Care Inspectoratereceived 30 red warnings during lockdownthat homes did not have enough staff to properly care for their residents. Mr Briggs denied the situation arose from Conservative government cuts a decade ago, insisting there have been record amounts of money invested by the UK and Scottish governments in the social care network. ""We didnât have the workforce
in place in Scotland; we need to really  tackle that at the end of this
crisis,"" he told BBC Radio Scotland. ""The care home sector should
have been put on the same emergency response as our NHS. We should have seen testing
and PPE put in place on the same levels for the care home sector. ""That way we could
have tried to prevent the infections that we saw."" Mr Briggs added he does not think Scotland is ""in a good place"" in preparations for a possible second
wave of infections, especially care homes that have not seen any infections. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Nicola Sturgeon was âreally bluntâ in saying she âwouldnât be
booking a foreign holiday right nowâ at her briefing earlier and people should be âvery cautious about
non-essential foreign travel right nowâ. Shona Thorne, from Thorne Travel in Ayrshire, said agents were ""extremely disappointed"" in the first minister's response. ""Weâve always said if itâs not
safe, we shouldnât be flying,"" she told BBC Radio Scotland. ""The government then said it is safe to fly, and we
have followed all the guidelines. ""For the first minister to then say she wouldnât
be recommending it seems very, very strange indeed."" Ms Thorne says the travel industry needs more information about how decisions are being made - ""Are we going for figures, projected figures, the R number?"" - and called for regional strategies for each country rather than blanket bans. ""The Canary Islands are closer to Africa than Spain, so it doesn't make logical sense, or statistically,"" she adds. If we have a spike in Athens, does that mean all the islands should close? Should we say âdonât come to Scotland' if thereâs a spike in Blackpool?"" Shona Thorne, Travel agent  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

first minister warned earlier that although the majority of hospitality businesses are
following the rules, some guidance measures - such as seating
areas not being cleaned thoroughly, staff not wearing face coverings and contact details not being taken - are being breached. Paul Waterson from the Scottish Licensed
Trade Association, told BBC Radio Scotland Nicola Sturgeon's message was ""well made"" and something his organisation ""certainly supports"". ""We
have always said itâs very important we follow the rules and make sure
customers feel safe and comfortable and enjoy the experience,"" he says. ""That is what will
bring them back into your premises. ""If places are not doing basic stuff like taking details, wearing face masks, cleaning tables, then customers will not support them,

The pandemic cost Â£248bn to the global tourism industry in lost revenue between January and May, according to the UN World Tourism Organization (UNWTO). In a report, the organisation said this loss was three times greater than that of the global financial crisis of 2009"". Tourist numbers also fell by 300 million during the period - a 56% drop from the same time last year - as lockdown measures brought a stop to international travel. âThis latest data makes clear the importance of restarting tourism as soon as it is safe to do so,"" said UNWTO Secretary-General Zurab Pololikashvili. ""The dramatic fall in international tourism places many millions of livelihoods at risk, including in developing countries."" Numerous studies have concluded that face masks can prevent people from spreading airway germs to others. But nowa new paper,external, due to be published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine, has found that masks also protect the people wearing them too - lessening the severity of symptoms, or preventing infection entirely in some cases. Using animal experiments and observations during the pandemic, the group of scientists says people wearing face coverings take in fewer coronavirus particles, making it easier for their immune systems to combat any viral spread. Dr. Tsion Firew, a doctor at Columbia University in the US - who wasnât involved in the work, - told the New York Times that a relationship between masking and milder disease had not yet been proven. But the new research paper âreiterates what we say about masks,â said Dr Firew. âItâs not just a selfless act.â  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The experience of people who were already marginalised and facing the most isolation during lockdown is to be researched at Glasgow University. A 25-member team is funded by the Scottish government until November to gather evidence from some of the poorest communities, refugees and asylum- eekers, victims of abuse, families with a parent in prison, and those who have been required to shield in their homes. The intention is to help guide Holyrood policy, and also to report on effective coping strategies and resilience among those facing some of the hardest circumstances.

"Najib Razak (centre) was prime minister from 2009 to 2018 A court in Malaysia has sentenced former PM Najib Razak to 12 years in jail after finding him guilty on all seven counts in the first of several multi-million dollar corruption trials. Najib had pleaded not guilty to the charges of criminal breach of trust, money laundering and abuse of power. The case against him is seen as a test of Malaysia's anti-corruption efforts. The 1MDB scandal around a state-owned wealth fund in Malaysia has uncovered a global web of fraud and corruption. It sent shockwaves through Malaysia's political establishment, leading to the toppling of Najib's UMNO party, which had governed the country for 61 years since it gained independence. Najib, in office from 2009 to 2018, was sentenced to 12 years in prison for abuse of power, and 10 years in jail for each of six counts of money laundering and breach of trust. The sentences - to run concurrently - will be suspended pending appeal. ""After considering all evidence in this trial, I find that the prosecution has successfully proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt,"" judge Mohamad Nazlan Mohamad Ghazali told the Kuala Lumpur High Court. ""I am surely not satisfied with the result,"" Najib told reporters. ""This is definitely not the end of the world, because there's a process of appeal, and we hope that we would be successful then,"" he added. Tuesday's verdicts centred on 42 million ringgit ($10m; Â£7.7m) transferred from the fund to the then-prime minister's private accounts. Najib denies all wrongdoing and says he was misled by financial advisers - in particular fugitive financier Jho Low. Jho Low has been charged in both the US and Malaysia, but also maintains his innocence. A supporter reacts after the verdicts were announced Najib's defence team argued he was led to believe the funds in his accounts were donated by the Saudi royal family - rather than misappropriated from the state fund. The charges carried as much as 15 to 20 years in prison each. 1MDB scandal: The playboys, PMs and partygoers Najib Razak: The fall of Malaysia's former PM How Malaysiaâs government collapsed in two years Goldman Sachs settles 1MDB with Malaysia for $3.9bn The case centres around the 1 Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), a sovereign wealth fund set up in 2009, when Najib Razak was prime minister. Sovereign wealth funds are government-owned investment funds that are used to boost a country's economic development. Built with state earnings, such as revenues from oil resources and exports, they have extraordinary flows of cash to invest and potentially enormous international clout. In 2015, questions were raised around 1MBD's activities after it missed payments owed to banks and bondholders. Malaysian and US authorities allege that $4.5bn was illicitly plundered from the fund and diverted into private pockets. The missing money has been linked to luxury real estate, a private jet, Van Gogh and Monet artworks - and even a Hollywood blockbuster, the Wolf of Wall Street. Last week,US bank Goldman Sachs reached a $3.9bn settlementwith the Malaysian government for its role in the multi-billion-dollar corruption scheme. The deal resolved charges in Malaysia that the bank misled investors when it helped raise $6.5bn for 1MDB. Since his dramatic election defeat two years ago, the first for his party in 60 years - and the humiliation of seeing luxury items wheeled from his home in shopping trolleys by the police - Najib Razak has enjoyed something of a political resurrection. Still a very powerful figure within UMNO, the former ruling party, he has successfully posed as a champion of ethnic Malays, many of whom became disillusioned with the reformist coalition which replaced him. When that coalition collapsed in February, and UMNO joined a new government, Najib expressed confidence that the series of trials would go his way. That confidence proved misplaced. This first criminal conviction of such a senior political figure must now hurt his standing within UMNO, and will improve the public standing of Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin - once a close colleague and stalwart of UMNO who was fired in 2016 over his objections to the 1MDB scandal. He now leads a fragile coalition with a wafer-thin parliamentary majority, pushing Malaysia into uncharacteristically choppy political waters. The former prime minister was cleared of all allegations by Malaysian authorities while he was still in office. Yet the accusations played a big part in his election defeat in 2018 - and the new government swiftly reopened investigations into the 1MDB case. While Tuesday's verdicts were the first, they were possibly not the most significant. A separate trial that began last Augustlooks at accusations the former prime minister illicitly obtained 2.28bn ringgit ($550m, Â£448m) from 1MDB between 2011 and 2014. He is facing 21 counts of money-laundering and four of abuse of power but again denies any wrongdoing. His wife, Rosmah Mansor, also faces money-laundering and tax evasion charges, to which she has pleaded not guilty.

"Many countries are worried Hong Kong's ""unique status"" is at stake China has said Hong Kong will suspend extradition treaties with Britain, Canada and Australia, after they took similar steps over the territory's controversial new security law. The foreign ministry spokesman accused the countries of ""gross interference in China's internal affairs"". New Zealand made the same move after the other three. China said it reserved the right to respond to this too. The law reduces the city's autonomy and makes it easier to punish protesters. ""Judicial co-operation has been politically manipulated by Canada, Australia and the UK - a wrong move that damages the conditions for such co-operation and deviates from its purpose of upholding justice and the rule of law,"" foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said. ""Therefore China has decided that the Hong Kong special administrative region will suspend its agreements of surrendering fugitive offenders and of mutual assistance in criminal matters with Canada, Australia and the UK."" The three countries, along with New Zealand and the US, are part of the so-called Five Eyes intelligence alliance. The US has signalled it plans to suspend its extradition treaty with Hong Kong. The US has decided to rescind Hong Kong's special trading privileges after the new law was enacted. Earlier this month US lawmakers approved sanctions in response to the law, targeting banks that do business with Chinese officials involved in cracking down on pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. This video can not be played Hong Kong residents are worried the new law means the end of the ""one country, two systems"" principle Hong Kong's government says the widely criticised law is required to bring order to a city that saw mass pro-democracy protests last year which often turned violent. China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? Australia suspends Hong Kong extradition treaty UK suspends extradition treaty with Hong Kong Announcing New Zealand's move earlier on Tuesday, Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters said China had ""eroded rule-of-law principles, undermined the 'one country, two systems' framework that underpins Hong Kong's unique status, and gone against commitments China made to the international community"". Travel advice has also been updated,externalto alert New Zealanders to risks presented by the law. Military and dual-use goods and technology exports from New Zealand to Hong Kong will now be treated in the same way as New Zealand treats such exports to China. Canada and Australia said they were suspending their extradition treaties with Hong Kong in early July. The UK announced its decision last week. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the ""imposition"" of the newsecurity lawin Hong Kong by Beijing was a ""serious violation"" of the country's international obligations. The UK and others fear the new arrangement could see anyone extradited to Hong Kong from their territory being subsequently sent on to China. This video can not be played Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab warns Beijing: ""The UK is watching and the whole world is watchingâ Beijing introduced the security law at the end of June, creating new offences which could see Hong Kong residents sent to mainland China for trial. Critics said it could see pro-democracy protesters in the region being served with life sentences. They have also said the law breaches an agreement made with the UK before Hong Kong - a former British colony - was handed over to China in 1997. Under the 50-year agreement, China enshrined civil liberties - including the right to protest, freedom of speech and the independence of the judiciary - in Hong Kong's Basic Law, an approach which came to be known as ""one country, two systems"".
