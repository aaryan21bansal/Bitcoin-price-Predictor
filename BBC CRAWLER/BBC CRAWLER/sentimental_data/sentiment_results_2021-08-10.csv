"Esther Dingley sent this selfie at the top of a mountain on 22 November The boyfriend of a British woman who went missing while hiking in the Pyrenees has found her body and belongings. Esther Dingley, from Durham, vanished on a solo trek in November sparking major searches by French and Spanish police and her partner Daniel Colegate. A fragment of bone found in July wasconfirmed to be the 37-year-old's. LBT Global, which is supporting the family, said an accident ""is the most likely hypothesis"". A spokesman for the overseas crisis support charity said Mr Colegate found his girlfriend's remains on Monday afternoon, close to where the bone fragment was discovered. Chris Bockman, a British journalist working in Toulouse, said French police searches had been hampered by a number of search and rescue operations and thunderstorms. He said according to the French judge leading the investigation, officers are beginning to collect forensic information at the ""difficult to reach site"" which will be DNA analysed, while a helicopter will be used ""if necessary"" to recover Ms Dingley's body. Daniel Colegate and Esther Dingley were on an open-ended campervan tour of Europe Since Ms Dingley vanished, her partner hadwalked hundreds of milesin the mountains on the French and Spanish border looking for signs of her. ""At this stage an accident is the most likely hypothesis, given the location and other early indications,"" LBT Global said. ""A full investigation is under way to confirm the details surrounding this tragedy. ""The family remain incredibly grateful for the efforts of the police units involved and their commitment to understanding the exact circumstances of Esther's death."" Ms Dingley, who was an experienced hiker, was trekking alone when shelast communicated with her partnerfrom the top of Pic De Sauvegarde at about 16:00 on 22 November. Mr Colegate, who was staying 100 miles away in a French farmhouse, raised the alarm several days later when she failed to report in at an agreed time. The couple wereon an open-ended campervan tour of Europeand Ms Dingley was on the final walk of a month-long solo expedition when she vanished. Esther Dingley was an experienced walker, her family said Police on both sides of the border used helicopters and specialist teams to search for her in the days between her disappearance and the arrival of the heavy winter snow. The failure to find any sign of her leftMr Colegate ""baffled""and led to fears she may have been kidnapped. Mr Colegate began his own searcheswhen the winter weather eased in Aprilfollowed a few weeks laterby the police. Dan and Esther had been together since meeting at university in 2003 The couple met in 2003 when they were both students at Oxford University and later moved to Durham. In 2014, after Mr Colegate nearly died following an operation, they decided to swap their lives running their own businesses and embark on a campervan tour of Europe involving lots of hiking and cycling. During their travels, they adopted a pregnant dog in Spain who gave birth to five puppies who joined them on their adventure. Mr Colegate has written books about their travels whileMs Dingley ran a blog detailing their exploits,external.

"Winchester Cathedral is the city's most famous landmark Winchester is the least affordable city to buy a home in, says the Halifax. Its figures suggest buying a home in the Hampshire commuter city will cost 14 times average earnings, higher than Greater London at 11 times. Typically, buying a home in a UK city will now set buyers back 8.1 times their average earnings, up from 5.6 times a decade ago. House prices have ""generally continued to outstrip wage growth"", said Halifax managing director Russell Galley. Winchester has leapfrogged Oxford as the least affordable city in the annual survey, while Londonderry is the most affordable for the third year in a row. In the Northern Ireland city, a home will cost 4.7 times average earnings. House price growth slows as housing market cools House prices at new high as buyers seek more space Over the past year, the Halifax reckons the average house price in UK cities has grown by 10.3%. Its analysis of figures from the Office for National Statistics suggests average earnings for people living and working in cities climbed just 2.1% over the same time period. Average city house prices increased to Â£287,440, while comparable average earnings rose to Â£35,677. Surprisingly, cities are slightly more affordable than the average for the UK as a whole, according to the figures. But that may partly reflect more people moving out of cities in search of more space during the pandemic. A home in Winchester will now set buyers back an average Â£630,432, up 8% in the last year. That leaves it with the highest average house prices of any UK city, ahead of St Albans at Â£604,423 and London at Â£564,695. The least expensive average house prices among cities are in Londonderry at Â£155,917 and Hull Â£156,924. Average earnings in Winchester are Â£45,059, higher than for the UK as a whole and only beaten by St Albans at Â£59,391 and Greater London at Â£51,257. ""The beauty of Winchester is that you can be both country mouse and city mouse at the same time,"" Katie Cave, director at mortgage broker Clearpoint Finance, told the BBC. ""Weekends can be spent taking in the views at the top of St Catherine's Hill, nestled in the heart of a nature reserve. Then come Monday morning, you can hop on the train to London and be at your desk in just over an hour."" Emma Seaton moved to Winchester from London Emma Seaton moved from Wandsworth in south London to a village just outside Winchester to get various benefits for her family while her husband could still commute to London. ""We moved out here for the stunning, diverse countryside, community feel and accessibility: but it's less than an hour on the train to London,"" said Emma, director of buying agency Prime Purchase. ""The villages surrounding the city boast thriving communities with busy shops and pubs and the schools are excellent, and we also enjoy easy access to the coast, the New Forest and the ancient capital of Wessex."" She said Winchester's bars, cafes, restaurants and plenty of culture were all within easy walking distance of each other, adding to the city's attraction. ""Winchester is more manageable than Oxford, which is often snarled up with traffic, making it a nicer city to live in."" There is some good news: in one in nine UK cities, property has become more affordable in the last 12 months. Housing affordability improved in seven cities compared with a year earlier: Oxford, Carlisle, Portsmouth, Durham, Salford, Inverness and Glasgow. According to the figures, Carlisle and Aberdeen are now more affordable than five years ago, while Inverness is the only city more affordable than 10 years ago. An average home there costs 5.6 times average earnings, down from 6.2 in 2011, as wage growth there has outstripped house price growth. ""Affordability is significantly better in the North and there are now just two cities - Plymouth and Portsmouth - with better-than-average affordability in the South,"" said Mr Galley.

"Euro Auctions was established in County Tyrone in 1998 The founder of a County Tyrone business that has been sold for Â£775m has said ""it is a fantastic deal for the company"". Euro Auctions in Dromore buys and sells industrial plant, construction equipment and agricultural machinery all over the world. The firm was set up in Dromore in 1998 by Derek Keys and his brothers. It has grown to have more than 200 staff across 14 countries. It was bought by the Canadian company Ritchie Bros. Last year, Euro Auctions conducted 60 auctions, selling close to 90,000 items for more than Â£484m. Brothers Derek and Jonnie Keys said they were delighted for the company Derek Keys, Euro Auctions' founder, said it was ""a great day for myself, from humble beginnings with my father starting out in business"". ""I never thought the business would grow to this size and with the help of all the staff here in Dromore it's been great. ""I'm delighted for the company, it's been a good journey and I've enjoyed every day and I look forward to working with Ritchie Bros team."" Jonnie Keys, operations manager at Euro Auctions, said he is delighted for his family and the firm's 200 staff. ""The company is very family orientated and Ritchie Bros originated in the same background - three brothers started the business and they've taken it to a $5.4bn turnover, the largest industrial construction auctioneer in the world,"" he said. ""There's lots of services that the Ritchie Bros have that we are not able to offer our customers so, going forward, we'll be able to lock these services and bring them to our own customers throughout the world and help the business to grow further."" He said that moving the business to capture an online market helped the company to grow as well. Founder of Euro Auctions Derek Keys said he never thought the business would grow to this size ""We were one of the first in local auction and business to adopt the whole internet process which stood us in good steed. ""More recently we were able to switch our model at the start of Covid last year and we went straight to online which was a bit of a test in a zone. ""We have auctioneers based in the US and we did the internet bidding here in Dromore so I suppose the company is a technology company as well as an auction company, and that has allowed use to grow and expand very quickly. Ritchie Bros' chief executive Ann Fandozzi said: ""When companies come together it's as much about culture and people and protecting a legacy that has been built by these brothers for 23 years."" The deal is expected to close late 2021 or early 2022.

"This video can not be played How have Scottish pupils found their results grading? Elation, stress, relief and uncertainty are just some of the emotions felt by pupils across Scotland as grades are confirmed for National 5, Higher and Advanced Higher qualifications. BBC Scotland has spoken to a number of pupils at Portlethen Academy in Aberdeenshire who shared their results and views on the grading process. Abbie Collett said she would welcome a return to the normal exams system S5 pupil Abbie Collett said she was ""very happy"" with her A, B and two Cs as well as a pass in a foundation apprenticeship, and hopes to study primary education after sixth year. But prior to the cancellation of exams, she found it ""difficult"" not knowing how her work would be assessed. ""It was quite difficult not knowing what was happening at the start of the year and what bits of the courses you were and weren't going to learn,"" she said. ""It was challenging doing online learning as well. ""I thought I might have done worse due to everything going on, but I was happy with my grades that I needed and the teachers were a big help this year with pushing you with what you wanted to do."" Record high for A grades as pass rate falls Four things to look out for on results day Abbie said she would welcome a return to the normal exam system. ""You had an expectation of what you were going to be getting this year so it wasn't as nerve wracking,"" said Abbie. ""I'm just going into S6 so I've never done proper exams. ""I would hope it will be proper exams again because it's easier, it's fairer on all pupils because everyone doing them at the same time all over the country and everybody has a fair opportunity."" Ross Greenlees hopes to pursue a career in catering Ross Greenlees agreed the initial uncertainty around the exams process made it ""difficult to prepare"", but thought the eventual assessment of his work was ""fair"". He got two As at Nat 5 level, a C and a pass in an apprenticeship in food and drink technology. ""It was pretty good considering the circumstances,"" he said. ""We sort of knew our grades before today but getting the confirmation those were the final grades was a good feeling."" Ross hopes to go to college for a cooking course and pursue a career in catering - but first comes S6. Whether exams return as normal next year or not, he hopes decisive action will be taken. ""If the exams were going to come back it would be easier if they came back fully,"" he said. ""But if it's assessments throughout the year and your grade is taken from work you've actually produced, I feel that's worked quite well.""

""I knew I'd got it because I've been doing music my whole life,"" she said. ""Chemistry was a bit of an unknown but I got what I needed. ""I think it was better for me, choosing things that were assessed throughout the year, so they took a lot of that pressure and stress off me that I know a lot of my friends had - especially with all the things that were going on with Covid."" Jorja believes the overall grading process was dealt with ""pretty well"", though added the final assessments ""felt like exams"". ""There was definitely ups and downs the whole way through - but I think the teachers and the school did everything they could, you knew they were there to support you.

"Lionel Messi joins fellow superstars Neymar and Kylian Mbappe at PSG Lionel Messi has signed a two-year contract with Paris St-Germain after leaving Barcelona. The 34-year-old's deal also has the option of a third year. Messi left Barca - the only club he has played for - as they were unable to afford a new deal under La Liga's financial fair play rules. ""I am impatient to start a new chapter of my career in Paris. The club and its vision are in perfect harmony with my ambitions,"" said the Argentina star. ""I know how talented the players and staff are here. I am determined to build, alongside them, something great for the club and for the fans. I can't wait to set foot on the Parc des Princes pitch."" 'Messi feels betrayed' - The inside track on superstar's 'heartbreaking' Barca exit Lionel Messi completes PSG move - reaction Bonus Football Daily podcast: Messi officially signs for PSG PSG president Nasser al-Khelaifi said: ""I am delighted that Lionel Messi has chosen to join Paris St-Germain and we are proud to welcome him to Paris, with his family. ""He did not hide his desire to continue to evolve at the highest level and to win trophies. The ambition of the club is of course identical. ""The addition of Leo to our world-class team confirms the relevance and success of our recruitment. Together with our great coach and his staff, I look forward to seeing our team make history for all of our supporters around the world."" This video can not be played Lionel Messi: Ten great goals for Barcelona Considered one of the greatest players of all time, Messi scored a record 672 goals in 778 games for Barca, the club he joined as a 13-year-old. The striker has won the Ballon d'Or a record six times and lifted 35 trophies with the Catalan club. He becomes PSG's fourth free-transfer signing this summer after the arrivals of Netherlands midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum, Spain defender Sergio Ramos and Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma. Highly rated Morocco right-back Achraf Hakimi also joined from Inter Milan. Messi, who will wear the number 30 shirt, will play in a front three alongside the two most expensive players of all time - Neymar and Kylian Mbappe. A PSG news conference will take place in the auditorium of the Parc des Princes on Wednesday at 10:00 BST. Messi could make his PSG debut at home to Strasbourg on Saturday. Pictures of Lionel Messi are being taken down at the Nou Camp Keeping Messi at the Nou Camp had been president Joan Laporta's top priority this summer, but attempts to agree a new contract were severely complicated by the club's financial problems. He officially became a free agent when his previous deal expired on 1 July, but it was still widely anticipated he would stay. However, Barcelona confirmed last week that Messi would be leaving the club because of""financial and structural obstacles"". On Sunday he broke down in tears at a news conference in which he admitted he did not want to leave Barcelona, but had no choice. Messi had agreed a new deal - on 50% of his old wages - to stay at Barcelona but the club could not afford to implement it because they were so far above the wage limit allowed by La Liga. ""He used to earn 140m euros gross a year at Barca, that's around Â£125m,"" BBC Sport columnist Guillem Balague told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""Take off about 40-50% for tax. ""He agreed to stay at Barcelona by reducing his wages by 50%, not more than that because that's illegal [under Spanish law]. Basically the league wouldn't believe he was reducing his wages to zero, which is what Barcelona may have tried to do as they are 1bn euros in debt. Basically they cannot afford him."" The news sparked a scramble for his services, with Manchester City and Chelsea among those to be linked, but it is PSG who have won the race to secure the Argentine superstar's signature, seen as one of the most noteworthy captures in football's history. He will now form a formidable-looking strike force alongside his former Barca team-mate Neymar, France World Cup winner Mbappe and another Argentine, Mauro Icardi. Messi also joins international team-mates Angel di Maria and Leandro Paredes in the French capital, just three weeks after the trio helped Argentina win the Copa America for the first time in 28 years. Where will Messi, Neymar, Mbappe rank in the great forward lines? PSG are yet to win the Champions League in a decade of Qatari ownership and subsequent heavy investment, with the 2020 final defeat against Bayern Munich the closest they have come. Mauricio Pochettino's side also finished second to Lille in Ligue 1 last season. ""Clearly what PSG's ownership want is a team that is in the Champions League final every year,"" said Balague. ""With Messi you have an advantage. Mauricio Pochettino being in charge and his contract being renewed as well means they have an idea how to do that, and Messi will complement that.

"The transmitter mast can be seen for miles around A TV transmitter fire that disrupted broadcasts for more than a million people has been put out but there are concerns about the mast's stability. The blaze at the 315 metres (1,032ft) tall Bilsdale mast on the North York Moors affected Freeview and FM radio. North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service said the mast fire had led to ""concerns about its structural integrity"". Walker Ron Needham, 71, said he had seen ""a huge black cloud of smoke come from the buildings at the bottom"". He had been hiking on the moor with his wife Sue, 69, when they stopped for lunch at the base of the mast. They noticed ""nothing untoward at that stage"" but, after carrying on their walk for about a mile and a half, turned to look at the mast and noticed ""smoke coming out of the top, a bit like a chimney"", Mr Needham said. A 300 metre (984ft) exclusion zone is in place around the tower. Eight pumps and crews from across the region were sent to tackle the blaze at 13:19 BST after a call from an engineer working at the transmitter north of Helmsley. In a statement North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service said firefighters had ""worked to control the fire in difficult circumstances and extinguished a fire in a single-storey stone building and transmitter mast"". It added: ""Only one building in a complex of four was affected and there are concerns about the structural integrity of the mast. ""A 300 metre exclusion zone has been put in place around the mast."" The fire service said it would be working on Wednesday with Arqiva, the site operators, ""to bring the incident to a safe conclusion"". The tower was built in 1969 and provides coverage for homes across northern England, from Tadcaster round to Leyburn, then up to Seaham and most of the way down the coast to Filey.

"Former Prime Minister David Cameron personally promoted Greensill Capital to investors before the controversial company collapsed. BBC Panorama discovered Mr Cameron appeared with the company's founder, Lex Greensill, at an event hosted by the Swiss bank Credit Suisse in 2019. The collapse of Greensill in March has left the bank's clients facing billions of dollars in losses. Mr Cameron says there was no wrongdoing in any of the actions he took. Education secretary Gavin Williamson told BBC Radio Four's Today programme on Tuesday that Mr Cameron had been ""absolutely cleared"" of any wrongdoing by two independent investigations. He added he had made himself ""available to parliamentary scrutiny"", which was ""the right thing to do"". Mr Cameron worked for the company as a part-time adviser for two-and-a-half years after stepping down as prime minister. Panorama has also discovered documents indicatinghis role earned him about $10m before tax. Mr Cameron's spokesman has said his remuneration was a private matter. The June event Mr Cameron attended was called ""The Future of Supply Chain Finance"", and the audience were wealthy Credit Suisse clients. What's the David Cameron lobbying row about? David Cameron lacked judgement over Greensill, MPs' report says Ex-PM David Cameron cleared by lobbying watchdog Credit Suisse was marketing and selling Greensill investments at the time, and the bank told investors they were low risk. Investors thought their money was being loaned to companies that were awaiting payment for goods and services they had sold. The loans were supposed to be backed up by unpaid invoices, but earlier this year it was revealed that some of the invoices simply did not exist. US court papers show how between 2018 and 2021, Greensill lent $850m of investors' cash to a US coal company called Bluestone Resources. Only $70m of that money was secured against real invoices for coal that Bluestone had actually sold. Investors did not know it, but the remaining $780m was only backed by predicted coal sales that may or may not happen in the future. Lex Greensill told Panorama that this type of financing was commonplace in the financial services industry. He said the predicted Bluestone business was all ""based upon future trade that is likely to occur with current customers"". Panorama discovered that was not true. The programme obtained the names of the companies that Lex Greensill said were current customers of Bluestone. Six of the companies said they were not Bluestone customers and they weren't planning to buy its coal in the future. Lex Greensill later told Panorama the coal buyers did not have to be current customers. Bluestone only had to state it expected to make the sales at some future point and Greensill was not obliged to make checks, he said. Mr Greensill denied misleading investors. He said his company made all the appropriate disclosures to Credit Suisse and the Swiss Bank was ""solely responsible for making any disclosures to their investors"". He said the loans were always secured against assets and personal guarantees, and were backed up by insurance that would pay 100% of any shortfall. Credit Suisse says its focus is on returning cash to investors and that 59% has been returned so far. Mr Cameron's spokesman told Panorama he was neither a director of Greensill, nor involved in any lending decisions, and that he had no special insight into what ultimately happened. The spokesman said: ""It is also preposterous to suggest that he would work for any company if he was aware that it was behaving improperly, or was in any way seeking to mislead investors.""

"AMC has 620 cinemas in the US, and 358 in Europe AMC, the US cinema chain that owns Odeon, says it will allow customers to pay for movie tickets and concessions in Bitcoin by the end of the year. Boss Adam Aron said it has been exploring the technology and ""how else AMC can participate in this new burgeoning cryptocurrency universe"". The firm, which is the largest US cinema chain, has not said whether it will apply to its cinemas in Europe. Bitcoin has seen wild price swings in recent weeks. The highly-speculative cryptocurrency was trading at about $45,000 (Â£32,500) on Tuesday, after falling below $30,000 last month. However, an increasing number of businesses have begun to accept it as payment as it goes mainstream, including US mobile operator AT&T, Microsoft and Wikipedia. ""I've had to learn more in the past six months about blockchain and cryptocurrency than I learned about it in the entire decade before that,"" Mr Aron, 66, told journalists on a conference call. ""This increased knowledge has given me the confidence to tell you all today that AMC is hereby formally announcing... that by year's end we will have the information technology systems in place to accept Bitcoin."" Commentators suggest AMC is trying to appeal to young amateur traders that have piled into its own shares over the last six months, turning it into a so-called ""meme stock"". Banding together on the social media site Reddit, these investors have driven up the price of AMC stock by some 1,500% this year - although it has little bearing on the struggling chain's actual financial performance. Following the Bitcoin announcement AMC shares jumped almost 6% on Tuesday before falling back. AMC was also the top trending stock on social media site Stocktwits, according to Reuters. Scarlett Johansson sues Disney over streaming However the firm's results for the six months to 30 June, released on Monday, told a different story. Revenue dived almost 40% to Â£593m, as cinemas in many places remained shut due to the pandemic, or customers stayed away due to Covid. Demand is also yet to recover despite restrictions having eased in the US and elsewhere. The firm said its ticket revenue in the third quarter was only on track to reach 45% of 2019 levels. However, AMC has struck a deal with movie studio Warner Bros to allow a 45-day theatrical window for movies before their streaming release from 2022. It hopes this will drive up ticket sales - which had been falling before the pandemic - for scheduled releases including ""The Batman"" and ""Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom"". A number of Hollywood studios opted to bypass cinemas during the pandemic and release their films online instead. Now most cinemas have reopened, giants like Disney and Warner Bros have chosen to maintain a dual release strategy for their major films, angering actors and cinema chains alike.

"Link FM's licensee, the Pakistan Muslim Centre, has ""apologised wholeheartedly"" for broadcasting the chant A community radio station faces sanctions after broadcasting an Islamic chant said to contain ""Jihadi lyrics"" and ""promoting terrorism"". Sheffield-based Link FM was found to have committed two serious breaches of Ofcom's broadcasting code by playing the ""Nasheed"" chant twice in 2020. The chant contained material likely to ""encourage or incite the commission of crime or lead to disorder"", Ofcom said. Licensee the Pakistan Muslim Centre said it ""apologised wholeheartedly"". More news from across Yorkshire Ina report,external, Ofcom, the broadcasting watchdog, said Link FM had broadcast a chant called ""Jundallah"" or ""Soldiers of Allah"". It said: ""Although this Nasheed didn't contain any direct call to violent action, we consider cumulative effect of lyrics and imagery was to condone, promote and actively encourage others to participate in violent acts as a form of devout religious expression and therefore amounted to an indirect call to action."" It added that the lyrics ""sought to condone, promote and encourage violent Jihad as a legitimate expression of Islamic faith and glorify an ideology associated with Jihad, including martyrdom"" and that such Nasheed chants ""are used by terrorist groups to attract potential recruits"". The Ofcom report said the Pakistan Muslim Centre had apologised for what it described as an ""error"" and an ""unfortunate incident"". It said the presenter who broadcast the chant did not speak Arabic and the piece had not been vetted. In a letter to Ofcom, the presenter apologised and said she felt ""quite embarrassed"" and had ""no intentions of inciting hatred or negativity of any shape or form"". Concluding that Link FM was in breach of the broadcasting code, Ofcom said it was ""minded to consider these breaches for the imposition of a statutory sanction"". Link FM is the second Sheffield-based community radio station to be found in breach of Ofcom's code in recent years. In 2017,Imam FM was taken off air after it broadcast 25 hours of lectures by Anwar Al-Awlaki, a US-born radical Muslin cleric, killed in a US drone strike in Yemen in 2011.

"This video can not be played Lionel Messi: Ten great goals for Barcelona Lionel Messi has agreed a two-year deal to join Paris St-Germain following his shock exit from Barcelona, says BBC Sport columnist Guillem Balague. The deal, which has the option of a third year, is subject to a medical. The Argentina captain, 34, left Barca - the only club he has played for - as they could not afford a new deal under La Liga's financial fair play rules. A PSG news conference will take place in the auditorium of the Parc des Princes on Wednesday at 10:00 BST. Mauricio Pochettino's PSG finished second to Lille in Ligue 1 last season. 'Messi feels betrayed by Barcelona' - the inside track on his Nou Camp exit ""It's all been confirmed. Lionel Messi is going to be a PSG player,"" Balague said on BBC Radio 5 Live. ""That's it, it's done. It's happened in the last few minutes. ""At the moment there are as much police as there are fans [at the stadium]. That's going to change soon. There's eight cameras here, again that's going to change. It seems like it is a two-year deal, plus one. ""His idea was to do it at Barcelona but it's going to be PSG. Then if he feels OK he will stay one more year maybe. But in any case his aim is to be at PSG and then to do well in the Qatar World Cup."" Messi and his family were pictured at Barcelona's El Prat airport on Tuesday afternoon after news of the deal emerged. When asked by reporters whether his son would be joining PSG, Jorge Messi answered ""yes"". Messi was pictured at El Prat airport on Tuesday afternoon after news of the deal with PSG emerged Messi's wife Antonela Roccuzzo posted this picture on Instagram on Tuesday with a caption talking of a ""new adventure together"" PSG's Neymar posted this image on Instagram with the caption 'Back Together'. The Brazilian played alongside Messi from 2013-2017 before his Â£200m move to France Pictures of Lionel Messi are being taken down at the Nou Camp Considered one of the greatest players of all time, Messi scored a record 672 goals in 778 games for Barca, the club he joined as a 13-year-old. He won the Ballon d'Or a record six times and lifted 35 trophies with the Catalan club. The signing of Messi - who would be reunited with former Barca team-mate Neymar at the Parc des Princes - is one of the most noteworthy captures in football's history. He will play in a front three alongside the two most expensive players of all time - Neymar and Kylian Mbappe. Where will Messi, Neymar, Mbappe rank in the great forward lines? Unless there are any late hitches, he will become PSG's fourth free-transfer signing this summer after the arrivals of Netherlands midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum, Spain defender Sergio Ramos and Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma. Highly-rated Morocco right-back Achraf Hakimi also joined from Inter Milan. PSG are yet to win the Champions League in a decade of Qatari ownership and subsequent heavy investment, with the 2020 final defeat against Bayern Munich the closest they have come. Balague said: ""Clearly what PSG's ownership want is a team that is in the Champions League final every year. ""With Messi you have an advantage. Pochettino being in charge and his contract being renewed as well means they have an idea how to do that and Messi will complement that. ""They will win the league, that's almost a given now, even though they lost last season. It will be a less competitive league which means he will be fresh of course, or should be, for the Champions League campaign."" Messi had agreed a new deal - on 50% of his old wages - to stay at Barcelona but the club could not afford to implement it because they were so far above the wage limit allowed by La Liga. ""He used to earn 140m euros gross a year at Barca, that's around Â£125m,"" said Balague. ""Take off about 40-50% for tax. ""He agreed to stay at Barcelona by reducing his wages by 50%, not more than that because that's illegal [under Spanish law]. Basically the league wouldn't believe he was reducing his wages to zero, which is what Barcelona may have tried to do as they are 1bn euros in debt. Basically they cannot afford him."" If the deal goes through quickly, he could make his PSG debut at home to Strasbourg on Saturday. Instatraders:Is foreign exchange trading as easy as social media claims it to be?

"Students in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are receiving their A-level results The number of As and A*s awarded have increased to 44.8% from 38.5% last year Because of the pandemic grades have been determined by teachers' estimates, rather than exams Scottish Highers, National 5s and Advanced Highers results are also being confirmed Students in Scotland received grades decided by their teachers after provisional grades were awarded in June Hundreds of thousands of students who studied for BTecs - practical qualifications aimed at specific jobs - are also getting their results They have also received teacher-assessed grades - although some practical assessments were carried out under social-distancing guidelines The A-level results follow last year's chaos when grades were initially calculated based on an algorithm This meant teachers estimates were used in most cases in 2020 The head of exams watchdog Ofqual says teacher assessments give a ""more accurate reflection"" of what students can achieve Edited by Emma Harrison and Rob Corp We're now closing our live page. Thank you for reading, sharing your exam result stories and putting questions to our experts. There will be more coverage on Thursday, when pupils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland receive their GCSE results - which have also been graded using teachers' estimates, looking at various pieces of work and mock exams over the past year. The live page writers today were Mary O'Connor, Alex Therrien and Eleanor Lawrie. The editors were Emma Harrison and Robert Corp. We'll soon be closing our A-level and BTec results live page. But before we do, here is a round-up of the main developments from today. This video can not be played 'I'm worried about starting university without any experience of exams' There are a unique set of school pupils who will be entering
universities this year without ever having sat an official final exam. Both Nicola and Mauvi in their fourth year of high school in
Scotland decided to study two-year highers. This meant they did not sit National 5 exams and then, due
to exams being cancelled because of coronavirus, were not able to sit official
final exams in 5th or 6th year. They are both starting university and are worried about the
academic year to come. They are concerned their lack of official exam
experience will make starting university even more daunting. Dr Edward Sosu, an education expert based at the University
of Strathclyde, says universities were aware that students starting with them
this year were in an unusual position. As we've been reporting, top grades for A-level results for England, Wales and Northern Ireland have reached a record high - with 44.8% getting A* or A grades. But how do the results compare by region? Here are the percentage of A-level entries awarded the top grades by nation and region: North-east England 39.2% (up from 35.6% in 2020) North-west England 41.4% (35.8%) Yorkshire & the Humber 41.1% (35.0%) West Midlands 40.9% (35.0%) East Midlands 41.3% (34.5%) Eastern England 44.8% (38.3%) South-west England 44.7% (38.8%) South-east England 47.1% (41.2%) London 47.9% (40.7%) England 44.3% (up from 38.1%) Wales 48.3% (41.8%) Northern Ireland 50.8% (43.3%) All 44.8% (up from 38.5%)  What happens to students who are taking subjects that include coursework? - Ali Hamza Rasheed, Manchester Joanne Elliott from the National Careers Service says: Teachers and tutors have taken an evidence-based approach this year. They have based grades on students' performance, using evidence such as coursework and other assessments done in class. Students have only been assessed on content that they have been taught. So if you missed something because you had to isolate you will not be graded on that work. Catherine Sezen from the Association of Colleges says: Vocational technical qualifications such as BTec or OCR Technical include a mixture of coursework and exams. They also had adaptations this year, including teacher-assessed grades. The results for these qualifications at Level 3 (the same level as A-level) have been announced today. The Level 2s will be announced on Thursday alongside GCSEs. Results for other practical qualifications will come throughout the summer. Read more answers to A-level queries, and submit your own question Ellie Curran and mum Margie Hundreds
of thousands of students have been getting their BTec and A-level results today, including Ellie Curran, aged 19. She is celebrating after achieving A* in
sociology and a B in business at A-level and a distinction in BTec law, meaning
she can go to Liverpool Hope University and study criminology. Ellie, who has cerebral palsy and
uses a wheelchair, says she is ""in shock"" at the results and working
from home during the pandemic has been ""dead hard"". She received her results at Archbishop Blanch School in Liverpool. Her mother Margie says: ""She's very
dedicated, in lockdown she would be up at 8am at her desk. ""She's always been dedicated, I
think she just wants to prove everyone wrong and show she can do it."" BTecs are practical qualifications aimed at specific job or career sectors such as engineering, hospitality and childcare. Like A-levels, results have been based on teacher assessments this year. Find out moreabout how they've been graded - and what to do if you're unhappy with your results.

BBC Scotland has spoken to a number of pupils at Portlethan Academy in Aberdeenshire who shared their results and views on the grading process. Abbie Collett says she would welcome a return to the normal exams system S5 pupil Abbie Collett says she is ""very happy"" with her A, B and two Cs as well as a pass in a foundation apprenticeship, and hopes to study primary education after sixth year. But prior to the cancellation of exams, she found it ""difficult"" not knowing how her work would be assessed. ""I thought I might have done worse due to everything going on, but I was happy with my grades that I needed and the teachers were a big help this year with pushing you with what you wanted to do."" Nevertheless, Abbie says she would welcome a return to the normal exam system. Ross Greenlees hopes to pursue a career in catering Ross Greenlees feels the initial uncertainty around the exams process made it ""difficult to prepare"", but thinks the eventual assessment of his work is ""fair"". He got two As at Nat 5 level, a C and a pass in an apprenticeship in food and drink technology. ""It was pretty good considering the circumstances,"" he says. ""We sort of knew our grades before today but getting the confirmation those were the final grades was a good feeling."" Ross hopes to go to college for a cooking course and pursue a career in catering - but first comes S6. Alice EvansNewsbeat Matt Calloway says university will feel like an extended holiday after the year heâs had trying to study at home. Like every other student across the UK, the 18-year-oldâs studies were interrupted by Covid â but he had to fit his learning around eight other siblings at home in Bristol. âIt made it a lot more difficult,â he tells BBC Radio 1 Newsbeat. âTrying to do online learning with them was never going to happen.â As the second eldest, he also had to help out his younger siblings with their school work. âI didnât realise how hard primary school work is,â he says. After juggling all of that, Matt âsurprised myselfâ by meeting the conditions of his offer. He picked up a double merit in construction and an A-level in photography, so is going to Middlesex University to study criminology and psychology.  I'm doing my exams next year and I'm very worried.I know some students wait a year to apply, so I'll be competing for university places against students with grades from 2021. Will universities be making allowances for my year? - Harry, Yorkshire Courteney Sheppard from Ucas says: Each year, the universities will consider the current cohort of students with their grades on merit based on that year. Make sure to look at the entry requirements of the courses that you are interested in, and do your best to get the grades that the universities are asking for. I would suggest that you consider courses with differing entry requirements for your Ucas application. Some of these choices could be aspirational. Others could be ""safe"" if you think you will definitely meet the requirements, including achievable grades.

Eighteen-year-old Nyat Aron-Yohannes, from Purfleet, Essex, got three A*s and is going to Oxford to study philosophy, politics and economics. Reflecting on the work she put in to get the results, she says: ""The struggle was real."" She adds: ""We woke up early to come into school and sometimes it did not even seem like it was worth it at those times when the grades were not matching up to your work ethic. ""Then lockdown happened and you had to persevere on your own because you did not have your classmates or teachers physically nearby to push you. You had to find strength somewhere else. ""I am just grateful it paid off, we were walking in faith."" Ade Olugboji, 18, also from Purfleet, got four A*s and is going to study maths and philosophy at Oxford. He says: ""Brampton has a philosophy of hard work. ""I started at 6am and left at 6pm. ""I knew there was going to be work but I did not understand the level until I got here. ""The thing is once I saw everyone else working so hard and so well, it did not seem that it (success) was impossible."" In all, 350 students took their A-levels at the school this year with 330 getting into Russell Group universities, including the 55 who got into Oxbridge. Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent It won't just be teenagers with great A-level grades jumping in the air in celebration. Away from the photographers, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, the exam boards and watchdogs might be tempted to have a quiet results' day leap of their own. Because after thechaotic U-turns of last year's exams, this year has been a much smoother run. It might be because results are way above anything ever seen before, thus fewer reasons to complain. Last year, the algorithm process saw about 40% of teacher assessed grades being downgraded, this time exam boards only intervened to change 1% of grades. As exam officials said in a briefing, these results reflect an ideal world where no one had a bad day in an exam hall and everyone had multiple chances to do well. But there will be consequences for those chasing university places - with warnings of a crush for top places in a year when more people than ever have applied. Once today's celebrations have finished, there will nervous glances ahead to next year. Because having allowed results to rise like a kite, at what point and how do you pull them down again?

Student Amina Lounici, 18 (centre), celebrates with her friend at Brampton Manor Academy in London Pupils at an inner city state school are celebrating after 55 teenagers got the A-level grades needed for them to study at Oxbridge, which is more than the offers made to Eton College students. The majority of pupils at Brampton Manor Academy in Newham, east London, are from ethnic minority backgrounds, in receipt of free school meals, or will be the first in their family to attend university. Sam Dobin, Brampton's sixth form director, says he is ""delighted"" that 55 of its students are now set to study at Oxford or Cambridge University this year, which is more than leading independent schools. At Eton, where Prime Minister Boris Johnson studied, 48 pupils secured Oxbridge offers, a fall from 69 last year. When Marty
Hardy moved with her family to the UK from Italy in 2012, she says she did not know a word of English. She tells the BBC: ""I went to school from Year 5 and I was assigned a teaching assistant for extra English lessons. ""I used to carry around a dictionary at school so that I could understand what my friends were saying to me."" But nine years later, Marty, 18, has secured 2A*s and an A at A-level and is off to read psychology and linguistics at the University of Oxford. Marty, who took her A-levels at Twynham Sixth Form in Bournemouth, says: ""I
never thought of going to Oxford University before, but in Year 12 I was
getting high grades and my teachers asked me about options."" She says she also has a TEFL qualification and hopes to become an English teacher in the future. Labour's shadow education secretary Kate Green has been speaking to the BBC after top grades for A-level results for England, Wales and Northern Ireland hit a record high. She says we should ""recognise and congratulate"" students on their results after a year of disruption to their education and paid tribute to teachers and staff in universities and colleges for working to ensure young people got fair grades. However, Green says she is ""concerned"" about the ""inequities"" between regions and the different education sectors in the results. For example, inLondon, 47.9% were A* and A grades, while in the north-east of England, it was 39.2%. She adds: ""I think there are real inequities to be concerned about in these results and that was to a degree inevitable because the government left it to schools to decide how they would carry out assessments and we know that means students haven't been assessed identically in every school, in every part of the country."" Green adds there are ""real lessons"" to be learned about what extra help and protections are needed ""to compensate for some of these inequities that we've got in the results"". Green insists the ""focus"" should now be on next steps if students haven't got the grades they feel they should have, with an appeals process that works ""swiftly and smoothly"" to help them - especially those whose university places depend on it, while also protecting those from less privileged backgrounds. As the government hopes for a return to exams next year, Green urges ministers to give schools the plans for this now so they can prepare students properly for what the assessment process is going to be like. BBC Newsbeat When the UK went into lockdown in January this year, Jack
was tempted to give up on his exams. He's just collected the results for his Scottish National 5 exams  - the equivalent to GCSEs in other parts of the UK. ""When we first got told we were doing online
learning, I was thinking to myself, at my lowest point: 'Let's just bin off the
5s, I'm not going to get what I want,"" he tells Newsbeat. Jack, 15, who attends Braidhurst High School in Motherwell, got three As and two Bs, despite struggling
with remote learning. He says he's ""really happy"" with how things
turned out. Katie, 16, who goes to the same school, got seven As in her National 5s, and says it
was ""hard"" getting there, but felt she ""had to go on with it
because everyone was in the same position"". She found that playing with her football team helped take
her mind of the exam stress. ""I know that it was important to take a break and go
to training, so I could get my mind off things and enjoy myself,"" she
tells Newsbeat. ""I know it was important to do both.â Hywel GriffithBBC News' Wales Correspondent Leah Morgan: ""We've had a lot of uncertainty"" Leah Morgan is off to study nuclear medicine at Swansea University, thanks to her four A*s in mathematics, biology, chemistry and physics. ""We've experienced
things that other years haven't,"" she says. ""We've had a lot of uncertainty, and at the end
of the day, our results came from tests that were done under exam conditions."" Leah, an A-level student at Coleg y Cymoedd Nantgarw campus in South Wales, says her year group's results are ""very valid"". ""My uni has taken them [my grades] into account and they're happy with them. ""And you know as
soon as uni is done that's your next grade. That's what jobs will be looking at
so these (A-Level results) wonât matter in a couple of years' time."" Students are being offered incentives to defer their place at the University of Exeter's medical school Aspiring student medics are to be offered Â£10,000 if they need to move medical schools due to capacity limits. The Medical Schools Council (MSC), which
represents 44 heads of UK medical schools, has started a
""brokerage programme"" after more university applicants met the terms of their offers than expected. The scheme for oversubscribed
schools means that students who are required to move medical schools will receive Â£10,000 ""for the inconvenience"". The method for distributing this funding
will be confirmed ""in due course"", according to the MSC. Last week, the Department for Education (DfE)
announced extra funding would be given to England's medicine and dentistry schools to expand this year's courses. Ucas figures released on Tuesday show 8,560 students from England
have been accepted on to medicine and dentistry courses, up 23% from 6,960 on
last year's results day. The government limits the number of places on medicine and dentistry courses in England. But the DfE has announced the cap will be adjusted to allow for more than 9,000 places on
medical and dentistry courses for 2021. The MSC says a ""limiting factor"" to the expansion of medical school places is the availability of clinical placements for students during their years on the course. Recently, the University of Exeter wrote to students who had applied to study medicine with an offer offree accommodation and Â£10,000 cash if they are prepared to delay their course for a year. Hywel GriffithBBC News' Wales Correspondent Back at Coleg y Cymoedd in Nantgarw, Dylan Coundley-Hughes is off to the University of Southampton to study biology. He is a bit concerned employers might think this year's students had an easier time than the year groups before and after them. ""It is a worry because I can see people may be like âoh you were from this yearâ.. we might not get employed compared to someone else,"" he says. ""But we can't do anything about it, so we need to just get on with it."" Dylan received an A* in biology, and As in maths and geography. The chief regulator of England's exams watchdog Ofqual has defended the approach to awarding this year's A-level grades. Simon Lebus told Radio 4's The World at One ""teachers were in the best position to make those judgements"". Holding nationally standardised exams would simply not have been practical, he said. ""If one thinks about it, at the beginning of June I think there were about a quarter of a million students in isolation because of problems with Covid, that had gone up to three quarters of a million by the end of June so it would have been complete mayhem if we'd been conducting exams in the normal way."" Lebus also rejected the notion that there has been grade inflation, suggesting it was not comparing like with like. But he said there does need to be a discussion about returning to something like the distribution of grades seen in the past, noting that ""there's clearly got to be a managed progression back to the old normal... I think there's a big debate to be had about how quickly that happens."" He added that the discrepancy between state and private school results was also consistent with the attainment gap already evident. In independent schools 70.1% of pupils achieved A* and A grades, while this was 39% at comprehensive schools.  Â© 2025 BBC.

Thank you for reading, sharing your exam result stories and putting questions to our experts. There will be more coverage on Thursday, when pupils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland receive their GCSE results - which have also been graded using teachers' estimates, looking at various pieces of work and mock exams over the past year. The live page writers today were Mary O'Connor, Alex Therrien and Eleanor Lawrie. The editors were Emma Harrison and Robert Corp. We'll soon be closing our A-level and BTec results live page. But before we do, here is a round-up of the main developments from today. This video can not be played 'I'm worried about starting university without any experience of exams' There are a unique set of school pupils who will be entering
universities this year without ever having sat an official final exam. Both Nicola and Mauvi in their fourth year of high school in
Scotland decided to study two-year highers. This meant they did not sit National 5 exams and then, due
to exams being cancelled because of coronavirus, were not able to sit official
final exams in 5th or 6th year. They are both starting university and are worried about the
academic year to come. They are concerned their lack of official exam
experience will make starting university even more daunting. Dr Edward Sosu, an education expert based at the University
of Strathclyde, says universities were aware that students starting with them
this year were in an unusual position. As we've been reporting, top grades for A-level results for England, Wales and Northern Ireland have reached a record high - with 44.8% getting A* or A grades. But how do the results compare by region? Here are the percentage of A-level entries awarded the top grades by nation and region: North-east England 39.2% (up from 35.6% in 2020) North-west England 41.4% (35.8%) Yorkshire & the Humber 41.1% (35.0%) West Midlands 40.9% (35.0%) East Midlands 41.3% (34.5%) Eastern England 44.8% (38.3%) South-west England 44.7% (38.8%) South-east England 47.1% (41.2%) London 47.9% (40.7%) England 44.3% (up from 38.1%) Wales 48.3% (41.8%) Northern Ireland 50.8% (43.3%) All 44.8% (up from 38.5%)  What happens to students who are taking subjects that include coursework? - Ali Hamza Rasheed, Manchester Joanne Elliott from the National Careers Service says: Teachers and tutors have taken an evidence-based approach this year. They have based grades on students' performance, using evidence such as coursework and other assessments done in class. Students have only been assessed on content that they have been taught. So if you missed something because you had to isolate you will not be graded on that work. Catherine Sezen from the Association of Colleges says: Vocational technical qualifications such as BTec or OCR Technical include a mixture of coursework and exams. They also had adaptations this year, including teacher-assessed grades. The results for these qualifications at Level 3 (the same level as A-level) have been announced today. The Level 2s will be announced on Thursday alongside GCSEs. Results for other practical qualifications will come throughout the summer.

of thousands of students have been getting their BTec and A-level results today, including Ellie Curran, aged 19. She is celebrating after achieving A* in
sociology and a B in business at A-level and a distinction in BTec law, meaning
she can go to Liverpool Hope University and study criminology. Ellie, who has cerebral palsy and
uses a wheelchair, says she is ""in shock"" at the results and working
from home during the pandemic has been ""dead hard"". She received her results at Archbishop Blanch School in Liverpool. Her mother Margie says: ""She's very
dedicated, in lockdown she would be up at 8am at her desk. ""She's always been dedicated, I
think she just wants to prove everyone wrong and show she can do it."" BTecs are practical qualifications aimed at specific job or career sectors such as engineering, hospitality and childcare. Like A-levels, results have been based on teacher assessments this year. Find out moreabout how they've been graded - and what to do if you're unhappy with your results.

But he said there does need to be a discussion about returning to something like the distribution of grades seen in the past, noting that ""there's clearly got to be a managed progression back to the old normal... I think there's a big debate to be had about how quickly that happens."" He added that the discrepancy between state and private school results was also consistent with the attainment gap already evident. In independent schools 70.1% of pupils achieved A* and A grades, while this was 39% at comprehensive schools.  Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Lionel Messi: Ten great goals for Barcelona Lionel Messi has agreed a two-year deal to join Paris St-Germain following his shock exit from Barcelona, says BBC Sport columnist Guillem Balague. The deal, which has the option of a third year, is subject to a medical. The Argentina captain, 34, left Barca - the only club he has played for - as they could not afford a new deal under La Liga's financial fair play rules. A PSG news conference will take place in the auditorium of the Parc des Princes on Wednesday at 10:00 BST. Mauricio Pochettino's PSG finished second to Lille in Ligue 1 last season. 'Messi feels betrayed by Barcelona' - the inside track on his Nou Camp exit ""It's all been confirmed. Lionel Messi is going to be a PSG player,"" Balague said on BBC Radio 5 Live. ""That's it, it's done. It's happened in the last few minutes. ""At the moment there are as much police as there are fans [at the stadium]. That's going to change soon. There's eight cameras here, again that's going to change. It seems like it is a two-year deal, plus one. ""His idea was to do it at Barcelona but it's going to be PSG. Then if he feels OK he will stay one more year maybe. But in any case his aim is to be at PSG and then to do well in the Qatar World Cup."" Messi and his family were pictured at Barcelona's El Prat airport on Tuesday afternoon after news of the deal emerged. When asked by reporters whether his son would be joining PSG, Jorge Messi answered ""yes"". Messi was pictured at El Prat airport on Tuesday afternoon after news of the deal with PSG emerged Messi's wife Antonela Roccuzzo posted this picture on Instagram on Tuesday with a caption talking of a ""new adventure together"" PSG's Neymar posted this image on Instagram with the caption 'Back Together'. The Brazilian played alongside Messi from 2013-2017 before his Â£200m move to France Pictures of Lionel Messi are being taken down at the Nou Camp Considered one of the greatest players of all time, Messi scored a record 672 goals in 778 games for Barca, the club he joined as a 13-year-old. He won the Ballon d'Or a record six times and lifted 35 trophies with the Catalan club. The signing of Messi - who would be reunited with former Barca team-mate Neymar at the Parc des Princes - is one of the most noteworthy captures in football's history. He will play in a front three alongside the two most expensive players of all time - Neymar and Kylian Mbappe. Where will Messi, Neymar, Mbappe rank in the great forward lines? Unless there are any late hitches, he will become PSG's fourth free-transfer signing this summer after the arrivals of Netherlands midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum, Spain defender Sergio Ramos and Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma. Highly-rated Morocco right-back Achraf Hakimi also joined from Inter Milan. PSG are yet to win the Champions League in a decade of Qatari ownership and subsequent heavy investment, with the 2020 final defeat against Bayern Munich the closest they have come. Balague said: ""Clearly what PSG's ownership want is a team that is in the Champions League final every year. ""With Messi you have an advantage. Pochettino being in charge and his contract being renewed as well means they have an idea how to do that and Messi will complement that. ""They will win the league, that's almost a given now, even though they lost last season. It will be a less competitive league which means he will be fresh of course, or should be, for the Champions League campaign."" Messi had agreed a new deal - on 50% of his old wages - to stay at Barcelona but the club could not afford to implement it because they were so far above the wage limit allowed by La Liga. ""He used to earn 140m euros gross a year at Barca, that's around Â£125m,"" said Balague. ""Take off about 40-50% for tax. ""He agreed to stay at Barcelona by reducing his wages by 50%, not more than that because that's illegal [under Spanish law]. Basically the league wouldn't believe he was reducing his wages to zero, which is what Barcelona may have tried to do as they are 1bn euros in debt. Basically they cannot afford him."" If the deal goes through quickly, he could make his PSG debut at home to Strasbourg on Saturday. Instatraders:Is foreign exchange trading as easy as social media claims it to be?

"Top A-level grades have risen for students across England, Wales and Northern Ireland for the first time since 2021. Overall this year 28% of all grades were A* or A - up from 27.2% in 2023. However the figures vary between the three nations, rising in England but falling in Wales and Northern Ireland. Here is what you need to know about everything from grade boundaries to clearing. You can normally pick up AS and A-level results in person anytime from 08:00 BST. However, some students receive their results via email. Check with your school or college about the arrangements in place for you. How much does uni cost and does it boost earnings? Everything you need to know about student loans Surprised by your results? Our interactive guide on what to do next Each exam is graded on a scale from A* to E. Grade boundaries show the minimum number of marks you need for each grade. They are decided by examiners and published on results day. Qualifications Wales, which oversees Welsh exams, had been prepared to use statistics to set the grade boundaries to prevent marks dropping significantly below 2019 levels, because of a concern that performance in some subjects had still not recovered fully since the pandemic. That back-up plan was not needed. In England and Northern Ireland the way boundaries are decided has returned to normal. Ucas is a charity which runs a clearing process,externalmatching students with university and college courses which still have spaces. Students can use it if they: fail to achieve the grades for their conditional offer fail to receive any offers they want to accept decide after 30 June to apply for university achieve better grades than expected and want to change universities Clearing is now open and closes on 21 October. Universities make an offer to a student to join a course based on qualifications and grades or theUcas tariff points system,external. Each A-level grade is worth a certain number of Ucas points. For example, an A* is worth 56 points and a D is worth 24 points. Many students decide not to go to university and start an apprenticeship or go straight into work. Others take agap year,externalso they have more time to decide what to do next. What are apprenticeships and how do I choose a good one? If you do not think your grade is right, you should talk to your school or college. It will contact the exam board on your behalf and ask for your marks to be reviewed. If you still think you have been unfairly graded after a review,you can ask your school or college to appeal,external. The exam board will consider whether a correction is needed. If you are still not satisfied, you can request a review from the exams regulator Ofqual. The charity YoungMinds points out thatexam results are not the only measure of success,external- and if things do not turn out how you had hoped, there are lots of ways to get where you want to. If you only just miss out on the grades you need to get on to a university or college course, the admissions office might accept you anyway or offer you a place on a different course. You could also try clearing. It may also be possible to resit some or all of your exams. Talk to your school or college if you want to explore this route. Resits will take place in May or June 2025.

"Students protested about the Welsh Government's grading system last year Everyone will be hoping for an altogether more low-key results day in Wales on Tuesday. Last year the uproar around downgraded A-level marks led to a dramatic U-turn by ministers. This summer there is no algorithm to ""standardise"" teacher grades and, crucially, the vast majority of Welsh pupils already know their results ahead of the official release. So how isA-level results dayin Wales going to be different in 2021? For a start, it is earlier than usual. Usually, A-level and GCSE results days are on subsequent Thursdays in the second half of August. However they have been brought forward to ensure enough time to process any appeals. Students collect their grades at Ysgol Bro Myrddin in Carmarthen In Wales, schools and collegesshared provisional results with pupils in Juneand they could then appeal. On results day, some schools are simply confirming grades via email or post, while others, such as Olchfa Comprehensive in Swansea, are inviting pupils to celebrate their results becoming official. The school's deputy head teacher Matt Salmon said it was a ""rite of passage"", even if pupils know what is inside the envelope. ""Whether there'll be the same level of excitement and celebration or, conversely, disappointment in some cases remains to be seen"", he said. Exam results system is fair for pupils - watchdog Uni clearing may be 'much more competitive' - Ucas Exams 2021 - It's been a rollercoaster for students Public inquiry call over exam results 'blunders' But while surprises are unlikely, it remains a significant day for those hoping to go to university with places only confirmed after the official release of results. And if you didn't quite get the grades you need, it's only now you find out whether there's any wriggle room or other options through clearing. Provisional results ""took away the stress"", said A-level student Shenona Mitra Shenona Mitra, 18, from Bangor hopes to study medicine in London and said having provisional results earlier gave students a sense of security. ""It took a little of the stress away from teachers and students because of how unpredictable things have been,"" she said. ""We needed that time to make sure things were ok and we could still go to university. If things needed to be changed, they could be within time."" Schools and colleges set them - or to use the official term, they areCentre Determined Grades(CDGs). The decision to cancel exams was made last November, but the system that replaced it had to be ditched too when schools remained closed after Christmas. At that stage it was decided thatteachers would decide students' end-of-year gradesbased on evidence of attainment. In practice that meant pupils sat a series of classroom assessments when they were back in school after Easter, though some claimed they were exams in all but name. Gareth Evans, executive director of education at the University of Wales Trinity St David, said some pupils ended up sitting 30 or 40 tests. ""That is not ideal after three or four months out of face-to-face teaching due to a pandemic,"" he said. ""Perhaps we could have considered a little better the well-being and learning loss of those pupils rather than the race to examine them for their GCSE and A-level outcomes."" Cai Parry wants more focus on coursework than exams Cardiff A-level pupil Cai Parry, 18, was part of a campaign last year calling for grades determined by teachers, rather than exams. He thinks there should be long-term changes to assessment, with more emphasis on coursework. ""That's a fairer reflection of how students are coping throughout the year, whereas if we pile everything on to just exams at the endâ¦ that has been a lot more stressful,"" he said. No. Last year an algorithm to standardise results was blamed for lowering tens of thousands of the grades that had been assessed by teachers, and for the uproar that ensued. A U-turn before GCSE results day meant pupils were eventually awarded the teacher grades and similar decisions were made elsewhere in the UK too. Trying to avoid a repeat of last year's chaos has been a top priority. This year, the exam board WJEC has had no power to change grades, though schools and colleges have been asked to explain results that are significantly out of line with previous years. Something similar but with some key differences. Pupils in England weren't given provisional grades. That means those who've been studying over the border, or who have taken qualifications in Wales under English exam boards, will be feeling the nerves more than most Welsh pupils. It's the first time results day is happening at the same time across the UK, as they're usually earlier in Scotland. Results for BTEC and other vocational qualifications will also be released. As they are regulated at a UK-wide level, BTEC students will not have had prior sight of their final grades. Some students will not even go to their school on results day There were 36,140 A-level entries for summer 2021, a rise of 16% compared with 2020. This could partly be due to a bigger teenage population, while a rise in top grades at AS-level last summer might have encouraged more students to continue to A-level. Mr Evans said there were too many variables to compare results. ""We're going to have to live with the fact that we can't compare year-on-year and this year's cohort of A-level and GCSE graduates have been through something nobody else has been through and, therefore, the results are not comparable,"" he said. That said,nearly half of this year's A-level grades were top A* and A grades in Wales, the official results showed on Tuesday. A total of 48.3% of grades were A* and A after what exam awarders called ""challenging circumstances"" due to Covid-19. There was an increase at A* with 21.3% of candidates getting this grade, compared with 16.3% in 2020. Altogether, 99.1% achieved A* to E passes.

"Flutter's Paddy Power betting shops were closed during the Covid lockdowns Paddy Power-owner Flutter has said its UK betting shop revenue has jumped higher than pre-Covid levels. Betting shops were closed during lockdowns but since reopening in June, Flutter said UK retail revenue rose 7% ahead of sales before the pandemic. Like its rivals, Flutter has seen strong growth in online gambling as shops closed and people were forced to work from home. But one gambling helpline said calls had risen by 9% in the year to March. And punters came back to betting shops after they re-opened as Covid restrictions eased in the second quarter, with UK retail revenue 7% higher than pre-Covid levels, it said. The number of people using Flutter's online gambling in the UK leapt even more, increasing nearly 60%. A UK gambling helpline said calls had increased by 9% in the year to the end of March. Flutter said global revenue rose 28% to Â£3bn as its average number of gamblers rose 40% to more than 7.5 million. Chief executive Peter Jackson said: ""The first half of 2021 exceeded our expectations as we made substantial progress against our operational and strategic objectives while maintaining excellent momentum in growing our player base."" Online gambling: 'I stole Â£70,000 to feed my addiction' Many countries around the world closed down betting shops during coronavirus lockdowns, and gamblers shifted their focus online. Flutter attracted new customers during lockdowns, and kept hold of many of them in the first half, said Alistair Johnson, analyst at Redburn. Studies have suggested that online gambling soared during coronavirus lockdowns, with vulnerable groups particularly at risk. In the UK, Flutter, which owns brands such as Betfair and Sky Betting and Gaming, said it had 59% more online customers than in the same period in 2019 before the coronavirus crisis. Overall, its UK and Ireland average monthly numbers grew 44% to 3.3 million customers. This outpaced revenue growth of 30% - so on average, revenue per active customer was lower, it said. Flutter has been pouring money into its US business, spending more than $1bn to date on marketing its flagship FanDuel sports betting brand. US revenues were more than $900m in the first half, putting distance between it and its main rivals, it said. The gambling giant competed its acquisition of Canadian gambling business the Stars Group on 5 May 2020. Freetrade analyst Gemma Boothroyd said the pandemic ""lent a helping hand to online betting, speeding up its transition to digital"". She said US revenue growth, which soared by 159% to Â£652m, was ""driven by six additional states legalising sports betting"". ""As vaccination ramps up and Flutter's main markets return to business-as-usual, it may be ill-prepared for lockdowns easing,"" Ms Boothroyd added. Last year a House of Lords report found that there were a third of a million problem gamblers in the UK, with young people being most at risk. The amount of harm was wider, though. For each problem gambler, six were harmed by their activities. So two million people were harmed by ""the breakup of families, crime, loss of employment, loss of homes and, ultimately, loss of life"", the report said. It found that 60% of gambling companies' profits come from the 5% of customers who are already problem gamblers, or who are at risk of becoming so. A study in May this year suggested that online gambling soared in 2020 in the UK, with regular gamblers more than six times more likely to gamble online. TheUniversity of Bristol study,externalsuggested that ""although many forms of gambling were restricted, a minority of regular gamblers significantly increased their gambling and betting online"" with vulnerable groups ""worse affected"". There was also a strong link between binge drinking and regular gambling, researchers said. GamCare,external, which operates theNational Gambling Helpline,external, said it had received 41,000 calls for help in the year to the end of March, a 9% increase on the previous year. It said there was a big increase in gambling due to boredom, but also more gamblers were using it as a coping strategy during the pandemic. Two thirds of the gamblers calling the helpline had debt issues, and three quarters had financial difficulties due to gambling. The most problematic online products were slots, betting, and casino games. Offline, betting in shops and gaming machines were problematic, gamblers said.

In the UK, Flutter, which owns brands such as Betfair and Sky Betting and Gaming, said it had 59% more online customers than in the same period in 2019 before the coronavirus crisis. Overall, its UK and Ireland average monthly numbers grew 44% to 3.3 million customers. This outpaced revenue growth of 30% - so on average, revenue per active customer was lower, it said. Flutter has been pouring money into its US business, spending more than $1bn to date on marketing its flagship FanDuel sports betting brand. US revenues were more than $900m in the first half, putting distance between it and its main rivals, it said. The gambling giant competed its acquisition of Canadian gambling business the Stars Group on 5 May 2020. Freetrade analyst Gemma Boothroyd said the pandemic ""lent a helping hand to online betting, speeding up its transition to digital"". She said US revenue growth, which soared by 159% to Â£652m, was ""driven by six additional states legalising sports betting"". ""As vaccination ramps up and Flutter's main markets return to business-as-usual, it may be ill-prepared for lockdowns easing,"" Ms Boothroyd added. Last year a House of Lords report found that there were a third of a million problem gamblers in the UK, with young people being most at risk. The amount of harm was wider, though. For each problem gambler, six were harmed by their activities. So two million people were harmed by ""the breakup of families, crime, loss of employment, loss of homes and, ultimately, loss of life"", the report said. It found that 60% of gambling companies' profits come from the 5% of customers who are already problem gamblers, or who are at risk of becoming so. A study in May this year suggested that online gambling soared in 2020 in the UK, with regular gamblers more than six times more likely to gamble online. TheUniversity of Bristol study,externalsuggested that ""although many forms of gambling were restricted, a minority of regular gamblers significantly increased their gambling and betting online"" with vulnerable groups ""worse affected"". There was also a strong link between binge drinking and regular gambling, researchers said. GamCare,external, which operates theNational Gambling Helpline,external, said it had received 41,000 calls for help in the year to the end of March, a 9% increase on the previous year. It said there was a big increase in gambling due to boredom, but also more gamblers were using it as a coping strategy during the pandemic. Two thirds of the gamblers calling the helpline had debt issues, and three quarters had financial difficulties due to gambling. The most problematic online products were slots, betting, and casino games. Offline, betting in shops and gaming machines were problematic, gamblers said. Flutter said that it was developing steps ""focused on protecting those that are vulnerable without unnecessarily impinging on the freedoms of the majority of customers"".

"Esther Dingley sent this selfie at the top of a mountain on 22 November The boyfriend of a British woman who went missing while hiking in the Pyrenees has found her body and belongings. Esther Dingley, from Durham, vanished on a solo trek in November sparking major searches by French and Spanish police and her partner Daniel Colegate. A fragment of bone found in July wasconfirmed to be the 37-year-old's. LBT Global, which is supporting the family, said an accident ""is the most likely hypothesis"". A spokesman for the overseas crisis support charity said Mr Colegate found his girlfriend's remains on Monday afternoon, close to where the bone fragment was discovered. Chris Bockman, a British journalist working in Toulouse, said French police searches had been hampered by a number of search and rescue operations and thunderstorms. He said according to the French judge leading the investigation, officers are beginning to collect forensic information at the ""difficult to reach site"" which will be DNA analysed, while a helicopter will be used ""if necessary"" to recover Ms Dingley's body. Daniel Colegate and Esther Dingley were on an open-ended campervan tour of Europe Since Ms Dingley vanished, her partner hadwalked hundreds of milesin the mountains on the French and Spanish border looking for signs of her. ""At this stage an accident is the most likely hypothesis, given the location and other early indications,"" LBT Global said. ""A full investigation is under way to confirm the details surrounding this tragedy. ""The family remain incredibly grateful for the efforts of the police units involved and their commitment to understanding the exact circumstances of Esther's death."" Ms Dingley, who was an experienced hiker, was trekking alone when shelast communicated with her partnerfrom the top of Pic De Sauvegarde at about 16:00 on 22 November. Mr Colegate, who was staying 100 miles away in a French farmhouse, raised the alarm several days later when she failed to report in at an agreed time. The couple wereon an open-ended campervan tour of Europeand Ms Dingley was on the final walk of a month-long solo expedition when she vanished. Esther Dingley was an experienced walker, her family said Police on both sides of the border used helicopters and specialist teams to search for her in the days between her disappearance and the arrival of the heavy winter snow. The failure to find any sign of her leftMr Colegate ""baffled""and led to fears she may have been kidnapped. Mr Colegate began his own searcheswhen the winter weather eased in Aprilfollowed a few weeks laterby the police. Dan and Esther had been together since meeting at university in 2003 The couple met in 2003 when they were both students at Oxford University and later moved to Durham. In 2014, after Mr Colegate nearly died following an operation, they decided to swap their lives running their own businesses and embark on a campervan tour of Europe involving lots of hiking and cycling. During their travels, they adopted a pregnant dog in Spain who gave birth to five puppies who joined them on their adventure.

"Top A-level grades have risen for students across England, Wales and Northern Ireland for the first time since 2021. Overall this year 28% of all grades were A* or A - up from 27.2% in 2023. However the figures vary between the three nations, rising in England but falling in Wales and Northern Ireland. Here is what you need to know about everything from grade boundaries to clearing. You can normally pick up AS and A-level results in person anytime from 08:00 BST. However, some students receive their results via email. Check with your school or college about the arrangements in place for you. How much does uni cost and does it boost earnings? Everything you need to know about student loans Surprised by your results? Our interactive guide on what to do next Each exam is graded on a scale from A* to E. Grade boundaries show the minimum number of marks you need for each grade. They are decided by examiners and published on results day. Qualifications Wales, which oversees Welsh exams, had been prepared to use statistics to set the grade boundaries to prevent marks dropping significantly below 2019 levels, because of a concern that performance in some subjects had still not recovered fully since the pandemic. That back-up plan was not needed. In England and Northern Ireland the way boundaries are decided has returned to normal. Ucas is a charity which runs a clearing process,externalmatching students with university and college courses which still have spaces. Students can use it if they: fail to achieve the grades for their conditional offer fail to receive any offers they want to accept decide after 30 June to apply for university achieve better grades than expected and want to change universities Clearing is now open and closes on 21 October. Universities make an offer to a student to join a course based on qualifications and grades or theUcas tariff points system,external. Each A-level grade is worth a certain number of Ucas points. For example, an A* is worth 56 points and a D is worth 24 points. Many students decide not to go to university and start an apprenticeship or go straight into work. Others take agap year,externalso they have more time to decide what to do next. What are apprenticeships and how do I choose a good one? If you do not think your grade is right, you should talk to your school or college. It will contact the exam board on your behalf and ask for your marks to be reviewed. If you still think you have been unfairly graded after a review,you can ask your school or college to appeal,external. The exam board will consider whether a correction is needed. If you are still not satisfied, you can request a review from the exams regulator Ofqual. The charity YoungMinds points out thatexam results are not the only measure of success,external- and if things do not turn out how you had hoped, there are lots of ways to get where you want to. If you only just miss out on the grades you need to get on to a university or college course, the admissions office might accept you anyway or offer you a place on a different course. You could also try clearing. It may also be possible to resit some or all of your exams. Talk to your school or college if you want to explore this route. Resits will take place in May or June 2025. Scotland has adifferent qualification system.,externalStudents take Highers, which are similar to A-levels. Results day in Scotland was on Tuesday 6 August.

"Former Prime Minister David Cameron personally promoted Greensill Capital to investors before the controversial company collapsed. BBC Panorama discovered Mr Cameron appeared with the company's founder, Lex Greensill, at an event hosted by the Swiss bank Credit Suisse in 2019. The collapse of Greensill in March has left the bank's clients facing billions of dollars in losses. Mr Cameron says there was no wrongdoing in any of the actions he took. Education secretary Gavin Williamson told BBC Radio Four's Today programme on Tuesday that Mr Cameron had been ""absolutely cleared"" of any wrongdoing by two independent investigations. He added he had made himself ""available to parliamentary scrutiny"", which was ""the right thing to do"". Mr Cameron worked for the company as a part-time adviser for two-and-a-half years after stepping down as prime minister. Panorama has also discovered documents indicatinghis role earned him about $10m before tax. Mr Cameron's spokesman has said his remuneration was a private matter. The June event Mr Cameron attended was called ""The Future of Supply Chain Finance"", and the audience were wealthy Credit Suisse clients. What's the David Cameron lobbying row about? David Cameron lacked judgement over Greensill, MPs' report says Ex-PM David Cameron cleared by lobbying watchdog Credit Suisse was marketing and selling Greensill investments at the time, and the bank told investors they were low risk. Investors thought their money was being loaned to companies that were awaiting payment for goods and services they had sold. The loans were supposed to be backed up by unpaid invoices, but earlier this year it was revealed that some of the invoices simply did not exist. US court papers show how between 2018 and 2021, Greensill lent $850m of investors' cash to a US coal company called Bluestone Resources. Only $70m of that money was secured against real invoices for coal that Bluestone had actually sold. Investors did not know it, but the remaining $780m was only backed by predicted coal sales that may or may not happen in the future. Lex Greensill told Panorama that this type of financing was commonplace in the financial services industry. He said the predicted Bluestone business was all ""based upon future trade that is likely to occur with current customers"". Panorama discovered that was not true. The programme obtained the names of the companies that Lex Greensill said were current customers of Bluestone. Six of the companies said they were not Bluestone customers and they weren't planning to buy its coal in the future. Lex Greensill later told Panorama the coal buyers did not have to be current customers. Bluestone only had to state it expected to make the sales at some future point and Greensill was not obliged to make checks, he said. Mr Greensill denied misleading investors. He said his company made all the appropriate disclosures to Credit Suisse and the Swiss Bank was ""solely responsible for making any disclosures to their investors"". He said the loans were always secured against assets and personal guarantees, and were backed up by insurance that would pay 100% of any shortfall. Credit Suisse says its focus is on returning cash to investors and that 59% has been returned so far. Mr Cameron's spokesman told Panorama he was neither a director of Greensill, nor involved in any lending decisions, and that he had no special insight into what ultimately happened. The spokesman said: ""It is also preposterous to suggest that he would work for any company if he was aware that it was behaving improperly, or was in any way seeking to mislead investors.""

"JetBlue has said the Covid pandemic will not stop the airline from launching its long-awaited New York to London service on Wednesday. Chief executive Robin Hayes told the BBC there was ""strong demand"" for the route in the US where, he said, JetBlue had returned to 2019 levels. The move comes as the global travel industry continues to recover. Holiday Inn-owner Intercontinental Hotels said holiday demand was ""returning strongly"". In its latest results statement, Intercontinental Hotels Group (IHG), whose other brands include the Crowne Plaza chain, said it had opened 132 hotels during the January-to-June period and acquired another 203, both sizeable increases on last year. ""Trading improved significantly during the first half of 2021, with travel demand returning strongly as vaccines roll out, restrictions ease and economic activity rebuilds,"" said IHG chief executive Keith Barr. ""It has been great to see our teams welcome more and more guests back into our hotels, with domestic leisure bookings leading the way, particularly in the US and China."" Measured on revenue per available room, nearly half of the group's hotels worldwide were above 2019 levels in July, it said. JetBlue's first transatlantic flight will leave New York's JFK airport on Wednesday evening and will land at London's Heathrow. Flights to London Gatwick will begin on 29 September. However, travelling on the route does not come cheap, at least to start with. JetBlue's website no longer has seats available for that inaugural flight, but prices for the next few days start at $941 (Â£679) one-way. That is still slightly cheaper than British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, which are both quoting a price of $980 for the same time period. Thanks to the likes of those established competitors, there are already as many as 28 flights a day available between London and New York. And other carriers have come a cropper on the same route, including Norwegian Air, which filed for bankruptcy in November 2020 after failing to make its low-cost strategy pay. However, JetBlue will be cutting costs by using smaller aircraft, relying on the single-aisle Airbus A321LR, rather than the Boeing 787 Dreamliners that were favoured by Norwegian. And for those who can book further in advance, it is pledging to offer return fares of less than $600. The airline's Mr Hayes said it had wanted to offer a New York-to-London service for a long time and flights were now ""ready to go"". He said JetBlue wanted to have ""a disruptive and permanent effect"" on the market. US-based travellers are now welcome tofly to the UK without having to quarantine on arrivalif they have been fully vaccinated, but there is still a travel ban on people from the UK flying to the US. The White House said at the end of last month thatit did not intend to lift Covid-19 travel restrictionsfor non-Americans. Asked about this, Mr Hayes said JetBlue had made its views clear about the restrictions and that the current approach was ""not risk-based"". Javid urges review of excessive Covid test costs How are travel rules being relaxed?

"This video can not be played Lionel Messi: Ten great goals for Barcelona Lionel Messi has agreed a two-year deal to join Paris St-Germain following his shock exit from Barcelona, says BBC Sport columnist Guillem Balague. The deal, which has the option of a third year, is subject to a medical. The Argentina captain, 34, left Barca - the only club he has played for - as they could not afford a new deal under La Liga's financial fair play rules. A PSG news conference will take place in the auditorium of the Parc des Princes on Wednesday at 10:00 BST. Mauricio Pochettino's PSG finished second to Lille in Ligue 1 last season. 'Messi feels betrayed by Barcelona' - the inside track on his Nou Camp exit ""It's all been confirmed. Lionel Messi is going to be a PSG player,"" Balague said on BBC Radio 5 Live. ""That's it, it's done. It's happened in the last few minutes. ""At the moment there are as much police as there are fans [at the stadium]. That's going to change soon. There's eight cameras here, again that's going to change. It seems like it is a two-year deal, plus one. ""His idea was to do it at Barcelona but it's going to be PSG. Then if he feels OK he will stay one more year maybe. But in any case his aim is to be at PSG and then to do well in the Qatar World Cup."" Messi and his family were pictured at Barcelona's El Prat airport on Tuesday afternoon after news of the deal emerged. When asked by reporters whether his son would be joining PSG, Jorge Messi answered ""yes"". Messi was pictured at El Prat airport on Tuesday afternoon after news of the deal with PSG emerged Messi's wife Antonela Roccuzzo posted this picture on Instagram on Tuesday with a caption talking of a ""new adventure together"" PSG's Neymar posted this image on Instagram with the caption 'Back Together'. The Brazilian played alongside Messi from 2013-2017 before his Â£200m move to France Pictures of Lionel Messi are being taken down at the Nou Camp Considered one of the greatest players of all time, Messi scored a record 672 goals in 778 games for Barca, the club he joined as a 13-year-old. He won the Ballon d'Or a record six times and lifted 35 trophies with the Catalan club. The signing of Messi - who would be reunited with former Barca team-mate Neymar at the Parc des Princes - is one of the most noteworthy captures in football's history. He will play in a front three alongside the two most expensive players of all time - Neymar and Kylian Mbappe. Where will Messi, Neymar, Mbappe rank in the great forward lines? Unless there are any late hitches, he will become PSG's fourth free-transfer signing this summer after the arrivals of Netherlands midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum, Spain defender Sergio Ramos and Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma. Highly-rated Morocco right-back Achraf Hakimi also joined from Inter Milan. PSG are yet to win the Champions League in a decade of Qatari ownership and subsequent heavy investment, with the 2020 final defeat against Bayern Munich the closest they have come. Balague said: ""Clearly what PSG's ownership want is a team that is in the Champions League final every year. ""With Messi you have an advantage. Pochettino being in charge and his contract being renewed as well means they have an idea how to do that and Messi will complement that. ""They will win the league, that's almost a given now, even though they lost last season. It will be a less competitive league which means he will be fresh of course, or should be, for the Champions League campaign."" Messi had agreed a new deal - on 50% of his old wages - to stay at Barcelona but the club could not afford to implement it because they were so far above the wage limit allowed by La Liga. ""He used to earn 140m euros gross a year at Barca, that's around Â£125m,"" said Balague. ""Take off about 40-50% for tax. ""He agreed to stay at Barcelona by reducing his wages by 50%, not more than that because that's illegal [under Spanish law]. Basically the league wouldn't believe he was reducing his wages to zero, which is what Barcelona may have tried to do as they are 1bn euros in debt. Basically they cannot afford him."" If the deal goes through quickly, he could make his PSG debut at home to Strasbourg on Saturday. Instatraders:Is foreign exchange trading as easy as social media claims it to be?

He will play in a front three alongside the two most expensive players of all time - Neymar and Kylian Mbappe. Where will Messi, Neymar, Mbappe rank in the great forward lines? Unless there are any late hitches, he will become PSG's fourth free-transfer signing this summer after the arrivals of Netherlands midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum, Spain defender Sergio Ramos and Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma. Highly-rated Morocco right-back Achraf Hakimi also joined from Inter Milan. PSG are yet to win the Champions League in a decade of Qatari ownership and subsequent heavy investment, with the 2020 final defeat against Bayern Munich the closest they have come. Balague said: ""Clearly what PSG's ownership want is a team that is in the Champions League final every year. ""With Messi you have an advantage. Pochettino being in charge and his contract being renewed as well means they have an idea how to do that and Messi will complement that. ""They will win the league, that's almost a given now, even though they lost last season. It will be a less competitive league which means he will be fresh of course, or should be, for the Champions League campaign."" Messi had agreed a new deal - on 50% of his old wages - to stay at Barcelona but the club could not afford to implement it because they were so far above the wage limit allowed by La Liga. ""He used to earn 140m euros gross a year at Barca, that's around Â£125m,"" said Balague. ""Take off about 40-50% for tax. ""He agreed to stay at Barcelona by reducing his wages by 50%, not more than that because that's illegal [under Spanish law]. Basically the league wouldn't believe he was reducing his wages to zero, which is what Barcelona may have tried to do as they are 1bn euros in debt. Basically they cannot afford him."" If the deal goes through quickly, he could make his PSG debut at home to Strasbourg on Saturday. Instatraders:Is foreign exchange trading as easy as social media claims it to be?

"JetBlue has said the Covid pandemic will not stop the airline from launching its long-awaited New York to London service on Wednesday. Chief executive Robin Hayes told the BBC there was ""strong demand"" for the route in the US where, he said, JetBlue had returned to 2019 levels. The move comes as the global travel industry continues to recover. Holiday Inn-owner Intercontinental Hotels said holiday demand was ""returning strongly"". In its latest results statement, Intercontinental Hotels Group (IHG), whose other brands include the Crowne Plaza chain, said it had opened 132 hotels during the January-to-June period and acquired another 203, both sizeable increases on last year. ""Trading improved significantly during the first half of 2021, with travel demand returning strongly as vaccines roll out, restrictions ease and economic activity rebuilds,"" said IHG chief executive Keith Barr. ""It has been great to see our teams welcome more and more guests back into our hotels, with domestic leisure bookings leading the way, particularly in the US and China."" Measured on revenue per available room, nearly half of the group's hotels worldwide were above 2019 levels in July, it said. JetBlue's first transatlantic flight will leave New York's JFK airport on Wednesday evening and will land at London's Heathrow. Flights to London Gatwick will begin on 29 September. However, travelling on the route does not come cheap, at least to start with. JetBlue's website no longer has seats available for that inaugural flight, but prices for the next few days start at $941 (Â£679) one-way. That is still slightly cheaper than British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, which are both quoting a price of $980 for the same time period. Thanks to the likes of those established competitors, there are already as many as 28 flights a day available between London and New York. And other carriers have come a cropper on the same route, including Norwegian Air, which filed for bankruptcy in November 2020 after failing to make its low-cost strategy pay. However, JetBlue will be cutting costs by using smaller aircraft, relying on the single-aisle Airbus A321LR, rather than the Boeing 787 Dreamliners that were favoured by Norwegian. And for those who can book further in advance, it is pledging to offer return fares of less than $600. The airline's Mr Hayes said it had wanted to offer a New York-to-London service for a long time and flights were now ""ready to go"". He said JetBlue wanted to have ""a disruptive and permanent effect"" on the market. US-based travellers are now welcome tofly to the UK without having to quarantine on arrivalif they have been fully vaccinated, but there is still a travel ban on people from the UK flying to the US. The White House said at the end of last month thatit did not intend to lift Covid-19 travel restrictionsfor non-Americans. Asked about this, Mr Hayes said JetBlue had made its views clear about the restrictions and that the current approach was ""not risk-based"".

"Second-hand car sales in the UK have more than doubled in the last few months after a shortage of new models. Year on year, the used car market grew 108.6% in the second quarter, with more than 2.2 million vehicles changing hands, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said. The number of sales was up 6.6% on pre-pandemic levels in 2019. Petrol cars made up most of the sales, but demand for electric cars is growing fast. Increased demand led to a rise in sales of older used cars, with only 12.7% of all vehicles sold being made within the last three years, the lowest on record. Why the banger on your drive is suddenly worth a lot more The SMMT said the increase in sales tracked the country's easing of Covid restrictions, with demand rising as businesses reopened. Ford Fiestas, Vauxhall Corsas, Ford Focuses and Volkswagen Golfs were the most popular models, with black, silver, blue and grey being the most common colour choices. Marshall Motors, which is one of UK's top ten car dealerships, said on Tuesday that it had recorded revenue and underlying profit in the first half of the year. Chief executive Daksh Gupta said the company had ""seen exceptional market tailwinds in the used car market"" as a shortage of computer chips reduced the numbers of new cars on the market. ""Ultimately what that has done is push used car prices up significantly,"" he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. He added that it is ""difficult to call"" how long there would be such a high demand for used cars ""because the whole situation links to new car supply"". ""The position is unclear and many manufacturers are having to deal with very complex production challenges,"" he said. ""We expect this disruption to go well into 2022."" SMMT boss Mike Hawes said many consumers had turned to the second hand market due to the shortage of new cars at a time of ""increased need for personal mobility with people remaining wary of public transport as they return to work"". The shortage has been linked to a lack of parts. When lockdowns forced production lines to halt, microchip manufacturers diverted the chips that would normally go into new cars to the consumer electronics market, and supply is yet to fully recover. It has driven up the price of second hand cars, said the SMMT. One dealership, Nuneaton Cars, said buyers wereattempting to gazump each other to get hold of used cars already marked as sold. Sales of second- hand battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles more than tripled in the second quarter. However, electric vehicles made up just 1.3% of second-hand car sales in the second quarter of 2021. The SMMT said the used electric car market ""is not yet seeing the acceleration of uptake as has been seen in the new car market"". ""The scale of the challenge to transition the entire used car [fleet] away from traditional fuels remains significant,"" the industry body said. This comes amid a major UN scientific report that said human activity is changing the climate in unprecedented and sometimes irreversible ways. Despite this, Mr Hawes said the rebound in sales was ""welcome news"" due to a buoyant used car market being ""necessary to maintain strong residual values which, in turn, supports new car transactions"". ""We now need to see a similar rebound in new car sales to accelerate the fleet renewal necessary to deliver immediate and continuous improvements in air quality and carbon emissions,"" he said. New car registrations fell by almost a third last month, marking the worst July sales since 1998. Just 123,296 new cars were registered in the UK, a 29.5% decline on July 2020.

"AI can identify patterns in brain scans even the most expert neurologists cannot see. Scientists are testing an artificial-intelligence system thought to be capable of diagnosing dementia after a single brain scan. It may also be able to predict whether the condition will remain stable for many years, slowly deteriorate or need immediate treatment. Currently, it can take several scans and tests to diagnose dementia. The researchers involved say earlier diagnoses with their system could greatly improve patient outcomes. ""If we intervene early, the treatments can kick in early and slow down the progression of the disease and at the same time avoid more damage,"" Prof Zoe Kourtzi, of Cambridge University and a fellow of national centre for AI and data science The Alan Turing Institute, said. ""And it's likely that symptoms occur much later in life or may never occur."" Prof Kourtzi's system compares brain scans of those worried they might have dementia with those of thousands of dementia patients and their relevant medical records. The algorithm can identify patterns in the scans even expert neurologists cannot see and match them to patient outcomes in its database. In pre-clinical tests, it has been able to diagnose dementia, years before symptoms develop, even when there is no obvious signs of damage on the brain scan. The trial, at Addenbrooke's Hospital and other memory clinics around the country, will test whether it works in a clinical setting, alongside conventional ways of diagnosing dementia. In the first year, about 500 patients are expected to participate. Their results will go to their doctors, who can, if necessary, advise on the course of treatment. Denis and Penelope Clark want to know how his condition will progress, so they can plan for their future Consultant neurologist Dr Tim Rittman, who is leading the study, with neuroscientists at Cambridge University, called the artificial-intelligence system a ""fantastic development"". ""These set of diseases are really devastating for people,"" he said. ""So when I am delivering this information to a patient, anything I can do to be more confident about the diagnosis, to give them more information about the likely progression of the disease to help them plan their lives is a great thing to be able to do."" Among the first to participate in the trial, Denis Clark, 75, retired from his job as an executive for a meat company five years ago. Last year, his wife, Penelope, noticed he was sometimes struggling with his memory. And they are now concerned he is developing dementia. Denis tries to describe his symptoms but Penelope interjects to say he finds it hard to explain what is happening. The couple are worried about having to sell their home to fund Denis's care. So Penelope is relieved they should not have to wait long for a diagnosis and an indication of how any dementia is likely to progress. Normally, Denis might need several brain scans to see whether he has dementia ""We could then plan financially,"" she said. ""We would know whether as a couple we could have a few holidays before things get so bad that I can't take Denis on holiday."" Another of Dr Rittman's patients, Mark Thompson, 57, who began having memory lapses 10 months ago, before the trial of the artificial-intelligence system began, said it would have made a big difference to him had it been available. ""I had test after test after test and at least four scans before I was diagnosed,"" he said. ""The medical team was marvellous and did everything they could to get to the bottom of what was wrong with me. ""But the uncertainty was causing me more... mental problems than any caused by the condition. ""Was it a tumour? Would they need to operate? It caused me so much stress not knowing what was wrong with me."" Follow Pallabon Twitter,external.

"London's Tower Bridge has reopened to traffic after becoming stuck for almost 12 hours. The famous crossingwas scheduled to lift on Monday,externalto allow a large wooden tall ship through, but it appeared to become jammed in place. City of London Police said the 127-year-old landmark was closed ""due to technical failure"". The bridge reopened to traffic at 01:45 BST on Tuesday. Drivers - and pedestrians - had previously been warned to avoid the area. City of London Police said the bridge had suffered a technical failure The crossing connects the Square Mile financial district to Southwark. Approach roads to the bridge were shut while repairs were carried out. The two sides of the crossing became stuck at about 14:30 BST on Monday. Transport for London (TfL) reported that traffic had been slow moving on both sides of the river during the afternoon. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Students in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are receiving their A-level results The number of As and A*s awarded have increased to 44.8% from 38.5% last year Because of the pandemic grades have been determined by teachers' estimates, rather than exams Scottish Highers, National 5s and Advanced Highers results are also being confirmed Students in Scotland received grades decided by their teachers after provisional grades were awarded in June Hundreds of thousands of students who studied for BTecs - practical qualifications aimed at specific jobs - are also getting their results They have also received teacher-assessed grades - although some practical assessments were carried out under social-distancing guidelines The A-level results follow last year's chaos when grades were initially calculated based on an algorithm This meant teachers estimates were used in most cases in 2020 The head of exams watchdog Ofqual says teacher assessments give a ""more accurate reflection"" of what students can achieve Edited by Emma Harrison and Rob Corp We're now closing our live page. Thank you for reading, sharing your exam result stories and putting questions to our experts. There will be more coverage on Thursday, when pupils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland receive their GCSE results - which have also been graded using teachers' estimates, looking at various pieces of work and mock exams over the past year. The live page writers today were Mary O'Connor, Alex Therrien and Eleanor Lawrie. The editors were Emma Harrison and Robert Corp. We'll soon be closing our A-level and BTec results live page. But before we do, here is a round-up of the main developments from today. This video can not be played 'I'm worried about starting university without any experience of exams' There are a unique set of school pupils who will be entering
universities this year without ever having sat an official final exam. Both Nicola and Mauvi in their fourth year of high school in
Scotland decided to study two-year highers. This meant they did not sit National 5 exams and then, due
to exams being cancelled because of coronavirus, were not able to sit official
final exams in 5th or 6th year. They are both starting university and are worried about the
academic year to come. They are concerned their lack of official exam
experience will make starting university even more daunting. Dr Edward Sosu, an education expert based at the University
of Strathclyde, says universities were aware that students starting with them
this year were in an unusual position. As we've been reporting, top grades for A-level results for England, Wales and Northern Ireland have reached a record high - with 44.8% getting A* or A grades. But how do the results compare by region? Here are the percentage of A-level entries awarded the top grades by nation and region: North-east England 39.2% (up from 35.6% in 2020) North-west England 41.4% (35.8%) Yorkshire & the Humber 41.1% (35.0%) West Midlands 40.9% (35.0%) East Midlands 41.3% (34.5%) Eastern England 44.8% (38.3%) South-west England 44.7% (38.8%) South-east England 47.1% (41.2%) London 47.9% (40.7%) England 44.3% (up from 38.1%) Wales 48.3% (41.8%) Northern Ireland 50.8% (43.3%) All 44.8% (up from 38.5%)  What happens to students who are taking subjects that include coursework? - Ali Hamza Rasheed, Manchester Joanne Elliott from the National Careers Service says: Teachers and tutors have taken an evidence-based approach this year. They have based grades on students' performance, using evidence such as coursework and other assessments done in class. Students have only been assessed on content that they have been taught. So if you missed something because you had to isolate you will not be graded on that work. Catherine Sezen from the Association of Colleges says: Vocational technical qualifications such as BTec or OCR Technical include a mixture of coursework and exams. They also had adaptations this year, including teacher-assessed grades. The results for these qualifications at Level 3 (the same level as A-level) have been announced today. The Level 2s will be announced on Thursday alongside GCSEs. Results for other practical qualifications will come throughout the summer. Read more answers to A-level queries, and submit your own question Ellie Curran and mum Margie Hundreds
of thousands of students have been getting their BTec and A-level results today, including Ellie Curran, aged 19. She is celebrating after achieving A* in
sociology and a B in business at A-level and a distinction in BTec law, meaning
she can go to Liverpool Hope University and study criminology. Ellie, who has cerebral palsy and
uses a wheelchair, says she is ""in shock"" at the results and working
from home during the pandemic has been ""dead hard"". She received her results at Archbishop Blanch School in Liverpool. Her mother Margie says: ""She's very
dedicated, in lockdown she would be up at 8am at her desk. ""She's always been dedicated, I
think she just wants to prove everyone wrong and show she can do it."" BTecs are practical qualifications aimed at specific job or career sectors such as engineering, hospitality and childcare. Like A-levels, results have been based on teacher assessments this year. Find out moreabout how they've been graded - and what to do if you're unhappy with your results. As we've been reporting all day - students in England, Wales and Northern Ireland have been getting their A-level results today - with almost 45% of those taking them getting the top grades of A* and A. Click play below to see pupils sharing their grades with the BBC. This video can not be played A-level results: 'We have put in the work and we deserve these grades' Pupils in Scotland have today been having their grades confirmed for National 5, Higher and Advanced Higher qualifications. BBC Scotland has spoken to a number of pupils at Portlethan Academy in Aberdeenshire who shared their results and views on the grading process. Abbie Collett says she would welcome a return to the normal exams system S5 pupil Abbie Collett says she is ""very happy"" with her A, B and two Cs as well as a pass in a foundation apprenticeship, and hopes to study primary education after sixth year. But prior to the cancellation of exams, she found it ""difficult"" not knowing how her work would be assessed. ""I thought I might have done worse due to everything going on, but I was happy with my grades that I needed and the teachers were a big help this year with pushing you with what you wanted to do."" Nevertheless, Abbie says she would welcome a return to the normal exam system. Ross Greenlees hopes to pursue a career in catering Ross Greenlees feels the initial uncertainty around the exams process made it ""difficult to prepare"", but thinks the eventual assessment of his work is ""fair"". He got two As at Nat 5 level, a C and a pass in an apprenticeship in food and drink technology. ""It was pretty good considering the circumstances,"" he says. ""We sort of knew our grades before today but getting the confirmation those were the final grades was a good feeling."" Ross hopes to go to college for a cooking course and pursue a career in catering - but first comes S6. Alice EvansNewsbeat Matt Calloway says university will feel like an extended holiday after the year heâs had trying to study at home. Like every other student across the UK, the 18-year-oldâs studies were interrupted by Covid â but he had to fit his learning around eight other siblings at home in Bristol. âIt made it a lot more difficult,â he tells BBC Radio 1 Newsbeat. âTrying to do online learning with them was never going to happen.â As the second eldest, he also had to help out his younger siblings with their school work. âI didnât realise how hard primary school work is,â he says. After juggling all of that, Matt âsurprised myselfâ by meeting the conditions of his offer. He picked up a double merit in construction and an A-level in photography, so is going to Middlesex University to study criminology and psychology.  I'm doing my exams next year and I'm very worried.I know some students wait a year to apply, so I'll be competing for university places against students with grades from 2021. Will universities be making allowances for my year? - Harry, Yorkshire Courteney Sheppard from Ucas says: Each year, the universities will consider the current cohort of students with their grades on merit based on that year. Make sure to look at the entry requirements of the courses that you are interested in, and do your best to get the grades that the universities are asking for. I would suggest that you consider courses with differing entry requirements for your Ucas application. Some of these choices could be aspirational. Others could be ""safe"" if you think you will definitely meet the requirements, including achievable grades.

Eighteen-year-old Nyat Aron-Yohannes, from Purfleet, Essex, got three A*s and is going to Oxford to study philosophy, politics and economics. Reflecting on the work she put in to get the results, she says: ""The struggle was real."" She adds: ""We woke up early to come into school and sometimes it did not even seem like it was worth it at those times when the grades were not matching up to your work ethic. ""Then lockdown happened and you had to persevere on your own because you did not have your classmates or teachers physically nearby to push you. You had to find strength somewhere else. ""I am just grateful it paid off, we were walking in faith."" Ade Olugboji, 18, also from Purfleet, got four A*s and is going to study maths and philosophy at Oxford. He says: ""Brampton has a philosophy of hard work. ""I started at 6am and left at 6pm. ""I knew there was going to be work but I did not understand the level until I got here. ""The thing is once I saw everyone else working so hard and so well, it did not seem that it (success) was impossible."" In all, 350 students took their A-levels at the school this year with 330 getting into Russell Group universities, including the 55 who got into Oxbridge. Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent It won't just be teenagers with great A-level grades jumping in the air in celebration. Away from the photographers, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, the exam boards and watchdogs might be tempted to have a quiet results' day leap of their own. Because after thechaotic U-turns of last year's exams, this year has been a much smoother run. It might be because results are way above anything ever seen before, thus fewer reasons to complain. Last year, the algorithm process saw about 40% of teacher assessed grades being downgraded, this time exam boards only intervened to change 1% of grades. As exam officials said in a briefing, these results reflect an ideal world where no one had a bad day in an exam hall and everyone had multiple chances to do well. But there will be consequences for those chasing university places - with warnings of a crush for top places in a year when more people than ever have applied. Once today's celebrations have finished, there will nervous glances ahead to next year. Because having allowed results to rise like a kite, at what point and how do you pull them down again?

Student Amina Lounici, 18 (centre), celebrates with her friend at Brampton Manor Academy in London Pupils at an inner city state school are celebrating after 55 teenagers got the A-level grades needed for them to study at Oxbridge, which is more than the offers made to Eton College students. The majority of pupils at Brampton Manor Academy in Newham, east London, are from ethnic minority backgrounds, in receipt of free school meals, or will be the first in their family to attend university. Sam Dobin, Brampton's sixth form director, says he is ""delighted"" that 55 of its students are now set to study at Oxford or Cambridge University this year, which is more than leading independent schools. At Eton, where Prime Minister Boris Johnson studied, 48 pupils secured Oxbridge offers, a fall from 69 last year. When Marty
Hardy moved with her family to the UK from Italy in 2012, she says she did not know a word of English. She tells the BBC: ""I went to school from Year 5 and I was assigned a teaching assistant for extra English lessons. ""I used to carry around a dictionary at school so that I could understand what my friends were saying to me."" But nine years later, Marty, 18, has secured 2A*s and an A at A-level and is off to read psychology and linguistics at the University of Oxford. Marty, who took her A-levels at Twynham Sixth Form in Bournemouth, says: ""I
never thought of going to Oxford University before, but in Year 12 I was
getting high grades and my teachers asked me about options."" She says she also has a TEFL qualification and hopes to become an English teacher in the future. Labour's shadow education secretary Kate Green has been speaking to the BBC after top grades for A-level results for England, Wales and Northern Ireland hit a record high. She says we should ""recognise and congratulate"" students on their results after a year of disruption to their education and paid tribute to teachers and staff in universities and colleges for working to ensure young people got fair grades. However, Green says she is ""concerned"" about the ""inequities"" between regions and the different education sectors in the results. For example, inLondon, 47.9% were A* and A grades, while in the north-east of England, it was 39.2%. She adds: ""I think there are real inequities to be concerned about in these results and that was to a degree inevitable because the government left it to schools to decide how they would carry out assessments and we know that means students haven't been assessed identically in every school, in every part of the country."" Green adds there are ""real lessons"" to be learned about what extra help and protections are needed ""to compensate for some of these inequities that we've got in the results"". Green insists the ""focus"" should now be on next steps if students haven't got the grades they feel they should have, with an appeals process that works ""swiftly and smoothly"" to help them - especially those whose university places depend on it, while also protecting those from less privileged backgrounds. As the government hopes for a return to exams next year, Green urges ministers to give schools the plans for this now so they can prepare students properly for what the assessment process is going to be like. BBC Newsbeat When the UK went into lockdown in January this year, Jack
was tempted to give up on his exams. He's just collected the results for his Scottish National 5 exams  - the equivalent to GCSEs in other parts of the UK. ""When we first got told we were doing online
learning, I was thinking to myself, at my lowest point: 'Let's just bin off the
5s, I'm not going to get what I want,"" he tells Newsbeat. Jack, 15, who attends Braidhurst High School in Motherwell, got three As and two Bs, despite struggling
with remote learning. He says he's ""really happy"" with how things
turned out. Katie, 16, who goes to the same school, got seven As in her National 5s, and says it
was ""hard"" getting there, but felt she ""had to go on with it
because everyone was in the same position"". She found that playing with her football team helped take
her mind of the exam stress. ""I know that it was important to take a break and go
to training, so I could get my mind off things and enjoy myself,"" she
tells Newsbeat. ""I know it was important to do both.â Hywel GriffithBBC News' Wales Correspondent Leah Morgan: ""We've had a lot of uncertainty"" Leah Morgan is off to study nuclear medicine at Swansea University, thanks to her four A*s in mathematics, biology, chemistry and physics. ""We've experienced
things that other years haven't,"" she says. ""We've had a lot of uncertainty, and at the end
of the day, our results came from tests that were done under exam conditions."" Leah, an A-level student at Coleg y Cymoedd Nantgarw campus in South Wales, says her year group's results are ""very valid"". ""My uni has taken them [my grades] into account and they're happy with them. ""And you know as
soon as uni is done that's your next grade. That's what jobs will be looking at
so these (A-Level results) wonât matter in a couple of years' time."" Students are being offered incentives to defer their place at the University of Exeter's medical school Aspiring student medics are to be offered Â£10,000 if they need to move medical schools due to capacity limits. The Medical Schools Council (MSC), which
represents 44 heads of UK medical schools, has started a
""brokerage programme"" after more university applicants met the terms of their offers than expected. The scheme for oversubscribed
schools means that students who are required to move medical schools will receive Â£10,000 ""for the inconvenience"". The method for distributing this funding
will be confirmed ""in due course"", according to the MSC. Last week, the Department for Education (DfE)
announced extra funding would be given to England's medicine and dentistry schools to expand this year's courses. Ucas figures released on Tuesday show 8,560 students from England
have been accepted on to medicine and dentistry courses, up 23% from 6,960 on
last year's results day. The government limits the number of places on medicine and dentistry courses in England. But the DfE has announced the cap will be adjusted to allow for more than 9,000 places on
medical and dentistry courses for 2021. The MSC says a ""limiting factor"" to the expansion of medical school places is the availability of clinical placements for students during their years on the course. Recently, the University of Exeter wrote to students who had applied to study medicine with an offer offree accommodation and Â£10,000 cash if they are prepared to delay their course for a year. Hywel GriffithBBC News' Wales Correspondent Back at Coleg y Cymoedd in Nantgarw, Dylan Coundley-Hughes is off to the University of Southampton to study biology. He is a bit concerned employers might think this year's students had an easier time than the year groups before and after them. ""It is a worry because I can see people may be like âoh you were from this yearâ.. we might not get employed compared to someone else,"" he says. ""But we can't do anything about it, so we need to just get on with it."" Dylan received an A* in biology, and As in maths and geography. The chief regulator of England's exams watchdog Ofqual has defended the approach to awarding this year's A-level grades. Simon Lebus told Radio 4's The World at One ""teachers were in the best position to make those judgements"". Holding nationally standardised exams would simply not have been practical, he said. ""If one thinks about it, at the beginning of June I think there were about a quarter of a million students in isolation because of problems with Covid, that had gone up to three quarters of a million by the end of June so it would have been complete mayhem if we'd been conducting exams in the normal way."" Lebus also rejected the notion that there has been grade inflation, suggesting it was not comparing like with like. But he said there does need to be a discussion about returning to something like the distribution of grades seen in the past, noting that ""there's clearly got to be a managed progression back to the old normal... I think there's a big debate to be had about how quickly that happens."" He added that the discrepancy between state and private school results was also consistent with the attainment gap already evident. In independent schools 70.1% of pupils achieved A* and A grades, while this was 39% at comprehensive schools.  Â© 2025 BBC.

"Students in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are receiving their A-level results The number of As and A*s awarded have increased to 44.8% from 38.5% last year Because of the pandemic grades have been determined by teachers' estimates, rather than exams Scottish Highers, National 5s and Advanced Highers results are also being confirmed Students in Scotland received grades decided by their teachers after provisional grades were awarded in June Hundreds of thousands of students who studied for BTecs - practical qualifications aimed at specific jobs - are also getting their results They have also received teacher-assessed grades - although some practical assessments were carried out under social-distancing guidelines The A-level results follow last year's chaos when grades were initially calculated based on an algorithm This meant teachers estimates were used in most cases in 2020 The head of exams watchdog Ofqual says teacher assessments give a ""more accurate reflection"" of what students can achieve Edited by Emma Harrison and Rob Corp We're now closing our live page. Thank you for reading, sharing your exam result stories and putting questions to our experts. There will be more coverage on Thursday, when pupils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland receive their GCSE results - which have also been graded using teachers' estimates, looking at various pieces of work and mock exams over the past year. The live page writers today were Mary O'Connor, Alex Therrien and Eleanor Lawrie. The editors were Emma Harrison and Robert Corp. We'll soon be closing our A-level and BTec results live page. But before we do, here is a round-up of the main developments from today. This video can not be played 'I'm worried about starting university without any experience of exams' There are a unique set of school pupils who will be entering
universities this year without ever having sat an official final exam. Both Nicola and Mauvi in their fourth year of high school in
Scotland decided to study two-year highers. This meant they did not sit National 5 exams and then, due
to exams being cancelled because of coronavirus, were not able to sit official
final exams in 5th or 6th year. They are both starting university and are worried about the
academic year to come. They are concerned their lack of official exam
experience will make starting university even more daunting. Dr Edward Sosu, an education expert based at the University
of Strathclyde, says universities were aware that students starting with them
this year were in an unusual position. As we've been reporting, top grades for A-level results for England, Wales and Northern Ireland have reached a record high - with 44.8% getting A* or A grades. But how do the results compare by region? Here are the percentage of A-level entries awarded the top grades by nation and region: North-east England 39.2% (up from 35.6% in 2020) North-west England 41.4% (35.8%) Yorkshire & the Humber 41.1% (35.0%) West Midlands 40.9% (35.0%) East Midlands 41.3% (34.5%) Eastern England 44.8% (38.3%) South-west England 44.7% (38.8%) South-east England 47.1% (41.2%) London 47.9% (40.7%) England 44.3% (up from 38.1%) Wales 48.3% (41.8%) Northern Ireland 50.8% (43.3%) All 44.8% (up from 38.5%)  What happens to students who are taking subjects that include coursework? - Ali Hamza Rasheed, Manchester Joanne Elliott from the National Careers Service says: Teachers and tutors have taken an evidence-based approach this year. They have based grades on students' performance, using evidence such as coursework and other assessments done in class. Students have only been assessed on content that they have been taught. So if you missed something because you had to isolate you will not be graded on that work. Catherine Sezen from the Association of Colleges says: Vocational technical qualifications such as BTec or OCR Technical include a mixture of coursework and exams. They also had adaptations this year, including teacher-assessed grades. The results for these qualifications at Level 3 (the same level as A-level) have been announced today. The Level 2s will be announced on Thursday alongside GCSEs. Results for other practical qualifications will come throughout the summer.

of thousands of students have been getting their BTec and A-level results today, including Ellie Curran, aged 19. She is celebrating after achieving A* in
sociology and a B in business at A-level and a distinction in BTec law, meaning
she can go to Liverpool Hope University and study criminology. Ellie, who has cerebral palsy and
uses a wheelchair, says she is ""in shock"" at the results and working
from home during the pandemic has been ""dead hard"". She received her results at Archbishop Blanch School in Liverpool. Her mother Margie says: ""She's very
dedicated, in lockdown she would be up at 8am at her desk. ""She's always been dedicated, I
think she just wants to prove everyone wrong and show she can do it."" BTecs are practical qualifications aimed at specific job or career sectors such as engineering, hospitality and childcare. Like A-levels, results have been based on teacher assessments this year. Find out moreabout how they've been graded - and what to do if you're unhappy with your results. As we've been reporting all day - students in England, Wales and Northern Ireland have been getting their A-level results today - with almost 45% of those taking them getting the top grades of A* and A.

BBC Scotland has spoken to a number of pupils at Portlethan Academy in Aberdeenshire who shared their results and views on the grading process. Abbie Collett says she would welcome a return to the normal exams system S5 pupil Abbie Collett says she is ""very happy"" with her A, B and two Cs as well as a pass in a foundation apprenticeship, and hopes to study primary education after sixth year. But prior to the cancellation of exams, she found it ""difficult"" not knowing how her work would be assessed. ""I thought I might have done worse due to everything going on, but I was happy with my grades that I needed and the teachers were a big help this year with pushing you with what you wanted to do."" Nevertheless, Abbie says she would welcome a return to the normal exam system. Ross Greenlees hopes to pursue a career in catering Ross Greenlees feels the initial uncertainty around the exams process made it ""difficult to prepare"", but thinks the eventual assessment of his work is ""fair"". He got two As at Nat 5 level, a C and a pass in an apprenticeship in food and drink technology. ""It was pretty good considering the circumstances,"" he says. ""We sort of knew our grades before today but getting the confirmation those were the final grades was a good feeling."" Ross hopes to go to college for a cooking course and pursue a career in catering - but first comes S6. Alice EvansNewsbeat Matt Calloway says university will feel like an extended holiday after the year heâs had trying to study at home. Like every other student across the UK, the 18-year-oldâs studies were interrupted by Covid â but he had to fit his learning around eight other siblings at home in Bristol. âIt made it a lot more difficult,â he tells BBC Radio 1 Newsbeat. âTrying to do online learning with them was never going to happen.â As the second eldest, he also had to help out his younger siblings with their school work. âI didnât realise how hard primary school work is,â he says. After juggling all of that, Matt âsurprised myselfâ by meeting the conditions of his offer. He picked up a double merit in construction and an A-level in photography, so is going to Middlesex University to study criminology and psychology.  I'm doing my exams next year and I'm very worried.I know some students wait a year to apply, so I'll be competing for university places against students with grades from 2021. Will universities be making allowances for my year? - Harry, Yorkshire Courteney Sheppard from Ucas says: Each year, the universities will consider the current cohort of students with their grades on merit based on that year. Make sure to look at the entry requirements of the courses that you are interested in, and do your best to get the grades that the universities are asking for. I would suggest that you consider courses with differing entry requirements for your Ucas application. Some of these choices could be aspirational. Others could be ""safe"" if you think you will definitely meet the requirements, including achievable grades.

Eighteen-year-old Nyat Aron-Yohannes, from Purfleet, Essex, got three A*s and is going to Oxford to study philosophy, politics and economics. Reflecting on the work she put in to get the results, she says: ""The struggle was real."" She adds: ""We woke up early to come into school and sometimes it did not even seem like it was worth it at those times when the grades were not matching up to your work ethic. ""Then lockdown happened and you had to persevere on your own because you did not have your classmates or teachers physically nearby to push you. You had to find strength somewhere else. ""I am just grateful it paid off, we were walking in faith."" Ade Olugboji, 18, also from Purfleet, got four A*s and is going to study maths and philosophy at Oxford. He says: ""Brampton has a philosophy of hard work. ""I started at 6am and left at 6pm. ""I knew there was going to be work but I did not understand the level until I got here. ""The thing is once I saw everyone else working so hard and so well, it did not seem that it (success) was impossible."" In all, 350 students took their A-levels at the school this year with 330 getting into Russell Group universities, including the 55 who got into Oxbridge. Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent It won't just be teenagers with great A-level grades jumping in the air in celebration. Away from the photographers, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, the exam boards and watchdogs might be tempted to have a quiet results' day leap of their own. Because after thechaotic U-turns of last year's exams, this year has been a much smoother run. It might be because results are way above anything ever seen before, thus fewer reasons to complain. Last year, the algorithm process saw about 40% of teacher assessed grades being downgraded, this time exam boards only intervened to change 1% of grades.

"Students protested about the Welsh Government's grading system last year Everyone will be hoping for an altogether more low-key results day in Wales on Tuesday. Last year the uproar around downgraded A-level marks led to a dramatic U-turn by ministers. This summer there is no algorithm to ""standardise"" teacher grades and, crucially, the vast majority of Welsh pupils already know their results ahead of the official release. So how isA-level results dayin Wales going to be different in 2021? For a start, it is earlier than usual. Usually, A-level and GCSE results days are on subsequent Thursdays in the second half of August. However they have been brought forward to ensure enough time to process any appeals. Students collect their grades at Ysgol Bro Myrddin in Carmarthen In Wales, schools and collegesshared provisional results with pupils in Juneand they could then appeal. On results day, some schools are simply confirming grades via email or post, while others, such as Olchfa Comprehensive in Swansea, are inviting pupils to celebrate their results becoming official. The school's deputy head teacher Matt Salmon said it was a ""rite of passage"", even if pupils know what is inside the envelope. ""Whether there'll be the same level of excitement and celebration or, conversely, disappointment in some cases remains to be seen"", he said. Exam results system is fair for pupils - watchdog Uni clearing may be 'much more competitive' - Ucas Exams 2021 - It's been a rollercoaster for students Public inquiry call over exam results 'blunders' But while surprises are unlikely, it remains a significant day for those hoping to go to university with places only confirmed after the official release of results. And if you didn't quite get the grades you need, it's only now you find out whether there's any wriggle room or other options through clearing. Provisional results ""took away the stress"", said A-level student Shenona Mitra Shenona Mitra, 18, from Bangor hopes to study medicine in London and said having provisional results earlier gave students a sense of security. ""It took a little of the stress away from teachers and students because of how unpredictable things have been,"" she said. ""We needed that time to make sure things were ok and we could still go to university. If things needed to be changed, they could be within time."" Schools and colleges set them - or to use the official term, they areCentre Determined Grades(CDGs). The decision to cancel exams was made last November, but the system that replaced it had to be ditched too when schools remained closed after Christmas. At that stage it was decided thatteachers would decide students' end-of-year gradesbased on evidence of attainment. In practice that meant pupils sat a series of classroom assessments when they were back in school after Easter, though some claimed they were exams in all but name. Gareth Evans, executive director of education at the University of Wales Trinity St David, said some pupils ended up sitting 30 or 40 tests. ""That is not ideal after three or four months out of face-to-face teaching due to a pandemic,"" he said. ""Perhaps we could have considered a little better the well-being and learning loss of those pupils rather than the race to examine them for their GCSE and A-level outcomes."" Cai Parry wants more focus on coursework than exams Cardiff A-level pupil Cai Parry, 18, was part of a campaign last year calling for grades determined by teachers, rather than exams. He thinks there should be long-term changes to assessment, with more emphasis on coursework. ""That's a fairer reflection of how students are coping throughout the year, whereas if we pile everything on to just exams at the endâ¦ that has been a lot more stressful,"" he said. No. Last year an algorithm to standardise results was blamed for lowering tens of thousands of the grades that had been assessed by teachers, and for the uproar that ensued. A U-turn before GCSE results day meant pupils were eventually awarded the teacher grades and similar decisions were made elsewhere in the UK too. Trying to avoid a repeat of last year's chaos has been a top priority. This year, the exam board WJEC has had no power to change grades, though schools and colleges have been asked to explain results that are significantly out of line with previous years. Something similar but with some key differences. Pupils in England weren't given provisional grades. That means those who've been studying over the border, or who have taken qualifications in Wales under English exam boards, will be feeling the nerves more than most Welsh pupils. It's the first time results day is happening at the same time across the UK, as they're usually earlier in Scotland. Results for BTEC and other vocational qualifications will also be released. As they are regulated at a UK-wide level, BTEC students will not have had prior sight of their final grades. Some students will not even go to their school on results day There were 36,140 A-level entries for summer 2021, a rise of 16% compared with 2020. This could partly be due to a bigger teenage population, while a rise in top grades at AS-level last summer might have encouraged more students to continue to A-level. Mr Evans said there were too many variables to compare results. ""We're going to have to live with the fact that we can't compare year-on-year and this year's cohort of A-level and GCSE graduates have been through something nobody else has been through and, therefore, the results are not comparable,"" he said. That said,nearly half of this year's A-level grades were top A* and A grades in Wales, the official results showed on Tuesday. A total of 48.3% of grades were A* and A after what exam awarders called ""challenging circumstances"" due to Covid-19. There was an increase at A* with 21.3% of candidates getting this grade, compared with 16.3% in 2020. Altogether, 99.1% achieved A* to E passes.

"Top A-level grades have risen for students across England, Wales and Northern Ireland for the first time since 2021. Overall this year 28% of all grades were A* or A - up from 27.2% in 2023. However the figures vary between the three nations, rising in England but falling in Wales and Northern Ireland. Here is what you need to know about everything from grade boundaries to clearing. You can normally pick up AS and A-level results in person anytime from 08:00 BST. However, some students receive their results via email. Check with your school or college about the arrangements in place for you. How much does uni cost and does it boost earnings? Everything you need to know about student loans Surprised by your results? Our interactive guide on what to do next Each exam is graded on a scale from A* to E. Grade boundaries show the minimum number of marks you need for each grade. They are decided by examiners and published on results day. Qualifications Wales, which oversees Welsh exams, had been prepared to use statistics to set the grade boundaries to prevent marks dropping significantly below 2019 levels, because of a concern that performance in some subjects had still not recovered fully since the pandemic. That back-up plan was not needed. In England and Northern Ireland the way boundaries are decided has returned to normal. Ucas is a charity which runs a clearing process,externalmatching students with university and college courses which still have spaces. Students can use it if they: fail to achieve the grades for their conditional offer fail to receive any offers they want to accept decide after 30 June to apply for university achieve better grades than expected and want to change universities Clearing is now open and closes on 21 October. Universities make an offer to a student to join a course based on qualifications and grades or theUcas tariff points system,external. Each A-level grade is worth a certain number of Ucas points. For example, an A* is worth 56 points and a D is worth 24 points. Many students decide not to go to university and start an apprenticeship or go straight into work. Others take agap year,externalso they have more time to decide what to do next. What are apprenticeships and how do I choose a good one? If you do not think your grade is right, you should talk to your school or college. It will contact the exam board on your behalf and ask for your marks to be reviewed. If you still think you have been unfairly graded after a review,you can ask your school or college to appeal,external. The exam board will consider whether a correction is needed. If you are still not satisfied, you can request a review from the exams regulator Ofqual. The charity YoungMinds points out thatexam results are not the only measure of success,external- and if things do not turn out how you had hoped, there are lots of ways to get where you want to. If you only just miss out on the grades you need to get on to a university or college course, the admissions office might accept you anyway or offer you a place on a different course. You could also try clearing. It may also be possible to resit some or all of your exams. Talk to your school or college if you want to explore this route. Resits will take place in May or June 2025. Scotland has adifferent qualification system.,externalStudents take Highers, which are similar to A-levels. Results day in Scotland was on Tuesday 6 August.

"Randox has pledged to expand the number of drop boxes and increase the frequency of collections One of the bigger providers of Covid PCR test kits has responded after images of overflowing drop boxes were shared online. The firm, Randox, said it was increasing the number of drop boxes and the frequency of box collections. The move comes after people posted pictures of returned test kits piled high on top of drop boxes in Sutton and Hampstead over the weekend. One MP said the ""pointless"" tests were ""becoming a bad joke"". At least one PCR test is required for all arrivals from international destinations within two days of landing in the UK. Those returning from green listed countries, or who are fully vaccinated and returning from amber list countries, are required to take only one. However, those not fully vaccinated from amber list destinations must take at least two tests, one on day two and one on day eight. One of those affected, Gavin Marshall, said he had to drop off a test kit on behalf of his daughter, who had completed a PCR test two days after returning from a holiday in Portugal. Despite the fact that the box was full, he said: ""I had no choice but to leave the sample at that site, because there wasn't enough time to get to another drop box before collection deadline."" Mr Marshall called it a ""Covid travel rip-off"". Javid urges review of excessive Covid test costs Rory Boland, Which? Travel Editor, said he had seen problems with several testing firms and an increase in every type of complaint. Complaints included tests not arriving on time, people being unable to book tests and misleading prices. ""It's particularly frustrating as Which? raised this with government a few months ago,"" he added. ""The system isn't set up for large numbers of people travelling and now many people are travelling the system is not working properly. The government might now say it is looking into the prices of tests, but it's very late in the day and these problems were foreseeable."" Labour MP Ben Bradshaw tweeted in reaction to the photos: ""These pointless rip-off day two PCR tests for people returning from amber and green list countries, most of which have a fraction of our Covid-19 rates, are becoming a bad joke."" A government spokesperson said health secretary Sajid Javidhad asked the competition watchdog to investigate excessive pricingand said it was working with testing providers to reduce costs. Nancy Diaz was due to fly to Barcelona on 21 July. When her test arrived, she registered it and delivered it to a Randox Health drop box in Edinburgh, two days before her flight. However, Ms Diaz said she only received confirmation that her test had arrived at the company's laboratory the following evening, meaning she knew her results were not going to come through in time for her flight. Due to the delay, Ms Diaz rebooked her flight for 24 hours later, however, when she received her negative test result at 13:26 BST on 21 July, the day she had originally planned to fly on, she was required to do another test at Edinburgh Airport as her original test results were now outside of the 72-hour window. ""I was given no refund, as they (Randox) claim the 24 hours promise is from when the test arrives at their lab, which can be whenever, apparently,"" said Ms Diaz. ""The fact that the test can take more than 24 hours to arrive to their lab was not mentioned."" Lizzy Merrall ordered tests for her parents and for herself on 19 July, ahead of a family holiday to Spain on 27 July. Her parents' tests arrived, but her pre-departure test she needed to take with her on holiday to do before flying back to the UK did not. ""I contacted Randox on the 26 July asking where my tests were,"" she told the BBC. ""I asked them if they could at least offer me a refund for one of the tests but they never replied to me and I had to pay Â£80 for a last minute test."" Ms Merrrall said her test pack only arrived once she was already on holiday in Spain. Randox has not responded to requests for comment in relation to Ms Diaz's and Ms Merrall's experiences. A spokesperson for the Northern Ireland-based company said it was ""constantly expanding and improving its Covid-19 testing capacity and associated logistics network, which is already the largest in the United Kingdom, to meet the rapidly growing demand resulting from the loosening of travel restrictions"". ""Randox continues to increase the number of drop boxes across the United Kingdom, which already totals over 200, and is increasing the frequency of box collections which are already occurring multiple times per day,"" they added. ""Randox is providing premium testing services in dynamic and rapidly changing circumstances and is committed to continuously improving its logistics network, to ensure that international travellers receive their results in time.  All of the sample kits pictured will be processed."" PCR tests are more expensive than lateral flow tests and have been criticised by some in the travel industry for pricing many potential travellers out. The government has previously defended their use, saying they are useful as they can be sequenced to check for variants of concern, unlike lateral flow tests. But some have criticised the government, saying they are not sequencing enough tests. Last week, Conservative MP Huw Merriman, chair of the Transport select committee, said they should be dropped. ""PCR tests can be two to three times the cost of lateral flow testing. It's pricing out holidays for those that don't have the means to pay for those tests,"" he said. ""I wouldn't mind if the tests were going to be used for sequencing, so we can find all variants of concern, but if only 5% of PCR tests are being sequenced, then surely it's a complete waste of money."" The Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) has highlighted that as the vast majority of travellers into the UK do not test positive, their tests are not sent for sequencing. Of those sent for sequencing, a minority contain insufficient virus, but more than 95% of viable green and amber tests are sequenced, it said. A DHSC spokesperson said: ""All positive tests for arrivals from red list countries are sequenced and there is a legal requirement for private testing providers to sequence positive PCR tests for amber or green country travellers. ""We are already a world leader in genomics, with over 600,000 positive Covid-19 samples having been sequenced during this pandemic.""

"David Cameron made about $10m (Â£7m) from Greensill Capital before the finance company collapsed, documents obtained by BBC Panorama suggest. The documents indicate the former prime minister received $4.5m after cashing in Greensill shares in 2019. Greensill, which made its money by lending to businesses, went into administration in March, leaving investors facing billions in losses. Mr Cameron's spokesman said his remuneration was a private matter. Greensill collapsed after its insurer refused to renew cover for the loans it was making. Before its collapse, Mr Cameron unsuccessfully tried to persuade ministers to invest taxpayers' money in Greensill loans. He has since been cleared of breaking any lobbying rules, but MPs said the former prime minister showed a ""significant lack of judgement"". The details about Mr Cameron's shares were revealed in a letter from Greensill Capital to the former prime minister. According to the letter, Mr Cameron was going to be paid $4,569,851.60 (about Â£3.3m) after tax for a tranche of his Greensill shares. What did David Cameron do for Greensill? Cameron lacked judgement over Greensill, MPs say Ex-PM Cameron cleared by lobbying watchdog Panorama has not seen Mr Cameron's signed acceptance of the offer, but the letter records that he had already agreed to the deal. As well as the shares, Mr Cameron received a salary of $1m (Â£720,000) a year as a part-time adviser. The programme also understands that the former prime minister was paid a bonus of $700,000 (Â£504,000) in 2019 on top of his salary. In total, it looks like he made around $10m before tax for two-and-a-half years' part-time work. Mr Cameron's spokesman said: ""He acted in good faith at all times and there was no wrongdoing in any of the actions he took."" Panorama: David Cameron and the Missing Billions is on BBC One at 19:35 BST on Monday or lateron iPlayer Panorama has discovered how the company Mr Cameron promoted has left investors and UK taxpayers facing huge losses. Greensill Capital lent around $5bn (Â£3.6bn) to GFG Alliance - a group of companies controlled by the steel magnate Sanjeev Gupta. GFG employs 35,000 people around the world, including more than 4,000 at steel mills in the UK. Internal documents reveal that Greensill Capital knew GFG was in financial trouble by the start of 2020 because it was unable to make payments on Greensill loans. But Greensill used its own cash to cover repayments GFG could not afford - leaving investors unaware of the problems. What is the GFG Alliance and what does it own? An email sent by a Greensill finance officer to a senior manager in April 2020 said that the unusual payments had been going on for four months. It said: ""We are constantly plugging holes that GFG cannot afford to repay... It is not even robbing Peter to pay Paul, it is just recirculation of Greensill funds."" A second email sent at the start of May suggests an insolvency practitioner should be sent in to review Mr Gupta's businesses. It said: ""It may well be that administration is required."" Sanjeev Gupta is executive chairman of GFG Alliance Instead of raising the alarm about GFG's inability to make loan payments, Greensill Capital looked for a new investor. It turned to the UK government - and David Cameron was sent in to try to make it happen. Mr Cameron sent 56 messages lobbying ministers and senior civil servants. He wanted the Bank of England to invest more than Â£10bn of taxpayers' money in Greensill's loans. The Bank of England turned Greensill down, but in June 2020 Greensill was approved as a lender under a government scheme designed to get emergency cash to companies affected by the coronavirus pandemic. The Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan (CLBIL) scheme run by the government-owned British Business Bank allowed Greensill to make loans backed by an 80% taxpayer guarantee. Greensill was only supposed to lend a maximum of Â£50m to a single borrower or group of companies under the CLBIL scheme. But Greensill Capital lent Mr Gupta's GFG Alliance Â£350m by making seven taxpayer-backed loans of Â£50m to seven of his companies. Greensill also made an eighth loan of Â£50m to another company closely associated with Mr Gupta. The companies have all failed to make repayments on the taxpayer-backed loans. Greensill auditor under investigation by watchdog How metal tycoon Sanjeev Gupta built his empire The government guarantee has been suspended while the loans are investigated - but that is being challenged and the taxpayer could still lose Â£320m. Mr Gupta's company, GFG Alliance, and its financing arrangements with Greensill Capital, are now being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office. GFG Alliance said it takes the investigation seriously and that all allegations of improper conduct are denied in the strongest terms. The company said it has been working tirelessly to stabilise the businesses affected by the collapse of Greensill and deliver refinancing. GFG said: ""We remain fully committed to UK industry and to a solution that will enable GFG to repay creditors and create a sustainable future for its UK businesses."" Lex Greensill, the founder of Greensill Capital, said the government guarantee on the loans should not be withdrawn. ""Our access to any government-backed schemes with respect to funding our clients has always drawn upon robust advice from leading law firms to ensure Greensill complied with relevant rules,"" he said. Lex Greensill worked with Mr Cameron in Downing Street He also said he was not aware his staff had recommended sending in an insolvency practitioner to GFG. Mr Cameron's spokesman said he was not involved in lending decisions and had no knowledge of GFG's financial situation. ""He was a part-time adviser to the company - one of several - and had no Executive or Board responsibilities whatsoever,"" he said. ""He made the representations he did to the UK government not just because he thought it would benefit the company, but because he sincerely believed there would be a material benefit for UK businesses at a challenging time."" Panorama has also discovered how investors were misled about Greensill Capital's investments. Greensill made money through supply chain finance - which involves making loans to companies that are waiting for invoices to be paid by their customers. When the invoices were paid, the cash would be there to pay investors back, with interest. To fund the loans, it teamed up with Swiss bank Credit Suisse, which raised $10bn from investors. It was the Swiss bank's job to market and sell the Greensill investments, and to inform investors about potential risks. Investors thought their cash was safe, because it was supposed to be secured against the unpaid invoices. But this year it was revealed that some of the invoices simply did not exist. US court papers show how between 2018 and 2021, Greensill lent $850m of investors' cash to a US coal company called Bluestone Resources. Only $70m of that money was secured against real invoices for coal that Bluestone had actually sold. Investors did not know it, but the remaining $780m was only backed by predicted coal sales that may or may not happen in the future. Lex Greensill told Panorama that this type of financing was commonplace in the financial services industry. He said the predicted Bluestone business was all ""based upon future trade that is likely to occur with current customers"". Panorama discovered that was not true. The programme obtained the names of the companies that Lex Greensill said were current customers of Bluestone. Six of the companies said they were not Bluestone customers and they weren't planning to buy its coal in the future. Lex Greensill later told Panorama the coal buyers did not have to be current customers. Bluestone only had to state it expected to make the sales at some future point and Greensill was not obliged to make checks, he said. Mr Greensill denied misleading investors. He said his company made all the appropriate disclosures to Credit Suisse and the Swiss Bank was ""solely responsible for making any disclosures to their investors"". He said the loans were always secured against assets and personal guarantees, and were backed up by insurance that would pay 100% of any shortfall. Credit Suisse says its focus is on returning cash to investors and that 59% has been returned so far.

"London's Tower Bridge has reopened to traffic after becoming stuck for almost 12 hours. The famous crossingwas scheduled to lift on Monday,externalto allow a large wooden tall ship through, but it appeared to become jammed in place. City of London Police said the 127-year-old landmark was closed ""due to technical failure"". The bridge reopened to traffic at 01:45 BST on Tuesday. Drivers - and pedestrians - had previously been warned to avoid the area. City of London Police said the bridge had suffered a technical failure The crossing connects the Square Mile financial district to Southwark. Approach roads to the bridge were shut while repairs were carried out. The two sides of the crossing became stuck at about 14:30 BST on Monday. Transport for London (TfL) reported that traffic had been slow moving on both sides of the river during the afternoon. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"AI can identify patterns in brain scans even the most expert neurologists cannot see. Scientists are testing an artificial-intelligence system thought to be capable of diagnosing dementia after a single brain scan. It may also be able to predict whether the condition will remain stable for many years, slowly deteriorate or need immediate treatment. Currently, it can take several scans and tests to diagnose dementia. The researchers involved say earlier diagnoses with their system could greatly improve patient outcomes. ""If we intervene early, the treatments can kick in early and slow down the progression of the disease and at the same time avoid more damage,"" Prof Zoe Kourtzi, of Cambridge University and a fellow of national centre for AI and data science The Alan Turing Institute, said. ""And it's likely that symptoms occur much later in life or may never occur."" Prof Kourtzi's system compares brain scans of those worried they might have dementia with those of thousands of dementia patients and their relevant medical records. The algorithm can identify patterns in the scans even expert neurologists cannot see and match them to patient outcomes in its database. In pre-clinical tests, it has been able to diagnose dementia, years before symptoms develop, even when there is no obvious signs of damage on the brain scan. The trial, at Addenbrooke's Hospital and other memory clinics around the country, will test whether it works in a clinical setting, alongside conventional ways of diagnosing dementia. In the first year, about 500 patients are expected to participate. Their results will go to their doctors, who can, if necessary, advise on the course of treatment. Denis and Penelope Clark want to know how his condition will progress, so they can plan for their future Consultant neurologist Dr Tim Rittman, who is leading the study, with neuroscientists at Cambridge University, called the artificial-intelligence system a ""fantastic development"". ""These set of diseases are really devastating for people,"" he said. ""So when I am delivering this information to a patient, anything I can do to be more confident about the diagnosis, to give them more information about the likely progression of the disease to help them plan their lives is a great thing to be able to do."" Among the first to participate in the trial, Denis Clark, 75, retired from his job as an executive for a meat company five years ago. Last year, his wife, Penelope, noticed he was sometimes struggling with his memory. And they are now concerned he is developing dementia. Denis tries to describe his symptoms but Penelope interjects to say he finds it hard to explain what is happening. The couple are worried about having to sell their home to fund Denis's care. So Penelope is relieved they should not have to wait long for a diagnosis and an indication of how any dementia is likely to progress. Normally, Denis might need several brain scans to see whether he has dementia ""We could then plan financially,"" she said. ""We would know whether as a couple we could have a few holidays before things get so bad that I can't take Denis on holiday."" Another of Dr Rittman's patients, Mark Thompson, 57, who began having memory lapses 10 months ago, before the trial of the artificial-intelligence system began, said it would have made a big difference to him had it been available. ""I had test after test after test and at least four scans before I was diagnosed,"" he said. ""The medical team was marvellous and did everything they could to get to the bottom of what was wrong with me. ""But the uncertainty was causing me more... mental problems than any caused by the condition. ""Was it a tumour? Would they need to operate? It caused me so much stress not knowing what was wrong with me."" Follow Pallabon Twitter,external.

"Second-hand car sales in the UK have more than doubled in the last few months after a shortage of new models. Year on year, the used car market grew 108.6% in the second quarter, with more than 2.2 million vehicles changing hands, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said. The number of sales was up 6.6% on pre-pandemic levels in 2019. Petrol cars made up most of the sales, but demand for electric cars is growing fast. Increased demand led to a rise in sales of older used cars, with only 12.7% of all vehicles sold being made within the last three years, the lowest on record. Why the banger on your drive is suddenly worth a lot more The SMMT said the increase in sales tracked the country's easing of Covid restrictions, with demand rising as businesses reopened. Ford Fiestas, Vauxhall Corsas, Ford Focuses and Volkswagen Golfs were the most popular models, with black, silver, blue and grey being the most common colour choices. Marshall Motors, which is one of UK's top ten car dealerships, said on Tuesday that it had recorded revenue and underlying profit in the first half of the year. Chief executive Daksh Gupta said the company had ""seen exceptional market tailwinds in the used car market"" as a shortage of computer chips reduced the numbers of new cars on the market. ""Ultimately what that has done is push used car prices up significantly,"" he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. He added that it is ""difficult to call"" how long there would be such a high demand for used cars ""because the whole situation links to new car supply"". ""The position is unclear and many manufacturers are having to deal with very complex production challenges,"" he said. ""We expect this disruption to go well into 2022."" SMMT boss Mike Hawes said many consumers had turned to the second hand market due to the shortage of new cars at a time of ""increased need for personal mobility with people remaining wary of public transport as they return to work"". The shortage has been linked to a lack of parts. When lockdowns forced production lines to halt, microchip manufacturers diverted the chips that would normally go into new cars to the consumer electronics market, and supply is yet to fully recover. It has driven up the price of second hand cars, said the SMMT. One dealership, Nuneaton Cars, said buyers wereattempting to gazump each other to get hold of used cars already marked as sold. Sales of second- hand battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles more than tripled in the second quarter. However, electric vehicles made up just 1.3% of second-hand car sales in the second quarter of 2021. The SMMT said the used electric car market ""is not yet seeing the acceleration of uptake as has been seen in the new car market"". ""The scale of the challenge to transition the entire used car [fleet] away from traditional fuels remains significant,"" the industry body said. This comes amid a major UN scientific report that said human activity is changing the climate in unprecedented and sometimes irreversible ways. Despite this, Mr Hawes said the rebound in sales was ""welcome news"" due to a buoyant used car market being ""necessary to maintain strong residual values which, in turn, supports new car transactions"". ""We now need to see a similar rebound in new car sales to accelerate the fleet renewal necessary to deliver immediate and continuous improvements in air quality and carbon emissions,"" he said. New car registrations fell by almost a third last month, marking the worst July sales since 1998. Just 123,296 new cars were registered in the UK, a 29.5% decline on July 2020.
