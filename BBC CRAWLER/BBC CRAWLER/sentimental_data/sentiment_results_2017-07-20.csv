"Bennington spoke publicly about being abused as a child Linkin Park lead singer Chester Bennington has died aged 41, LA County Coroner says. The coroner said Bennington apparently hanged himself. His body was found at a private home in the county at 09:00 local time (17:00 GMT) on Thursday. Bennington was said to be close to Soundgarden vocalist Chris Cornell, whotook his own lifein May. Formed in 1996,Linkin Parkhave sold more than 70 million albums worldwide and won two Grammy Awards. The band had a string of hits including Faint, In The End and Crawling, and collaborated with the rapper Jay-Z. In pictures:  Rocker Chester Bennington remembered Chester Bennington: The music world reacts Linkin Park star's hurt made moving music Band member Mike Shinoda confirmed the news of Bennington's death The album Meteora topped the Billboard 200 chart in 2003 and is regarded as one of the biggest indie rock records of all time. The band had been due to begin a tour next week. For a generation growing up in the early 2000s, it would have been hard to find someone who didn't own a copy of the band's debut album Hybrid Theory. It's sold more than 30 million copies worldwide and remains one of the biggest selling albums released since the start of the millennium. Linkin Park's successful trick was to fuse elements of metal and rock with rap and hip-hop to shape the nu-metal genre on songs such as Crawling, In The End and Numb. Arguably their biggest asset was Chester's powerhouse voice. He had a huge, raspy vocal which suited their stadium-filling, singalong anthems. Whilst his vocal persona could be described as angry and harsh, in person he was warm, articulate and funny. The band's most recent album, One More Light, saw a different direction as they worked with prolific pop songwriters Julia Michaels and Justin Tranter - and collaborated with UK grime artist Stormzy. He leaves a wife, and six children from two marriages. The singer is said to have struggled for years with alcohol and drug abuse, and has talked in the past about contemplating suicide as a result of being a victim of abuse as a child.

"This video can not be played Four things OJ did in while in prison Former US football star and actor OJ Simpson has been granted parole after nine years in a Nevada prison. ""Thank you!"" said the 70-year-old, bowing his head as the board approved him for release in October. Simpson is serving time for armed robbery, assault with a deadly weapon and 10 other charges over a 2007 confrontation at a Las Vegas hotel. He was acquitted in 1995 of the murders a year earlier of ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman. OJ trials: Where are they now? Spectacular fall of 'The Juice' The former Hall of Fame running back was found guilty in 2008 of the botched Las Vegas robbery - exactly 13 years to the day after he was sensationally cleared in the so-called trial of the century. This video can not be played ""I've basically spent a conflict-free life,"" Simpson claimed at his parole hearing He and a group of five others stormed into a hotel room to confront two sports-memorabilia collectors and seize items that he claimed belonged to him from his career. The hour-long hearing for Prisoner 1027820 took place at the Lovelock Correctional Facility, a medium-security prison in the Nevada desert. Simpson told parole officials on Thursday the objects he took from the Las Vegas hotel room were later ruled by officials to legally belong to him. ""I've spent a conflict-free life,"" the prisoner said during the hour-long hearing. However, in 1989 Simpson admitted spousal abuse after police responded to a domestic violence call at his home. According to police records, his wife had run from the house screaming to officers: ""He's going to kill me!"" More than two decades after the murders, the slow-speed car chase through the streets of Los Angeles and his sensational acquittal, OJ Simpson still commands an audience. Television networks across the US interrupted their regular broadcasting to cut to the drab setting of the Lovelock Correctional Center in the high desert of Nevada. And there he was, now 70 years old and dressed in simple blue prison garb but still instantly recognisable - the man who was a sensation from the moment he burst on to the American football field. When he was asked by the parole board commissioners about how he would cope with media attention if he were to be released, the man they used to call The Juice laughed. It must have felt like they were asking him how he would cope with breathing the air. The families of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman are not laughing - and there is evidence that OJ Simpson's supporters are a shrinking band. The country was once divided, not least on racial lines, about the verdict in the ""trial of the century"" but a recent poll suggested that only 7% of Americans now believe the fallen star was not a killer. Simpson (C) appears to dab a tear during the testimony of Bruce Fromong On Thursday, Bruce Fromong, who was one of Simpson's victims in the robbery a decade ago, testified in favour of his release. ""I've known OJ for a long time,"" said Mr Fromong. ""I don't feel that he's a threat to anyone. ""He's a good man. It's time to give him a second chance."" Simpson appeared to dab a tear. The prisoner told the commissioners he had helped establish a Baptist prayer meeting in prison, adding: ""I could have been a better Christian."" This video can not be played Simpson: ""I did my time"" The prisoner also rejected suggestions he had an alcohol problem. ""I've done my time,"" he said. ""I've done it as well and as respectfully as anybody can. I think if you talk to the wardens they'll tell you. ""I've not complained for nine years. All I've done is try to be helpfulâ¦ and that's the life I've tried to live because I want to get back to my kids and family."" The Nevada Board of Parole Commissioners said it had received hundreds of letters for and against Simpson's parole. In 2013 the board granted him parole on some of his convictions, but not for the more violent charges. Nicole Brown Simpson and friend Ron Goldman were stabbed to death His daughter, Arnelle Simpson, choked up as she told the parole board: ""My experience with him is that he's like my best friend and my rock."" She added: ""He is remorseful, he truly is remorseful."" But Simpson's legal problems are likely to continue after he is released. An attorney for the family of Ron Goldman vowed to pursue him for due payment of damages. Simpson rejected the suggestion that he had an alcohol problem during the hearing Despite the 1995 not-guilty verdict, a civil court jury held Simpson liable for the deaths of his ex-wife and her friend, awarding $33.5m (Â£25.8m) to their families. Two years ago a court enlarged that judgment to about $58m, but it remains largely unpaid. Legal experts say the families could claim a portion of Simpson's future earnings, such as book deals or television appearances. However, under federal law Simpson's estimated $20,000 monthly pension from the National Football League is out of reach to creditors. Following his playing career, he appeared in television commercials before taking roles in movies like the comedy The Naked Gun.

"Gayle Newland was jailed for six-and-a-half years A woman who wore a prosthetic penis and tricked her blindfolded friend into sex has been jailed. Gayle Newland, 27, of Willaston, Cheshire, created an online persona pretending to be a man and continued the deceit for two years. A retrial juryfound her guiltyof committing three sexual assaults, which she denied, using a prosthetic penis without her victim's consent. She was jailed at Manchester Crown Court for six-and-a-half years. Sentencing her, Recorder of Manchester, Judge David Stockdale QC, said: ""Truth can sometimes be stranger than fiction. ""The truth, the whole truth, here is as surprising as it is profoundly disturbing."" He added: ""It is difficult to conceive of a deceit so degrading or so damaging for the victim upon its discovery."" Newland was originally jailed for eight years in November 2015 after she was convicted of the same offences, which happened in 2013. But the conviction was later quashed on the grounds the trial judge's summing up of the case was not fair and balanced. Newland created a fake Facebook profile when she was 15 years old During the retrial the victim, who gave evidence behind a curtain, told the court she was persuaded by the defendant to wear a blindfold at all times when they met. She said she only found out she was having sex with a woman - rather than a man - when she finally took off her mask. The victim told the court she thought she was having sex with Kye Fortune - a fake Facebook profile Newland originally created when she was 15 years old, using an American man's photographs and videos. She said: ""There was no point until the day I took the blindfold off that I thought for one second that a woman was the person behind this."" Newland denied concealing her gender and claimed both women were gay and struggling with their sexuality when they met and had sex, with her as Kye, during role-play. The defendant received concurrent terms of six years for three counts of sexual assault. She was jailed for an extra six months for defrauding her former employers - an internet advertising agency - of Â£9,000 by creating fake client profiles between March 2014 and September 2015. The court heard she had held a senior position at the firm, which paid bloggers to post content. Simon Medland QC, prosecuting, said Newland ""manipulated"" the firm's payments system in which contributors were rewarded with small sums for posting content. Judge Stockdale earlier lifted reporting restrictions on the fraud. The retrial jury was not told of the fraud conviction until it returned its verdicts.

"A midwife in Sweden who says she was so overworked she had no time to change her sanitary products has posted an image of her trousers, stained with menstrual blood, to highlight the pressures of her job. Petra Vinberg Linder uploaded the photo on July 14 on Facebook with the comment: ""Night shift midwife = had three childbirths. You don't have time to pee or change sanitary products.

"Former police officer Adrian Pogmore has admitted four charges of misconduct in a public office An ex-police officer who admitted misusing his force's helicopter to film people having sex hid his ""swinging and voyeurism"", a court has heard. Adrian Pogmore, 51, used the aircraft to film people sunbathing naked and a couple, who were his friends, having sex in their garden. Four other men all deny charges of misconduct in a public office. Giving evidence at Sheffield Crown Court, a former colleague said he did not know Pogmore was ""into voyeurism"". More stories from across Yorkshire Police officers Matthew Lucas, 42, and Lee Walls, 47, and helicopter pilots Matthew Loosemore, 45, and Malcolm Reeves, 64, are all on trial. Matthew Loosemore, Lee Walls and Malcolm Reeves deny misconduct in a public office Pogmore made four recordings from the aircraft between 2007 and 2012, including filming two naturists sitting outside a caravan on a campsite and his friends having sex, the court heard. The jury was told he knew the couple because they ""shared his sexual interest in the swinging scene"" and the pair had ""brazenly put on a show"" for the helicopter. When asked by Mr Loosemore's defence barrister, Neil Fitzgibbon, if he believed it was appropriate for someone ""into swinging and voyeurism"" to operate a Â£1.5m police helicopter camera, ex-colleague PC Tim Smales replied: ""certainly not"". PC Smales agreed with Mr Fitzgibbon when asked: ""It would be fair to say Mr Pogmore kept his swinging and/or voyeurism a secret?"" He replied: ""Certainly from me, yes."" The officer told the jury he would have reported it if he knew Pogmore was ""into voyeurism and swinging"" and that he worked with him for a number of years before Pogmore was dismissed from South Yorkshire Police. Matthew Lucas denies three counts Prosecutors had described Pogmore as ""a swinging and sex-obsessed air observer"", while the jury was told the other four men blamed him for the recordings. The court heard how the footage was found among Pogmore's property at a police station, and he was the only defendant present during all four incidents. Pogmore, of Guilthwaite Crescent, Whiston, Rotherham, has admitted four charges of misconduct in a public office. Mr Reeves, of Farfield Avenue, Knaresborough, North Yorkshire, denies two counts of the same charge. Mr Walls, of Southlands Way, Aston, Sheffield, denies one count. Mr Loosemore, of Briar Close, Auckley, Doncaster, denies one count. Mr Lucas, of Coppice Rise, Chapeltown, Sheffield, denies three counts. The trial continues.

"Xanda was reportedly shot on a trophy hunt Two years after Cecil the lion was killed by a trophy-hunter in Zimbabwe, prompting global outrage, his son has met a similar sad end. Xanda, a six-year-old lion with several young cubs, was shot dead on 7 July. He was killed just outside the Hwange National Park in northern Zimbabwe, close to where his father died. The lion had been fitted with an electronic tracking collar by Oxford University's Wildlife Conservation Research Unit (WildCRU). Dr Loveridge, a Senior Research Fellow with Oxford's Department of Zoology, secured the collar last October. ""Xanda was one of these gorgeous Kalahari lions, with a big mane, big body, beautiful condition - a very, very lovely animal. Personally, I think it is sad that anyone wants to shoot a lion, but there are people who will pay money to do that,"" he said. The Oxford team are calling for a wider 5km (three-mile) ""no-hunting zone"" around the National Park. Sad inheritance: The much-loved Zimbabwean lion Cecil was killed in 2015 The BBC's Africa Correspondent, Andrew Harding, reports that at the age of six, Xanda was old enough to be legally targeted by big game hunters. These individuals, many from the US, UK and South Africa, pay tens of thousands of pounds for the deadly pursuit - thereby funding the staff who protect other wildlife. It is not yet clear who shot Xanda. A professional hunter is said to have reported the death to the authorities and returned the lion's collar. Lion kills girl of 10 as she goes to toilet When is hunting not poaching? How the internet descended on the man who killed Cecil the lion The killing comes two years after dentist Walter James Palmer, from Minnesota in the US, sparked an international outcry by killing Cecil, a 13-year-old lion who was a major tourist attraction in the area. His home and dentistry practice were targeted by protesters after his identity surfaced in the press. Protesters left stuffed animals at Walter Palmer's dental practice after it emerged he had shot Cecil At the time it was reported that the lion had been shot with a bow and arrow and did not die immediately. He was followed for more than 40 hours before being shot with a rifle. Mr Palmer was believed to have paid $50,000 (Â£32,000) to hunt a lion in Zimbabwe's largest game reserve.

"David Davis, left, and Michel Barnier The UK and EU are still at odds over citizens' rights and the amount the UK will pay to leave the bloc, at the end of the second week of Brexit talks. EU negotiator Michel Barnier said the UK had not been clear enough about where it stands on these issues and that was hampering progress. UK Brexit Secretary David Davis said the negotiations on the so-called divorce bill had been ""robust"". He said progress had been made but both sides needed to show ""flexibility"". Brexit: All you need to know The people who will negotiate Brexit Katya Adler: The EU negotiator Mr Barnier said: ""We require this clarification on the financial settlement, on citizens' rights, on Ireland - with the two key points of the common travel area and the Good Friday Agreement - and the other separation issues where this week's experience has quite simply shown we make better progress where our respective positions are clear."" Mr Davis said: ""We have had robust but constructive talks this week. Clearly there's a lot left to talk about and further work before we can resolve this. Ultimately, getting to a solution will require flexibility from both sides."" This video can not be played The EU Brexit negotiator calls for legal certainty' over citizens' rights Michel Barnier said there had been some areas of agreement about how Britons living abroad and EU nationals living in the UK should be treated after Brexit. Ajointly agreed ""technical note"" outlining the UK and EU's positions on citizens' rights,externalhas been published. But there was disagreement over ""the rights of future family members"" - meaning children born in the future to EU citizens in the UK - and ""the exports of certain social benefits"". The EU wants rights currently enjoyed by EU citizens in the UK - access to healthcare, welfare, education - to apply to children and family members, whether they currently live in the UK or not, and to continue in perpetuity, after the death or divorce of the rights-holder. But it says children born to UK citizens in EU states after the withdrawal date would be considered ""family members"", not rights holders themselves - the UK says it would allow children born to EU citizens to acquire the same ""settled status"" or, in some cases, British citizenship. The UK wants to give all EU nationals living in the UK the same rights as British citizens once they have been resident in the country for five years, as long as they arrived before a specified ""cut-off"" date, probably 29 March 2017, when Article 50 was triggered. After this date, they could continue to build up their five years' entitlement if necessary. The EU's position also requires that citizens live in a host country for five years before acquiring permanent residency rights. In addition, EU nationals who get married after March 2019 would lose the right to bring family members to the UK, unless they pass an income test, like non-EU migrants. They could also risk losing their right to return to Britain if they leave for more than two years - as would be the case for British citizens in EU countries. The UK says it is prepared to offer some flexibility on this for some citizens on overseas postings or studying abroad and wants the EU to offer the same. David Davis said the UK hadpublished its approach to citizens' rights,externalsince the first round of negotiations, which he described as ""both a fair and serious offer"" and had now published a joint paper setting out areas of agreement, and issues for further talks. He said sticking points in the talks included the rights of employees of EU-based companies to work for extended periods in other countries, such as the UK. British officials highlighted that British expats would lose the rights to vote and stand in local elections under the EU plan - while the UK position is to protect the rights of citizens to vote and stand in elections in their host country. EU negotiators have said that British people living in an EU country would lose their guaranteed rights if they moved to another EU country. A senior EU source said there was a willingness to be flexible on this point during the negotiations, depending on the UK's position in the next set of talks. Senior British sources called the proposal ""unprecedented"" as it would leave British expats with worse rights than those coming from outside the EU and it would be ""interesting"" to see what the public reaction would be to it. David Davis and Michel Barnier stood at matching podiums in Brussels, side by side but not entirely in step. Mr Davis talked breezily about work done constructively and ""at pace"" and even injected a slightly bantering note into proceedings, quoting back to Mr Barnier his own earlier warning line that ""the clock is ticking"". Mr Barnier's take appeared to be slightly less positive and was much more focused on the need for further clarification from the UK side on a whole range of issues - we counted him using the word clarification or variations on it at least eight times in a relatively short news conference. There are plenty of briefings around on points of detail - would the UK for example have the right to conduct blanket criminal record checks on EU citizens applying for residence in post-Brexit UK. But the big stumbling blocks are obvious and have been obvious for a while. One is the ""divorce bill"" - when will a figure emerge into the public domain and what might the UK be prepared to pay. The other is the future role of the European Court of Justice in overseeing the rights of EU citizens who remain in the UK - the EU sees that as a basic right but from the British perspective it's being seen as ""a very big ask"". This video can not be played David Davis said he was 'encouraged by progress' in Brexit talks Britain has agreed in principle to meet its financial obligations as it leaves the EU, to cover things like the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and the pensions of EU officials. But a senior EU source said the UK negotiating team had not said what they might be prepared to pay - and there had been no ""serious discussions"" about what the bill might include. David Davis said: ""We both recognise the importance of sorting out the obligations we have to one another, both legally and in a spirit of mutual cooperation."" But Michel Barnier has called for ""clarification"" on where the UK stands. UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has said the EU can ""go whistle"" if it demands an ""extortionate"" payment but other ministers have struck a more conciliatory tone. Sources have suggested to the BBC the bill could be between 30 and 50 billion euros. Downing Street said the UK was ""looking at the legal commitments"" it faces, adding: ""There are points of difference and that's one of them."" But there were no plans to produce a position paper on the divorce bill, the No 10 spokesman said. David Davis rejected the suggestion that there was a lack of clarity from his team on Northern Ireland, saying the two sides had discussed ways of ""achieving a flexible and imaginative solution to address the unique circumstances around the border"" and preserve the common travel area. A senior EU source said they were still waiting for concrete proposals from the UK side on the kind of border that is achievable.

The ECJ settles disputes between member states about the free movement of workers and other cross-border issues. UK Prime Minister Theresa May has said the UK will be leaving its jurisdiction. The UK has floated the idea of a new international body, made up of British and EU judges, or, according to UK officials, ""some kind of ombudsman"", to settle disputes, but the EU is rejecting this out of hand. There can't be any agreement on citizens' rights until this one is settled, EU sources say. Read more:Reality check: What is the European Court of Justice? The UK wants to carry out criminal record checks on all EU citizens who want to live in the UK. The EU says they should only be carried out where there is a suspicion of wrongdoing. This will be looked at in more detail during the August talks. On a trade deal, David Davis said the UK could not accept a ""punishment"" deal, but added: ""Nobody expects a punishment deal. Michel and I are going for a good deal."" Gibraltar did not come up as an issue in the current round of talks, sources say. Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the ""lack of progress"" on issues such as the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in Europe was ""deeply concerning"" and would cause ""anxiety for millions of families"". He questioned whether phase two of the talks could get under way in October as planned, something that would ""trigger deep concern for businesses and communities across the UK"". ""The reality is that we have a government that is unprepared, divided and incapable of securing a good deal for Britain. We urgently need a fresh approach,"" he added. The EU has said talks won't move on to the subject of future trading arrangements until it judges there's been adequate progress on the separation issues. The two sides are meeting for four days each month, with this week's talks aimed at scoping out points of difference and common ground in those areas that have been identified as requiring urgent attention. Mr Barnier has said the EU side are hoping to agree the basic terms of a deal on EU citizens and the exit bill in October - which he says would open the way for talks on the UK's future trade relations with the EU to begin in December. Meanwhile, the UK government has announced that MPs are set to debate the repeal bill - a key piece of Brexit legislation that will transform EU laws into British laws - for two days from 7 September.

"A Canadian pensioner built a set of stairs at his local park for just C$550 when the city estimated it would cost at least C$65,000 ($51,500, Â£40,000). But instead of a thank you, Toronto has blocked off access to the steps and asked Adi Astl, 73, to take them down. Before the stairs were installed, Mr Astl said a few people had fallen down the steep muddy embankment to the park. Mr Astl said he took matters into his own hands after his local councillor told him about the city's price tag. ""To me, the safety of people is more important than money,"" Mr Astl toldCTV News,external. ""So if the city is not willing to do it, I have to do it myself."" He said the whole project took him and his neighbours about 14 hours. Mr Astl's councillor, Justin Di Ciano, said the official estimate, which the city said could go from $65,000 to $150,000, was outlandish. ""With $150,000 you can put up half a house,"" Mr Di Cianotold GlobalNews,external. The muddy embankment before the stairs were built Toronto Mayor John Tory agreed the price estimate was overblown, but said it just won't do for private citizens to ""go out to Home Depot and build a staircase in a park because that is what they would like to have"". City staff say they are re-assessing the estimate, which was based on a staircase built at another park. ""Red tape"" stops school nurses from doing their jobs Resident Dana Beamon told CTV News she is thankful for Mr Astl's staircase. ""We have far too much bureaucracy,"" she said.

"The boys drove for three miles down the windy, curvy road Two brothers aged five and two stole their mother's car and wrecked it on a drive to their grandfather's house, say authorities in West Virginia. Putnam County Sheriff deputies believe the toddlers probably teamed up to work the pedals and steer the wheel before crashing it in a ditch. The pair made it three miles (4.8km) down the road and successfully navigated multiple turns. They were not hurt but officials are weighing charges against the mother. They had taken their mother's 2005 Ford Focus after finding the keys in the floor mat while playing in the front yard. Officials believe they were trying to reach their grandfather's farm but crashed five miles short in the town of Red House. ""Luckily, they didn't pass anybody because they would've probably had a wreck before then,"" said Putnam County Sheriff Steve Deweese.

"The forced migration of UK children overseas was a bigger sex abuse scandal than that of Jimmy Savile, ex-prime minister Gordon Brown has said. Mr Brown told the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse that the 2,000 surviving British child migrants who suffered abuse should be compensated. He said the mass transportation of 130,000 British children overseas was ""government-enforced trafficking"". Across 50 years, the children were sent to ex-colonies such as Australia. The transportation programme began in the 1920s, partly to ease the population of the UK's orphanages in the years after the First World War, and to give ""lost"" children the chance of a new life in Britain's colonies. But children continued to be be sent abroad until 1974. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse in England and Wales has already heard that many child migrants experienced ""unacceptable depravity"", with some having been sent abroad without the consent of parents and wrongly told they were orphans. In 2009, the Australian government apologised for the cruelty shown to the child migrants and in 2010 Mr Brown, in his role as UK prime minister, issued an apology to victims on behalf of the UK. The abuse scandal of the British children sent abroad How will the inquiry work? The experiences of the children sent away from the UK are being looked at as part of the first phase of the wide-ranging inquiry into child abuse. Mr Brown told the inquiry that the forced migration of British children was ""probably the biggest national sex abuse scandal"". ""Bigger than what people have alleged about Savile,"" he said. ""Bigger than what people have alleged about individual children's homes. ""Bigger in scale, bigger in geographical spread, and bigger in the length of time that went on undetected. ""I'm shocked about the information that I have seen."" The inquiry into historical child sex abuse in England and Wales is to examine claims made against local authorities, religious organisations, the armed forces and public and private institutions Momentum for the inquiry started with the Jimmy Savile scandal The inquiry is expected to take about five years to complete The first phase of the inquiry will consist of 13 separate investigations The child sexual abuse inquiry so far Mr Brown said a government minister should explain to the inquiry why nothing has been done over ""sickening"" new evidence of abuse which has come to light since his 2010 apology. He said he had become aware of so many historical cases he described as ""grave, horrifying and sickening"" and said there had been a ""violation of human rights"". ""Children were denied a childhood, an identity, a family and any sense of belonging,"" he said. ""Many, some as young as three - and this was happening as recently as the 1970s - were sent abroad having been falsely told their parents were dead."" He said successive governments had failed in a duty of care. ""Because we failed in our duty of care it is now time to compensate the 2,000 child migrants still alive,"" he said. Mr Brown added: ""My apology seven years ago was for the gross inhumane violation of rights by forcibly removing children, depriving them of identity, family and any sense of belonging. ""An unknown but clearly large number of these children were subjected to horrific assaults sometimes before, sometimes during but in the main after they left the UK. ""Because successive governments failed in what I call their duty of care, these 2,000 surviving migrants all need and deserve redress."" Mr Brown told the inquiry that 1,000 families had been reunited since 2010. Another former prime minister, Sir John Major, did not appear in person but provided a written statement to the inquiry which said his government took the approach that mistreatment of British children sent abroad was primarily a matter for the country concerned.

"The white bag still carries traces of Moon dust and small rock A bag used by US astronaut Neil Armstrong to collect the first ever samples of the Moon has sold at auction in New York for $1.8m (Â£1.4m). The outer decontamination bag from the Apollo 11 mission in 1969 was bought at Sotheby's by an anonymous bidder. The white bag still carries traces of Moon dust and small rocks. The auction comes after a legal battle over the ownership of the only artefact from the Apollo 11 mission which was in private hands. After the spacecraft returned to Earth, nearly all the equipment was sent to the Smithsonian museums. However, the bag was left in a box at the Johnson Space Center because of an inventory error. It was then misidentified during a government auction, selling for just $995 to a lawyer from Illinois in 2015. Nasa later tried to get the bag back, but earlier this year a federal judge ruled that it legally belonged to the buyer, who then offered it for sale at Sotheby's.

"Bennington's friends have been responding to his unexpected death on social media The angst-ridden vocals of Linkin Park frontman Chester Bennington, who died aged 41 on Thursday, helped lead the group to global critical acclaim. The frontman's brooding charisma - added to the group's blend of rap, metal and electronic music - spawned a string of chart-topping hits. The son of a police officer in Phoenix, Arizona, Bennington was born on 20 March 1976 and had a troubled youth. After years of intense drug use, he got sober and joined Linkin Park in 1998. ""Growing up, for me, was very scary and very lonely,"" he told Metal Hammer magazine in 2014. ""I started getting molested when I was about seven or eight,"" he said, describing the abuser as an older friend. ""I was getting beaten up and being forced to do things I didn't want to do. ""It destroyed my self-confidence. Like most people, I was too afraid to say anything. ""I didn't want people to think I was gay or that I was lying. It was a horrible experience,"" hetold the magazine,external. His parents divorced when he was 11 years old, and he went to live with his father, whom he described as ""not emotionally very stable then"", adding that ""there was no-one I could turn to"". The singer quit hard drugs after a gang broke into a property where the future star was getting high and pistol-whipped some of his friends. Bennington moved to Los Angeles and successfully auditioned to join Linkin Park. In pictures: Rocker Chester Bennington remembered Music world reacts to Bennington's death Later in the 2000s, as the band's success took off, he again began using drugs before returning to sobriety, telling Spin Magazine in 2009: ""It's not cool to be an alcoholic. ""It's not cool to go drink and be a dumbass. ""It's cool to be a part of recovery. ""Most of my work has been a reflection of what I've been going through in one way or another,"" he added. Linkin Park was formed in 1996 and the band's 2000 debut album, Hybrid Theory, surfed the popular wave of nu-metal,Rolling Stone magazine writes,external. It eventually sold more than 30 million albums and became one of the top-selling albums since the start of this millennium. The band has sold 70 million albums worldwide and won two Grammy Awards. Linkin Park had a string of hits including Faint, In The End and Crawling, and collaborated with rapper Jay-Z. Their latest music video for the songTalking to Myself,externalwas released on Thursday, on the same day of the artist's death. Bennington was said to be close to Sound Garden's Chris Cornell, who took his own life in May 2017. Bennington sang at the funeral for Cornell, who would have turned 53 on Thursday. In addition to working with Linkin Park, he also sang for Stone Temple Pilots, for his side project Dead by Sunrise, and Kings of Chaos. Bennington leaves six children from two different marriages.

"US President Donald Trump gave a wide-ranging interview to the New York Times, in which he criticised his attorney general, Jeff Sessions. But there was plenty more he said of interest. So what else came up? ""It [the Bastille Day parade in Paris] was one of the most beautiful parades I have ever seen. And in fact, we should do one one day down Pennsylvania Ave."" The US president clearly enjoyed the pomp and military might on display in Paris. He had wanted tanks and armaments to play a part in his inauguration parade in January,emails revealed,external, but defence chiefs were opposed. TRUMP:He's a great guy. Smart. Strong. Loves holding my hand. NY TIMES:I've noticed. TRUMP:People don't realise he loves holding my hand. And that's good, as far as that goes. This video can not be played The US president and his French counterpart shared a handshake that seemed like it would never end ""The Russians have great fighters in the cold. They use the cold to their advantage. I mean, they've won five wars where the armies that went against them froze to death. [crosstalk] It's pretty amazing."" As historian Andrew Roberts once wrote: ""The Russians have a saying that there is no such thing as cold weather, only the wrong clothing."" Roberts said Hitler refused to believe the weather forecasts. Like Napoleon Bonaparte before him, Hitler's Russian ambitions ended in disaster. ""Well, Napoleon finished a little bit bad. But I asked that. So I asked the president, so what about Napoleon? He said: 'No, no, no. What he did was incredible. He designed Paris.' [garbled] The street grid, the way they work, you know, the spokes. He did so many things even beyond. And his one problem is he didn't go to Russia that night because he had extracurricular activities, and they froze to death. How many times has Russia been saved by the weather?"" Louis-Napoleon, nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte, began the rebuilding of Paris in 1848, based on his own love of London. But it was as Napoleon III he later commissioned the major renovation of the city, carried out by Georges-Eugene Haussman. ""What Jeff Sessions did was he recused himself right after, right after he became attorney general. And I said, ""Why didn't you tell me this before?"" I would have - then I said, ""Who's your deputy?"" So his deputy he hardly knew, and that's Rosenstein, Rod Rosenstein, who is from Baltimore. There are very few Republicans in Baltimore, if any. So, he's from Baltimore."" It turns out that Mr Rosenstein is not from Baltimore but from Philadelphia, and he was appointed a US attorney by a Republican. ""We had dinner at the Eiffel Tower, and the bottom of the Eiffel Tower looked like they could have never had a bigger celebration ever in the history of the Eiffel Tower. I mean, there were thousands and thousands of people, 'cause they heard we were having dinner."" TRUMP:I was seated next to the wife of Prime Minister Abe [Shinzo Abe of Japan], who I think is a terrific guy, and she's a terrific woman, but doesn't speak English. NY TIMES:Like, nothing, right? Like zero? TRUMP:Like, not ""hello."" It later emerged that perhaps Japanese First Lady Akie Abedoes speak English,external, so there are questions why the confusion arose - and whether she chose not to. The BBC's Mariko Oi in Tokyo said that her team has told the BBC in the past they would only accept interviews in Japanese. And while we're on language skills... President Trump's eight-year-old granddaughter entered the room during the interview and showed off her Mandarin. Why didn't Japan's First Lady speak to Trump? ""I mean, you think of Hillary Clinton, and you look, she went eight years - very capable - went eight years as the first lady, and could not get healthcare. So this is not an easy crack."" Strange as it sounds, the president is correct that Mrs Clinton was given the task of heading reforms to healthcare but the push floundered. TRUMP:So anyway, in my opinion, he shared it so that I would think he had it out there. NY TIMES:As leverage? TRUMP:Yeah, I think so. In retrospect. In retrospect. The president is referring to a conversation ex-FBI director James Comey had with Mr Trump, warning him about the existence of memos that contain unsubstantiated claims that Russian security officials have compromising material on him. Mr Comey told Congress he thought it was only fair to let the president know. Trump's 'Russian dossier' â what we know and what we don't ""Do you know what happened with Merkel? So I am sitting in the chair. We'd been sitting there for two hours. So it's not like, 'Nice to see ya.' So the press comes in. So I guess someone screamed out, ""Shake her hand, shake her hand!"" I didn't even hear. So I didn't shake her hand, because I'd been with her for so long. I'd been with her for a long period of time."" This video can not be played Merkel handshake offer to Trump falls on deaf ears Read transcripts of the interview at the New York Times,external Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington When it comes to wide-ranging media interviews, Donald Trump is like a top. You never know which direction he will head once you give him a spin. There was a little bit of everything in the New York Times sit-down. Some amateur historian chatter? Sure. How about a mysterious ""$12 a year"" health insurance plan that is somehow is linked to the ongoing Senate Obamacare repeal negotiations? Yep! Or an extended riff on the loving nature of handshakes with French President Emmanuel Macron? Uhh, OK. Mr Trump's occasionally bizarre soliloquies have been explained away as a quirk of a wandering mind, but they may end up being a feature for the president, not a bug. Like playing football on the side of a hill, every time the Times reporters thought they were about to score a goal on the president, the ball rolled off to one side or the other. Times reporter Peter Baker twice asked the president what he thought of his oldest son being told, via email, that the Russian government wanted to help his campaign, and both times Mr Trump veered wildly off course. He talked about Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state and Barack Obama's Syria policy; ""illegal acts"" by the Democratic National Committee and why former FBI Director James Comey didn't just say he retired instead of admitting that Mr Trump fired him. If there was any sort of answer to the question of why Russia might want to help him and why Donald Trump Jr was so eager to learn more, it was buried in an avalanche of verbiage.

"This video can not be played Canada's Governor General lightly touched the Queen on the elbow as she descended a flight of steps Canada's governor general has been forced to defend his actions after a ""slippy"" carpet led to a breach of royal etiquette with the Queen. But how do you avoid a protocol slip-up? David Johnston raised eyebrows on Wednesday as he was seen to belightly touching Her Majesty's elbowas she descended some steps, at an event in London. Mr Johnston said he was simply concerned about the Queen's safety and made the judgement that a breach of protocol was appropriate ""to be sure that there was no stumble"". To avoid any future mishaps, however, here is a reminder of the traditional dos and don'ts. The Royal Family's dress code uncovered Why are there rules for meeting the Queen? Prime minister Theresa May performs a curtsey as she greets the Queen Curtsey or bow (the head only) - although you can also shake hands or do a combination of the two as demonstrated by Theresa May (above). Use the right greetings. On presentation to the Queen, the correct address is Your Majesty and subsequently Ma'am, pronounced like jam. Be early. Guests should arrive before a royal. Take the Queen's lead. Don't talk unless spoken to, sit until she sits or begin eating until she does. Form semi-circles. If you are presented to Her Majesty at a Royal event it is likely you will be marshalled into position in a series of semi-circles rather than straight lines. Guests should try to be empty-handed, Debrett's adds. In 2009, traditional protocol was breached when the Queen and Michelle Obama were spotted with their arms around each other Touch Her Majesty. Only shake her hand if she offers it. In 2000, John Howard appeared to have put his arm around the Queen, as did US First Lady Michelle Obama in 2009. Expect the Queen to start the conversation with you if you are sitting on her left during a meal. As etiquette experts Debrett's states, it is customary for the guest of honour to sit to the right of the Queen and the convention is that she speaks to this person during the first course of the dinner, then switches attention to the person on her left for the following course. Formula 1 star Lewis Hamilton, who was sat to her left at one function, didn't know this and tried to speak to Her Majesty but was politely told: ""No, you speak that way first and I'll speak this way and then I'll come back to you."" Actor Tom Hiddleston gave the Duchess of Cornwall friendly shoulder squeeze when they met during a Radio 2 broadcast last year Leave before the Queen. Debrett's states guests should never leave an event before the royal personage unless permission has been granted through a private secretary. Turn your back on Her Majesty - it is considered rude. Take pictures when you are visiting her at home. She may be one of the most photographed women in the world, but unofficial photography is not permitted in royal palaces. In 2015, guests in Germany were advisednot to take selfies. Ask personal questions. Small-talk should be as far as you go. Get carried away. You may be nervous, but alcohol is not your friend as Debrett's reminds guests in times of ""overexcitement or nervousness"". These rules aren't steadfast and those in breach need not fear exile. The official website for the British Monarchy states ""there are no obligatory codes of behaviour when meeting the Queen or a member of the Royal Family"".  It hastens to add: ""Many people wish to observe the traditional forms."" The choice is yours.

"Sir Vince Cable has been crowned leader of the Liberal Democrats without a contest - this is the story of how he got there. He is one of the most recognisable faces in British politics: a former minister in the coalition government, a ballroom dancing enthusiast who did Strictly before Ed Balls, a financial guru noted for predicting the economic crash and now, at the age of 74, the leader of what used to be known as the third force in British politics. As someone who was a leading player during the coalition years, and who paid the price for it by losing his Commons seat in 2015, he will know better than anybody the scale of the task facing him. The Lib Dems have just 12 MPs. Sir Vince has conceded that the party's decision to campaign hard for a second referendum on the terms of the Brexit deal did not ""cut through"" at the general election. But he believes the party's time will come again, when it begins to dawn on the public that leaving the EU is a terrible mistake and has harmed the economy. He aims to lead the charge in Parliament against what he sees as Theresa May's reckless pursuit of a ""hard Brexit,"" joining forces with Remainer Tories to frustrate the passage of key pieces of legislation. His mild manner - impressionists have compared his voice to that of the soft-hearted prison officer Mr Barrowclough in the 70s sitcom Porridge - masks a shrewd and steely operator, with a knack for generating publicity. Even before easing into the seat vacated when Tim Farron felt compelled to resign as leader, he was grabbing column inches and stirring up social media controversy,telling the BBC's Andrew Marrshow he thought Brexit might never happen. It was this tendency to speak his mind, with one eye on the headlines, that drove some of his Conservative coalition colleagues to distraction during his years in government. At times, Sir Vince, or plain old Mr Cable as he was known then, gave the impression of a man being held captive by enemy forces. He baffled Tory MPs withhis first Lib Dem conference speech as business secretary, in which he attacked capitalism, accusing it of killing competition. He branded the Conservative stance on immigration ""nasty"" and ""ugly"" and fought a long-running battle with then Home Secretary Theresa May over immigration curbs on students and non-EU workers, which he believed would be disastrous for the UK economy. But it was comments he never meant to be heard publicly that landed him in the most trouble, when in December 2010 he told undercover reporters he could bring down the coalition at any point by walking out - and how he had to ""battle"" to curb Tory excesses and promote his own party's agenda. He called the coalition's attempts to push through changes in the health service, local government and other areas a ""kind of Maoist revolution"", which was ""in danger of getting out of control"". Most damagingly, he told the undercover Daily Telegraph reporters he had ""declared war on Rupert Murdoch"" and planned to block the media baron's efforts to take full control of BSkyB. The remarks led to him being stripped of his powers to make a decision on the BSkyB bid - and were criticised by Downing Street as ""totally unacceptable and inappropriate"". But the fact that he remained business secretary may have proved his point about being unsackable. Date of birth:9 May 1943 Education:Grammar school, Cambridge university Family:Father of three grown-up children by his first wife, Olympia, who died in 2001. Remarried in 2004. Eldest grandson, Ayrton Cable, launched the Humanitarian Water and Food Youth Award at the age of 11, in front of 12,000 young people at Wembley Job before politics:Economist, lecturer and adviser to the Kenyan government and senior Labour politicians. Chief economist at oil giant Shell. Political career:A Labour councillor in Glasgow in the 1970s, who joined the SDP in 1982 and then won his Twickenham seat for the Lib Dems at the second attempt in 1997. Stood in as Lib Dem leader when Sir Menzies Campbell quit in 2007, was business secretary in the coalition government between 2010 and 2015, before losing his seat. Returned to the Commons in June. Knighted in 2015. Off duty:Ballroom dancing and writing - he is about to publish his first novel, a political thriller about a post-Brexit future called Open Arms. Sir Vince was a contemporary of Ken Clarke, Michael Howard and Norman Lamont - some of the Tory ""big beasts"" of the 1990s - while at Cambridge University. But he did not follow them on the fast track to Parliament. A grammar school boy from York, he initially joined the Liberal Party but, after university, defected to Labour. He fought for the Glasgow Hillhead seat at the 1970 election, losing. As a Labour councillor in Glasgow he contributed to The Red Paper on Scotland, edited by Gordon Brown in 1975. In 1982, Sir Vince changed party once more, this time opting for the newly formed Social Democratic Party. He made failed attempts to run for Parliament in 1983 and 1987. After the SDP and the old Liberal Party merged to form the Liberal Democrats in 1988, Sir Vince was unsuccessful in another bid to become an MP in 1992. It was not until the anti-Tory landslide of 1997 that he finally won the seat of Twickenham, south-west London. Along the way, he worked as an economics lecturer, at the Foreign Office, as a special adviser to future Labour leader John Smith, an official in the Kenyan government and as chief economist for the oil company Shell. Once in Parliament, his political career went comparatively smoothly, with promotion to the Lib Dem front bench in 1999 and to Treasury spokesman in 2003. In this influential role he made pronouncements on the unsustainability of Labour's long economic boom - comments which saw his reputation rise following the arrival of the credit crunch. He was also one of the first senior politicians to call for Northern Rock to be nationalised. Sir Vince helped to oust Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy in 2005, but it was after Mr Kennedy's successor, Sir Menzies Campbell, resigned after two years in the job, that Sir Vince became a household name. Having been elected deputy leader, he stood in at prime minister's questions and in a memorable exchange mocked Gordon Brown, remarking on the then prime minister's ""remarkable transformation in the last few weeks from Stalin to Mr Bean, creating chaos out of order rather than order out of chaos"". Laughter rang around the Commons chamber and a man previously seen as a rather dry figure was instantly transformed into a budding media star. By the 2010 election he was a familiar face on the nation's TV screens, cultivating a reputation as one of the few front-ranking politicians who had warned about the looming financial crisis in 2008. When David Cameron failed to win an overall majority, there were suggestions he might become chancellor under the Tory-Lib Dem government that emerged from coalition talks. However, the job went to George Osborne and Sir Vince was given the business brief - in charge of a department he had previously suggested should be abolished. Sir Vince's most controversial task was to oversee the rise in university tuition fees to a maximum of Â£9,000 a year. This came despite the Lib Dems signing a pre-election pledge to oppose any such move, which made him and party leader Nick Clegg the focus of much anger. Sir Vince voiced doubt about whether he should back the plans in Parliament. Eventually he and all his Lib Dem ministerial colleagues did so, in the face of a large rebellion by the party's backbench MPs. The Lib Dems have still not recovered from the reputational hit they took over tuition fees, although Sir Vince continues to defend the policy to this day,telling Sky News earlier this month,externalthat scrapping fees would be a ""cheap populist gesture"" that would create an unfair system, adding that the ""40% of students"" who go to university should not be subsidised by the ""60% who don't"" He also oversaw the controversial privatisation of the Royal Mail, which was criticised by the National Audit Office as being sold off too quickly and cheaply, after shares soared 70% above their original price. Sir Vinceinsisted the sale had delivered ""value for money""for taxpayers. His political career appeared to have come to an end in 2015, when he was ejected from Parliament by the voters of Twickenham. Never one to rest on his laurels, he threw himself into his hobby of ballroom dancing - in 2010 he had taken part in the BBC's Strictly Come Dancing Christmas special - entering the British National Dance Championships, after taking lessons at the dance studio of his Strictly dance partner Erin Boag. He also started work on a novel, after previously hitting the best seller lists with The Storm, an explanation of the 2008 world financial crash and how Britain should respond to it. Sir Vince is the father of three grown-up children by his first wife, Olympia, who was from Kenya. It was a mixed-race marriage, which saw Sir Vince defying his father, who told him such unions ""didn't work"". After Olympia was diagnosed with cancer for a second time in the 1990s, he combined the roles of being an MP and her carer until her death in 2001. Sir Vince remarried in 2004, to Rachel Smith, a farmer from the New Forest who had been at Cambridge with him. He wears the wedding rings from both of his marriages. He won back his Twickenham seat in June's snap election and when Tim Farron unexpectedly announced he was quitting as Lib Dem leader, saying he could not reconcile the role with his Christian faith, Sir Vince decided to stand for a job he had long coveted. When potential rivals ruled themselves out, it became clear that he would be crowned leader without a contest. Sir Vince has brushed off concerns about his age by referring to Sir Winston Churchill, who led his party in his late 70s, and William Gladstone, who was prime minister in his 80s. ""Some of the brightest and most interesting people in British politics recently have been relatively old,"" he said when quizzed about it. ""You remember Bernie Sanders in America as well? I don't feel old, I feel young and energetic."" He had always regretted not standing for the party leadership in 2007, when Sir Menzies Campbell was effectively hounded out of the job for being too old, at the age of 66. Sir Vince, who was then 64, apparently feared that he would also be judged too old, but with his opposite numbers in the Conservatives and Labour both in their 60s, age is less of an issue now. He bristles at the suggestion that he is merely keeping the leadership seat warm for his 38-year-old deputy Jo Swinson, who had been the runaway favourite to be the party's next leader before deciding not to stand. ""I've made it very clear I wasn't signing up to be a caretaker, I was signing up to do the job and do it properly and whatever that involves,"" he told The House magazine, including leading the party into the next election, whenever that might be.

"This whole Dali exhumation business is weird. It's right up there with any of his surreal artworks for its sense of the macabre and otherness. Nothing about this story is straightforward. Let's start with where he is buried. Having died in 1989 and then been embalmed by Narcis Bardalet (who said he thought Dali would have found this whole affair hilarious), he was buried under the stage of his Theatre Museum in Figueres, north east Spain. A crypt was created that the public can visit where they can see a large memorial stone marking his burial place. But that was not the point of entry for Thursday night's exhumation. That was upstairs in the huge geodesic domed hall that was once the old theatre's main stage. Bang in the middle of the space, embedded in the floor, is a massive one-and-a-half tonne, unmarked stone slab, which thousands of people once walked over every day without any idea that they were treading on the great surrealist's grave. Dali's tomb (centre of the image) in the Theatre Museum in Figueres Now, though, they will know - as it has become famous for being the place where the forensic scientists accessed the artist's remains. Security was tight. The media was banned. Only those who absolutely needed to be there (lawyers, Dali Foundation representatives, the forensic team, etc) were granted a place to watch the proceedings, which took place in a hastily-erected tent to stop any enterprising individuals from flying a drone above the glass dome and taking pictures. The forensic operation took four hours and was followed by a press conference, where we learned the exhumation was much more straightforward than anticipated. Dali's mummified body was in almost perfect condition, enabling samples of his hair, nail and bones to be taken. Narcis Bardalet was present and said it was a miracle the artist's moustache was still pointing at ten to two, like a clock. MarÃ­a Pilar Abel MartÃ­nez, who claims Dali is her father The Dali Foundation is not at all happy, although it does admit the extra attention has been a welcome magnet for tourists. The foundation can't understand why the judge approved the exhumation before all other avenues had been fully explored. It points specifically to the DNA of MarÃ­a Pilar Abel MartÃ­nez, the Tarot card-reading woman who is making the claim that Dali is her dad. Why, it asks, hasn't her DNA been compared with her brother's - whose father is known, and is not Salvador Dali. Maybe it has - we don't know. But one can only assume her representations had sufficient credibility to persuade a judge to sanction the exhumation. The evidence is circumstantial. She says her mother met the famous artist in the mid-1950s when she was working in Cadaques, a small fishing port near Figueres where Dali and his wife Gala had created a surrealist's dream home out of a row of old cottages. Her mother and Dali had a ""clandestine affair"" she says, leading to her mother becoming pregnant and subsequently giving birth to her in 1956. Experienced Dali watchers are sceptical. Not least because he was well known for being more of a watcher than a doer when it came to sex. The orgies he and Gala are said to have hosted at their seaside home were likely a visual treat for him, and a physical pleasure for her. That's how the story goes, anyway. But should the DNA sample taken from his dead body prove that he is indeed the father of Ms MartÃ­nez, a revision to the accepted stance on Dali's voyeuristic nature will be needed. As will a reapportioning of his highly-prized estate, which contains paintings, buildings, sculptures and use of the lucrative Dali trading licence. It is estimated the value of his estate, which he gave to the Spanish state and the Salvador and Gala Dali Foundation, is around Â£300 million, a quarter of which Ms MartÃ­nez would be entitled to under Spanish law. That would pay a legal bill or two, as well as being a bizarre end to a bizarre story that has Salvador Dali written all over it. We'll have to wait until the middle of September to find out the results, as the court case won't resume until then.

"Bitcoin's value has dipped and soared as opinion about whether it will split has shifted The value of the virtual currency Bitcoin has always been volatile. Even so, there has been particular turbulence in recent days as fears of a ""civil war"" among its adherents first grew and then subsided, although they have not gone away altogether. On Sunday, the value of one bitcoin dropped to about $1,863 (Â£1,430) before bouncing back to $2,402 on Wednesday, according to datafrom the news site CoinDesk,external- still some way off a June high of $3,019. Bitcoin risks becoming a victim of its success. The popularity of the financial technology has caused transactions to be processed slower, with some users complaining ofhaving to wait three days or more,externalfor confirmation of trades when thebacklog was at its worst,external, in May. Moreover, fees have also risen, hitting a high of $5 per transaction at the start of June. That makes it too costly to justify its use for some purchases, such as buying a pint of lager in a Bitcoin-accepting pub. There are ways around the problem, but the cryptocurrency's community has been split over which solution to adopt. The risk is that Bitcoin could effectively split in two, with one type becoming incompatible with another, ultimately undermining confidence in the project altogether. Ex-Bitcoin boss pleads not guilty Bitcoin 'tops gold' Experts clash over crypto-currency The issue is that Bitcoin's underlying technology has an in-built constraint: the ledger of past transactions, known as the blockchain, can have only 1MB of data added to it every 10 minutes. To understand why, it's helpful to first understand how Bitcoin works. To authenticate Bitcoin transactions, a procedure called ""mining"" takes place, which involves volunteers' computers racing to solve difficult mathematical problems. For each problem solved, one block of bitcoins is processed. As a reward, the successful miners are given newly generated bitcoins. An updated copy of the blockchain database is then copied to all the computers involved in the validation process, which are referred to as ""nodes"". Bitcoin originally did not have the 1MB/10min blockchain limit, but the feature was added tohelp defend the technology,externalagainst denial of service (DoS) attacks, which might overwhelm the blockchain by flooding it with tiny transactions. Buying bitcoins has become expensive in itself Mining, by the way, has become a big business in its own right, with some companies investing in huge ""farms"" of computers dedicated to the activity. Several of the biggest are based in China. Many of the miners have, in fact, favoured the so-called Bitcoin Unlimited solution. They said that allowing them to increase the 1MB block size would speed up transactions and reduce transactions fees. But this could also make mining more expensive, and impractical for small ""mom and pop"" operations, leaving it under the control of a handful of large corporations. That is because more processing power would be needed to verify transactions. Furthermore, additional data bandwidth and storage space would be needed to transmit and store the blockchain, since it would become much bigger. Critics also say the move would make Bitcoin more vulnerable to hackers. Moreover, some people are concerned that giving the miners power to vary the block size might undermine the principle of Bitcoin being decentralised, with no equivalent to a central bank running the show. Some software developers have favoured reorganising the format of Bitcoin transactions to make the blockchain more efficient. Specifically, they propose relocating "" transaction signatures"" - which unlock bitcoins so they can be spent - from within the blockchain to a separate file transmitted alongside it. Doing so should make it possible to process transactions at double the current rate. And as an added benefit, ""node"" computers could save on storage space by opting not to keep records of the oldest signatures. This scheme is known as Segregated Witness, or Segwit. However, critics say it would deliver only a temporary respite while adding an extra level of complexity. It appears so. A middle-ground solution - called Segwit2x - aims to start sending signature data separately from the blockchain later this week and then to double the block size limit to 2MB in three months' time. An initiative called Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 91 (BIP 91) states that if 80% of the mining effort adopts the new blockchain software involved and uses it consistently between 21 July and 31 July, then the wider community should accept this as the solution. The good news for those who like the idea is that close to 90% of miners appear to back the effort, according to Coin Dance, aBitcoin-related statistics site,external. Other plans exist to try again after August if the target is missed. But a risk remains that if use of Segwit2x software never reaches the required threshold or that hardcore opponents refuse to buckle, then it could result in two different versions of the blockchain, and in effect two types of Bitcoin. Such as schism could help rival cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, prosper and ultimately doom Bitcoin altogether. One expert, however, said he believed that was an unlikely outcome. ""The vast majority of people in the Bitcoin community are opposed to splitting Bitcoin into two competing cryptocurrencies,"" said Dr Garrick Hileman, research fellow at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance. ""Such a move would weaken Bitcoin's network effect advantage and sow confusion. ""It is much more likely that people who are dissatisfied with Bitcoin's direction will simply move on to something else, which is what we've seen in the past."" ""More and more small to medium sized companies who are 'mining' at the moment will be taken out of the game if they won't adapt and grow,"" said Martin Sims, CEO ofCoin Geek.,external ""It's a very competitive industry and everyone needs to update and evolve as the popularity of bitcoin increases and the game changes.""

"The court heard Lloyd was called ""Action Man Mark"" because of his love of physical activity A benefits cheat who said he could not walk more than 50 metres climbed Mount Kilimanjaro and won a triathlon. Mark Lloyd, of Ynysybwl, Rhondda Cynon Taff, claimed Â£6,551.80 in Personal Independence Payments, saying a slipped disc in his back left him in agony. At the same time, the 33-year-old competed in races, climbed Africa's highest peak, went wing-walking and skied in the Alps. He was convicted of a fraud charge at Merthyr Tydfil Magistrates' Court. Chris Evans, prosecuting, said: ""He said he can only walk between 20 and 50 metres, can't walk on uneven ground, suffers pain when walking long distances and needs to sit down every 20 minutes."" He claimed the cash between October 2014 and February 2016, but the court was shown photos of Lloyd competing in the HSBC triathlon in September 2015 - a race he won in the adult taster category. That month, he was also pictured posing with an African guide during his five-day trek to the peak of Kilimanjaro in Tanzania which involved walking between eight and 12 hours a day. He also took part in the World Powerboat Championships in Malta. Lloyd told benefits assessors he could not bend or stretch and needed walking aids Lloyd was medically discharged from the Army in 2011 after suffering an injury to his lower back while serving in Afghanistan. In 2014, he applied for the Personal Independence Payment - up to Â£141 a week for those suffering long-term ill health to help cover costs of their care. The following year, he applied for more money, saying his condition had worsened and he would be bedridden for a day if he walked more than 164 ft (50m). Mr Evans said: ""The case is not whether he has an injury or not, but if he exaggerated his condition to claim money."" Lloyd admitted filling in risk assessment forms to enter three triathlons without revealing he suffered ill health. He said: ""I didn't want any special treatment or assistance. I wanted to be self-sufficient and compete at the same level as everyone else."" Despite saying he struggled to walk, Lloyd reached the peak of Kilimanjaro James Harris, defending, said Lloyd had not been dishonest and was able to push through the pain barrier because of his Army training. ""When climbing Mount Kilimanjaro he said he pushed himself and was in agony,"" he told the court. District Judge Martin Brown called Lloyd's defence ""nonsense"" and said he deliberately lied to get ""every penny he could"". The court heard the offence took place while he was serving a 20-week suspended prison sentence for common assault. Lloyd denied one count of dishonestly failing to disclose information to make a gain for himself, but was convicted following a trial. He will be sentenced in August. A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: ""Only a small minority of people try to cheat the benefits system, but cases like this show how we are rooting out those who are stealing taxpayers' money and diverting it away from the people who really need it.""

"AlphaBay went offline earlier this month Two of the largest dark web marketplaceshave been shut down,externalfollowing a ""landmark"" international law enforcement investigation. The AlphaBay and Hansa sites had been associated with the trade in illicit items such as drugs, weapons, malware and stolen data. According to Europol, there were more than 250,000 listings for illegal drugs and toxic chemicals on AlphaBay. Hansa was seized and covertly monitored for a month before being deactivated. The agency said it believed the bust would lead to hundreds of new investigations in Europe. ""The capability of drug traffickers and other serious criminals around the world has taken a serious hit today,"" said Europol's executive director Rob Wainwright. It was a ""landmark"" operation, according to US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) acting director Andrew McCabe. AlphaBay has been offline since early July, fuelling suspicions among users that a law enforcement crackdown had taken place. ""We know of several Americans who were killed by drugs on AlphaBay,"" said US Attorney General Jeff Sessions. ""One victim was just 18 years old when in February she overdosed on a powerful synthetic opioid which she had bought on AlphaBay."" He also said a 13-year-old boy died after overdosing on a synthetic opioid bought by a high school classmate via the site. Mr Sessions cautioned criminals from thinking that they could evade prosecution by using the dark web: ""You cannot hide,"" he said, ""We will find you."" This video can not be played Jeff Sessions highlighted the significant quantities of illegal drugs traded via the dark web The US Department of Justice (DoJ) said that illegal drugs listed for sale on AlphaBay included heroin and fentanyl. It added in a court filing that $450m (Â£347m) was spent via the marketplace between May 2015 and February 2017. Investigations were led by the FBI, the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and the Dutch National Police. Police in other countries, including the UK, France and Lithuania, also contributed. The Dutch National Police took over the Hansa marketplace on 20 June after two men in Germany were arrested and servers in Germany, The Netherlands and Lithuania were seized. This allowed for ""the covert monitoring of criminal activities on the platform"" until it was eventually shut down a month later. Ever since AlphaBay went offline earlier in July, users of the site had discussed potential alternative dark web marketplaces on online forums. Hansa was frequently mentioned, meaning that the authorities were likely able to uncover new criminal activity on Hansa as users migrated to it from AlphaBay. ""We recorded an eight times increase in the number of human users on Hansa immediately following the takedown of AlphaBay,"" said Mr Wainwright. This video can not be played Technology explained: What is the dark web? The significance of today's announcement will only truly be known over the coming year or more as authorities follow up the ""many new leads"" they said had been found as a result of infiltrating and shutting down these two enormous networks. While the sites' closure is a massive boost, the DoJ and Europol both readily acknowledge that new services will simply pop up to replace them. After all, the closure of previous dark web marketplace Silk Road in 2013 was eventually followed with AlphaBay - bigger, more lucrative and, by the looks of it, more dangerous. What authorities really want to do is start putting significant numbers of people behind bars. This huge coordinated action has only resulted in a handful of arrests - and one key suspect apparently took his own life seven days after being brought into custody. It's clear such big services require a large, intricate network of criminals - and that's what authorities are targeting. Follow Dave Lee on Twitter@DaveLeeBBC,external An alleged administrator of AlphaBay, 26-year-old Canadian Alexandre Cazes, was arrested in Thailand on 5 July following a joint operation between US, Canadian and Thai authorities. Police also seized millions of dollars in assets, three properties and four Lamborghini cars. But Cazes was later found dead in a Bangkok jail cell. The DoJ said that he apparently took his own life. A previous dark web marketplace, Silk Road, was shut down by the FBI in 2013 and a successor - Silk Road 2.0 - was deactivated the following year. However, in its press release today the DoJ said that AlphaBay had more than 350,000 listings for illicit items of various kinds - Silk Road only had 14,000 when it was seized in 2013.

"Pills with fattening side-effects are widely available from illegal vendors in Sudan In our series of letters from African journalists, Yousra Elbagir looks at how some Sudanese women are turning to black market substances in their quest for beauty. While skin bleaching is a long-standing cosmetic staple across Sudan, a newer craze is sweeping the nation. Many young women are turning to prescription pills in order to gain weight, and hopefully gain the curvaceous figures they see as the standard of beauty. Away from the regulation of trained pharmacists, fattening pills are illegally dispensed by the same small shops which sell topical bleaching creams and other popular beauty fixes. Sold individually, in small bags and emptied sweet containers, they are completely devoid of any information about medical risks. It is difficult to estimate how many women in Sudan use these products to gain weight, because many are reluctant to admit to it. ""Pills are handed out in the village like penny sweets,"" says Imitithal Ahmed, a student at the University of Khartoum. ""I've always been scared [to use them] because I've seen family members fall ill and close friends become dependent on appetite stimulants. ""My aunt is on the brink of kidney failure and has blocked arteries from taking too many fattening pills, trying to get a bigger bum. ""Everyone in the family knows why she's sick, but she won't own up to it. She's had to stop taking the pills on doctor's orders."" Yousra Elbagir: ""Fattening pills are a popular niche within a much bigger trend"" Pills are often rebranded and given catchy street names which allude to their effects. From The Neighbours' Shock to Chicken Thighs and My Mama Suspects, the clinical name of pills are forgotten and replaced by promises of a bigger bottom, shapely thighs and a belly that will have your mother concerned that you might be pregnant. Tablets range from standard appetite stimulants to allergy medicines containing the steroid hormone, cortisone. ""The ultimate Sudanese woman [is] full-bodied and light-skinned"" The side-effects of taking cortisone are now a cash cow for pill peddlers. It is known to slow the metabolism, increase appetite, trigger water retention and create extra deposits of fat around the abdomen and face. Using unregulated steroids without supervision can damage the heart, liver, kidneys and thyroid, says Dr Salah Ibrahim, Head of the Pharmacists' Union in Sudan. He explains that cortisone is a naturally occurring hormone in the body, helping to regulate vital bodily functions. But when a man-made, concentrated version enters the body in the form of pills or topical bleaching creams, the brain gives the body a signal to stop production. If a user suddenly stops taking the substance, their major organs can spiral into dysfunction. Young women in Sudan are dying from kidney and heart failure caused by sudden steroid withdrawal, medical professionals say. Fatalities are especially common among new brides, who traditionally undergo a month of intense beautification before their wedding day and then abruptly stop using fattening pills and steroidal bleaching creams. Their deaths are put down to sudden organ failure. Yet these horrifying beauty trends continue to gain traction. Prescription pill abuse is taking off in Sudan's conservative society, partly because it lacks the social stigma and pungent, giveaway odour of alcohol and cannabis. University students flock to buy the potent painkiller Tramadol, which is sold for 20 Sudanese pounds ($1; 80 pence) per pill. Some of Khartoum's roadside tea-sellers are even known to drop the painkiller in a cup of tea, upon a coded request. Many Sudanese women view Nada Algalaa as an ideal beauty Awareness campaigns have so far had very little impact. Dr Ibrahim, Head of the Pharmacists Union, has made numerous appearances on national television to warn of the dangers of prescription pill abuse. At university level, pharmacists are taught vigilance and trained to act in keeping with ethics and pharmaceutical law. But in a country where pharmacists and doctors are paid very little, the temptation to sell pills to illegal vendors is overwhelming for some. ""Last time I went to the beauty shop I go to for my creams, the shop owner brought out a chocolate box full of different fattening pills,"" says Ms Ahmed, the Khartoum student. ""Girls are too scared to ask pharmacists and doctors about the pills they buy from beauty shops, for fear of being publicly shamed."" Police may arrest traders and block smuggling routes, but the profits for rogue pharmacists keep growing regardless. Fattening pills are poured into the black market, deemed to be the lesser evil. Sudan isn't the only African society where being overweight is a symbol of prosperity and power, boosting the ""marriageability"" of young women. But in this country, it embodies an ideal. It defines the ultimate Sudanese woman - full-bodied and light-skinned - epitomising beauty and coveted as a wife. The iconic status of Nada Algalaa, a Sudanese singer whose looks are widely praised and emulated, is testament in itself. For some women, it is an ideal to be acquired by any means necessary.

"This video can not be played Simpson: ""I did my time"" Former US football star and actor OJ Simpson has told a parole board ""I've done my time,"" as he asked for release after nine years in a Nevada prison. Simpson, who was acquitted of a double murder in 1995, is serving time for armed robbery, assault with a deadly weapon and 10 other charges. The sentence, which carries a maximum of 33 years, stems from a 2007 confrontation at a Las Vegas hotel. Simpson, 70, had said he was only trying to reclaim his possessions. The former Hall of Fame running back was found guilty in 2008 - exactly 13 years to the day after he was famously acquitted for the killings of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman. OJ Simpson - the spectacular fall of 'The Juice' OJ Simpson case: Where are they now? He and a group of five others stormed into a hotel room to confront two sports-memorabilia collectors to seize items that he claimed belonged to him from his own career. This video can not be played ""If he is denied parole... it will be part of the continuing payback... since his acquittal in 1995,"" says Jeffrey Toobin The hearing for Prisoner 1027820 is happening at the Lovelock Correctional Facility, a medium security prison in the Nevada desert. ""Mr Simpson, you are getting the same hearing that everyone else gets,"" a parole panellist, Connie Bisbee, told him as Thursday's hearing began. ""Sure,"" he replied in a husky voice with a shrug and a smile. ""Thank you, ma'am."" Simpson told parole officials that the objects he took from the Las Vegas hotel room were later ruled by officials to legally belong to him. One panellist asked: ""So you believe that the property was yours?"" A brief history of OJ Simpson ""It's been ruled legally by the state of California,"" Simpson responded in a raised voice, leaning forward. He said the belongings, which he described as images of his family and friends, were later handed over to him by officials. ""It's kind of mind-boggling that they turned over to me property that I'm in jail for, for trying to retrieve."" Bruce Fromong, who was  one of Simpson's victims in the robbery, testified in favour of his release. ""I've known OJ for a long time,"" said Mr Fromong. ""I don't feel that he's a threat to anyone. ""He's a good man. It's time to give him a second chance. It's time for him to go home to his family, his friends."" Simpson appeared to dab a tear during Mr Fromong's testimony. If four out of seven members of the parole board vote in favour of his release, Simpson could be free by October. Experts believe he is likely to be approved for release, after a record of good behaviour at the Lovelock prison. Another panellist asked him if he had completed a specific self-improvement course since his last parole hearing. He said he had not, but that he had taken another course called ""alternative to violence"". Simpson rejected the suggestion that he had an alcohol problem during the hearing ""I think it's the most important course anybody in this prison can take because it teaches you how to deal with conflict through conversation,"" he said. ""I've spent a conflict-free life,"" he continued, when asked if he had completed an anti-violence course. Simpson also told the commissioners he had helped establish a Baptist prayer event, adding: ""I could have been a better Christian."" The prisoner also rejected the suggestion that he had an alcohol problem. ""I've done my time,"" he said. ""I've done it as well and as respectfully as anybody can. I think if you talk to the wardens they'll tell you. ""I've not complained for nine years. All I've done is try to be helpfulâ¦ and that's the life I've tried to live because I want to get back to my kids and family."" In 2013 the Nevada Board of Parole Commissioners granted him parole on some of his convictions, but for not the more violent charges. The prisoner's daughter, Arnelle Simpson, choked up as she told the parole board: ""My experience with him is that he's like my best friend and my rock. ""As a family we recognise that he is not the perfect man, but he's clearly a man and a father who's done his best to behave in a way that speaks to his overall nature and character, which is always to be positive, no matter what."" She added: ""He is remorseful, he truly is remorseful."" The board, which normally takes days to make a decision, went behind closed doors to deliberate and said it would announce its ruling shortly.

Bruce Fromong, who was  one of Simpson's victims in the robbery, testified in favour of his release. ""I've known OJ for a long time,"" said Mr Fromong. ""I don't feel that he's a threat to anyone. ""He's a good man. It's time to give him a second chance. It's time for him to go home to his family, his friends."" Simpson appeared to dab a tear during Mr Fromong's testimony. If four out of seven members of the parole board vote in favour of his release, Simpson could be free by October. Experts believe he is likely to be approved for release, after a record of good behaviour at the Lovelock prison. Another panellist asked him if he had completed a specific self-improvement course since his last parole hearing. He said he had not, but that he had taken another course called ""alternative to violence"". Simpson rejected the suggestion that he had an alcohol problem during the hearing ""I think it's the most important course anybody in this prison can take because it teaches you how to deal with conflict through conversation,"" he said. ""I've spent a conflict-free life,"" he continued, when asked if he had completed an anti-violence course. Simpson also told the commissioners he had helped establish a Baptist prayer event, adding: ""I could have been a better Christian."" The prisoner also rejected the suggestion that he had an alcohol problem. ""I've done my time,"" he said. ""I've done it as well and as respectfully as anybody can. I think if you talk to the wardens they'll tell you. ""I've not complained for nine years. All I've done is try to be helpfulâ¦ and that's the life I've tried to live because I want to get back to my kids and family."" In 2013 the Nevada Board of Parole Commissioners granted him parole on some of his convictions, but for not the more violent charges. The prisoner's daughter, Arnelle Simpson, choked up as she told the parole board: ""My experience with him is that he's like my best friend and my rock. ""As a family we recognise that he is not the perfect man, but he's clearly a man and a father who's done his best to behave in a way that speaks to his overall nature and character, which is always to be positive, no matter what."" She added: ""He is remorseful, he truly is remorseful."" The board, which normally takes days to make a decision, went behind closed doors to deliberate and said it would announce its ruling shortly.

"This video can not be played OJ Simpson: His life and the trial that defined it The story of Orenthal James - ""OJ"" - Simpson is about a fallen hero. The former American football star and Hollywood celebrity, who died on Thursday aged 76, went on in his later life to spectacularly make headlines for all the wrong reasons. After convincing a jury of his innocence in a double murder case, he was later convicted in Las Vegas of armed robbery and conspiracy to kidnap. The incident came more than a decade after he was cleared of the murder of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman. That famous trial started in 1995 and contained the blockbuster ingredients of money, murder, fame and sex. The trial gripped the US, and much of the rest of the world, for an entire year, and dramas and documentaries inspired by the case continue to enthral audiences. The jury's decision remains a subject of heated debate in popular culture to this day. Americast - The life and death of OJ Simpson Before 1994, Simpson was regarded with affection by the public, well known as a professional athlete, actor and million-dollar spokesman for several US companies. Things appeared to always work out for ""the Juice"". He had gone from a poor San Francisco neighbourhood, where he grew up, to a home in the wealthy boulevards of west Los Angeles via a glittering American football career. Fans continued to adore him long after his career as a running back ended It all changed when he became the main suspect in his ex-wife's murder. Millions of Americans watched as the police chased his white Bronco car for 90 minutes live on TV. He finally gave himself up outside his LA home. Throughout his career OJ had worked hard to rise above race and become an all-American hero. In 1969, in an interview with the New York Times, he stated that his biggest accomplishment was that ""people looked at me like a man, not a black man"". But years later, in the Los Angeles courtroom, his race came to the forefront. OJ's police car chase was broadcast across the US Public opinion on his guilt divided along racial lines, and revealed a large chasm between black and white Americans' perception of the police. His lawyer, Johnnie Cochran, argued to the mostly black jury that police had planted evidence in an attempt to frame Simpson because he was a black superstar. Critics accused him of playing the ""race card"". Simpson's attorneys played recordings of Los Angles police detective Mark Furhman, who had found the bloodied glove, using racial slurs, and called witnesses who testified he had made racist comments. 'If the glove doesn't fit, you must acquit', his lawyer argued The verdict proved similarly divisive once the jury voted to acquit Simpson after just hours of deliberation. There was widespread outrage among white Americans after Simpson walked free, but the majority of black Americans supported it. The trial led many to ask the question: Who was the real OJ Simpson? There was no denying that he had been very much loved by the public who viewed him as gentle, generous, hard-working and charismatic. He and Nicole Brown, whom he married in 1985, played the perfect, handsome couple. But the court case threw up a darker side, with the prosecution's emphasis on Simpson's violent relationship with his ex-wife. There was the now-infamous incident of New Year's Day 1989 when police were summoned to their home to find Nicole outside, her eye blackened and her lip bloodied. She fell into an officer's arms, sobbing and screaming: ""He's going to kill me."" Nicole decided not to press charges, but the city lawyer went ahead and prosecuted OJ for spousal battery. He was fined and given two years' probation. They remained together for another three volatile years before they divorced. Simpson was born in 1947. He was a bow-legged child who had rickets, but was able to escape poverty in San Francisco because he was an extremely good runner. He eventually went on to become one of the top running backs in American football history. He attended the University of Southern California, where he was named the country's top college football player in 1968. He then moved to Buffalo, New York, where he spent most of his career. In 1979, he was forced to retire due to injuries. By then, however, he was making his mark as a Hollywood actor. Between 1973 and 1994, he appeared in more than 20 films including The Towering Inferno and the Naked Gun films. He also won some lucrative television advertising deals. After the 1995 murder trial things were never the same for Simpson. Those professional accomplishments were effectively negated in the public imagination, as many Americans came to solely associate him with the death of his ex-wife and her friend, despite the acquittal. He was later found liable for the deaths in a civil trial brought by the Brown and Goldman family and ordered to pay them $33.5m in damages. He pursued a relatively quiet life, playing golf and focusing on his four children - two from his first marriage to a childhood sweetheart in the 1960s and two from his marriage to Nicole. At times, however, Simpson appeared to lean into his now-infamous reputation. In 2006 he was back in the spotlight, after a $3.5m (Â£1.8m) deal he reached with Rupert Murdoch's broadcasting and publishing companies sparked public outrage. The deal included the publication of Simpson's ghost-written, ""hypothetical"" account of the murders, If I Did It, as well as an interview for Fox TV. The rights were later sold to the Goldman family, who significantly shrank the size of the word ""If"" on the cover, and added the subtitle ""Confessions of the Killer"". In 2008, he was convicted of armed robbery and conspiracy to kidnap stemming from an organised raid in a Las Vegas hotel room. Simpson claimed that the men were trying to sell his personal memorabilia. He served nine years in prison, and his parole ended in 2021. After his prison sentence, Simpson tried to reset his public image. He joined Twitter, now known as X, in 2019. He generated no small degree of controversy with a debut message declaring he had a ""little gettin' even to do.""On 11 February, the former football star posted his final video to X. ""My health is good,"" he told his followers. ""Obviously I'm dealing with some issues. But hey, I think I'm just about over it.""""I'll be back on that golf course, hopefully, in a couple weeks,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Simpson: ""I did my time"" Former US football star and actor OJ Simpson has told a parole board ""I've done my time,"" as he asked for release after nine years in a Nevada prison. Simpson, who was acquitted of a double murder in 1995, is serving time for armed robbery, assault with a deadly weapon and 10 other charges. The sentence, which carries a maximum of 33 years, stems from a 2007 confrontation at a Las Vegas hotel. Simpson, 70, had said he was only trying to reclaim his possessions. The former Hall of Fame running back was found guilty in 2008 - exactly 13 years to the day after he was famously acquitted for the killings of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman. OJ Simpson - the spectacular fall of 'The Juice' OJ Simpson case: Where are they now? He and a group of five others stormed into a hotel room to confront two sports-memorabilia collectors to seize items that he claimed belonged to him from his own career. This video can not be played ""If he is denied parole... it will be part of the continuing payback... since his acquittal in 1995,"" says Jeffrey Toobin The hearing for Prisoner 1027820 is happening at the Lovelock Correctional Facility, a medium security prison in the Nevada desert. ""Mr Simpson, you are getting the same hearing that everyone else gets,"" a parole panellist, Connie Bisbee, told him as Thursday's hearing began. ""Sure,"" he replied in a husky voice with a shrug and a smile. ""Thank you, ma'am."" Simpson told parole officials that the objects he took from the Las Vegas hotel room were later ruled by officials to legally belong to him. One panellist asked: ""So you believe that the property was yours?"" A brief history of OJ Simpson ""It's been ruled legally by the state of California,"" Simpson responded in a raised voice, leaning forward. He said the belongings, which he described as images of his family and friends, were later handed over to him by officials. ""It's kind of mind-boggling that they turned over to me property that I'm in jail for, for trying to retrieve."" Bruce Fromong, who was  one of Simpson's victims in the robbery, testified in favour of his release. ""I've known OJ for a long time,"" said Mr Fromong. ""I don't feel that he's a threat to anyone.

"Vince Cable, with new deputy leader Jo Swinson, left. Sir Vince Cable is the new leader of the Liberal Democrats, after no-one stood against him. The 74-year old Twickenham MP was the only candidate on the ballot paper when nominations closed at 16:00 BST. The former business secretary said there should be an ""exit from Brexit"" and he believed the party's call for a second referendum would be vindicated. He also said he did not intend to be a ""caretaker"" leader and he would ""serve as long as I need to"". Sir Vince, who has been acting and deputy leader in the past, has argued that Brexit is not inevitable. He assumes the leadership vacated by Tim Farron, who stood down after a disappointing general election in which the party increased its number of MPs from nine to 12 but saw its vote share fall to 7.4%. Sir Vince paid tribute to his predecessor as he was announced as the new leader, saying Mr Farron had taken over the leadership at a time of crisis for the party and had rebuilt its membership to record levels. He argued that the Conservatives and Labour had been taken over by ""ideologues"" and British politics had lost its ""basic common sense"", moderation and mutual respect - his aim was for the Liberal Democrats to move into that space. He warned that he feared the UK was ""heading for a disastrous outcome"" over Brexit, headed by a dysfunctional and disunited government -  and said he felt there should be an ""exit from Brexit"". The party's main campaign pledge during the election was to give the public the final say on the terms of the UK's exit from the EU in a further referendum, ahead of the scheduled withdrawal date in March 2019. Although Sir Vince has admitted this message did not ""cut through"", he has argued that attitudes are beginning to change and that the public mood will come round to the party's position. He said as the difficulties of Brexit became clearer, Mr Farron's policy would be ""absolutely vindicated"". He added: ""I'm ambitious for this country and I'm ambitious for this party. In difficult times, we have shown enormous resilience but I believe we can fight our way back, break through and make an enormous success of our party and eventually, in government."" Sir Vince has ruled out coalitions with the Tories and with a Jeremy Corbyn-led Labour party Born:9 May 1943, in York Educated:Grammar school, Cambridge University Family:Father of three grown-up children by his first wife, Olympia, who died in 2001. Remarried in 2004. Job before politics:Economist, lecturer and adviser to the Kenyan government and senior Labour politicians. Chief economist at oil giant Shell. Political career:A Labour councillor in Glasgow the 1970s, who joined the SDP in 1982 and then won his Twickenham seat for the Lib Dems at the second attempt in 1997. Stood in as Lib Dem leader when Sir Menzies Campbell quit in 2007, was business secretary in the coalition government between 2010 and 2015, before losing his seat. Returned to the Commons in June. Knighted in 2015. Off duty:Ballroom dancing and writing - about to publish his first novel, a political thriller about a post-Brexit future called Open Arms Read More: The Vince Cable story He has said the Conservative and Labour leaderships are conspiring to negotiate a ""hard Brexit"" and he is willing to work with MPs from other parties to thwart this. Sir Vince, who was knighted last year, was elected unopposed after other potential candidates, including Jo Swinson, Norman Lamb and Sir Ed Davey, said they would not be putting themselves forward. The veteran politician, who was a Labour councillor in the 1970s before defecting to the SDP and later joining the Liberal Democrats, has never stood for the party's leadership before. But he has become one of its most recognisable and influential figures, having served as deputy to former leaders Sir Menzies Campbell and Nick Clegg, and been a cabinet minister in the Tory-Lib Dem government for five years. He will be the oldest leader of the party in its near 30-year history. He has insisted he has the energy, as well as the experience, to lead the Lib Dems into the next election, which he believes will happen sooner rather than later. Mr Farron announced his decision to quit a week after last month's poll, citing the pressures of trying to reconcile his Christian beliefs with his leadership of a progressive political party. He later said that he had decided to step down early on in the election campaign - a campaign in which he was forced to clarify on several occasions his views on whether gay sex was a sin or not.

"The government has scrapped the planned electrification of railway lines in Wales, the Midlands and the North. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said the government will instead introduce faster trains with more seats and better on-board facilities. He said: ""We are making the biggest investment in the railways since the Victorian era."" Andy McDonald, Labour's Shadow Transport Secretary, accused him of ""taking people for a ride"". Routes between Cardiff and Swansea, and between Kettering, Nottingham and Sheffield, and between Windermere and Oxenholme will be affected. Mr Grayling said said the new trains on the Great Western and Midland Mainline would be bi-mode, meaning they could run on electrified sections of track and then transfer to non-electrified sections. He said: ""Thanks to this new technology disruptive electrification works... will no longer be needed. ""Passengers will benefit sooner and experience less disruption compared with putting up intrusive wires and masts along routes where they are no longer required."" However, Mr McDonald said: ""The Tories have been promising the electrification of the Great Western Mainline from Paddington to Swansea since 2012 and today's announcement confirms that they have been taking people for a ride."" Eight years ago Network Rail dramatically over-promised how quickly and how cheaply it could electrify some of Britain's busiest rail lines. Reality soon hit home. A recent report by the Public Accounts Committee described the electrification of the Great Western line as ""a stark example of how not to run a project"". The budget went from Â£874m in 2013 to Â£2.8bn two years later. Why? Because when Network Rail first did their sums, it was based on guesswork. They hadn't looked in detail at what needed doing and it was just much harder than they thought to upgrade Victorian bridges and tunnels on a line that was being kept open at the same time. So having kicked some of the promised electrification schemes into the long grass a while ago, the government's finally chopped them. New trains which are part diesel, part electric, will be used instead. Liberal Democrat Shadow Transport Secretary, Jenny Randerson, said: ""The Liberal Democrats secured vital investment for rail electrification when in government. ""That was then delayed by the Tories and now has been scrapped altogether."" The government said it would introduce new Intercity Express trains in Wales with around 130 more seats and faster services. Wales' Economy Secretary, Ken Skates, told Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales programme: ""I don't buy it."" He accused the UK government of ""years of broken promises"" and said Mr Grayling had not responded to his requests for a meeting on the issue. ""I'm urging the UK government to clarify the situation immediately,"" he added. The Department for Transport said the new services meant long distance journey times from Nottingham and Sheffield would be reduced by up to 20 minutes in peak periods. It said four direct services a day in each direction between Windermere and Manchester Airport will be introduced from May 2018.

"Russian corvette Mirazh passes through Istanbul en route for Syria The ship spotters of Istanbul have become a key resource for diplomats and intelligence experts, alerting the world to the scale of Russia's campaign in Syria. It's almost midnight. I've just got to sleep at the end of a long day travelling to Istanbul, when my phone beeps with a message. ""Slightly bad news,"" it says. ""Alexander Tkachenko will enter Bosphorus at 04:20. ""Very inconvenient. There is absolutely no guarantee we will see anything at all."" The Alexander Tkachenko is a massive Russian roll-on roll-off passenger ferry that has passed through the Bosphorus several times before, carrying military trucks and other equipment bound for Syria on an open deck. The boat may not have visible cargo this time. And in any case, 4.20am is well before dawn at this time of year in Turkey. It will still be dark. But that won't stop Yoruk Isik, who sent the message, from getting up to position himself at a good vantage point on the banks of the Bosphorus Straits in the heart of Istanbul with his binoculars and zoom lens camera. He'll be ready to tweet the news of the ship's passage to his many avid followers, who now include diplomats and intelligence analysts worldwide. And he's inviting me to come with him, though he adds: ""I will feel very guilty if there is nothing on board."" Of course, I get up too. That's what I've come for. On the Black Sea: The Voyage Beginsis available to listen to and download on theBBC iPlayer. The second part in the series will be broadcast on theBBC World Serviceon Wed 26 Jul 2017 at 03:32 BST. Welcome to the wacky - but politically, increasingly important - world of ship-spotting. It's an international, highly collaborative, fraternity - yes, they're mainly (though not all) men - and Isik is one of its most passionate, energetic members. He's a big man in every sense of the word - bear-like, generous and funny. Yoruk Isik (right) with fellow ship spotter Devrim Yaylali, on a Bosphorus ferry And he keeps himself going on strong coffee - the third love of his life, after his wife and ships - because he doesn't get much sleep. ""Many times I get up at two, three or four o'clock in the morning to see things,"" he says. ""Yes, it's very painful. I destroy many days like this."" And he laughs. It's easy to understand how his addiction started. Partly it comes from living in Istanbul. The Bosphorus - the gateway to the Black Sea for ships coming from the Mediterranean - isn't the only waterway in the world that's crowded with international shipping, but no other shipping lane as busy as this runs through the heart of a huge city. So Istanbul's 15 million residents can watch massive warships and cruise ships, container vessels and tankers passing before their eyes. Only 700m wide at its narrowest point, the Bosphorus is so busy that to avoid accidents, the Turkish authorities operate a one-way system, regularly changing the direction of travel according to demand. Ships going the other way must wait at the northern or southern entrance. The USS Porter transits the Bosphorus Isik has his favourite vantage points for spotting - most of them at one of the Strait's many bends. But often he just watches from his own balcony. ""This ship spotting is a mirror of international relations, politics, what is happening now,"" he says. This video can not be played Yoruk Isik explains how warships became his obsession ""The trade wars between Russia and Turkey, the US presence in the Black Sea supporting its Nato allies, or Russia trying to reinsert itself in the Middle East - it is all happening in the middle of this town!"" Isik - who earns a living as an international affairs consultant - logs the passage of boats of all kinds. One he lay in wait for recently at a waterside cafe was the largest construction vessel in the world, the Pioneering Spirit, the length of six jumbo jets, passing through the Bosphorus on its way to lay the TurkStream gas pipeline off the Russian coast. It's so big that the strait had to be closed to other shipping as it went through. But it's warships that most fascinate Isik and his ship-spotting friend Devrim Yaylali, who edits the Bosphorus Naval News website. Yaylali, an economist, has been watching ships for even longer than Isik - since he commuted across the Bosphorus to school in his early teens, during the Cold War. He was so curious about Soviet ships that one day he even skipped a school exam to photograph the aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov, now the flagship of the Russian navy, on its inaugural passage through Istanbul. Today Isik and Yaylali are kept busier and busier - naval traffic through the Bosphorus has increased since Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula, on the northern side of the Black Sea, in 2014. The Kremlin has been strengthening its military defences in Crimea - and modernising its Black Sea fleet based in the Crimean port of Sevastopol. ""Russia has already bought three brand new Kilo Class submarines - and a fourth is about to come,"" Isik says. ""That shows their interest in asserting influence over the Black Sea."" On the deck of the Filchenkov, someone wanted a shot of Yoruk Isik too But Nato has said it will bolster its naval presence in the region in response. In April, Isik spotted the UK destroyer HMS Daring passing through Istanbul - a rare Royal Navy operational deployment to the Black Sea. ""The current situation is more scary than the Cold War to me,"" he says. ""There is the possibility, if not of more hot military action, certainly of more military face-offs."" But for now the greatest danger of a face-off is over Syria - and since the start of Russia's involvement in the war there nearly two years ago, Isik and his fellow Istanbul ship-spotters have played a key role in alerting the world to the scale of the Kremlin's military commitment. All Russian ships travelling to Syria from Sevastopol or Russia's other Black Sea base at Novorossiysk must pass through the Bosphorus. And sometimes, Isik says, Russia seems keen to flaunt its controversial campaign. His most famous shot, taken in December 2015 - and retweeted around the world - was of a Russian soldier standing on the deck of a landing ship holding a shoulder-launched missile, an Igla rocket, as the vessel passed through the centre of Istanbul. A soldier with a shoulder-fired surface-to-air missile can be seen on board the ship Russian warships, like those of other Black Sea nations, have full rights of passage through the Bosphorus in peacetime. Non-Black Sea states have more limited naval rights. But that image - taken shortly after Turkey shot down a Russian warplane for allegedly violating its airspace - was judged so provocative by Ankara that it sent a diplomatic note to Moscow in protest. ""I didn't even see (the rocket) with my naked eye - only when I downloaded the picture,"" Isik says. When Isik zoomed in on his photos he could see a soldier carrying an Igla rocket on his shoulder ""In the end, I couldn't decide whether it was done on the order of Moscow - or just the initiative of the soldier or captain."" As for the Aleksandr Tkachenko - the ship we've both given up our sleep for - it eventually emerges as predicted out of the early morning mist round a bend in the Bosphorus - loaded with row upon row of olive-green Kamaz military trucks. Isik throws himself into a photographic frenzy. The Aleksandr Tkachenko carrying a cargo of military trucks on its way to Syria, just after dawn ""I'm quite excited,"" he says, ""because when the Russian government made a contract with this ship one-and-a-half years ago, it was secret, they didn't announce it - and this shows their approach to the war. Nato ships are stronger than Russia's navy - but with what they have, Russia successfully launched a campaign 1,000 miles from Sevastopol."" ""I was the first to notice that Russia was carrying military vehicles on civilian vessels and it showed even more that they were deepening their commitment."" ""So, Tim, do you feel the excitement of the ship spotter right now?"" Isik asks. ""I love mystery, and it's like a puzzle when we see ships carrying things from point A to point B - and with the help of other ship spotters you can solve this puzzle.""

"This video can not be played Derek Ironside describes how a group of masked man attacked Aberdeen fans outside a pub Two Aberdeen fans have been treated for injuries after supporters were attacked in Bosnia ahead of the club's Europa League game against Siroki Brijeg. About 50 supporters were subjected to an unprovoked attack outside the Black Dog Pub in Mostar on Wednesday. A group of about a dozen masked men set off flares and attacked the Aberdeen fans with baseball bats and metal bars. The attackers are understood to have been linked to a rival Bosnian club rather than Siroki Brijeg. In a statement posted on its website, Siroki Brijeg said it ""strongly condemned the hooligan attack"". The club, which is based in the town of the same name about 12 miles from Mostar, said it had set up a fan zone ahead of Thursday evening's match, and guaranteed there would be ""maximum security"" for the Aberdeen fans. Siroki Brijeg also thanked Aberdeen and its supporters for the ""extraordinary welcome"" they had received in Scotland during last week's first leg, which ended in a 1-1 draw. About 200 Aberdeen supporters were expected to attend the second-leg tie in Bosnia. Siroki Brijeg were recently ordered to play three matches behind closed doors by the country's football association after the club's fans chanted fascist slogans during a match with Sarajevo in May. Aberdeen-based journalist Derek Ironside, who was at the pub in the old town area of Mostar, told BBC Scotland that the atmosphere had been ""very good natured, with not a hint of trouble or hassle at all"". He added: ""Everybody was just enjoying themselves, it was a good atmosphere, very relaxed. ""Then all of a sudden down this small, narrow lane came a group of about 12 masked guys with flares. They started throwing the flares towards the Aberdeen fans, and I think they had weapons as well."" Mr Ironside said he believed one Aberdeen fan ""looked quite badly injured"" and had been taken to hospital. Aberdeen Evening Express journalist Sean Wallace was also among those caught up in the violence. He wrote on Twitter: ""Sore head after being bottled by masked Bosnian hooligans in Mostar. Also cuts to legs after being hit by flare in Mostar. Sore but ok."" In a statement on its Facebook page, the Black Dog Pub offered its ""sincere apologies"" to the Aberdeen fans. It said: ""This was a football rivalry-related incident and is not normal in the old city of Mostar. ""The police are involved and people have been identified. If anyone has any more info please pass it forward. ""Because of this incident, we are asking the good people of Mostar to please come around the old city this weekend and show your support that Mostar is a safe place for tourists and everyone.""

"Keeping your children entertained during along summer holidayis never easy, especially when you're on a tight budget. According to theFamily and Childcare Trust,external, the cost of holiday childcare has increased by 4% since 2016 to an average of Â£125 per week. The BBC has called on you, the experts, to send us your best advice for managing childcare costs in the summer downtime. Melanie Stevens from Cheltenham, Gloucester, suggests: ""In the summer holidays, I ask young students back from university to be our holiday nanny. ""My two boys are 11 and 12. I've got two lovely girls helping this summer, sometimes chilling at home and sometimes trips to the Lido, park and cafes. ""This works out cheaper than sending the boys to sporty holiday clubs and I have the luxury of not having to rush them out of the house. ""It does cost my entire salary for those weeks. I save Â£100 per month towards this."" However, Christine Castle from Reading, Berkshire, says paying for a club may be worth it: ""I can use up my holidays looking after my grandson but that would mean me losing time to spend with my husband as we both still work full time. ""I have paid for all the school holiday - less two weeks when my daughter is off work - for my grandson to go to a local summer club. ""He is educated and has fun whilst doing it so for me it is money well spent."" Followers ofMumsnet's Facebook page,externalhave also provided these pearls of wisdom: Alison Cunningham,externalsuggests: ""I got a weekend job so, yes, we don't get a full weekend as a family but hubby gets quality time with our little girl and we don't have the worry of relying on family for childcare. We are fortunate that hubby's job allows me to only work a few hours at the weekend, though I know this isn't a possibility for everyone."" Amanda Hobbs,externalwent back to the classroom for her solution: ""I got a job in teaching! Has its drawbacks because everywhere is so damn busy and I get no 'me time.'

"The discovery was made in a rock shelter in the Northern Territory Archaeologists have found the first evidence to suggest that Aboriginal people have been in Australia for at least 65,000 years. The discovery indicates their arrival on the continent was up to 18,000 years earlier than previously thought. It was made after sophisticated artefacts were excavated from a rock shelter in the Northern Territory. Researchers unearthed what they say are the world's oldest stone axes and ochre crayons, thought to be used for art. The research, which has been peer-reviewed, was published in the journalNature,external. It is based on findings at the Madjedbebe shelter, near Kakadu National Park. Australian Aborigines are believed to be the world's oldest continuous civilisation. However, there has been debate among scientists about when they arrived, with an estimate of between 47,000 and 60,000 years ago. They would have made sea journeys from the islands of South-East Asia at a time when water levels were much lower. The lead author of the new research, Associate Prof Chris Clarkson, from the University of Queensland, said: ""We have managed to establish a new age for first occupation in Australia and pushed it back by about 18,000 years beyond what was the previous established age of about 47,000 years."" Researchers worked with the agreement of the traditional owners of the area near the Kakadu National Park He added: ""This has huge implications for everything from theout-of-Africa storyto theextinction of megafaunaand Aboriginal peoples' own knowledge of how long they have been in this country."" Map charts early massacres of indigenous Australians The out-of Africa theory postulates on when humans first left Africa. The dates there have also been hugely debated and have ranged from between 60,000 and 100,000 years. What this new research does is push up the bottom of that range to 65,000 years. It also confirms that humans would have arrived before the extinction of Australian megafauna such as a type of giant wombat and a giant carnivorous goanna. Agraphic in the Sydney Morning Herald,externalput the new timeframe in perspective, saying that if Aboriginal culture were taken to be 24 hours long, the First Fleet of European settlers in 1788 would have arrived at 23:54 and 56 seconds. Radiocarbon dating was used on charcoal samples but this has a limit of about 50,000 years. To go beyond that, the team used the method of optically stimulated luminescence (OSL). It is used on buried material, measuring the time that has elapsed since mineral grains were last exposed to sunlight. It was used to date some 28,500 individual grains of sand. DNA gives window into Aboriginal history This led to a far more accurate timeframe than was previously known. The rare artefacts found in the dense lowest layer of the Madjedbebe shelter indicate an ""innovative and dynamic early Aboriginal occupation of Australia"", Assoc Prof Clarkson told the BBC. Ground-edge stone axes were unearthed during the excavation ""We found these beautiful ground stone-edge axes with grooves at one end where the handle would have been attached with resin,"" he said. Australian artists call for ban on fake Aboriginal art The team found pieces of reflective art minerals such as mica wrapped around ground ochre, along with a slab covered in red ochre that was mixed with mica. ""It really tells us that people were heavily into artistic activity,"" Associate Prof Clarkson said. The traditional owners of the area are the Mirrar people. Their interests are represented by the Gundjeihmi Aboriginal Corporation, which struck a deal with the researchers over the latest dig. Mirrar people worked alongside archaeologists at Madjedbebe, helping with the excavation and curation of the material. Since the 1970s, the Northern Territory rock shelter has been excavated four times, with more than 10,000 artefacts found in the lowest layer of the site. Gundjeihmi Aboriginal Corporation head Justin O'Brien said that the latest research ""shatters previous understandings of the sophistication of the Aboriginal toolkit"".

"It was an awkward day for some stars at the BBC after the corporation disclosed, for the first time, how much its top talent is earning. The list has proved revealing, showing a gender pay gap and a lack of diversity among those in the top pay bracket. Some of the BBC's biggest earners have reacted with humour to having their pay deals exposed to the public - Gary Lineker wished everyone ""Happy BBC salary day"" on Twitter. But fellow TV broadcaster Andrew Marr admitted the revelations would be ""uncomfortable"", while Radio 4's Today presenter John Humphrys said his Â£600,000 salary was hard to justify. But it raises the question, would it be better for everyone's salaries to be public knowledge? Do you really want to know if the person sitting next to you earns more? Chris Evans tops best-paid BBC stars list How much the BBC pays its stars Stars react to BBC pay revelations Talking about money is one of Britain's last taboos. Most people would admit to being curious about how much their colleagues earn, but would never dare to ask. In fact, according to a study from 2015, Britons are more likely to discuss their sex life than reveal the size of their salary. University College London researchers, in a survey of 15,000 men and women, discovered that British people are seven times more likely to tell a stranger how many sexual partners they've had, whether they've had an affair, and whether they've ever contracted a sexually-transmitted disease, than have a chat about their income. Researcher Soazig Clifton said: ""They'd tell us about their affairs, all of their partners, they'll tell us all kinds of different things but the one thing they won't tell us is how much they earn."" British people may not feel comfortable about talking freely about their pay, but some companies have decided to be completely transparent about staff earnings. At GrantTree, a company which helps UK firms get government funding, everyone in the organisation knows what everyone else earns. Andrew Ormerod, a GrantTree director, said he couldn't imagine it any other way. He told told 5 Live's Wake Up to Money: ""I actually find it strange to think about not knowing that. ""And for us it's part of a broader culture of transparency so it actually feels quite strange for me the way that a lot of businesses operate where actually there isn't that level of transparency."" Employees at another company, London-based Pimlico Plumbers, divulged what they were earning as part of a TV show for Channel 4 in 2012. Pimlico Plumbers chief executive Charlie Mullins with some of the staff involved in the TV show Karl Plunkett, communications director, said it caused ""uproar"" in the office. Some call centre workers discovered the newest addition to their team, Ben, earned Â£3,000 more than them, while one staff member called Mark was shocked to find out he was on Â£9,000 less than his colleague. ""There were a few rows, some unhappy people - people who found out the person sitting next to them was earning more,"" said Karl. But he said it proved beneficial in the long run, getting the company to create a fairer pay structure and boost the pay of people who were lagging behind. ""It wasn't without pain but it has left us in better stead. We still benefit (now) from the fact that there aren't any outrageous secrets."" The publication of BBC salaries sparked a debate about the gender pay gap - after it was revealed that just one third of 96 stars earning more than Â£150,000 are female. The top seven on the list are all male. Sam Smethers, chief executive of the Fawcett Society, which campaigns for equal rights for women, says the figures reveal the scale of inequality in the BBC. ""What it shows very clearly is that women are both under-represented and undervalued in those top-earning roles at the BBC, although it's useful having the information published today and we welcome it,"" she said. Jane Garvey, who presents Woman's Hour on Radio 4, said women can benefit from the information being in the public domain. ""The cat will not be allowed to get back in the bag,"" she told Radio 4's PM Programme. ""I actually suspect that a lot of women will be energised by this and will take this opportunity to shout and to make their feelings very clear on the issue of their pay. Let's hope that is what happens."" GrantTree director Andrew Ormerod said having pay disparities out in the open has helped get rid of the gender pay gap at his company. He said: ""It cuts out the gender imbalance. We just don't have a gender pay gap. ""The thing about having transparent salaries is that you're naturally going to ask the question as to why this person is paid a different amount of money and you have got to have a reason."" Money may be an awkward topic of conversation, but that isn't the only reason for not shouting about your salary across the office. As BBC director general Tony Hall has pointed out, comparing pay ""is not straightforward"". What you earn can depend on your ""role, education or experience"" says Seamus Nevin, head of employment and skills policy at the Institute of Directors. ""So making direct comparisons can be difficult,"" he added. Dan Walker was listed as earning between Â£200,000 and Â£249,999 a year, while his BBC Breakfast co-host Louise Minchin didn't even make the list. But Dan took to Twitter to clarify, saying he earns the same as Louise for the programme - it is his other BBC commitments in BBC Sport that take his total salary higher. Mr Nevin says knowing you are earning less can create problems in your workplace. ""The problem with talking about pay with colleagues is that it may or may not be reliable information and it can engender bad feelings and poor morale,"" he said. ""This can prove very unhealthy if it means staff are more concerned about everyone around them instead of the overall objectives of the team.""

"Most Americans now believe OJ Simpson is probably guilty, polls show OJ Simpson has been granted parole and could be released from prison as early as October. He was jailed in 2008 for armed robbery after taking memorabilia from his football career from dealers in a Las Vegas hotel room. While the case has no connection to his infamous 1995 acquittal in a double murder trial, Simpson's release would thrust a man that a poll suggeststhree-quarters of Americans,externalbelieve is probably guilty of those killings back into the spotlight. Here's a recap of the key details of the OJ story. Television stations interrupted programming to bring American audiences live pictures of the OJ Simpson car chase One of the defining images of OJ Simpson's fall from grace, for many people, was broadcast live on television on 17 June, 1994. Imagine your childhood sports hero - an icon beloved across the country - suddenly captured in a car chase with police along the freeways of Los Angeles. In the back seat of the white Ford Bronco was Simpson, holding a gun and being driven by an old friend, Al Cowlings. The former NFL player had been charged with the bloody murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman, who had been found stabbed to death outside her condominium in LA's affluent Brentwood neighbourhood. He had earlier agreed to turn himself in to police but decided to flee instead. Before 1994, Simpson was regarded with affection by the American public Crowds waved and egged on the man they called ""The Juice"" - an African-American athlete who had risen to fame in the late 1960s and later used his status as a springboard to a lucrative career in acting, sports commentary and television advertising, including a role in the Naked Gun films. The two-hour chase ended at Simpson's home - where he eventually surrendered. The scenes gripped a nation and the legal proceedings that followed were dubbed ""the trial of the century"" by the American media - with scenes from the courtroom broadcast to millions. Now 70, Simpson will be released in October if he wins parole The media sensation around the OJ trial took place against the backdrop of an America racially divided in its opinion on the case. And the sensational proceedings occurred in a city - Los Angeles - where trust between police and the black community had been shredded by the 1992 acquittal of police officers for using excessive force in the videotaped beating of Rodney King, which triggered the LA riots. Most white Americans thought he was guilty andmost African-Americans thought he was innocent,external, polls suggested. Simpson's alleged history of domestic violence came up during the trial, with police records revealing Nicole Brown Simpson required hospital treatment after being beaten by her husband in early 1989. During the trial, OJ famously tried on a pair of bloody gloves - one of which was found at the murder scene - which did not appear to fit him, a moment seen as a major blow for the prosecution. Simpson was - to the shock of many - found not guilty by the jury of the murders on 3 October 1995. 'OJ Simpson knife' not a murder weapon The Brown and Goldman families eventually won a civil case against OJ Simpson Prosecutors at the double murder trial accused OJ Simpson of beating Nicole Brown Simpson over a period of 17 years The legal ""dream team"" defending him had, as the recent eight-hour, Oscar-winning documentary OJ: Made in America makes clear, put race front and centre in the trial, despite Simpson having not previously associated himself strongly with the black community and the civil rights struggle. ""Not only did we play the race card, we dealt if from the bottom of the deck,"" Robert Shapiro, one of Simpson's lawyers, would say after the verdict. OJ Simpson assembled a legal ""dream team"", including Robert Kardashian (centre) But the families of Ronald Goldman and Nicole Brown Simpson pursued Simpson in a civil case which in 1997 found him responsible for the pair's deaths and ordered him to pay the families tens of millions of dollars - most of which is still outstanding. Ten years later, in September 2007, Simpson and a group of associates stormed a hotel room in Las Vegas where two sports memorabilia dealers had items that Simpson considered to be rightfully his. Two of the men with Simpson were armed. He was convicted in October 2008 on a litany of charges, including armed robbery, assault and kidnapping, and sentenced to at least nine years in prison, and a maximum 33-year term. Some observers, including Simpson's lawyer, described the jury's decision as ""payback"" for the 1995 acquittal. As part of the process of obtaining the money they were owed from the civil case, the Goldman family was in 2007 awarded the rights to If I Did It, Simpson's controversial ghost-written book describing how he would have committed the murders, had he been responsible. They republished it with new commentary but significantly shrank the size of the word ""if"" on the cover, and added the subtitle Confessions of the Killer. And while the 1994 murders remain unsolved, that is how many Americans see ""OJ"" today. 'OJ Simpson knife' not a murder weapon OJ Simpson: The case which divides opinion.

This might help One in three cases of dementia could be prevented if more people looked after their brain health throughout life, according to an international study in the Lancet. It lists nine key risk factors including lack of education, hearing loss, smoking and physical inactivity. The study is being presented at theAlzheimer's Association International Conference,externalin London. By 2050, 131 million people could be living with dementia globally. There are estimated to be 47 million people with the condition at the moment.

""Acting now will vastly improve life for people with dementia and their families and, in doing so, will transform the future of society."" The report, which combines the work of 24 international experts, says lifestyle factors can play a major role in increasing or reducing an individual's dementia risk. It examines the benefits of building a ""cognitive reserve"", which means strengthening the brain's networks so it can continue to function in later life despite damage. Eve Laird is taking part in a study on how to prevent dementia Eve Laird, from Dumfries, is worried about dementia because her mum is living with the condition. She has decided to make some changes to her lifestyle. ""I'm terrible for eating processed foods and takeaways and I've really been trying to cut back on that. ""I definitely drink a lot more water than I used to - and I don't drink as much coffee now. ""I actually took part in the Edinburgh marathon. For that I joined the Dumfries running club - I go there once a week."" She says she felt so much better for the exercise, and for improving her diet. ""I felt a lot healthier and mentally sharper as well. It's something I'd really like to continue, but it is hard to stay on track."" ""I just think the small changes can make such a big difference."" Failure to complete secondary education was a major risk factor, and the authors suggest that individuals who continue to learn throughout life are likely to build additional brain reserves. Another major risk factor is hearing loss in middle age - the researchers say this can deny people a cognitively rich environment and lead to social isolation and depression, which are among other potentially modifiable risk factors for dementia. Another key message from the report is that what is good for the heart is good for the brain. Not smoking, doing exercise, keeping a healthy weight, treating high blood pressure and diabetes can all reduce the risk of dementia, as well as cardiovascular disease, and cancer. The researchers say they did not have enough data to include dietary factors or alcohol in their calculations but believe both could be important. Dr Doug Brown, director of research at Alzheimer's Society, said: ""Though it's not inevitable, dementia is currently set to be the 21st Century's biggest killer. We all need to be aware of the risks and start making positive lifestyle changes."" Dr David Reynolds, chief scientific officer at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: ""Alongside prevention research, we must continue to invest in research to find a life-changing treatment for people with this devastating condition.""

"Amanda Wong and her daughter Naomi use the Goldman Sachs nursery Head into the Goldman Sachs building on London's Fleet Street and you're greeted by wall to wall marble, a bank of receptionists and a water feature. So far, so City. But wind your way past the lifts through an anonymous fire door and you enter a world that couldn't be less corporate. The sounds, colours and laughter of a nursery. The Goldman Sachs Children's Centre is both incongruous - and an anomaly - the only onsite childcare facility in the Square Mile. Started in 2003 to offer back up provision for staff, it takes kids between the ages of three months and 12 years old. The expense and regulatory requirements for such a facility are the main reasons why it is unique - and peculiar to a bank with deep pockets. This is part of a day of BBC coverage looking at the cost of holiday childcare. Find out more at bbc.co.uk/business or follow the conversation on social media using the hashtag #Childcare According to the latest figures from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, only 5% of businesses in the UK now offer childcare in the workplace. Anecdotally, this is almost exclusively made up of large employers because they have the money and space to allow for it. They include government departments, Royal Mail, a variety of universities, Microsoft and Toyota. There are tax breaks for those companies that do. The onsite childcare at Goldman Sachs takes children from three months to 12 years old Employers who include childcare as part of the employee remuneration package, attract tax, National Insurance and reporting obligations. However, employers that offer in-workplace nurseries don't - and they get relief for the day-to-day running and capital costs of providing the service, for example heating and lighting, and premises. It might be seen as a perk now, but onsite childcare flourished in the immediate post-war years out of necessity. A labour shortage meant that women were needed to work - and factories and mills started to offer the creches that allowed them to. Dr Laura Paterson of Oxford University, who specialises in the history of women's employment, says that childcare provision by businesses died away in the 1950s as the need for women became less acute and the way they worked changed. ""Part-time and flexible working hours reduced the need for workplace nurseries to some extent,"" she says, ""Women who worked from the 1950s to the 70s tell us that they did part-time jobs when their children were young to fit around school hours. And they worked in the evening so that their partner could care for their children."" Staff at Goldman Sachs are allowed 20 days of emergency childcare a year But what about those working full-time at Goldman? For Amanda Wong, who project manages new trades for the firm and is a mum to 12-month-old Naomi, the children's centre has been a lifesaver. Ms Wong put her daughter into nursery the same day she returned to work, shortly after Naomi turned nine months. ""It has made me feel a lot more relaxed and mentally ready to come back to work a lot earlier than I would have and I think it helps new mums with separation guilt or anxieties about returning to work,"" she says. Though she admits it's not ideal to take a one-year-old on the Tube through central London each day. Summer childcare costs on the rise Counting the cost of school holidays 'Bring your children to work' 'Without a creche I couldn't work' Six alternative ways to fix the childcare problem Ishmeet Rayit, who manages the Goldman Sachs Children's Centre, tells me they have a higher staff ratio than Ofsted regulations require (one-to-two in the baby room rather than one-to-three), because they need to make children who might not be familiar with them, settle in quickly. Of the 5,500 people who work in the office, about a quarter are registered users. Each parent at the bank gets 20 free ""back-up"" days to use the centre, renewed each year. The most coveted facility in the centre is the after-school and holiday programme where the 5-12 year olds come. It's stuffed full of bilingual books and toys, showing just how multicultural the bank is. ""The kids call it an office day,"" Ms Rayit says. ""They get taken out for lunch by their parents and they make friends here."" Parents are only allowed to book 10 days of this holiday service at a time, the room can accommodate 12, and the waiting list to get in is long. Goldman Sachs is in two old newspaper offices on London's Fleet Street Sally Boyle, the international head of human resources at Goldman, says it is a ""significant cost"" to the firm - but it is worth it. ""We've definitely seen it have an impact on retention of a smallish group of women but important women who wouldn't have stayed I suspect if they hadn't been able to manage that childcare in a way that they can here,"" she says. The centre is run by Bright Horizons, the largest provider of workplace nurseries in the UK. Goldman pays it a monthly management fee, and parents who need childcare beyond that paid for by the bank, deal directly with the nursery. A spokesperson for the company says that demand for onsite care is increasing. ""In today's competitive talent market, recruiting and retaining exceptional people is a high priority for organisations. ""Onsite childcare has been identified as a key factor in encouraging parents to return to work and, in turn, helping organisations to thrive"". But Rohan Silva, whose Second Home drop-in work spaces are planning in-house creches, says the barriers to entry today of setting up onsite childcare are enormous. ""The Ofsted accreditation process takes at least three months, and costs hundreds of pounds in registration costs and consultancy fees. In addition, there are multiple additional inspections each year, plus a chronic shortage of trained staff,"" he says. Second Home found designing its onsite creches difficult ""Another challenge is the fact that so few architects and designers have ever designed childcare facilities, because so few are created by property developers. That means thinking from scratch the issues around access and child-friendly materials,"" Mr Silva says. He believes it's a vital way of allowing more parents to work. ""The UK's rate of maternal employment is 27% lower than other Western countries - making childcare more accessible will make a big difference. ""This is especially true of single parents - who are much more likely to be unemployed, and for whom access to childcare is the biggest barrier to finding work,"" Mr Silva adds. A recent Institute of Directors survey backs this up. It found over half of its members think that the cost of childcare hurts careers - particularly those of women. It is currently consulting on whether to open a creche for its members. For now, though unlike those women working in factories after the war, the option of taking your child to work is offered at a company's largesse rather than out of compulsion. And it's reserved for a privileged few.

"Hugging at work is apparently on the rise Are you a hugger or a hand shaker - or neither? When a work colleague returns from holiday or maternity leave, do you go in for the double bear-hug, or a friendly hello from across the desk? For those people who prefer a non-physical greeting, the direction of office etiquette may be moving against you. There is evidence that workplaces are seeing a rise in hugging culture. In asurvey,externallast year more than half of advertising and marketing executives said hugging was common, up from a third in the survey in 2011. Experts say it could have a lot to do with more relaxed workplace environments. But there's a downside. A separatestudy,externallast year on sexual harassment in the US fast food industry found that more than a quarter of workers felt they were hugged inappropriately. Deborah Wallsmith, an assistant professor of anthropology at Kennesaw State University, Georgia, says that the gradations of hug discomfort depend upon nuances, relationships, and personal preferences. ""The least offensive is the one armed side-by-side hug, where the huggers are standing next to each other, and extend their adjacent arms around each other's waist. ""The most objectionable is the full-frontal squeeze that goes on forever."" She adds that she ""feels uncomfortable getting hugged by former professors and former bosses"". Kara Deringer, a business coach from Alberta, Canada, explains that context is all-important. Yet many people get it wrong. Kara Deringer accepts that hugging is a social minefield She agrees that hugging can be very useful. ""It creates connections."" But on the other hand, she says: ""Be careful. I have seen lots of misunderstandings. ""I currently work in a team, and we're huggers. But there are those who will courageously say 'I'm not a hugger'."" Ms Deringer recommends either asking people for a hug, or paying very close attention to body language. ""If they reach out their hand? I've got it, they're hand shaker or a high fiver."" And beware another minefield - the sociological layers of power, culture, and gender. All can have their own ""rules"" for physical contact, says Ms Deringer. ""It's also about social intelligence - I won't hug someone I just met."" Tracey Smolinski is also in a work culture where hugging is acceptable. The chief executive of Cardiff-based Introbiz, which hosts business networking events, says: ""We are quite a friendly team, and usually give a kiss on the face, both cheeks, when we are familiar with them. ""But if you don't know them, best not to kiss or hug, because you don't know how they will take it. You have to be careful."" Some of this may sound like commonsense. But what if hugging is standard practice in your office, but you really don't want to indulge? Are you the office grinch? One person's hug can be very unwanted Toronto-based musician Cynthia Pike-Elliott, who has had careers in healthcare and law enforcement, says that in both environments hugging was standard. ""Hugging was a huge part of my workplace, a huge part in maintaining these personal relationships,"" she says. For her, hugging is ""a way to say to someone that you've made a connection with them, and that you trust themâ¦ It's not hurting anyone. ""If I was an employee, a hug from my employer would show their pride and gratitude of a job well done much more than words could ever accomplish,"" she says. Ms Pike-Elliott adds that if a business owner hugs a client, it ""shows trust and validates that the client is special, it builds a solid relationship"". In her role as a musician she has found colleagues and acquaintances more ""huggy"" than most. ""Music and arts is about revealing your soul. It's very personal,"" she says. Cynthia Pike-Elliott says that in her industry, hugging is very common Not everyone's so keen on the idea of hugging, however. Sometimes, it ends up in court. Earlier this year, California corrections officer Victoria Zetwick California accused her superior, the county sheriff, of giving more than a hundred unwanted hugs over a dozen years. A court said it was enough to constitute a ""hostile environment"".

Putting the fun back into dance classes Can you be taught to be more charismatic? Does selling up mean selling out? Canadian labour lawyer Shaun Bernstein advises against hugs in the office, particularly in light of the province of Ontario's update to its Occupational Health and Safety Act last September. This included more provisions against workplace harassment and unwelcome attention. Mr Bernstein says: ""If the hug is taken in the wrong way, it can easily be construed under the law as workplace sexual harassment, which places a responsibility on the employer to investigate... ""There's the specific prohibition when it comes from a person in power, so I think that that's important to note."" It is also the responsibility of the company to have a designated harassment complaints officer, as well as a back-up person in case the officer is the one causing trouble. Mr Bernstein adds: ""Employers have a serious responsibility when it comes to protecting their workers against harassment, and are obligated to have policies in place to prevent this kind of conduct."" Always remember that work friends are not the same as real friends, says Adina Zaiontz For Adina Zaiontz, chief executive of Napkin Marketing, in Toronto, the simple rule is: ""When in doubt, don't hug... Everyone feels differently about personal space and boundaries."" It's possible to hug and still avoid full body contact, she adds. So, when does she feel it's OK? Someone you are close to at work is very upset, and confiding to you about a death or personal tragedy in their life Someone you are close to at work is telling you big, happy personal news, ""I'm engaged!"" ""I'm pregnant!"" A close co-worker or employee is telling you they got a new job, and the departure is on good terms You meet a colleague whom you haven't seen in a very long time You're at a party and everyone is being a little extra huggier Ms Zaiontz adds: ""No matter what you think, your work friends are different than your real friends. Your real friends can't call HR on you.""

"Chris Evans is the BBC's highest-paid star The BBC's most highly paid male presenters could be asked to accept lower wages as the corporation tries to close the gender pay gap. The BBC has defendedhigh salaries which were revealed in its annual reporton Wednesday. The corporation has pledged to achieve equality between men and women on air by 2020. BBC director of radio and education James Purnell said pay cuts were part of the solution. He told the BBC's Newsnight programme: ""Quite a lot of men have been taking pay cuts; John Humphrys said that today on air."" This video can not be played BBC executive James Purnell says ""quite a lot of men"" have taken pay cuts already Asked if he expected more male, on-air talent to take a pay cut, he responded: ""I'm not going to start negotiating live on air, but that's clearly one of the levers we can pull, and we have been doing that."" Culture Secretary Karen Bradley said stars should be conscious ""how this looks in public"", while Labour MP Harriet Harman said there was ""clearly discrimination"" at the BBC. How much do the BBC's stars earn? Reality Check: The gender pay gap Stars react to their salaries being revealed What does industry make of star pay? BBC director general Tony Hall has said there is ""more to do"" on the gender pay gap. The top seven earners, in the list of the BBC's 96 best-paid stars, were all male. It is the first time the pay of stars earning more than Â£150,000 has been made public. The BBC was compelled to make public the information under the terms of its new Royal Charter. Radio 2 DJ Chris Evans was the top-paid star on between Â£2.2m and Â£2.25m, the BBC's 2016-17 annual report revealed. Strictly Come Dancing host Claudia Winkleman was the highest-paid female, earning between Â£450,000 and Â£500,000. The One Show's Alex Jones was second, earning between Â£400,000 and Â£450,000. Anne Mcelvoy, senior editor at the Economist, told BBC's Today programme that the disclosures would force the BBC to look at the differentials between men and women. She rejected the suggestion that the list merely reflected a patchwork of different negotiations with different agents, saying there was a ""very clear pattern"" that had persisted for a long time that showed the BBC had failed to help women get on. Peter Fincham, a former controller of BBC One, said the BBC had been wrong to try to resist transparency around ""talent"" pay, and Wednesday's disclosures would mean there would now be restraint in pulling out the cheque book for talent. Trade union Equity said in a statement: ""The apparent pay gaps in gender and for those from a black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) background are troubling."" George Alagiah, Jason Mohammad and Trevor Nelson are the highest paid BAME presenters, each receiving between Â£250,000 and Â£300,000. The highest-paid female star with a BAME background is news presenter Mishal Husain, who earned between Â£200,000 and Â£250,000. The figures quoted only refer to the amount of licence fee money each person receives and do not include their earnings from other broadcasters or commercial activities. The annual report does not include stars who receive their pay through BBC Worldwide, the corporation's commercial arm. The figures also exclude stars paid through independent production companies.

"Glenna Duram has been found guilty of the murder of her husband Martin A woman has been found guilty of shooting her husband five times in a Michigan murder case apparently witnessed by a parrot. Glenna Duram shot her husband, Martin, in front of the couple's pet in 2015, before turning the gun on herself in a failed suicide attempt. The parrot later repeated the words ""Don't shoot!"" in the victim's voice, according to Mr Duram's ex-wife. The parrot, an African Grey named Bud, was not used in the court proceedings. The jury found Mrs Duram, 49, guilty of first-degree murder following a day of deliberations. She will be sentenced next month. She suffered a head wound in the incident in the couple's Sand Lake home in May 2015, but survived. Mr Duram's mother Lillian said it ""hurt"" to witness Mrs Duram ""emotionless"" in court as evidence was presented in the case of her son's death,local media report,external. ""It just isn't good; just isn't good. Two years is a long time to wait for justice,"" she said. Bud the African Grey parrot, similar to the one pictured, apparently has ""the filthiest mouth around"" Mr Duram's ex-wife Christina Keller, who now owns Bud, earlier said she believed the parrotwas repeating a conversationfrom the night of the murder, which she said ended with the phrase ""don't shoot!"", with an expletive added. Mr Duram's parents agreed it was possible that the foul-mouthed bird had overheard the couple arguing and was repeating their final words. ""I personally think he was there, and he remembers it and he was saying it"", Mr Duram's father told local media at the time. His mother, Lillian Duram, added: ""That bird picks up everything and anything, and it's got the filthiest mouth around."" A prosecutor in Michigan initially considered using the parrot's squawkings as evidence in the murder trial, but this was later dismissed.

"Is a culture of highly selective universities getting in the way of social mobility? The long-running battle over grammar schools - put back into the deep freeze after the general election result - saw deep-rooted divisions over the impact of dividing pupils by academic ability. Opponents argued that academic selection really became social selection - and that what appeared to be selection by ability became a filter shaped by social background. But when it comes to university, it seems that such attitudes are turned on their head. It's not even even really questioned that higher education should operate on an entry system specifically outlawed in secondary education. So why shouldn't there be comprehensive universities? That's the argument put by Tim Blackman, vice-chancellor of Middlesex University, in what Nick Hillman, the influential director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, said was one of the ""most thought-provoking papers ever published on UK higher education"". Prof Blackman's contention is that the university system, with its obsession with hierarchies and rankings, has become a barrier to meritocracy. Instead of driving social mobility, he says, the university system has become a mirror to existing inequalities and is amplifying social segregation. At the top are the highest ranking powerhouse universities, Oxford and Cambridge and the leading London institutions, followed by the rest of the Russell Group universities and then down through the ranks of red-bricks, 1960s campuses, middling institutions and then on to the ""new universities"" that were often former polytechnics. This is also a system without any real relegation or promotion on merit - as a university group such as the Russell Group can choose who is or isn't a member. Should brighter students be spread more widely throughout the system? Prof Blackman sees this not as an academic ladder, but a stratified class system. Even if more young people from disadvantaged families are going to university, there is still a strong pattern of better-off teenagers getting into the highest ranked universities. He talks of ""hyper-selection"" at the top of the table, in the scramble for places at the most sought after institutions. And this creates a system in which a ""good"" university is likely to be synonymous with being the most selective. This, says Prof Blackman, is the opposite of what the country needs from a higher education system. If the UK is blighted with low productivity and a skills gap, he says, what is needed are universities that are strong across the whole range of institutions. The brightest students should be spread across the system, rather than being clustered in a small number of universities crammed with other similar youngsters. And he proposes the benefits of a comprehensive university, with a mixed ability intake, making the most of the talent of those who attend - rather than concentrating the prestige, funding and brightest students in a few institutions, to the detriment of the majority. The analogy used is that a ""good"" hospital would be one that got the best outcomes for its patients, not the one that started out with the healthiest intake. But even with this radical thinking, Prof Blackman still suggests that there would be an economic argument for a handful of elite institutions - ""strategically important world-class research universities"". And it remains easier to identify the flaws in the current system than to propose a practical way of changing it. What should be the purpose of a modern university? Prof Blackman suggests that the funding system should be shaped to reward universities that create a social mix of students. But, he says, the current arrangements of high and low status institutions are ""based on snobbery and discrimination rather than evidence"". The concept of a non-selective university might seem strange. It seems to go against the grain of the idea that university is the summit of a journey after getting over a series of tough exams. But Prof Blackman says the higher education system needs to borrow from the comprehensive principle if it is going to make a difference to social equality and to address the needs of an economy demanding more highly skilled staff. ""The root of these problems is academic selection, which has created a sector based on social class advantages,"" he says. The government has tried to shake up the old order in universities somewhat, grading the quality of teaching, in a way that has put some top institutions at the back of the queue. Universities Minister Jo Johnson said: ""Social mobility should be at the heart of our higher education system. This is becoming the case, with more students from disadvantaged backgrounds going to and staying at university than ever before. ""But we know there is more work to do. Soon, all providers - including the most selective - will be required to publish application, drop-out and attainment data by gender, ethnicity and socio-economic background. ""The Teaching Excellence Framework is also refocusing the sector's attention on teaching - putting in place incentives that will raise standards and encourage providers to ensure they are supporting students throughout their studies.""

"David Davis, left, and Michel Barnier The UK and EU are still at odds over citizens' rights and the amount the UK will pay to leave the bloc, at the end of the second week of Brexit talks. EU negotiator Michel Barnier said the UK had not been clear enough about where it stands on these issues and that was hampering progress. UK Brexit Secretary David Davis said the negotiations on the so-called divorce bill had been ""robust"". He said progress had been made but both sides needed to show ""flexibility"". Brexit: All you need to know The people who will negotiate Brexit Katya Adler: The EU negotiator Mr Barnier said: ""We require this clarification on the financial settlement, on citizens' rights, on Ireland - with the two key points of the common travel area and the Good Friday Agreement - and the other separation issues where this week's experience has quite simply shown we make better progress where our respective positions are clear."" Mr Davis said: ""We have had robust but constructive talks this week. Clearly there's a lot left to talk about and further work before we can resolve this. Ultimately, getting to a solution will require flexibility from both sides."" This video can not be played The EU Brexit negotiator calls for legal certainty' over citizens' rights Michel Barnier said there had been some areas of agreement about how Britons living abroad and EU nationals living in the UK should be treated after Brexit. Ajointly agreed ""technical note"" outlining the UK and EU's positions on citizens' rights,externalhas been published. But there was disagreement over ""the rights of future family members"" - meaning children born in the future to EU citizens in the UK - and ""the exports of certain social benefits"". The EU wants rights currently enjoyed by EU citizens in the UK - access to healthcare, welfare, education - to apply to children and family members, whether they currently live in the UK or not, and to continue in perpetuity, after the death or divorce of the rights-holder. But it says children born to UK citizens in EU states after the withdrawal date would be considered ""family members"", not rights holders themselves - the UK says it would allow children born to EU citizens to acquire the same ""settled status"" or, in some cases, British citizenship. The UK wants to give all EU nationals living in the UK the same rights as British citizens once they have been resident in the country for five years, as long as they arrived before a specified ""cut-off"" date, probably 29 March 2017, when Article 50 was triggered. After this date, they could continue to build up their five years' entitlement if necessary. The EU's position also requires that citizens live in a host country for five years before acquiring permanent residency rights. In addition, EU nationals who get married after March 2019 would lose the right to bring family members to the UK, unless they pass an income test, like non-EU migrants. They could also risk losing their right to return to Britain if they leave for more than two years - as would be the case for British citizens in EU countries. The UK says it is prepared to offer some flexibility on this for some citizens on overseas postings or studying abroad and wants the EU to offer the same. David Davis said the UK hadpublished its approach to citizens' rights,externalsince the first round of negotiations, which he described as ""both a fair and serious offer"" and had now published a joint paper setting out areas of agreement, and issues for further talks. He said sticking points in the talks included the rights of employees of EU-based companies to work for extended periods in other countries, such as the UK. British officials highlighted that British expats would lose the rights to vote and stand in local elections under the EU plan - while the UK position is to protect the rights of citizens to vote and stand in elections in their host country. EU negotiators have said that British people living in an EU country would lose their guaranteed rights if they moved to another EU country. A senior EU source said there was a willingness to be flexible on this point during the negotiations, depending on the UK's position in the next set of talks. Senior British sources called the proposal ""unprecedented"" as it would leave British expats with worse rights than those coming from outside the EU and it would be ""interesting"" to see what the public reaction would be to it. David Davis and Michel Barnier stood at matching podiums in Brussels, side by side but not entirely in step. Mr Davis talked breezily about work done constructively and ""at pace"" and even injected a slightly bantering note into proceedings, quoting back to Mr Barnier his own earlier warning line that ""the clock is ticking"". Mr Barnier's take appeared to be slightly less positive and was much more focused on the need for further clarification from the UK side on a whole range of issues - we counted him using the word clarification or variations on it at least eight times in a relatively short news conference. There are plenty of briefings around on points of detail - would the UK for example have the right to conduct blanket criminal record checks on EU citizens applying for residence in post-Brexit UK. But the big stumbling blocks are obvious and have been obvious for a while. One is the ""divorce bill"" - when will a figure emerge into the public domain and what might the UK be prepared to pay. The other is the future role of the European Court of Justice in overseeing the rights of EU citizens who remain in the UK - the EU sees that as a basic right but from the British perspective it's being seen as ""a very big ask"". This video can not be played David Davis said he was 'encouraged by progress' in Brexit talks Britain has agreed in principle to meet its financial obligations as it leaves the EU, to cover things like the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and the pensions of EU officials. But a senior EU source said the UK negotiating team had not said what they might be prepared to pay - and there had been no ""serious discussions"" about what the bill might include. David Davis said: ""We both recognise the importance of sorting out the obligations we have to one another, both legally and in a spirit of mutual cooperation."" But Michel Barnier has called for ""clarification"" on where the UK stands. UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has said the EU can ""go whistle"" if it demands an ""extortionate"" payment but other ministers have struck a more conciliatory tone. Sources have suggested to the BBC the bill could be between 30 and 50 billion euros. Downing Street said the UK was ""looking at the legal commitments"" it faces, adding: ""There are points of difference and that's one of them."" But there were no plans to produce a position paper on the divorce bill, the No 10 spokesman said. David Davis rejected the suggestion that there was a lack of clarity from his team on Northern Ireland, saying the two sides had discussed ways of ""achieving a flexible and imaginative solution to address the unique circumstances around the border"" and preserve the common travel area. A senior EU source said they were still waiting for concrete proposals from the UK side on the kind of border that is achievable.

Michel and I are going for a good deal."" Gibraltar did not come up as an issue in the current round of talks, sources say. Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the ""lack of progress"" on issues such as the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in Europe was ""deeply concerning"" and would cause ""anxiety for millions of families"". He questioned whether phase two of the talks could get under way in October as planned, something that would ""trigger deep concern for businesses and communities across the UK"". ""The reality is that we have a government that is unprepared, divided and incapable of securing a good deal for Britain. We urgently need a fresh approach,"" he added. The EU has said talks won't move on to the subject of future trading arrangements until it judges there's been adequate progress on the separation issues. The two sides are meeting for four days each month, with this week's talks aimed at scoping out points of difference and common ground in those areas that have been identified as requiring urgent attention. Mr Barnier has said the EU side are hoping to agree the basic terms of a deal on EU citizens and the exit bill in October - which he says would open the way for talks on the UK's future trade relations with the EU to begin in December. Meanwhile, the UK government has announced that MPs are set to debate the repeal bill - a key piece of Brexit legislation that will transform EU laws into British laws - for two days from 7 September.

"Mr McCain is ""reviewing treatment options"", a statement says Veteran US Republican Senator John McCain has been diagnosed with brain cancer and is reviewing treatment options, according to his office. The options may include chemotherapy and radiation, his doctors said. The 80-year-old politician is in ""good spirits"" recovering at home. He thanked those who had wished him well and said he would be back soon. The tumour was discovered during a surgery to remove a blood clot from above his left eye last week. A Vietnam veteran, Mr McCain spent more than five years as a prisoner of war. The six-term senator and 2008 Republican presidential candidate underwent surgery at a clinic in Phoenix, in the state of Arizona, last Friday. Tissue analysis revealed that a primary brain tumour known as glioblastoma was associated with the clot, a statement from the Mayo Clinic said. ""The senator's doctors say he is recovering from his surgery 'amazingly well' and his underlying health is excellent,"" it added. ""Treatment options may include a combination of chemotherapy and radiation."" Senior Republicans and Democrats wished him a speedy recovery, prompting Mr McCain totweet,externalhis thanks, and a warning: ""I greatly appreciate the outpouring of support - unfortunately for my sparring partners in Congress, I'll be back soon, so stand-by!"" ByJames Cook, BBC North America correspondent John McCain is known in Washington as a tough, independent-minded senator - a warrior who is now facing another battle against cancer. He earned his reputation the hard way, being shot down as a US Navy pilot over Vietnam where he was held as a prisoner of war for more than five years, including two in solitary confinement. Repeatedly beaten and tortured, Mr McCain was never again able to raise his arms above his head. During the most recent presidential election campaign, Donald Trump belittled the senator as ""not a war hero"" saying ""I like people who weren't captured"". Many Americans were horrified. Mr McCain may have annoyed many Republicans by arguing for reforms to campaign finance and immigration laws. He may have irritated opponents of America's many wars with his forceful arguments in favour of the projection of US military might. But this country reveres its veterans. The attacks on John McCain's personal sacrifice were roundly condemned then - and millions of Americans will be praying for his recovery now. Glioblastoma is a particularlyaggressive brain tumour,external, and increases in frequency with age, affecting more men than women. Mr McCain, who is the chairman of the Senate Committee on Armed Services, was in ""good spirits as he continues to recover at home with his family"", his office said.

"Reported sexual offences on trains have more than doubled in the past five years, according to statistics obtained by BBC Radio 5 live. British Transport Police figures show 1,448 offences were reported in 2016-17, up from 650 in 2012-2013. Campaigners say the rise shows the importance of work done by authorities to encourage women to report incidents. The majority of the incidents recorded were sexual assaults on females aged 13 and above. The reports cover England, Scotland and Wales and include the London Underground. The figures came to light following a freedom of information request from BBC Radio 5 live Investigates to British Transport Police (BTP). One charity said the rise in the figures might be a response to better awareness of how to report offences among victims, rather than a rise in incidents. Rachel Krys, co-director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, praised the effort BTP and train companies have put into campaigns to encourage victims to report abuse. She said the rise in reported offences does not suggest women are more at risk than a few years ago. This video can not be played Jessica Brady was sexually assaulted whilst travelling home on the Tube ""It is really important that these campaigns continue. When the scale of sexual violence is better understood, police forces take it more seriously and measures can be taken to reduce the risks to women and tackle perpetrators, who for too long had been acting with impunity."" ""Research on the London Underground last year showed that the majority of these offences happen during rush hour, dispelling the myth that this is anything to do with a late-night drinking culture. ""These figures showed that it is sober men, travelling to and from work who thought they were entitled to assault women passengers, and that they would get away with it."" Journalist Imogen Groome was a victim of such a rush hour attack earlier this year on the London Underground. Ms Groome's experience has encouraged others to come forward ""I felt something against me, at first I just thought it was someone's bag or something but it continued. I realised what was happening, he was rubbing himself up against me. I was unable to move for about 10 minutes until the carriage got quieter. Then he moved away. ""My first thought was don't shout, he might have a knife, I felt angry and upset, I spoke to my editor when I arrived at work who said I should write it down. ""I didn't report it, felt like there was nobody to tell at the time. I didn't feel comfortable doing it. ""I have spoken to other women since telling my story in public and encouraged them to report incidents, I think it is the right thing to do. ""I don't feel like I can travel on public transport when it will be crowded. I plan ahead and get the bus."" Detective Chief Inspector Darren Malpas from BTP said: ""When the'Report it to stop it' campaign,externallaunched, we fully expected to record a rise in sexual offences and it is pleasing that previously reluctant victims of sexual offences now have the confidence to report this to us. ""Tackling all forms of unwanted sexual behaviour on public transport is a priority for British Transport Police and we have worked hard in recent years to send a clear message to victims that they will be taken seriously and we will investigate offences.""

"Mike Ashley said Sports Direct was on course to become the ""Selfridges of sport"" Profits at Sports Direct have plummeted nearly 60%, which the retailer said was largely due to the weaker pound. The slide in sterling means the firm has had to pay more for its imported goods, and its underlying pre-tax profit fell to Â£113.7m from Â£275.2m. However, chief executive Mike Ashley said trading at its new ""flagship"" stores was going well. Sports Direct's reputation has been badly hit by revelations about staff conditions at its Derbyshire warehouse. Chairman Keith Hellawell said the company had made ""positive progress"" across the business as it continued to ""strive to ensure that all of our people are treated with dignity and respect"". A recent survey of workers in Shirebrook, to which 3,300 people responded, had showed that an ""overwhelming majority"" of people in the warehouse ""currently feel they are treated with respect"", he added. Staff had elected the company's first UK workers' representative and Mr Hellawell said he had ""no doubt"" their ""contribution will prove invaluable to the board as the Sports Direct family continues to move forward together"". Sports Direct, which has been without a chief financial officer since last October, also said it had appointed Jon Kempster to the role. Mr Kempster is set to join the company on 11 September. Mr Ashley said Sports Direct was trying to ""conservatively manage the currency volatility that is reflected in our full year results"". Sports Direct imports many of its products from abroad and the pound's fall against the dollar had led to a ""significant fall in profits"", he added. However, he said the company had now put in place hedging arrangements to ""minimise the short-term impact of currency volatility"". The company's key strategy is to turn itself into the ""Selfridges of sport"", and Mr Hellawell said the ""elevation of our retail proposition continues to be a key objective"". Sports Direct said it was forming a ""new strategic partnership"" with sportswear firm Asics. The Japanese company will manage dedicated areas within Sports Direct's new upmarket ""premium"" stores. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said this had been a ""transformational"" year for Sports Direct. Progress was being made on the new premium stores, he said, and they were ""a lot more profitable than the existing Sports Direct stores"". The retailer's shares rose by 6% following the release of the results as investors appeared to welcomed the progress it was making to move upmarket. In recent months, Sports Direct has bought 26% stake in Game Digital, increased its stake in Debenhams, acquired lingerie firm Agent Provocateur and snapped up the US sports clothing and outdoor equipment chains Bob's Stores and Eastern Mountain Sports. The company's ""spending spree on acquisitions"" had affected profits, Mr Wilson said. ""That's something to bear in mind when we're looking at these figures and also what that does is it puts Sports Direct in a better position to make a strategic move in, for example, the department store area or in the US with its US acquisitions."" It doesn't look good on paper. But for analysts watching the company this seems like the beginning of the end of a difficult period for Sports Direct. Financially, it's now protected against a further drop in the pound. Better late than never. Reputationally, the damage it suffered from its alleged Dickensian treatment of workers is being addressed with a worker on the board of the company. It's smartening up its shops and restating its goal to be the ""Selfridges of sport"". The monkey isn't quite off its back. Chief executive Mike Ashley is still facing a court case about a Â£15m pub bet, which is generating colourful headlines. But as the chairman ends his statement by saying, Sports Direct has been a big contributor to the UK economy with thousands of jobs and billions in tax. Sports Direct: 'Selfridges' of sports?

"Files from the National Archives reveal that the British government supported the release of the Nazi war criminal Rudolf Hess as early as 1956. Rudolf Hess was Adolf Hitler's deputy and, for a while, one of the most powerful figures in Nazi Germany. He is mainly remembered for flying to Britain in 1941 in a bizarre and unsuccessful solo peace mission, which resulted in his arrest and imprisonment for the rest of World War Two. After the war Hess was sentenced to life imprisonment and spent the rest of his days in Berlin's Spandau Prison. For much of his time he was its only inmate. But Foreign Office files released on Thursday show that the British supported Hess's release more than three decades before his suicide in 1987. Hess was sentenced at the Nuremberg trials in 1946 by the so-called Four Powers - the UK, the US, France and Russia - and support for his release was needed by all of them before any change could be made. By 1966, the six other prisoners held in Spandau - including Hitler's architect, Albert Speer - had been freed or had died. Hess, by this time 72, was to remain Spandau's solitary prisoner for the rest of his life. While healthy for his age, Hess was inevitably frail. His son organised a campaign for his release, receiving considerable press coverage in West Germany. There was also growing support for this in the UK. Hess at the Nuremberg trials, sitting next to Hermann Goering Rudolf Hess: Inside the mind of Hitler's deputy The enduring myth of Rudolf Hess Top Nazi Rudolf Hess exhumed from 'pilgrimage' grave Hess landing in Scotland recalled The files show the British government stepped up its efforts to have him freed. In 1979, just after becoming Foreign Secretary, Lord Carrington wrote a particularly strong note to his Soviet counterpart Andrei Gromyko. ""It would be both inhumane and pointless,"" he said, ""to insist that this old man should die in prison."" In all, the British made 11 unilateral appeals for Hess to be freed. The Americans and French supported them in a further nine. The Soviets always refused to consider the case. Nearly 40 years after the end of the war, Soviet politicians and diplomats argued that the release of such a leading figure in the Nazi regime would not be understood by the Soviet people, or by others who had suffered. One diplomat said he was not convinced by the so-called humanitarian argument - ""The suffering which he and other Nazis had inflicted was not human,"" he said. Tony Le Tissier was the last British governor of Spandau, holding the post in the decade leading up to Hess's death. There were also French, American and Russian governors - they took turns to run the prison, for a month at a time. Tony Le Tissier, the last British governor of Spandau prison The rules of Spandau, drawn up after the Nuremberg trials, were harsh. Prisoners were only to be addressed by their number, never their name. Punishments were strict. When in 1955 Hess failed to greet a Soviet warder, he  lost all his reading materials for 10 days. Prisoners could be put on bread and water, or placed in punishment cells. But Le Tissier says that by the time he arrived, the regime was far more relaxed. Although Hess was supposed to be called Number Seven, not everyone stuck to that - some officers did address him by name. He was not supposed to watch the television news - but that wasn't rigidly enforced either. He could go into the garden when he chose, and he had two cooks to prepare any meal he wanted. ""He ate an awful lot!"" says Le Tissier. ""Quite a surprising amount."" Le Tissier did chat to Hess but he says the prisoner never talked about his past: ""It was a closed circle - never came into it."" Neither did they ever talk about the news or politics. Constructed in 1876 on Berlin's Wilhelmstrasse in the western district of Spandau Initially used as a military detention centre, the prison held civilian inmates from 1919 and was used by the Gestapo during Nazi rule Apart from Hess, the prison held six other Nazi prisoners after WW2 - Konstantin von Neurath, Erich Raeder, Karl Donitz, Walther Funk, Albert Speer and Baldur von Schirach After Hess's death, the building was immediately demolished to prevent it becoming a neo-Nazi shrine. A shopping centre was later built on the site While Le Tissier tried to make Hess's stay as comfortable as possible, organising new chairs for his room for instance and a new bed, he did not personally agree with the argument that he should have been freed. Le Tissier thinks Hess deserved to die in prison, for all that he had done. ""He got his just deserts,"" he says. ""He was a fanatical Nazi - an enemy. I did feel very strongly that he was there till he finished."" In August 1987 Hess killed himself, wrapping a lamp cord round his neck. Some suggested he was helped but Le Tissier is convinced that Hess acted unaided. Security was extremely tight in Spandau, he says. There was only one key to the gate, and only the chief warder had it. Le Tissier recalls his reaction: ""It was a fait accompli - it was over."" He thinks it was a good thing. ""It was such a waste of time and money, involving so many people.""

"The proportion of first-class degrees has more than trebled since the 1990s The proportion of top degree grades being awarded by UK universities has soared - with some universities giving first-class degrees to more than a third of their students. The University of Surrey awarded a first-class degree to 41% of students last year, more than doubling the proportion five years ago. And firsts awarded at the University of East Anglia have almost trebled to 37%. Professor of education Alan Smithers called it ""chronic grade inflation"". Among the prestigious Russell Group of universities more than a quarter of students received a first-class degree. The Press Association survey, analysing figures for 2015-16 from the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA), indicates it is now more common to graduate with a first-class degree than a lower second (2:2) grade - with 24% getting a first last year, compared with 21% getting a  lower second. The most widely awarded degree was an upper second (2:1), received by about 51%. The figures from HESA go back only as far as 1994 - when 7% of students received a first, but they show the proportion of firsts has more than trebled in the past two decades, up to 24% last year. Among the 148 universities with comparable data, only a handful saw fewer first-class degrees last year than five years previously, with a number having doubled or trebled the proportion awarded. Among specialist institutions, such as in the creative arts, proportions of firsts could be even higher - such as 64% of students getting firsts at the Royal Academy of Music. ""There are people who think the system isn't as robust as it might be,"" said Nick Hillman, head of the Higher Education Policy Institute. ""It can all be a bit bit cosy - you ask someone you know to be an external examiner."" Universities are their own degree-awarding bodies, so can decide their own levels of degree grades. ""A comparison would be if schools could decide how many A grades to give in A-levels - it's a big incentive for grade inflation,"" said Mr Hillman. Prof Smithers, of the University of Buckingham, said unlike with national exams such as GCSEs and A-levels, universities were ""free to award as many firsts as they like"". ""They have every incentive to do so,"" he said. ""Students like to have top-class degrees and may choose universities on that basis."" Increasing firsts could push universities up league tables, said Prof Smithers. ""If every other university is doing it, you don't want to get left behind,"" he said. But it meant that it was difficult for employers to interpret the value and that ""an upper-second has almost become the pass grade"". Universities are competing for students and their tuition fees, rising to Â£9,250, and there have been suggestions that more higher top degrees will be an incentive for applicants. First-class degrees will be an advantage for future job opportunities - and some companies recruit only from graduates with an upper second or above. But there have also been arguments that rising degree grades reflect the improved A-level grades of those entering university and a more focused attention to studying. Between 2010-11 and 2015-16, the University of Surrey increased its proportion of first-class degrees awarded, from 19% to 41%. Prof Jane Powell, the university's vice-provost, said it ""reflects a combination of national trends and the University of Surrey's concentrated focus on enhancing all aspects of our educational provision"". ""It is very pleasing to see this high level of commitment by both staff and students translating into excellent degree results, the rigorous standards of which are confirmed by external independent assurance processes."" Imperial College has the highest proportion of firsts among mainstream universities. A spokeswoman said this reflected the very high entry grades required to get a place at such a top-ranking institution. Highest proportions of first-class degrees in mainstream universities Imperial College London 41.8% University of Surrey 41.2% University College London 35.6% University of Dundee 34.8% University of East Anglia 34% University of Oxford 33.2% King's College London 31.9% University of Cambridge 31.7% University of Bath 30.8% University of Salford 30.4% Biggest increases in first-class degrees in mainstream universities 2010-11 to 2015-16 University of Surrey 19.3% to 41.2% University of East Anglia 12.5% to 34% University of Bradford 10.3% to 27.6% University of Stirling 11.6% to 27.8% University of Derby 9.4% to 25% University of Dundee 19.3% to 34.8% University of West London 11.6% to 27% University of Wales Trinity Saint David 7.1% to 22.2% Southampton Solent University 8.6% to 23.5% Staffordshire University 12.2% to 27% 14.8 Students say university 'poor value' 10 charts that show the effect of tuition fees Student debts 'rise to more than Â£50,000' Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Watch: Ferocious and explosive fire burns behind CBS reporter 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

"Russian corvette Mirazh passes through Istanbul en route for Syria The ship spotters of Istanbul have become a key resource for diplomats and intelligence experts, alerting the world to the scale of Russia's campaign in Syria. It's almost midnight. I've just got to sleep at the end of a long day travelling to Istanbul, when my phone beeps with a message. ""Slightly bad news,"" it says. ""Alexander Tkachenko will enter Bosphorus at 04:20. ""Very inconvenient. There is absolutely no guarantee we will see anything at all."" The Alexander Tkachenko is a massive Russian roll-on roll-off passenger ferry that has passed through the Bosphorus several times before, carrying military trucks and other equipment bound for Syria on an open deck. The boat may not have visible cargo this time. And in any case, 4.20am is well before dawn at this time of year in Turkey. It will still be dark. But that won't stop Yoruk Isik, who sent the message, from getting up to position himself at a good vantage point on the banks of the Bosphorus Straits in the heart of Istanbul with his binoculars and zoom lens camera. He'll be ready to tweet the news of the ship's passage to his many avid followers, who now include diplomats and intelligence analysts worldwide. And he's inviting me to come with him, though he adds: ""I will feel very guilty if there is nothing on board."" Of course, I get up too. That's what I've come for. On the Black Sea: The Voyage Beginsis available to listen to and download on theBBC iPlayer. The second part in the series will be broadcast on theBBC World Serviceon Wed 26 Jul 2017 at 03:32 BST. Welcome to the wacky - but politically, increasingly important - world of ship-spotting. It's an international, highly collaborative, fraternity - yes, they're mainly (though not all) men - and Isik is one of its most passionate, energetic members. He's a big man in every sense of the word - bear-like, generous and funny. Yoruk Isik (right) with fellow ship spotter Devrim Yaylali, on a Bosphorus ferry And he keeps himself going on strong coffee - the third love of his life, after his wife and ships - because he doesn't get much sleep. ""Many times I get up at two, three or four o'clock in the morning to see things,"" he says. ""Yes, it's very painful. I destroy many days like this."" And he laughs. It's easy to understand how his addiction started. Partly it comes from living in Istanbul. The Bosphorus - the gateway to the Black Sea for ships coming from the Mediterranean - isn't the only waterway in the world that's crowded with international shipping, but no other shipping lane as busy as this runs through the heart of a huge city. So Istanbul's 15 million residents can watch massive warships and cruise ships, container vessels and tankers passing before their eyes. Only 700m wide at its narrowest point, the Bosphorus is so busy that to avoid accidents, the Turkish authorities operate a one-way system, regularly changing the direction of travel according to demand. Ships going the other way must wait at the northern or southern entrance. The USS Porter transits the Bosphorus Isik has his favourite vantage points for spotting - most of them at one of the Strait's many bends. But often he just watches from his own balcony. ""This ship spotting is a mirror of international relations, politics, what is happening now,"" he says. This video can not be played Yoruk Isik explains how warships became his obsession ""The trade wars between Russia and Turkey, the US presence in the Black Sea supporting its Nato allies, or Russia trying to reinsert itself in the Middle East - it is all happening in the middle of this town!"" Isik - who earns a living as an international affairs consultant - logs the passage of boats of all kinds. One he lay in wait for recently at a waterside cafe was the largest construction vessel in the world, the Pioneering Spirit, the length of six jumbo jets, passing through the Bosphorus on its way to lay the TurkStream gas pipeline off the Russian coast. It's so big that the strait had to be closed to other shipping as it went through. But it's warships that most fascinate Isik and his ship-spotting friend Devrim Yaylali, who edits the Bosphorus Naval News website. Yaylali, an economist, has been watching ships for even longer than Isik - since he commuted across the Bosphorus to school in his early teens, during the Cold War. He was so curious about Soviet ships that one day he even skipped a school exam to photograph the aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov, now the flagship of the Russian navy, on its inaugural passage through Istanbul. Today Isik and Yaylali are kept busier and busier - naval traffic through the Bosphorus has increased since Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula, on the northern side of the Black Sea, in 2014. The Kremlin has been strengthening its military defences in Crimea - and modernising its Black Sea fleet based in the Crimean port of Sevastopol. ""Russia has already bought three brand new Kilo Class submarines - and a fourth is about to come,"" Isik says. ""That shows their interest in asserting influence over the Black Sea."" On the deck of the Filchenkov, someone wanted a shot of Yoruk Isik too But Nato has said it will bolster its naval presence in the region in response. In April, Isik spotted the UK destroyer HMS Daring passing through Istanbul - a rare Royal Navy operational deployment to the Black Sea. ""The current situation is more scary than the Cold War to me,"" he says. ""There is the possibility, if not of more hot military action, certainly of more military face-offs."" But for now the greatest danger of a face-off is over Syria - and since the start of Russia's involvement in the war there nearly two years ago, Isik and his fellow Istanbul ship-spotters have played a key role in alerting the world to the scale of the Kremlin's military commitment. All Russian ships travelling to Syria from Sevastopol or Russia's other Black Sea base at Novorossiysk must pass through the Bosphorus. And sometimes, Isik says, Russia seems keen to flaunt its controversial campaign. His most famous shot, taken in December 2015 - and retweeted around the world - was of a Russian soldier standing on the deck of a landing ship holding a shoulder-launched missile, an Igla rocket, as the vessel passed through the centre of Istanbul. A soldier with a shoulder-fired surface-to-air missile can be seen on board the ship Russian warships, like those of other Black Sea nations, have full rights of passage through the Bosphorus in peacetime. Non-Black Sea states have more limited naval rights. But that image - taken shortly after Turkey shot down a Russian warplane for allegedly violating its airspace - was judged so provocative by Ankara that it sent a diplomatic note to Moscow in protest. ""I didn't even see (the rocket) with my naked eye - only when I downloaded the picture,"" Isik says. When Isik zoomed in on his photos he could see a soldier carrying an Igla rocket on his shoulder ""In the end, I couldn't decide whether it was done on the order of Moscow - or just the initiative of the soldier or captain."" As for the Aleksandr Tkachenko - the ship we've both given up our sleep for - it eventually emerges as predicted out of the early morning mist round a bend in the Bosphorus - loaded with row upon row of olive-green Kamaz military trucks. Isik throws himself into a photographic frenzy. The Aleksandr Tkachenko carrying a cargo of military trucks on its way to Syria, just after dawn ""I'm quite excited,"" he says, ""because when the Russian government made a contract with this ship one-and-a-half years ago, it was secret, they didn't announce it - and this shows their approach to the war. Nato ships are stronger than Russia's navy - but with what they have, Russia successfully launched a campaign 1,000 miles from Sevastopol."" ""I was the first to notice that Russia was carrying military vehicles on civilian vessels and it showed even more that they were deepening their commitment."" ""So, Tim, do you feel the excitement of the ship spotter right now?"" Isik asks. ""I love mystery, and it's like a puzzle when we see ships carrying things from point A to point B - and with the help of other ship spotters you can solve this puzzle.""

"The revelations about how much the BBC pays its top presenters dominate the front pages. ""Bloated Blokes Club""is the headline in the Daily Mirror,external, which points out the corporation's seven highest earners are all white men. The Daily Mail warns of ""mutiny"" among female staff,externalover the pay gap between men and women. The Times agrees that the BBC ""faces a revolt"",externalbecause of the gender divide. The paper says the broadcaster could end up spending millions more in wages to placate ""angry"" female talent. The Daily Telegraph says the government wants the BBC's top male stars,externalto take a pay cut of 10% to help close the gap. According to the paper, the corporation has been warned it has three years before the next Charter Review to ""get its house in order"" and make progress on equality. The Telegraph quotes an unnamed source at the culture department who says ministers could lower the threshold and force the BBC to publish the name of every broadcaster who earns more than Â£100,000 if changes are not made. In its editorial, theGuardian argues that while poring over the details of celebrities' salaries is ""utterly fascinating"",externalto the public, it does not ""contribute much at all"" to the public interest. Far more shocking, the paper says, is the gender pay gap which should ""make the bosses hang their heads in shame"". A man being paid up to 10 times more than a woman working in the same sphere is ""unforgivable, it says. The Daily Star takes a different approach,external, accusing ""overpaid BBC luvvies"" of ""having hissy fits"" after the figures were revealed. The Sun illustrates the story with a full-page photo of the BBC Breakfast sofa,external, with presenter Dan Walker - who is on the list of the highest-paid stars - sitting next to colleague Louise Minchin, who is not. The headline: ""Awkward"". The Independent leads with an exclusive report,externalfrom Iraq The paper says it has seen intelligence reports that suggest more than 40,000 civilians were killed in the battle to retake the city of Mosul from the Islamic State group - far more than previously thought. The documents said thousands of people were killed - by air strikes, by IS militants and by the Iraqi forces trying to drive them out. An Iraqi minister tells the paper there is evidence of a ""hidden massacre"" with the bodies of many of those who died still buried under rubble. Fidget spinners - the playground toys that have been banned in some classrooms in Britain - are an unlikely source of concern in Moscow,according to the Times,external. The paper says the spinning toys are being investigated by the Kremlin in case they are ""anti-Putin"". Russia's consumer protection agency is looking into claims that they could be used by anti-government activists to ""brainwash"" recruits with hypnosis. The Kremlin is said to be ""unnerved"" after large numbers of students turned up to support an anti-corruption campaigner who used his fidget spinner while appearing in court.

"Mike Ashley said Sports Direct was on course to become the ""Selfridges of sport"" Profits at Sports Direct have plummeted nearly 60%, which the retailer said was largely due to the weaker pound. The slide in sterling means the firm has had to pay more for its imported goods, and its underlying pre-tax profit fell to Â£113.7m from Â£275.2m. However, chief executive Mike Ashley said trading at its new ""flagship"" stores was going well. Sports Direct's reputation has been badly hit by revelations about staff conditions at its Derbyshire warehouse. Chairman Keith Hellawell said the company had made ""positive progress"" across the business as it continued to ""strive to ensure that all of our people are treated with dignity and respect"". A recent survey of workers in Shirebrook, to which 3,300 people responded, had showed that an ""overwhelming majority"" of people in the warehouse ""currently feel they are treated with respect"", he added. Staff had elected the company's first UK workers' representative and Mr Hellawell said he had ""no doubt"" their ""contribution will prove invaluable to the board as the Sports Direct family continues to move forward together"". Sports Direct, which has been without a chief financial officer since last October, also said it had appointed Jon Kempster to the role. Mr Kempster is set to join the company on 11 September. Mr Ashley said Sports Direct was trying to ""conservatively manage the currency volatility that is reflected in our full year results"". Sports Direct imports many of its products from abroad and the pound's fall against the dollar had led to a ""significant fall in profits"", he added. However, he said the company had now put in place hedging arrangements to ""minimise the short-term impact of currency volatility"". The company's key strategy is to turn itself into the ""Selfridges of sport"", and Mr Hellawell said the ""elevation of our retail proposition continues to be a key objective"". Sports Direct said it was forming a ""new strategic partnership"" with sportswear firm Asics. The Japanese company will manage dedicated areas within Sports Direct's new upmarket ""premium"" stores. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said this had been a ""transformational"" year for Sports Direct. Progress was being made on the new premium stores, he said, and they were ""a lot more profitable than the existing Sports Direct stores"". The retailer's shares rose by 6% following the release of the results as investors appeared to welcomed the progress it was making to move upmarket. In recent months, Sports Direct has bought 26% stake in Game Digital, increased its stake in Debenhams, acquired lingerie firm Agent Provocateur and snapped up the US sports clothing and outdoor equipment chains Bob's Stores and Eastern Mountain Sports. The company's ""spending spree on acquisitions"" had affected profits, Mr Wilson said. ""That's something to bear in mind when we're looking at these figures and also what that does is it puts Sports Direct in a better position to make a strategic move in, for example, the department store area or in the US with its US acquisitions."" It doesn't look good on paper. But for analysts watching the company this seems like the beginning of the end of a difficult period for Sports Direct. Financially, it's now protected against a further drop in the pound. Better late than never. Reputationally, the damage it suffered from its alleged Dickensian treatment of workers is being addressed with a worker on the board of the company.

"David Davis, left, and Michel Barnier The UK and EU are still at odds over citizens' rights and the amount the UK will pay to leave the bloc, at the end of the second week of Brexit talks. EU negotiator Michel Barnier said the UK had not been clear enough about where it stands on these issues and that was hampering progress. UK Brexit Secretary David Davis said the negotiations on the so-called divorce bill had been ""robust"". He said progress had been made but both sides needed to show ""flexibility"". Brexit: All you need to know The people who will negotiate Brexit Katya Adler: The EU negotiator Mr Barnier said: ""We require this clarification on the financial settlement, on citizens' rights, on Ireland - with the two key points of the common travel area and the Good Friday Agreement - and the other separation issues where this week's experience has quite simply shown we make better progress where our respective positions are clear."" Mr Davis said: ""We have had robust but constructive talks this week. Clearly there's a lot left to talk about and further work before we can resolve this. Ultimately, getting to a solution will require flexibility from both sides."" This video can not be played The EU Brexit negotiator calls for legal certainty' over citizens' rights Michel Barnier said there had been some areas of agreement about how Britons living abroad and EU nationals living in the UK should be treated after Brexit. Ajointly agreed ""technical note"" outlining the UK and EU's positions on citizens' rights,externalhas been published. But there was disagreement over ""the rights of future family members"" - meaning children born in the future to EU citizens in the UK - and ""the exports of certain social benefits"". The EU wants rights currently enjoyed by EU citizens in the UK - access to healthcare, welfare, education - to apply to children and family members, whether they currently live in the UK or not, and to continue in perpetuity, after the death or divorce of the rights-holder. But it says children born to UK citizens in EU states after the withdrawal date would be considered ""family members"", not rights holders themselves - the UK says it would allow children born to EU citizens to acquire the same ""settled status"" or, in some cases, British citizenship. The UK wants to give all EU nationals living in the UK the same rights as British citizens once they have been resident in the country for five years, as long as they arrived before a specified ""cut-off"" date, probably 29 March 2017, when Article 50 was triggered. After this date, they could continue to build up their five years' entitlement if necessary. The EU's position also requires that citizens live in a host country for five years before acquiring permanent residency rights. In addition, EU nationals who get married after March 2019 would lose the right to bring family members to the UK, unless they pass an income test, like non-EU migrants. They could also risk losing their right to return to Britain if they leave for more than two years - as would be the case for British citizens in EU countries. The UK says it is prepared to offer some flexibility on this for some citizens on overseas postings or studying abroad and wants the EU to offer the same. David Davis said the UK hadpublished its approach to citizens' rights,externalsince the first round of negotiations, which he described as ""both a fair and serious offer"" and had now published a joint paper setting out areas of agreement, and issues for further talks. He said sticking points in the talks included the rights of employees of EU-based companies to work for extended periods in other countries, such as the UK. British officials highlighted that British expats would lose the rights to vote and stand in local elections under the EU plan - while the UK position is to protect the rights of citizens to vote and stand in elections in their host country. EU negotiators have said that British people living in an EU country would lose their guaranteed rights if they moved to another EU country. A senior EU source said there was a willingness to be flexible on this point during the negotiations, depending on the UK's position in the next set of talks. Senior British sources called the proposal ""unprecedented"" as it would leave British expats with worse rights than those coming from outside the EU and it would be ""interesting"" to see what the public reaction would be to it. David Davis and Michel Barnier stood at matching podiums in Brussels, side by side but not entirely in step. Mr Davis talked breezily about work done constructively and ""at pace"" and even injected a slightly bantering note into proceedings, quoting back to Mr Barnier his own earlier warning line that ""the clock is ticking"". Mr Barnier's take appeared to be slightly less positive and was much more focused on the need for further clarification from the UK side on a whole range of issues - we counted him using the word clarification or variations on it at least eight times in a relatively short news conference. There are plenty of briefings around on points of detail - would the UK for example have the right to conduct blanket criminal record checks on EU citizens applying for residence in post-Brexit UK. But the big stumbling blocks are obvious and have been obvious for a while. One is the ""divorce bill"" - when will a figure emerge into the public domain and what might the UK be prepared to pay. The other is the future role of the European Court of Justice in overseeing the rights of EU citizens who remain in the UK - the EU sees that as a basic right but from the British perspective it's being seen as ""a very big ask"". This video can not be played David Davis said he was 'encouraged by progress' in Brexit talks Britain has agreed in principle to meet its financial obligations as it leaves the EU, to cover things like the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and the pensions of EU officials. But a senior EU source said the UK negotiating team had not said what they might be prepared to pay - and there had been no ""serious discussions"" about what the bill might include. David Davis said: ""We both recognise the importance of sorting out the obligations we have to one another, both legally and in a spirit of mutual cooperation."" But Michel Barnier has called for ""clarification"" on where the UK stands. UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has said the EU can ""go whistle"" if it demands an ""extortionate"" payment but other ministers have struck a more conciliatory tone. Sources have suggested to the BBC the bill could be between 30 and 50 billion euros. Downing Street said the UK was ""looking at the legal commitments"" it faces, adding: ""There are points of difference and that's one of them."" But there were no plans to produce a position paper on the divorce bill, the No 10 spokesman said. David Davis rejected the suggestion that there was a lack of clarity from his team on Northern Ireland, saying the two sides had discussed ways of ""achieving a flexible and imaginative solution to address the unique circumstances around the border"" and preserve the common travel area. A senior EU source said they were still waiting for concrete proposals from the UK side on the kind of border that is achievable.

The ECJ settles disputes between member states about the free movement of workers and other cross-border issues. UK Prime Minister Theresa May has said the UK will be leaving its jurisdiction. The UK has floated the idea of a new international body, made up of British and EU judges, or, according to UK officials, ""some kind of ombudsman"", to settle disputes, but the EU is rejecting this out of hand. There can't be any agreement on citizens' rights until this one is settled, EU sources say. Read more:Reality check: What is the European Court of Justice? The UK wants to carry out criminal record checks on all EU citizens who want to live in the UK. The EU says they should only be carried out where there is a suspicion of wrongdoing. This will be looked at in more detail during the August talks. On a trade deal, David Davis said the UK could not accept a ""punishment"" deal, but added: ""Nobody expects a punishment deal. Michel and I are going for a good deal."" Gibraltar did not come up as an issue in the current round of talks, sources say. Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the ""lack of progress"" on issues such as the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in Europe was ""deeply concerning"" and would cause ""anxiety for millions of families"". He questioned whether phase two of the talks could get under way in October as planned, something that would ""trigger deep concern for businesses and communities across the UK"". ""The reality is that we have a government that is unprepared, divided and incapable of securing a good deal for Britain. We urgently need a fresh approach,"" he added. The EU has said talks won't move on to the subject of future trading arrangements until it judges there's been adequate progress on the separation issues. The two sides are meeting for four days each month, with this week's talks aimed at scoping out points of difference and common ground in those areas that have been identified as requiring urgent attention. Mr Barnier has said the EU side are hoping to agree the basic terms of a deal on EU citizens and the exit bill in October - which he says would open the way for talks on the UK's future trade relations with the EU to begin in December. Meanwhile, the UK government has announced that MPs are set to debate the repeal bill - a key piece of Brexit legislation that will transform EU laws into British laws - for two days from 7 September.
