"Rodney Saunders's body was found by fishermen in February South African police have identified the body of a British botanist kidnapped with her husband in a case with suspected links to the Islamic State group (IS). Rachel Saunders, 63, and her husband Rodney Saunders, 74, were last seen alive on 10 February. Police found Rodney's body on 17 February in a river. Authorities identified Rachel's body on Wednesday but they did not say where they had found her remains. Capt Lloyd Ramovha, of the elite Hawks investigative unit, said in a statement: ""A multi-pronged investigation by the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation and the South African Police Service's Forensic Science Laboratory... led to the positive identification of the mortal remains of Rachel Saunders."" The pair, who owned a seed business in Cape Town, were on a trip looking for rare seeds in KwaZulu-Natal province when they were taken. After the couple's disappearance, their car was found with blood marks and 734,000 rand (Â£42,000) was reportedly drained from their bank accounts. The BBC has declined to comment on reports that, shortly before they were kidnapped, the couple had been working with a film crew from the television programme Gardeners' World. The body of Mr Saunders was found by fishermen in the Tugela river and identified several weeks later. Their disappearance led the British Foreign Office to update its warning about the threat of a terrorist attack in the country, which upset many South Africans. The rise and fall of 'Islamic State' The mystery of the horticulturalists missing in South Africa âIslamic Stateâ around the world Suspects Fatima Patel, 27, and Saffydeen Aslam del Vecchio, 38, were arrested on 16 February, one day before Rodney's body was found. Before the arrests, they were both under police surveillance and are alleged to have hoisted an IS flag in the reserve where the couple disappeared. Ms Patel had previously been arrested, with her brother, in 2016 during a separate anti-terrorism raid closer to Johannesburg. Neither of them were charged. Themba Xulu, 19, was later arrested after the couples' mobile phones were found in his possession, with a fourth suspect named as Ahmad Mussa, 36, from Malawi. Xulu received a suspended three-year sentence after striking a plea bargain with prosecutors, with the rest still in custody and due in court on 24 August on murder, kidnapping and robbery charges. There have been no known attacks by IS, or any other jihadist group, in South Africa. The most prominent case ever linked to IS in the country involved the Thulsie twins - Brandon-Lee and Tony-Lee. They were arrested during raids in 2016 that also saw Fatima Patel detained - though she was not charged at the time. The twins are expected to face trial on terrorism charges related to alleged plans to attack the US embassy in South Africa and Jewish targets.

"This video can not be played Paralysed rat picks up sugar cube after gene therapy repairs spinal cord Scientists say they have taken a significant step towards the goal of giving paralysed people control of their hands again. The team at King's College London used gene therapy to repair damage in the spinal cord of rats. The animals could then pick up and eat sugar cubes with their front paws. It is early stage research, but experts said it was some of the most compelling evidence that people's hand function could one day be restored. The spinal cord is a dense tube of nerves carrying instructions from the brain to the rest of the body. The body repairs a wounded spinal cord with scar tissue. However, the scar acts like a barrier to new connections forming between nerves. The researchers were trying to dissolve components of the scar tissue in the rats' spinal cord. They needed to give cells in the cord a new set of genetic instructions - a gene - for breaking down the scar. The instructions they gave were for an enzyme called chondroitinase. And they used a virus to deliver them. Finally, a drug was used to activate the instructions. The animals regained use of their front paws after the gene therapy had been switched on for two months. Dr Emily Burnside, one of the researchers, said: ""The rats were able to accurately reach and grasp sugar pellets. ""We also found a dramatic increase in activity in the spinal cord of the rats, suggesting that new connections had been made in the networks of nerve cells."" The researchers hope their approach will work for people injured in car crashes or falls. Prof Elizabeth Bradbury told the BBC: ""We find this really exciting, recovery of this type of function, because for spinal injured patients their highest priority is to get their hand function back. ""Being able to pick up a coffee cup, hold a toothbrush, these types of things will have a dramatic increase on their quality of life and their independence."" In 2014, a paralysed man was able to walk with a frame after cells from inside his nose were used toregenerate part of his spinal cord. The patient, Darek Fidyka, was injured in a knife attack that caused a different type of wound to those in car crashes. The gene therapy approach is not yet ready for human clinical trials. Dr Mark Bacon, from the charity Spinal Research, told the BBC: ""The data is some of the most compelling I've seen demonstrating restoration of skilled forelimb function. ""It's exciting, but getting approval for gene therapies represents a particular, but not insurmountable, challenge to getting it to the clinic. ""Transferred to the clinic, this research could be life-changing for the millions of people worldwide with paralysis caused by a spinal cord injury.""

"This video can not be played Parliament is being reduced to a âschool debating chamber"" over Brexit says Conservative MP Antoinette Sandbach. The government's bid to avoid a Commons defeat on the Brexit bill has been rejected as ""slap in the face"" by leading rebel Dominic Grieve. Theresa May assured Mr Grieve ahead of a vote on Tuesday that his call for MPs to be given a greater say on a Brexit deal would be taken on board. But he said ministers had changed the wording of an amendment drawn up after talks with him, at the last minute. Further talks are expected ahead of the bill returning to Parliament next week. Solicitor General Robert Buckland said the government had to ""strike a balance"" between rebels' concerns and protecting the government's negotiating position in Brexit talks with the EU. Laura Kuenssberg: Tory psychodrama over Brexit bill PM 'must honour Brexit vote assurances' BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Remain-leaning Tory MPs were furious and it set the scene for another big showdown when the bill returns to Parliament. Mr Grieve, a former attorney general, told BBC One's Question Time he could not understand why the government amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill had been changed ""at the last minute"" after two days of talks. ""I'd actually got on a train. I thought it was all over,"" he said. Dominic Grieve: 'Something was inexplicably changed' He said the problem was that if the UK reached ""the really apocalyptic moment"" where no Brexit deal had been done by early February 2019, Parliament was not being offered the chance to say what should happen next - only to ""note"" the position. Later he told BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight: ""I simply don't understand why they have done this ... It does feel, I have to say, to be blunt about it, it seems a bit like a slap in the face."" He added that rebels would ""talk further to the government and try to resolve it"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Fellow backbencher Sarah Wollaston described the change as ""a sneaky sting in the tail"" while Anna Soubry described it as a ""big mistake by the prime minister"" adding: ""Unfortunately it looks like she's yet again caved into the hard Brexiteers."" Another pro-EU Tory MP, Stephen Hammond, suggested the amendment had been ""hijacked"" by government figures trying to ""force their will"" onto the process. Asked if ministers had caved into the demands of Brexiteers and changed the wording, Solicitor General Robert Buckland said: ""No, I'm not getting into some Tory psychodrama about this. ""Colleagues had their say and had an input into the process. No deals were done this was all a process that took several hours, to say the least, to try to produce something that could command support and I'm sorry that some colleagues feel that it doesn't go as far as they had hoped for, I really am. ""But we have to make a decision, we have to move forward, table an amendment and allow their lordships to have the vigorous debate that I'm sure will follow next week."" A spokesman for the Department for Exiting the European Union said the amendment addressed a ""hypothetical"" scenario adding: ""The government is confident we will agree a good deal with the EU which Parliament will support."" The bill will now returns to the House of Lords early next week, with both the government amendment and Mr Grieve's original amendment expected to be debated. It will then return to the Commons, where a fresh showdown is expected unless a deal is hammered out. The government's amendment to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill sets out what must happen in the event of three scenarios: If MPs vote down the UK-EU Brexit deal, if Theresa May announces before 21 January 2019 that no deal has been reached, or if 21st January passes with no deal being struck. Under these circumstances, a minister must make a statement in Parliament setting out their next steps and give MPs an opportunity to vote. However, the vote would be on ""a motion in neutral terms"", merely stating that the House has considered the statement. Mr Grieve had originally wanted the amendment to say that the government must seek the approval of Parliament for its course of action - and that ministers must be directed by MPs and peers. Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said: ""The government's amendment is simply not good enough. ""Theresa May has gone back on her word and offered an amendment that takes the meaning out of the meaningful vote. Parliament cannot - and should not - accept it."" Is another Commons showdown looming? Analysis By BBC political correspondent Ben Wright Former Attorney General Dominic Grieve, Anna Soubry and perhaps a dozen of their Conservative backbench colleagues are leading the fight to ensure the Commons has the chance to shape the government's next move, if no deal is reached with the EU. That is Labour's view too. But the government is emphatic Parliament should not have that power. Why? Because that would effectively neuter the UK government's threat to the EU, that it is prepared to walk out without a deal. That's why Brexiteers are so enraged by this row. And it's why Dominic Grieve and his parliamentary posse are steeled for a drawn-out fight with their own government. The argument moves back to the Lords on Monday before a likely final showdown in the Commons next Wednesday. A compromise may be brokered before then. But a Conservative source told me the bitterness within the party was now worse than it was during the Maastricht saga in the early 1990s - of which today's battle over Brexit is, perhaps, the final act. The UK is due to leave the EU in March 2019, and negotiations have been taking place on the terms of the separation and how the two sides will work together in the future. The government is trying to pass a new law, called the EU Withdrawal Bill, which it says is needed to ensure a ""smooth and orderly Brexit"". Its main purposes are to end the supremacy of EU law in the UK, and transfer existing EU law into UK law so the same rules and regulations apply on the day after Brexit. But as it passes through Parliament, MPs and peers have been trying to change it, in some cases adding bits on that would change the government's Brexit strategy. Mr Grieve summed up the suspicion on both sides of the Brexit argument: ""One background fear is that actually there are some people who would quite like to just tip the UK out of the EU with no deal at all ... the other one is that people are trying to stop Brexit happening.""

"Mr Comey has come under fire from both Democrats and Republicans A highly anticipated US Department of Justice report accuses ex-FBI director James Comey of being ""insubordinate"" but not politically biased. Inspector General Michael Horowitz said Mr Comey had broken ""dramatically from FBI and department norms"" in handling an inquiry into Hillary Clinton's emails. Mrs Clinton has blamed Mr Comey for her election loss to Donald Trump in 2016. The report also reveals Mr Comey used a private email account for FBI business. FBI director Christopher Wray said he accepted the report's findings but he added that nothing in the report pointed towards political bias or impugned the FBI as an institution. In his report, the inspector general criticised Mr Comey's decision to reveal publicly a week before the election that he had reopened the inquiry into Mrs Clinton's emails, rejecting Mr Comey's argument that he had acted in the interests of transparency. He found that while Mr Comey's actions were not the result of political bias, ""by departing so clearly and dramatically from FBI and department norms, the decisions negatively impacted the perception of the FBI and the department as fair administrators of justice"". The 500-page report,externalalso found ""a troubling lack of any direct, substantive communication"" between Mr Comey and Former Attorney General Loretta Lynch. Does Clinton email report help or hurt Trump? The long list of whom Hillary Clinton blames But the report also touched on text messages between two FBI officials who later worked on Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the US election. Peter Strzok, who was Mr Mueller's lead agent in the Russian inquiry, was having an affair with Lisa Page, an FBI lawyer who also temporarily worked on the Mueller investigation. When Ms Page asked if Mr Trump would become president, Mr Strzok responded: ""No. No he won't. We'll stop it."" The report called this ""not only indicative of a biased state of mind but, even more seriously, implies a willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidate's electoral prospects"". FBI agent Peter Strzok texted his lover that they could ""stop"" Mr Trump becoming president Republicans have seized on the messages to argue the FBI investigation was biased against President Donald Trump. Christopher Wray said employees would be held accountable for any misconduct as a result of the report. Potentially embarrassing for the former FBI director is the inspector general's finding that he used a private Gmail address to conduct some official business. This practice continued while he was investigating Mrs Clinton for using a private email account to handle government secrets - which at the time Mr Comey branded ""extremely careless"". When asked about his own email by investigators, Mr Comey said: ""I had the sense that it was OK."" Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? What new Trump Tower documents tell us He said he only handled non-confidential information on his Gmail, and it was only used for information that would become public anyway, such as speeches or public statements. But the inspector general said it was ""inconsistent"" with justice department policy. Mrs Clinton took to Twitter to make a sarcastic comment. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Comey released a book earlier this year detailing his decisions as FBI director Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News James Comey deviated from FBI policy in his handling of the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server. This isn't exactly news. In fact, it's something both Democrats and Republicans agree on - although for very different reasons. Now the inspector general has weighed in, and while he says that it was reasonable for Mr Comey to decide not to charge Hillary Clinton with mishandling classified information, the way he went about announcing that was improper. What's more, his letter to Congress on the eve of the presidential election represented a ""serious error of judgement"". All of this will have Mrs Clinton's supporters nodding in agreement. Where the matter gets more complicated, however, is in evidence of anti-Trump sentiment the inspector general exposed within the FBI. While he concluded that it did not bias the investigation into Mrs Clinton, the effect on the Trump-Russia inquiry was not within the inspector general's mandate. Expect the president and his supporters to amplify Peter Strzok's text message that ""we'll stop"" Mr Trump from becoming president and point to the inspector general's finding that he may have been biased in prioritising the Trump investigation over the Clinton one in the last month of the presidential campaign. In the end, the inspector general report will provide fuel for partisan fires on both sides - and it will be very difficult to keep the flames from spreading to Robert Mueller's ongoing special counsel investigation. In announcing the review in January 2017,Mr Horowitz said,externalthere was overwhelming demand from lawmakers, members of the public, and ""various organisations"" to investigate claims of unprofessional behaviour on the part of the justice department and FBI employees. President Trump is among the most vocal critics of the FBI and the Department of Justice, repeatedly accusing several employees of being biased against him. The report focuses on Mr Comey's decision in July 2016, when FBI director, to hold a news conference announcing that Mrs Clinton would not be criminally charged for using a private email server for classified information during her time as US secretary of state. Six explosive new claims by James Comey FBI boss who went from 'respect' to 'nut' Eleven days before the presidential election, Mr Comey announced that the bureau was investigating new emails related to the Clinton email inquiry. The inspector general's report calls that decision a ""serious error in judgment"". Mrs Clinton and her aides blamed Mr Comey for her subsequent defeat while Democrats pointed out that he remained silent at the time about an investigation into possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. Mr Trump's decision to fire Mr Comey in May 2017 led the Department of Justice to appoint Mr Mueller, an ex-FBI director, to open an investigation into the Russia allegations. Mr Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion with the Kremlin, calling the Russia investigation a ""witch hunt"". On Twitter and ina New York Times op-ed,external, he said he had no regrets about his handling of the Clinton investigation. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Ms Daby is a former deputy mayor of Lewisham Labour has held Lewisham East in a by-election triggered by the resignation of former frontbencher Heidi Alexander. Lewisham councillor Janet Daby pledged to oppose a ""hard Brexit"" after winning with 50.2% of the vote in the Remain-voting area of south-east London. Labour's majority was slashed from 21,213 at the general election to 5,629 as the Lib Dems overtook the Tories to claim second place. Turnout was just 33% - less than half what it was at the general election. Lib Dem Leader  Sir Vince Cable described it as ""the largest swing from Labour to the Liberal Democrats in over a decade"" something he attributed to ""the failure of Labour's leadership to oppose the Conservatives' hard Brexit"". The Lib Dems' Lucy Salek increased the party's share of the vote. Labour's Janet Daby received 11,033 votes, the Lib Dem candidate Lucy Salek 5,404 (24.6%), and the Conservative candidate Ross Archer 3,161 (14.4%). Ms Daby, the former deputy mayor of Lewisham, said she felt ""humbled and delighted"". In her acceptance speech she said her victory meant ""we will not tolerate an extreme Brexit in Lewisham East"". ""We refuse to stand by and let a Tory government devastate our schools, our health service and our housing,"" she added. Asked if there was much difference between her and party leader Jeremy Corbyn on Brexit, she said she wanted to ensure ""we have as close a relationship to the EU as possible"". ""I voted for Jeremy Corbyn twice in the leadership election and obviously within politics not everybody will agree on everything ... but we need to find a way around it that holds the Tories to account."" Ms Daby has been a councillor for Lewisham since 2010 and is the director of the Whitefoot and Downham Community Food + Project which she founded in 2013. She was picked as the party's candidate from a shortlist of black and ethnic minority women. A total of 21,979 people turned out to vote in the by-election - 33.2% of the electorate. There was a 19% swing from Labour to the Lib Dems, who saw a 20% increase in their vote share from the last election. Labour won the south-east London seatat the 2017 general electionwith 32,072 votes - a majority of more than 20,000. Turnout in 2017 was 69%. Their new majority is 5,629. The former Labour MP Heidi Alexander announced in May she was quitting Parliament to work for Mayor of London Sadiq Khan. The full results in Lewisham East were: Janet Daby - Labour11,033 (50.2%) Lucy Salek - Liberal Democrats5,404 (24.6%) Ross Archer - Conservative3,161 (14.4%) Rosamund Adoo-Kissi-Debrah - Green Party788 (3.6%) Mandu Reid - Women's Equality Party506 (2.3%) David Kurten - UKIP380 (1.7%) Anne Marie Waters - For Britain Movement266 (1.2%) Maureen Martin - Christian Peoples Alliance168 Howling Laud Hope - Monster Raving Loony Party93 Massimo DiMambro - Democrats and Veterans Party67 Sean Finch - Libertarian Party38 Charles Carey - no description37 Patrick Gray - Radical Party20 Thomas Hall - Young People's Party18 Labour chooses by-election candidate Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

"Cannabis addiction is rising among women Addiction to cannabis is rising among people above the age of 40, and women in particular, according to a study by the University of York. In the past 10 years, the number of women citing the drug as their sole concern at treatment centres more than doubled, from 471 to 1008. Researchers blame an increase in the potency of the drug and are calling for more and better treatment. Cannabis is still however primarily used by young men. The study analysed figures from Public Health England on people seeking help at drug treatment centres between 2005-06 and 2015-16. The increase comes despite fewer people using cannabis. The number of people who use it at least once a month has fallen from two million to 1.4 million during the past decade, according to the Crime Survey for England and Wales. It remains the most popular illegal recreational drug in the UK, however. This video can not be played What's behind the rise? Report author Ian Hamilton, a lecturer in addiction at York University, said: ""The narrative is that cannabis is a young person's problem. ""That is still the case, but we are seeing a steady and significant rise in addiction problems amongst people over 40, particularly women. ""Cannabis is cheap and widely available. And many women consider it to be benign. ""For many people it will be, but there are a significant number who go on to develop problems. ""Older people were probably used to cannabis at a lower strength. Now, the market is awash with higher potency stuff, often grown domestically. ""In some cases, resin can be nearly three times stronger than drugs on the street in 2005. ""Higher potency cannabis, which is often combined with tobacco, could increase the likelihood of people developing health problems."" Most UK cannabis super strength skunk The science behind super strength skunk Women often think cannabis is harmless Jayne and Emma, not their real names, are seeking treatment for cannabis addiction. Jayne toldBBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour programme: ""It was cheap. And I didn't have much money. ""I also thought it wouldn't cause consequences. There's the illusion that you can do everything you need to do as a mother. ""But as I used more and more of it, I found I couldn't go out and take my children to school. I really began to neglect them."" Emma told the programme: ""My husband was angry all the time and I felt I was walking on eggshells. My mum was physically abusive when I was younger, and that has always stayed with me. I guess it was easier to be out of it really."" Many people believed cannabis was not addictive, Mr Hamilton said. ""This is a myth. Yet not everyone will experience problems,"" he said. ""It's a bit like wine - some people can enjoy a glass, others become alcoholics. ""Yet as the strength of the product has increased, it's as if people are moving immediately to the strength-equivalent of a vodka."" Click to hear the full Woman's Hour discussion.

"It's that time of year (or every other year) when a big football tournament is kicking off and one of your colleagues suggests a sweepstake. Should you venture Â£1 on this? Let's leave aside questions of team bonding, the evils of gambling and the likelihood that the eventual winner will spend their winnings on biscuits for the team. Reality Check is interested only in the odds. Consider aWorld Cupsweepstake in which it's Â£1 to enter, all 32 teams are drawn and the person who draws the eventual winner gets all the money. Their effective odds will have been 31 to one (because when you bet with a bookmaker, you get your stake back if you win). Compare that outcome with a situation in which you draw the name of one of the 32 teams out of a hat and then go and put Â£1 on that country to win with thebest available odds,externalat a bookmaker. What you want in a sweepstake is to end up with better odds than you would at the bookies, so we're interested in how many teams you could draw for which that would be the case. As the tournament kicks off, the answer to that question is nine. There are nine teams for which there are odds in the bookies of less than 31 to 1 against them winning. For example, if you draw Brazil in the sweepstake and they win the World Cup then you get Â£32, while if you'd bet that pound on Brazil at the bookmakers you'd be struggling to get more than about a fiver. The nine countries are: Brazil Germany Spain France Argentina Belgium England Portugal Uruguay So if you are the first person drawing in the sweepstake then you have a nine in 32 chance, about 28%, of picking a team for which you'd have better odds than you'd get at the bookmakers. Under the circumstances, you could be considerably better off choosing a random team and putting Â£1 on it at the betting shop. For example, if you've drawn Iceland in the sweepstake and they somehow manage to win the tournament, then you'll win Â£32 via the sweepstake when you would have won Â£200 or Â£300 if you'd made that bet at the bookmakers. This is partly because the World Cup is structured with its seeding system in a way that favours highly ranked teams, making it relatively unlikely for two of them to have to play each other before the quarter-finals, and harder for an outsider to win the tournament. But this does not take into account that the nine people who would be better off using the sweepstake if their team won are hugely more likely to be holding the winning ticket than the other 23. Prof Kevin McConway, from the Open University, says the odds being quoted suggest that there is about an 87% chance of one of those nine teams winning. That means that at the end of the tournament, there is an 87% chance that the person who wins the sweepstake will have won more money than they would have done through the bookmakers. That makes the sweepstake sound much better than the bookmakers, but it's not the end of the story. The expected winnings are thrown out by the bigger returns that you would get at the bookmakers in the extremely unlikely event that a smaller footballing nation won the World Cup. If Saudi Arabia won it, you could get about Â£2,000 from the bookmakers for your Â£1 stake, but only Â£32 from the sweepstakes. If you look at it this way there is not a lot of difference between the two systems, with sweepstakes coming out slightly on top because your colleague organising it is (presumably) not taking a cut, while the bookmaker will be. And there are other complicating factors here. If you are not the first person drawing in the sweepstake, then the odds change every time a team is drawn. So, if you see Brazil or Germany going, then your odds deteriorate. Whereas if a succession of sporting minnows are drawn, your odds improve. If you are organising a sweepstake, then this is why you need the draw either to be secret or to make sure everybody has paid you before anyone draws. Nobody is going to enter a sweepstake if only Panama and Saudi Arabia are left in the hat. Many sweepstakes are not organised to be winner-takes-all, which complicates matters somewhat. Perhaps you'll give Â£16 to the winner, Â£10 to the runner-up and Â£6 to the team that is knocked out first. Although this spreads the winnings, it does not alter the expected winnings from the sweepstake. This is not to say that picking a team out of a hat and betting Â£1 on it is a particularly good idea either. Maybe the Reality Check team is just missing the point here, or maybe the author of this piece is feeling bitter because he drew Costa Rica in the office sweepstake.

"A year on from the Grenfell Tower fire disaster, survivors are marking a week of remembrance - away from the ""politics"" - for the 72 people who lost their lives. BBC Reality Check has obtained figures showing the scale of the recovery effort, and what's still to be done to start to help the community back onto its feet. In February, at the Brit Awards, London-born grime artist Stormzy used his live performance after picking up two awards to ask the prime minister: ""Theresa May, where's the money for Grenfell?"" At the time, the government said it had pledged Â£58.9m, of which Â£30m had been spent. But the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) was not able to say what it had been spent on - although it responded to a Freedom of Information request made by Reality Check saying the ""majority of the money"" had been spent by the council. Since then, the overall pot of money available has increased. On Tuesday, Theresa May said more than Â£46m of national funds had already been spent on recovery following the fire and another Â£34m had been promised, bringing the total up to Â£80m. The council said it had been promised Â£78m of this, of which it had already received, and spent, Â£43.8m. Including the money received from central government, the council has spent Â£256.7m in total so far, by drawing on its own reserves and taking out loans. The Â£256.7m spent so far has been used for: acquiring and renovating social housing, and other related costs (Â£145.4m) social care (Â£25.9m) emergency accommodation for survivors (Â£25.6m) securing and managing the site of the fire (Â£19m) temporary and permanent accommodation for survivors (Â£13.5m) support services for survivors and the wider community, including providing welfare centres and community-based support (Â£13.2m) compensating leaseholders for loss of property (Â£10.1m) corporate services  - mainly costs relating to supporting the public inquiry and the coroner (Â£4m) During his performance at the Brit Awards, grime artist Stormzy asked Theresa May what had happened to the money for survivors The council has committed over Â£235m to secure 307 homes, most but not all of which has now been spent. And it has also promised to cover costs relating to the future use of the Grenfell Tower site, which ""has yet to be determined by the community"". Meanwhile, in addition to the Â£10m for mental health support services that was given to the council by the Treasury, NHS England spent about Â£4m last financial year and is set to spend Â£6m this financial year, through the local NHS Trust, for mental health services for survivors. rehousing survivors (Â£24m) refurbishing the Lancaster West Estate, which the tower was part of (Â£15m) managing the Grenfell Tower site (Â£12m) mental health support - not including separate money for NHS services - (Â£10m) support for the immediate response, for example emergency repairs (Â£7.3m) funeral costs and cash payments to survivors (Â£6m) welfare centres (Â£3m) In addition to the money pledged by the government and raised by the council, Â£28m was raised in charitable donations, of which Â£24m has now been distributed. And 200 tonnes of physical charitable donations were also made, of which 41 tonnes of new or almost new items were distributed among the community affected by the fire. The remainder was either sold in British Red Cross shops for Grenfell or turned into cash through recycling, raising an additional Â£226,000 for survivors. As well as the Â£80m the government has promised to spend on the survivors and the local area, Â£78m of which is to go through the council, the government has also committed to spend Â£400m on removing potentially dangerous cladding from council and housing association owned tower blocks around England. This money will initially come from an existing pot of money intended to fund the Affordable Homes Programme. In May, it was confirmed there were 323 such buildings taller than 18m (60ft) in England that had unsafe cladding on them - including residential blocks and publicly owned buildings such as schools and hospitals. Of these, 311 were judged to be a fire hazard and unlikely to meet current building regulations. Work has started to remove the cladding from 107 of these but so far has been completed in only 10. A total of 72 people died as a result of the blaze, the judge-led inquiry has said. This includes Maria Del Pilar Burton, 74, who died in January. She had been in hospital since she was rescued from the 19th floor. The survivors, who lived in 138 of the flats in the tower and the adjacent Grenfell Walk, have now split into 203 households - 116 from the tower and 22 from the walk. Some of the original households living in the tower contained multiple generations, for example grandparents and grown-up children, who are now being given the opportunity to have homes of their own. The council said it had committed to securing 307 homes to provide the 203 households with a choice of properties. As of 13 June, according to the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea: the council has made a total of 971 offers of some kind of accommodation to the 203 households 198 of the 203 have now accepted an offer of a home 135 of these have moved in - 52 into an temporary home, 83 into a permanent home 68 households from Grenfell Tower and Walk are still living in emergency accommodation - of these, 42 are in hotels, 22 are in serviced apartments and four are staying with family or friends 90 households from the surrounding estate - but not the tower or Grenfell Walk - are also still living in emergency or temporary accommodation, prior to moving back to their original homes Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter,external Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

"The man named in the press as Bryn Jones left Rolls Royce a number of years ago Counter-terrorism police investigating an alleged plot to pass military secrets to China have arrested a former Rolls-Royce employee. The man, arrested on Tuesday, was named by The Sun and Daily Telegraph as Bryn Jones, a jet engine specialist. Mr Jones, who left Rolls-Royce a number of years ago, is reported to have denied any wrongdoing. He has been released under investigation. Rolls-Royce declined to comment. Police have searched an address in the West Midlands and another in Derby, thought to be Mr Jones' home. MI5 is understood to have been involved in the investigation which involves concerns about alleged attempts by China to gather industrial secrets. In the past, China has been accused of using a variety of techniques including cyber and human espionage to steal defence technology.

"A list that reports to be Robert Mueller's proposed questions for Donald Trump is like a walking tour of all the Russia-related controversies surrounding the Trump campaign and the early days of his presidency. There's the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between top campaign aides and a woman with ties to the Russia government. And the Ukraine-related changes to the Republican Party platform. And fired national security adviser Michael Flynn's contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak. More than half the questionsobtained by the New York Times,externalare related to possible obstruction of justice by the president or his team. These include Attorney General Jeff Sessions' recusal from the Russia probe and Mr Trump's reaction to that, the clashes with former FBI Director James Comey up to and including his firing and possible efforts to undermine Mr Mueller's own investigation. Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? Six explosive new claims by James Comey In a series of Tuesday morning tweets the president said it was disgraceful that the questions were made public and claimed that their topics proved there was no ""collusion"". He focused in particular on the obstruction of justice aspect of the inquiries, writing that ""it would seem very hard to obstruct justice for a crime that never happened!"" That kind of argument may play in the court of public opinion, but there's not a lot of legal support for such a view. This video can not be played 'Lizard, liar, leaker' - Trump supporters on Comey and Russia investigation Just ask Martha Stewart, who went to jail for obstructing a federal investigation into insider trading, or Scooter Libby, who was convicted of obstructing a special counsel investigation into White House leaks of a covert CIA operative's name. Neither was convicted for the crime they were accused of. Mr Libby, one might recall, recentlyreceived a full pardonfrom Mr Trump. Trump Russia - the saga in 200 words Trump Russia affair: Key questions answered Given that the Times says the list came from communications between the special counsel and the Trump legal team, it's entirely possible the leak came from the president's own side. Michael Zeldin, an assistant to Mr Mueller when he was FBI director, told CNN on Tuesday morning that he thought the wording of the questions made it unlikely that the leak came from the special counsel's office. ""Some of the grammar is not even proper,"" he said. ""I think these are more notes that the White House has taken and then they have expanded upon the conversation to write out these as questions."" And even if the document accurately details the thrust of Mr Mueller's presidential inquiries, there's no indication that the list is complete - or what, if any, follow-up questions the special counsel team might ask if they get their face-to-face meeting with the president. This video can not be played Trump's love-hate relationship with Comey over a tumultuous year Despite Mr Trump's insistence, there appears to be plenty of interest in possible collusion. There are questions about Mr Trump's 2013 beauty pageant visit to Moscow (featured prominently in the now infamous ""Steele dossier""), his involvement with any Russian real estate deals during the presidential race, his son-in-law's attempts at back-channel contacts with the Russian government, his former adviser's contacts with Wikileaks and his knowledge of any outreach by campaign aides ""to Russia about potential assistance to the campaign"". The 'secret memo' intriguing Washington There's even a question about a 2017 Seychelles meeting between Trump associate Erik Prince and a Russian businessman. There have been reports that Mr Mueller has evidence that the visit was an attempt to open a secret line of communications between the president and Vladimir Putin. Perhaps most notably in the ""collusion"" context, Paul Manafort - the former Trump campaign chairman - is mentioned by name. ""What knowledge do you have of any outreach by your campaign, including by Paul Manafort, to Russia about potential assistance to the campaign?"" the question reads. Up until now, most Trump-Russia  speculation has focused on Russian attempts to reach out to Trump campaign aides, who were a small and inexperienced team. This question turns that on its head. What if it was someone from the Trump team that sought out the Russians? This video can not be played All you need to know about the Trump-Russia investigation Mr Manafort, of course, has been indicted by Mr Mueller in part for work he did for pro-Russian officials in Ukraine. He attended that June 2016 Trump Tower meeting, set up by Donald Trump Jr, after the candidate's son was told by an associate that Russia had information ""that would incriminate"" Hillary Clinton which was part of the Russian' government's support for Mr Trump. Mr Manafort also reportedly offered to give a government-connected Russian billionaire a briefing about the campaign in July 2016. In other words, roughly a third of Mr Mueller's questions cut right to the heart of the investigation into possible ties between Mr Trump's team and Russia. For the moment, it appears the special counsel team wants the interview to be conducted voluntarily. There's always the possibility, however, that Mr Mueller could issue a subpoena compelling the president to talk. The resulting legal scrum on whether a president has to obey such an edict would be the stuff of political legends. The special counsel has plenty of questions. The biggest one right now, however, is how - or if Mr Trump answers any of them.

"As he readies to end his term in office, a suggestion has emerged - that Donald Trump could pardon himself or his family. Media reports, quoting unnamed sources, say Mr Trump has suggested to aides he is considering granting a pardon to himself in the final hours of his presidency, coming alongside further recent presidential pardons. Mr Trump has tweetedin the past that ""all agree the US President has the complete power to pardon"". To some experts, this would be like a judge presiding over their own trial. Others though say Mr Trump may be correct - although that is not to say it would be a good idea. The right of US presidents to issue pardons is enshrined in the constitution. UnderArticle II, Section 2, Clause 1,external, presidents have ""power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment"". In practice a president could offer clemency or a commutation, i.e. reducing a prison sentence. A president can also offer a full pardon, in essence an official statement of forgiveness for a crime. An individual does not have to be charged or convicted to receive a pardon, and a president cannot pardon people over state-level crimes. In the context of the Russia investigation, Mr Trump could grant immunity to aides or family members, limiting Mr Mueller's scope. The short answer is we do not know, given the short wording but broad application of the constitution, and the fact there is no precedent for a US leader issuing such a pardon. Some legal experts say no, citing an opinion issued by the Justice Department days before Richard Nixon's resignation that he could not pardon himself ""under the fundamental rule that no one may be a judge in his own case"". Mr Trump reportedly inquired about his power to pardon himself and family members ""The Justice Department was right that guidance could be found in the enduring principles that no one can be both the judge and the defendant in the same matter, and that no one is above the law,"" wrote Laurence H Tribe, Richard Painter and Norman Eisenin the Washington Post,external. Others though say the constitution does not preclude a self-pardon. Are we going to see a blitz of Trump pardons? ""A self-pardon might well be outrageously improper... but the response the Constitution creates for such misconduct is impeachment, a political rather than criminal remedy,"" Mark Tushnet, a law professor at Harvard Universitytold Vox,external. While there are differing opinions among experts about whether Mr Trump could pardon himself, there is more consensus that such a move would be fraught with difficulties. This video can not be played Are presidential pardons Trump's secret weapon? Jonathan Turley, a professor at George Washington University Law School, told the LA Times a president pardoning himself would raise serious questions ""of an abuse of power"". It would also not apply to possible state charges, and only federal charges. Two University of Chicago law professors, Daniel Hemel and Eric Posner,writing in the New York Times,,externalargue that if Mr Trump pardoned relatives he could open himself to the risk of being charged with obstruction of justice. If he were to pardon himself, questions would follow about whether it is valid, and it could ultimately end up in the Supreme Court. Gerald Ford pardoned his predecessor Richard Nixon over the Watergate scandal. He argued it was essential for the nation to move on. It is a decision still debated today - some say it cost him the 1976 election, others that he made the difficult, but right, choice. Gerald Ford and the man he pardoned, Richard Nixon Presidents have made sweeping pardons to heal national wounds, such as when President Andrew Johnson pardoned Southerners after the Civil War. Bill Clinton caused uproar when he pardoned scores of people on his last day in office, including a brother-in-law and Marc Rich, a fugitive who had been indicted for tax evasion and fraud. Perhaps the most famous beneficiary of President Obama's clemency was Chelsea Manning, the US Army Private sentenced to 35 years in jail for leaking documents to Wikileaks. Mr Trump has made some controversial pardons. They include his former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who was ensnared by the Special Counsel inquiry into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. In December, he issued a series of pardons, including his former campaign manager Paul Manafort, ex-adviser Roger Stone and the father of his son-in-law. Mr Trump also pardoned four security guards involved in a 2007 massacre in Iraq. There were also less contentious pardons and commutations. In 2018, he pardoned Jack Johnson, boxing's first black heavyweight champ, convicted in 1913 of taking his white girlfriend across state lines, and  the same year granted clemency for Alice Johnson, a 63-year-old grandmother jailed in 1996 on a non-violent drug charge.

"This video can not be played A beginner's guide to impeachment and Trump US President Donald Trump has been impeached and now faces the next stage of a process that could, with enough support in Congress, see him removed from office. It all centres on whether or not he improperly sought help from Ukraine to boost his chances of re-election in 2020. Mr Trump became only the third president in US history to be impeached after two votes in the Democratic Party-controlled House of Representatives - but more on what that means below. President Trump, who is a Republican, strongly denies any wrongdoing. President Trump is accused of pressuring Ukraine to dig up damaging information on one of his main Democratic challengers for the presidency in 2020, Joe Biden, and his son Hunter. Hunter worked for a Ukrainian company when Joe Biden was US vice-president. The president is accused of dangling two things as bargaining chips to Ukraine - withholding $400m of military aid to Ukraine that had already been allocated by Congress, and a White House meeting for Ukraine's president. This, Democrats say, amounts to an abuse of presidential power, using the office for personal political gain and to the detriment of national security. Ukraine was using that money in its ongoing conflict with Russia. Mr Trump is also accused of obstructing Congress by refusing to co-operate with the congressional inquiry. A formal complaint from a whistleblower - an unnamed intelligence official who wrote a letter expressing concern about Mr Trump's 25 July call with President Volodymyr Zelensky - kicked off the impeachment process in early September. A rough transcript of the call,externalrevealed that Mr Trump had urged President Zelensky to investigate discredited allegations against Joe and Hunter Biden. This video can not be played What we know about Biden-Ukraine corruption claims The call came shortly after Mr Trump had blocked the release of millions of dollars in US military aid to Ukraine.A senior official later testifiedthat the president made clear the release of the aid was conditional on Mr Biden being investigated, but the White House denies this. In a series of public hearings, a procession of US officials have testified that there was a White House shadow foreign policy led by the president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. Its aim was to get Ukraine to open an investigation into the Bidens and declare as much publicly. Mr Trump denies using US military aid as a bargaining chip with Mr Zelensky and has repeatedly insisted his call with Ukraine's leader was ""perfect"". He has called the impeachment inquiry a ""witch hunt"" by Democrats and elements of the media. He also says it was appropriate to ask Ukraine to investigate ""corruption"", referring to the energy firm where Hunter Biden worked. The Republican defence comes in three parts: - Ukraine's president said he felt no pressure - The Ukrainians were unaware the aid was held back - US military aid was eventually released To impeach, in this context, means to bring charges in Congress that will form the basis for a trial. The US constitution states a president ""shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes or misdemeanours"". It's important to note this is a political process, rather than a criminal one. This video can not be played What does it take to impeach a president? It happens in two stages. The first stage is done now - two articles of impeachment (charges) were brought to the House of Representatives and passed in a vote along party lines. Next the process heads to the Senate where a trial will be held in January. But here, a two-thirds vote is necessary for a president's removal - and this milestone has never been reached in US history. The Senate is currently controlled by the Republican Party so conviction is considered unlikely in Trump's case. Bill Clinton found himself impeached on the grounds of perjury and obstruction of justice after he lied about the nature of his affair with Monica Lewinsky and then allegedly asked her to lie about it as well. But when the trial reached the Senate in 1999, the vote for a conviction failed to get close to the two-thirds backing required. Bill and Hillary Clinton with US House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt after Mr Clinton was impeached The only other president impeached was Andrew Johnson in 1868. He was accused of, among other things, dismissing his secretary of war against the will of Congress. Mr Johnson had a narrow escape - the two-thirds majority in the Senate was missed by just one vote. President Andrew Johnson narrowly survived his impeachment trial Richard Nixon, the 37th US president, resigned in 1974 before he could be impeached over the Watergate scandal. The line of succession for the US government, as established by the Presidential Succession Act of 1947, would mean Vice-President Mike Pence moving into the Oval Office.

"This video can not be played Grenfell memorial events were held to remember the victims About 5,000 people are estimated to have taken part in a silent walk in honour of the 72 people killed in the Grenfell Tower fire a year ago. Firefighters laid down their helmets and formed a guard of honour as the marchers - carrying banners and wearing green - passed by. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and London Mayor Sadiq Khan joined the event near the tower in West London. Earlier a silent procession followed a memorial service at a nearby church. Silent walks have been held in the neighbourhood on the 14th of every month since the fire, attracting hundreds of people. The Met Police estimated 5,000 people took part in the evening walk at the end of the day of remembrance for the victims of the disaster. Firefighters formed a guard of honour for the walk Some of the people on the walk stopped to hug the firefighters as they passed A 72-second national silence was held at midday as part of the anniversary. It was observed across the country, including at government buildings, Parliament and by the Queen and the Duchess of Sussex on a visit to Chester, where the monarchwore green in honour of Grenfell victims. This video can not be played Tube driver stops train and waves green flag in solidarity for Grenfell The names of the 72 victims were read out at the memorial service held at St Helen's Church, near the tower. Bereaved families were invited to light candles in memory of their loved ones at the church, which had been decked out in green - the colour adopted by survivors and relatives of those who died. Clarrie Mendy, who lost two family members in the fire and organised the service attended by several hundred people, said: ""It's a service of healing, community, inclusivity and solidarity, to know we are not alone."" Addressing the service, Labour MP David Lammy, whose family friend died in the fire, said it was a ""bittersweet"" moment as the community celebrated their unity but mourned those lost. White doves were released outside the church after the service. Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Global roots of fire victims 'Grenfell was a symbol of hope' Ms Mendy then led the silent procession towards Grenfell Tower, accompanied by other bereaved relatives carrying a large floral display spelling ""Humanity for Grenfell"". Relatives holding banners marched to the tower after the service Wreaths were laid by the London mayor and the Duke of Kent during another service at a memorial close to the base of the tower. Singers Stormzy, Adele and Marcus Mumford, who have been vocal supporters of those affected by the fire, were at the event. Stormzy joined the mourners for the service at the base of Grenfell Tower Nicholas Burton, whose wife Maria del Pilar Burton died in January and is considered the 72nd victim of the fire, said he chatted with all three singers during the day. He said: ""I went into the sports centre and I hear 'Hi Nick' and it's Adele calling me over, who introduced me to her new husband and then Marcus comes over and we had a hug, then Stormzy comes over - they have all been unbelievable. ""I was thanking them for all they've done behind the scenes that no-one knows about."" Jeremy Corbyn later visited the site and wrote a message on a wall in the shadow of the tower saying: ""Love and sympathy to all at Grenfell. Together we mourn. Together we overcome."" The Labour leader was hugged by a boy after writing a message of support on a memorial wall By BBC reporter Alice Evans, in North Kensington Hundreds of people gathered in the shadow of the charred tower block to pay their respects. Young and old, the survivors and bereaved wore bright green scarves to match the green heart that's become the symbol of this community's solidarity and integrity. Many of the fences, bus stops and lampposts displaying the same vibrant ribbons still have tape markings on them - ghostly reminders of the missing person posters that a year ago today were hastily, hopefully being stuck on any free space.

"Alemishet Demissie lived on the 12th floor of Grenfell Tower In the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire a year ago, a series of promises were made to the survivors, especially concerning rehousing. Have they been delivered? ""In this property I might feel lonely, but that's life. We have to move on. There is no other way of doing this,"" says Alemishet Demissie, 70, who lived alone on the 12th floor of Grenfell Tower. Since her home was destroyed, she has lived between hotels and temporary flats, but the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme joined her as she moved into a permanent property. ""I'm happy - I can't ask for more, considering the situation,"" she says. After the fire, the government made two separate promises to the displaced residents, who had been living in 138 of the flats in the tower and the adjacent Grenfell Walk. The Prime Minister, Theresa May, promised they would be rehoused within three weeks of the fire. And by 5 July, three weeks after the fire, all of those 138 households that wanted contact with the council had been offered temporary accommodation - but only nine of these offers, of an interim flat or house, had been accepted, with most families still living in hotel rooms. Duke of Cambridge joins DIY SOS Grenfell crew Visual guide to the Grenfell Tower fire Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Grenfell: Inside the 21st floor The second promise, made by Housing Minister Alok Sharma, was that the council, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea (RBKC), would provide the residents of the 138 flats with a permanent home within a year. This video can not be played Mohammed and Zahra used to live in Grenfell Tower, but home has been a hotel room for the past year And as of 13 June, 364 days after the fire, the council has committed over Â£235m to secure 307 homes, most but not all of which has now been spent. The survivors, who lived in 138 of the flats in the tower and the adjacent Grenfell Walk, have now split into 203 households - 116 from the tower and 22 from the walk. Some of the original households living in the tower contained multiple generations, for example grandparents and grown-up children, who are now being given the opportunity to have homes of their own. The council says it has committed to securing 307 homes to provide the 203 households with a choice of properties. As of 13 June, according to the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea: the council has made a total of 971 offers of some kind of accommodation to the 203 households 198 of the 203 have now accepted an offer of a home 135 of these have moved in - 52 into an temporary home, 83 into a permanent home 68 households from Grenfell Tower and Walk are still living in emergency accommodation - of these, 42 are in hotels, 22 are in serviced apartments and four are staying with family or friends 90 households from the surrounding estate - but not the tower or Grenfell Walk - are also still living in emergency or temporary accommodation, prior to moving back to their original homes Many of the 203 households that have accepted an offer of a new home say they have been waiting for refurbishment to be completed before they can move in. Antonio Roncolato lived on the 10th floor of Grenfell Tower with his 27-year-old son, Chris. Since the fire, he has lived in two hotels and, now, a temporary flat. Chris is being rehoused separately. ""It's a beautiful house, but it's not my flat. It doesn't reflect my identity, my way of being,"" Antonio says of his current home. ""It's nicely decorated, but it is not my personal home like I had in Grenfell Tower."" Antonio praised the work of council workers on the ground Over the past year, Antonio, who was aged 57 at the time of the fire, has turned down six offers of permanent accommodation from the council. When asked whether he was worried that people might lose sympathy with survivors turning down offers of permanent accommodation, he said he had shown interest in various properties but ""only a few would match what they would call my 'descriptions'"". ""I'm entitled to a two-bedroom flat, with a kitchen and a bathroom,"" he says. ""Moving a property for the rest of your life, it's not buying a car or a motorbike, where you think you'll keep it for three or four years and replace it. ""So, I have to have a feeling that, 'Yes, this is it.'"" Antonio has turned down flats on the top floors of blocks with no lifts and one because he felt the kitchen was too small with no connection for a washing machine. While praising the council employees on the ground, he criticises its leadership. ""I never asked for promises,"" he says. ""It is unprecedented. It is very difficult."" But, Antonio adds: ""We need to wait as long as it takes for me to find the right accommodation, because they kept on promising things and they cannot [deliver], so what trust can I have?"" Polly Neate, chief executive of housing charity Shelter, says the fact so many people are still living in emergency or temporary accommodation is ""disgraceful"" but a symptom of the fact there is simply not enough housing available. ""It isn't really true to say that the council haven't made any effort to rehouse people,"" she says. ""It also isn't true to say that the former residents of Grenfell are being fussier than they should be in any way. ""There is a dire shortage of housing. And if that teaches us anything, it's that we need to be building more housing."" Council leader Elizabeth Campbell said: ""The families involved are not statistics that need to be moved around a balance sheet.  So, we will no longer set deadlines. They are not required. ""What is required is understanding, support, and above all a willingness to do everything we can to help - no matter how large or small the task."" A spokesman for the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government said: ""Ministers have been clear that the council must work quickly to rehouse survivors. And we expect them to do whatever is necessary to ensure people can move into settled homes as swiftly as possible."" Meanwhile, as she unpacks her belongings, Ms Demissie says: ""We've all been through a lot, but there's no point in thinking about the past - better to aim for a positive future.""

"This video can not be played Grenfell memorial events were held to remember the victims About 5,000 people are estimated to have taken part in a silent walk in honour of the 72 people killed in the Grenfell Tower fire a year ago. Firefighters laid down their helmets and formed a guard of honour as the marchers - carrying banners and wearing green - passed by. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and London Mayor Sadiq Khan joined the event near the tower in West London. Earlier a silent procession followed a memorial service at a nearby church. Silent walks have been held in the neighbourhood on the 14th of every month since the fire, attracting hundreds of people. The Met Police estimated 5,000 people took part in the evening walk at the end of the day of remembrance for the victims of the disaster. Firefighters formed a guard of honour for the walk Some of the people on the walk stopped to hug the firefighters as they passed A 72-second national silence was held at midday as part of the anniversary. It was observed across the country, including at government buildings, Parliament and by the Queen and the Duchess of Sussex on a visit to Chester, where the monarchwore green in honour of Grenfell victims. This video can not be played Tube driver stops train and waves green flag in solidarity for Grenfell The names of the 72 victims were read out at the memorial service held at St Helen's Church, near the tower. Bereaved families were invited to light candles in memory of their loved ones at the church, which had been decked out in green - the colour adopted by survivors and relatives of those who died. Clarrie Mendy, who lost two family members in the fire and organised the service attended by several hundred people, said: ""It's a service of healing, community, inclusivity and solidarity, to know we are not alone."" Addressing the service, Labour MP David Lammy, whose family friend died in the fire, said it was a ""bittersweet"" moment as the community celebrated their unity but mourned those lost. White doves were released outside the church after the service. Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Global roots of fire victims 'Grenfell was a symbol of hope' Ms Mendy then led the silent procession towards Grenfell Tower, accompanied by other bereaved relatives carrying a large floral display spelling ""Humanity for Grenfell"". Relatives holding banners marched to the tower after the service Wreaths were laid by the London mayor and the Duke of Kent during another service at a memorial close to the base of the tower. Singers Stormzy, Adele and Marcus Mumford, who have been vocal supporters of those affected by the fire, were at the event. Stormzy joined the mourners for the service at the base of Grenfell Tower Nicholas Burton, whose wife Maria del Pilar Burton died in January and is considered the 72nd victim of the fire, said he chatted with all three singers during the day. He said: ""I went into the sports centre and I hear 'Hi Nick' and it's Adele calling me over, who introduced me to her new husband and then Marcus comes over and we had a hug, then Stormzy comes over - they have all been unbelievable. ""I was thanking them for all they've done behind the scenes that no-one knows about."" Jeremy Corbyn later visited the site and wrote a message on a wall in the shadow of the tower saying: ""Love and sympathy to all at Grenfell. Together we mourn. Together we overcome."" The Labour leader was hugged by a boy after writing a message of support on a memorial wall By BBC reporter Alice Evans, in North Kensington Hundreds of people gathered in the shadow of the charred tower block to pay their respects. Young and old, the survivors and bereaved wore bright green scarves to match the green heart that's become the symbol of this community's solidarity and integrity. Many of the fences, bus stops and lampposts displaying the same vibrant ribbons still have tape markings on them - ghostly reminders of the missing person posters that a year ago today were hastily, hopefully being stuck on any free space.

"This video can not be played Paralysed rat picks up sugar cube after gene therapy repairs spinal cord Scientists say they have taken a significant step towards the goal of giving paralysed people control of their hands again. The team at King's College London used gene therapy to repair damage in the spinal cord of rats. The animals could then pick up and eat sugar cubes with their front paws. It is early stage research, but experts said it was some of the most compelling evidence that people's hand function could one day be restored. The spinal cord is a dense tube of nerves carrying instructions from the brain to the rest of the body. The body repairs a wounded spinal cord with scar tissue. However, the scar acts like a barrier to new connections forming between nerves. The researchers were trying to dissolve components of the scar tissue in the rats' spinal cord. They needed to give cells in the cord a new set of genetic instructions - a gene - for breaking down the scar. The instructions they gave were for an enzyme called chondroitinase. And they used a virus to deliver them. Finally, a drug was used to activate the instructions. The animals regained use of their front paws after the gene therapy had been switched on for two months. Dr Emily Burnside, one of the researchers, said: ""The rats were able to accurately reach and grasp sugar pellets. ""We also found a dramatic increase in activity in the spinal cord of the rats, suggesting that new connections had been made in the networks of nerve cells."" The researchers hope their approach will work for people injured in car crashes or falls. Prof Elizabeth Bradbury told the BBC: ""We find this really exciting, recovery of this type of function, because for spinal injured patients their highest priority is to get their hand function back. ""Being able to pick up a coffee cup, hold a toothbrush, these types of things will have a dramatic increase on their quality of life and their independence."" In 2014, a paralysed man was able to walk with a frame after cells from inside his nose were used toregenerate part of his spinal cord. The patient, Darek Fidyka, was injured in a knife attack that caused a different type of wound to those in car crashes. The gene therapy approach is not yet ready for human clinical trials. Dr Mark Bacon, from the charity Spinal Research, told the BBC: ""The data is some of the most compelling I've seen demonstrating restoration of skilled forelimb function. ""It's exciting, but getting approval for gene therapies represents a particular, but not insurmountable, challenge to getting it to the clinic. ""Transferred to the clinic, this research could be life-changing for the millions of people worldwide with paralysis caused by a spinal cord injury.""

"Police re-opened the case in 2012 with a call for witnesses French police have arrested a couple 31 years after their daughter was found dead, in a cold case revived through DNA evidence. The mutilated body of the child, named by police as Inass, was found by a motorway in central France in 1987. The parents were traced after the DNA of their son, tested in an unrelated case, was matched with that of the girl, French media report. Authorities say the parents are now under formal investigation. Inass's body was found in a ditch along the A10 motorway near the city of Blois in August 1987, clothed and covered in a blanket. In a news conference on Thursday, Blois prosecutor FrÃ©dÃ©ric Chevallier said her parents, now aged 66 and 64 and named as Ahmed and Halima Touloub, were under investigation for the crimes of murdering a minor, violence against a minor and concealing a corpse. The two separated in 2010, and were arrested at their separate homes on Tuesday morning. Blois prosecutor FrÃ©dÃ©ric Chevallier gave a press conference about the arrested couple on Thursday evening Mr Chevallier said the girl was born on 3 July 1983, and so was four years old when her body was found. She was born in Casablanca in Morocco and initially lived with her maternal grandmother before joining her parents in late 1984 or early 1985. According to the prosecutor, Mr Touloub told police on his arrest that his wife had been violent to him and their children, and that they lived under ""her rule"". He spoke of his ""relief"" that the case had been reopened, Mr Chevallier said. He told authorities he had found Inass dead after returning from a trip to Morocco, and that her body was then abandoned by the side of the road. The mother, however, claimed it was her husband who had been violent. She also admitted ""occasionally"" being violent to Inass but insisted she was not involved in her death, Mr Chevallier said. The girl was buried in an unmarked grave near the location where the body was found When Inass's body was found in 1987, the authorities were unable to identify her and all physical evidence found with the body was preserved. Her body bore marks of horrific, long-standing abuse, including human bite marks, broken bones and burns with an iron. Parts of her body were mutilated. The investigating magistrate in Blois who was in charge of the case at the time said that it was ""practically a case of cannibalism with flesh being removed"". Nicknamed the ""little martyr of the A10"", her body was never claimed and her disappearance never reported. She was buried in an anonymous grave. At the time, the murder sparked one of France's biggest ever investigations, with the girl's photograph posted in public places and an alert sent to more than 30 countries. Some 65,000 schools were visited at the start of the school year, and 6,000 doctors or childminders were contacted to try to find the victim's name. The case baffled police for years.  It was declared unsolved in 1997. Can we still rely on DNA sampling? The detectives who hunt cold case killers In 2008, her DNA was formally identified, and the related information registered in a national genetic prints database. However no identification was made at that stage. The case was reopened in 2012 when a call for witnesses was released with a picture of the dead girl's face and the caption: ""Who is she?"" The apparent breakthrough in the case happened when a man was arrested over a violent incident in 2016. His DNA reportedly identified him as the victim's brother. Months of investigation then led police to the parents. Other prominent cases revived in recent years thanks to DNA evidence include: A former police officer arrested in April and accused of being the ""Golden State killer""who carried out a string of rapes and murders in the US in the 1970s and 80s The murder conviction in 2016 of an Italian man identified through DNA samples as the killer of 13-year-old Yara Gambirasio six years earlier Three held in French child murder mystery Remains of missing French girl found Officers who hunt cold case killers Can police rely on DNA sampling?

"The number of people waiting for a hospital operation in England is at its highest for more than a decade An estimated 4.2m people are waiting to be seen - the highest since 2007. April's figures also showed growing numbers waiting more than 18 weeks, the treatment target time, including people due to have cataract or back surgery and knee and hip replacements. The rising numbers come after the health service was forced to postpone thousands of operations in the winter. That action was taken to relieve the pressure on A&E departments. It means the number of patients now waiting longer than they should has topped 500,000 for the first time since 2008, although some trusts have had problems reporting data in previous months which has kept the figures lower than they were in reality. Janet Davies, Royal College of Nursing general secretary, said: ""Cancelling non-urgent care may have helped the NHS fight though one of the worst winters in recent memory, but patients in need of elective surgery should not have to pay the price for chronic staff shortages and years of underfunding."" Phillippa Hentsch, of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals, said the rising numbers were ""worrying"". She also highlighted the continued missed targets in cancer and A&E. And she added they demonstrated the need for ""substantial"" resources to be announced in the long-term funding settlement that has been promised by Prime Minister Theresa May. Ministers are currently discussing how much the NHS should get, with an announcement expected in the next few weeks in time for the 70th anniversary of the creation of the health service at the start of July.

At the commemoration event people wept together, clutching each other as each of the 72 victims' names was read out one at a time so that they could be remembered ""as individuals, and not merely as numbers"". The neighbourhood then led the nation into a silence. Some may welcome this time as a chance for quiet reflection - a peaceful moment in which to pay respects. Here beneath the blackened shell of the tower, it did not feel peaceful though. It was more like a grief-stricken, still-shocked absence of sound as if the community was holding its breath.

"Mr Trump's children, Ivanka, Eric, and Donald Jr were named in the lawsuit New York's attorney general is suing the Trump Foundation, as well as Donald Trump and his children, alleging ""extensive and persistent"" lawbreaking. Barbara Underwood said the charitable foundation had engaged in ""unlawful political co-ordination"" designed to influence the 2016 election. The lawsuit seeks to dissolve the foundation and $2.8m (Â£2.1m) in restitution. The foundation denied the charges, calling them politically motivated. The president hit back at the lawsuit on Twitter, saying that ""sleazy New York Democrats"" were ""doing everything they can to sue me"". He vowed he would not settle the case. Allow Twitter content?

The attorney general is also seeking to bar the president and three of his adult children, Donald Jr, Eric and Ivanka, from serving on the board of any New York-based charity, ""in light of misconduct and total lack of oversight"". She has referred the case to the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Election Commission, she says. Ms Underwood filed a petition at the New York Supreme Court in Manhattan on Thursday, Mr Trump's 72nd birthday. It accuses the foundation and its directors - Mr Trump and his three eldest children - of unlawfully co-ordinating with the Trump presidential campaign, repeated self-dealing transactions, and violating laws under which non-profit organisations must operate. In a statement, Ms Underwood said,externalMr Trump had illegally instructed the foundation to provide support to his presidential campaign by using the foundation's name and funds it raised to promote the campaign. The petition also claims that Mr Trump used charitable assets to pay off legal obligations, to promote his own businesses and to purchase personal items, including a painting of himself.

The Trump Foundation issued a statement denying the charges and accusing the attorney general of holding its $1.7 million in remaining funds ""hostage for political gain"". Ms Underwood is a Democrat. The president described the suit as ""ridiculous"". The younger Trumps have yet to comment publicly. The lawsuit announced on Thursday is the culmination of a two-year investigation, which began under the previous New York attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, Ms Underwood said. Mr Schneiderman resigned last monthafter several former girlfriends accused him of physical abuse. In October 2016Mr Schneiderman ordered the Trump Foundation to stop fundraising in New York, after finding it had no proper registration. President-elect Trumpvowed to shut the charitable foundation down in December 2016, to avoid ""even the appearance"" of any conflict of interest. The Trump Foundation lawsuit adds to Mr Trump's legal challenges, which include a wide-ranging special counsel investigation into alleged ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. Special Counsel Robert Mueller has indicted several of Mr Trump's associates and raided the home and office of the president's long-time lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen. Read more Could Trump pardon himself? What's the deal with the Trump Foundation? The one Trump statistic that explains everything Anthony Zurcher, North America reporter New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood has opened a new front in the ongoing criminal investigations into Donald Trump and his empire. Allegations of misdeeds connected to the Trump Foundation had swirled during the 2016 presidential elections, but the topic had been overshadowed during the early days of the Trump presidency. That may be about to change. Administration officials, from the president on down, will certainly attempt to brand this as yet another politically motivated investigation of an ideological adversary - new witches but the same hunt. Nevertheless, as New York Attorney General, Ms Underwood has significant investigatory and prosecutorial power, and if she starts looking into some of Mr Trump's more questionable charitable activities, there's no telling what she might turn up. At the very least, it appears the Trump world's celebrations of former Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's disgrace were a bit premature. Ms Underwood may not be as outspokenly anti-Trump as her predecessor, but she appears to be equally - or more - aggressive where it counts, in the courtroom. Thursday's 41-page document filed with the NY Supreme Court spells out a range of alleged violations of laws concerning non-profit organisations, dating back more than a decade. The investigation apparently found that the foundation was ""little more than an empty shell that functions with no oversight by its board of directors"". The board had not met since 1999, despite being legally required to meet annually, and did not oversee the foundation's activities ""in any way"", the document says. Mr Trump, who has not contributed any personal funds to the foundation since 2008, was the sole signatory on the foundation's bank accounts and approved all of its grants. Several pages of the document focus on a charity fundraiser for veterans in Iowa in January 2016, which Mr Trump chose to hold instead of taking part in a TV debate with other Republican presidential hopefuls ahead of the influential state's caucuses. More than $2.8m was donated to the Trump Foundation at that event. The petition alleges that those funds raised from the public were used to promote Mr Trump's campaign for the presidency, in particular in the Iowa nominating caucuses. The lawsuit also claims that the foundation paid $100,000 (Â£75,000) to settle legal claims against Mr Trump's Mar-A-Lago resort, $158,000 to settle claims against one of his golf clubs, and $10,000 to purchase a painting of Mr Trump to hang at another of his golf clubs. The purchase of the painting was an example of one of ""at least five self-dealing transactions"" which violate tax regulations on non-profit charities, the statement said. ""As our investigation reveals, the Trump Foundation was little more than a cheque book for payments from Mr Trump or his businesses to nonprofits, regardless of their purpose of legality,"" Ms Underwood said. ""This is not how private foundations should function.""

"A thick blanket of dust has added to the woes of the city Residents of India's capital Delhi are battling high pollution levels and extreme temperatures due to an unusual dust haze covering the city. People have been complaining about breathing problems, with many saying the city has become unliveable. The state government has responded by banning all construction and deploying the fire brigade to sprinkle water across the city. People have been advised to stay indoors as much as possible. ""In this case, dust has become a carrier of toxic pollutants. Pollution levels are 8-9 times higher than normal. And when we breathe, we are taking in toxic substances, which can have serious health repercussions,"" Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director of the Centre For Science and Environment, told BBC Hindi. Delhi's air pollution is triggering a health crisis India cities dominate world air pollution list Can Delhi ever clean up its foul air? Delhi is already one of the most polluted cities in the world but the recent weather pattern has caused more problems for its residents. Many have taken to social media to share their concerns and are urging the government to do something about it. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played Parliament is being reduced to a âschool debating chamber"" over Brexit says Conservative MP Antoinette Sandbach. The government's bid to avoid a Commons defeat on the Brexit bill has been rejected as ""slap in the face"" by leading rebel Dominic Grieve. Theresa May assured Mr Grieve ahead of a vote on Tuesday that his call for MPs to be given a greater say on a Brexit deal would be taken on board. But he said ministers had changed the wording of an amendment drawn up after talks with him, at the last minute. Further talks are expected ahead of the bill returning to Parliament next week. Solicitor General Robert Buckland said the government had to ""strike a balance"" between rebels' concerns and protecting the government's negotiating position in Brexit talks with the EU. Laura Kuenssberg: Tory psychodrama over Brexit bill PM 'must honour Brexit vote assurances' BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Remain-leaning Tory MPs were furious and it set the scene for another big showdown when the bill returns to Parliament. Mr Grieve, a former attorney general, told BBC One's Question Time he could not understand why the government amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill had been changed ""at the last minute"" after two days of talks. ""I'd actually got on a train. I thought it was all over,"" he said. Dominic Grieve: 'Something was inexplicably changed' He said the problem was that if the UK reached ""the really apocalyptic moment"" where no Brexit deal had been done by early February 2019, Parliament was not being offered the chance to say what should happen next - only to ""note"" the position. Later he told BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight: ""I simply don't understand why they have done this ... It does feel, I have to say, to be blunt about it, it seems a bit like a slap in the face."" He added that rebels would ""talk further to the government and try to resolve it"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Fellow backbencher Sarah Wollaston described the change as ""a sneaky sting in the tail"" while Anna Soubry described it as a ""big mistake by the prime minister"" adding: ""Unfortunately it looks like she's yet again caved into the hard Brexiteers."" Another pro-EU Tory MP, Stephen Hammond, suggested the amendment had been ""hijacked"" by government figures trying to ""force their will"" onto the process. Asked if ministers had caved into the demands of Brexiteers and changed the wording, Solicitor General Robert Buckland said: ""No, I'm not getting into some Tory psychodrama about this. ""Colleagues had their say and had an input into the process. No deals were done this was all a process that took several hours, to say the least, to try to produce something that could command support and I'm sorry that some colleagues feel that it doesn't go as far as they had hoped for, I really am. ""But we have to make a decision, we have to move forward, table an amendment and allow their lordships to have the vigorous debate that I'm sure will follow next week."" A spokesman for the Department for Exiting the European Union said the amendment addressed a ""hypothetical"" scenario adding: ""The government is confident we will agree a good deal with the EU which Parliament will support."" The bill will now returns to the House of Lords early next week, with both the government amendment and Mr Grieve's original amendment expected to be debated. It will then return to the Commons, where a fresh showdown is expected unless a deal is hammered out. The government's amendment to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill sets out what must happen in the event of three scenarios: If MPs vote down the UK-EU Brexit deal, if Theresa May announces before 21 January 2019 that no deal has been reached, or if 21st January passes with no deal being struck. Under these circumstances, a minister must make a statement in Parliament setting out their next steps and give MPs an opportunity to vote. However, the vote would be on ""a motion in neutral terms"", merely stating that the House has considered the statement. Mr Grieve had originally wanted the amendment to say that the government must seek the approval of Parliament for its course of action - and that ministers must be directed by MPs and peers. Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said: ""The government's amendment is simply not good enough. ""Theresa May has gone back on her word and offered an amendment that takes the meaning out of the meaningful vote. Parliament cannot - and should not - accept it."" Is another Commons showdown looming? Analysis By BBC political correspondent Ben Wright Former Attorney General Dominic Grieve, Anna Soubry and perhaps a dozen of their Conservative backbench colleagues are leading the fight to ensure the Commons has the chance to shape the government's next move, if no deal is reached with the EU. That is Labour's view too. But the government is emphatic Parliament should not have that power. Why? Because that would effectively neuter the UK government's threat to the EU, that it is prepared to walk out without a deal. That's why Brexiteers are so enraged by this row. And it's why Dominic Grieve and his parliamentary posse are steeled for a drawn-out fight with their own government. The argument moves back to the Lords on Monday before a likely final showdown in the Commons next Wednesday. A compromise may be brokered before then. But a Conservative source told me the bitterness within the party was now worse than it was during the Maastricht saga in the early 1990s - of which today's battle over Brexit is, perhaps, the final act. The UK is due to leave the EU in March 2019, and negotiations have been taking place on the terms of the separation and how the two sides will work together in the future. The government is trying to pass a new law, called the EU Withdrawal Bill, which it says is needed to ensure a ""smooth and orderly Brexit"". Its main purposes are to end the supremacy of EU law in the UK, and transfer existing EU law into UK law so the same rules and regulations apply on the day after Brexit. But as it passes through Parliament, MPs and peers have been trying to change it, in some cases adding bits on that would change the government's Brexit strategy. Mr Grieve summed up the suspicion on both sides of the Brexit argument: ""One background fear is that actually there are some people who would quite like to just tip the UK out of the EU with no deal at all ... the other one is that people are trying to stop Brexit happening.""

"The shocking case drew attention to the suffering of migrants smuggled to Europe Four men have received 25-year jail terms in Hungary over the deaths of 71 migrants who suffocated in a sealed lorry in August 2015. Police found the victims' decomposing bodies in the lorry, registered in Hungary and abandoned near an Austrian village. It came amid a migrant surge to Europe. An Afghan identified as the gang leader got 25 years, as did three Bulgarian accomplices. Ten others, all but one from Bulgaria, got shorter jail terms. They were all found guilty of people-smuggling. In 2015 Central Europe faced a huge influx of migrants, many of them fleeing Syria and other conflict zones. Austria's migrant disaster: Why did 71 die? Migrants risk death despite lorry tragedy EU court rejects migrant quota challenge The accused, on trial in the city of Kecskemet, can appeal against the verdicts. Most expressed remorse, but three of the Bulgarians remain at large and were tried in absentia. The victims came from Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and Iran. They included eight women and four children; the other 59 were men. All but one were identified. Crammed into the back of a small Volvo meat lorry, with standing room only, the 71 victims are believed to have suffocated less than three hours after it set off. They died on a scorching hot day while the lorry was still in Hungary. It was found near Parndorf, just across the border in Austria. The lorry, emblazoned with pictures of sausages and a chicken's head, had been sealed airtight. The alleged ringleader is an Afghan denied refugee status According to the prosecution, the smugglers knew that the migrants squeezed into the back were going to die, and they ignored the sound of them banging on the sealed interior, as the oxygen ran out. The alleged ringleader is Samsoor Lahoo, a 31-year-old Afghan. The evidence produced against him included a phone-tap recording in which he allegedly ordered the driver to keep going despite the victims' cries for help. Lahoo and three Bulgarians - his deputy, the lorry driver and the driver of a car that escorted it - were found guilty of killing the migrants. Each got 25 years, with no chance of parole - less, however, than the life terms demanded by prosecutors. The others got jail terms ranging from three to 12 years. In all, nine Bulgarians, Lahoo and a Lebanese national were in court. The defendants (centre) were tethered to police officers in court Prosecutors say the group was charging migrants up to â¬3,500 (Â£3,100; $4,100) per head and had planned two more smuggling journeys for 27 August - the day after the bodies were found. Between February and August 2015 they smuggled 1,200 migrants into Austria via Hungary, earning at least â¬300,000, prosecutors said. The tragedy fuelled an outpouring of sympathy for refugees and migrants, and was a catalyst in the decision in August 2015 to open borders and allow them to head on towards Germany. In 2015-2016 about one million were allowed to stay in Germany - a highly controversial decision. But as the crisis continued into 2016 Austria's then foreign minister and now Chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, played a key role in shutting down the Balkan route used by migrants. Barriers went up, including a formidable razor-wire fence on Hungary's southern border, completed in April 2017. Migrants risk death despite lorry tragedy Austria's migrant disaster: Why did 71 die?

"Mr Trump's children, Ivanka, Eric, and Donald Jr were named in the lawsuit New York's attorney general is suing the Trump Foundation, as well as Donald Trump and his children, alleging ""extensive and persistent"" lawbreaking. Barbara Underwood said the charitable foundation had engaged in ""unlawful political co-ordination"" designed to influence the 2016 election. The lawsuit seeks to dissolve the foundation and $2.8m (Â£2.1m) in restitution. The foundation denied the charges, calling them politically motivated. The president hit back at the lawsuit on Twitter, saying that ""sleazy New York Democrats"" were ""doing everything they can to sue me"". He vowed he would not settle the case. Allow Twitter content?

She has referred the case to the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Election Commission, she says. Ms Underwood filed a petition at the New York Supreme Court in Manhattan on Thursday, Mr Trump's 72nd birthday. It accuses the foundation and its directors - Mr Trump and his three eldest children - of unlawfully co-ordinating with the Trump presidential campaign, repeated self-dealing transactions, and violating laws under which non-profit organisations must operate. In a statement, Ms Underwood said,externalMr Trump had illegally instructed the foundation to provide support to his presidential campaign by using the foundation's name and funds it raised to promote the campaign.

The Trump Foundation issued a statement denying the charges and accusing the attorney general of holding its $1.7 million in remaining funds ""hostage for political gain"". Ms Underwood is a Democrat. The president described the suit as ""ridiculous"". The younger Trumps have yet to comment publicly. The lawsuit announced on Thursday is the culmination of a two-year investigation, which began under the previous New York attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, Ms Underwood said. Mr Schneiderman resigned last monthafter several former girlfriends accused him of physical abuse. In October 2016Mr Schneiderman ordered the Trump Foundation to stop fundraising in New York, after finding it had no proper registration. President-elect Trumpvowed to shut the charitable foundation down in December 2016, to avoid ""even the appearance"" of any conflict of interest. The Trump Foundation lawsuit adds to Mr Trump's legal challenges, which include a wide-ranging special counsel investigation into alleged ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. Special Counsel Robert Mueller has indicted several of Mr Trump's associates and raided the home and office of the president's long-time lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen. Read more Could Trump pardon himself? What's the deal with the Trump Foundation? The one Trump statistic that explains everything Anthony Zurcher, North America reporter New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood has opened a new front in the ongoing criminal investigations into Donald Trump and his empire. Allegations of misdeeds connected to the Trump Foundation had swirled during the 2016 presidential elections, but the topic had been overshadowed during the early days of the Trump presidency. That may be about to change. Administration officials, from the president on down, will certainly attempt to brand this as yet another politically motivated investigation of an ideological adversary - new witches but the same hunt. Nevertheless, as New York Attorney General, Ms Underwood has significant investigatory and prosecutorial power, and if she starts looking into some of Mr Trump's more questionable charitable activities, there's no telling what she might turn up. At the very least, it appears the Trump world's celebrations of former Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's disgrace were a bit premature. Ms Underwood may not be as outspokenly anti-Trump as her predecessor, but she appears to be equally - or more - aggressive where it counts, in the courtroom. Thursday's 41-page document filed with the NY Supreme Court spells out a range of alleged violations of laws concerning non-profit organisations, dating back more than a decade. The investigation apparently found that the foundation was ""little more than an empty shell that functions with no oversight by its board of directors"". The board had not met since 1999, despite being legally required to meet annually, and did not oversee the foundation's activities ""in any way"", the document says. Mr Trump, who has not contributed any personal funds to the foundation since 2008, was the sole signatory on the foundation's bank accounts and approved all of its grants. Several pages of the document focus on a charity fundraiser for veterans in Iowa in January 2016, which Mr Trump chose to hold instead of taking part in a TV debate with other Republican presidential hopefuls ahead of the influential state's caucuses. More than $2.8m was donated to the Trump Foundation at that event. The petition alleges that those funds raised from the public were used to promote Mr Trump's campaign for the presidency, in particular in the Iowa nominating caucuses. The lawsuit also claims that the foundation paid $100,000 (Â£75,000) to settle legal claims against Mr Trump's Mar-A-Lago resort, $158,000 to settle claims against one of his golf clubs, and $10,000 to purchase a painting of Mr Trump to hang at another of his golf clubs. The purchase of the painting was an example of one of ""at least five self-dealing transactions"" which violate tax regulations on non-profit charities, the statement said. ""As our investigation reveals, the Trump Foundation was little more than a cheque book for payments from Mr Trump or his businesses to nonprofits, regardless of their purpose of legality,"" Ms Underwood said.

"Fortnite's maker says the game has attracted 125 million players since it launched last year Sony chiefs are under pressure to respond to complaints about ""cross-play"" restrictions imposed on Fortnite. Gamers have discovered that if they had first played the title on a PlayStation console, they are unable to use the same Fortnite account with the newly released Nintendo Switch edition. This prevents them from being able to make use of outfits and other in-game purchases and rewards they had accrued. There is no such limitation when moving between the Xbox One and Switch. Gamers were already unable to share a Fortnite account between Microsoft and Sony's platforms. Sony and other games companies are showing off new titles at the E3 games expo this week But the appeal of the Switch is that its portable nature allows owners to play when away from home, and so many have bought it as a second games machine. Sony has yet to confirm it is responsible for the constraint, but it issued the following statement to the BBC. ""We're always open to hearing what the PlayStation community is interested in to enhance their gaming experience,"" it said. ""With... more than 80 million monthly active users on PlayStation Network, we've built a huge community of gamers who can play together on Fortnite and all online titles. ""We also offer Fortnite cross-play support with PC, Mac, iOS, and Android devices, expanding the opportunity for Fortnite fans on PS4 to play with even more gamers on other platforms."" ""We have nothing further to add beyond this at this point,"" a spokeswoman added. This video can not be played WATCH: Fans flocked to Fortnite's first live event on Tuesday Both Microsoft and Fortnite publisher Epic Gameshave previously indicated that the Japanese company had chosen,externalto prevent PlayStation gamers competing against other console owners in the title's multi-player fight-to-the-death Battle Royale mode. Sony has faced criticism for blocking cross-play in other titles in the past, including Minecraft and Rocket League. But the sheer scale of Fortnite's success means the backlash has the potential to be more damaging this time round. Fortnite was added to Nintendo's online store earlier this week Epic said this week thatthe title has amassed 125 million players worldwide,external. And Nintendo has announced that its free-to-play version of the gamewas downloaded more than two million times,externalin the 24 hours after its release on the Switch on Tuesday. Fortnite's World Cup to be 'open to all' Switch gets Fortnite and Super Smash Bros Ultimate PS4's Last of Us sequel kisses then kills Complaints about the matter are already threatening to overshadow Sony's publicity efforts at the E3 video games show in Los Angeles. Much of the profit from Fortnite comes from its sale of in-game outfits Each time it posts news about its latest releases to Twitter and Facebook, people have responded by demanding that it allow them to share their Fortnite logins and permit cross-play.

The PlayStation 4 is the strongest selling console of this generation by a large margin, but one industry watcher said that this did not make it immune to attack. ""Sony has got to be very careful about how it manages the situation,"" Samantha Loveridge, associate editor of GamesRadar+ told the BBC. ""Fortnite is absolutely massive and it's only going to get bigger - it's about to come to Android - so Sony has got to start thinking about its closed-garden ecosystem. ""One way or another, gamers deserve an explanation as to why this compatibility issue exists."" Nintendo is showing off its version of Fornite - which is limited to the Battle Royale Mode - at E3 Sony does allow compatibility with the PC and iOS versions of the game, indicating that the Xbox/Switch block it is a strategic choice rather than a technical impossibility. While gamers await comment from the PlayStation firm, its rivals have piled on the pressure. When asked about the matter, Nintendo's North America chiefReggie Fils-Aime told the IGN news site,external: ""What competitors do is their decision to make. We believe being both developer-forward and fan-forward is in the best interest of the game."" And one of Microsoft's gaming chiefs as well as one of its corporate accounts have also tweeted about the issue. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Police re-opened the case in 2012 with a call for witnesses French police have arrested a couple 31 years after their daughter was found dead, in a cold case revived through DNA evidence. The mutilated body of the child, named by police as Inass, was found by a motorway in central France in 1987. The parents were traced after the DNA of their son, tested in an unrelated case, was matched with that of the girl, French media report. Authorities say the parents are now under formal investigation. Inass's body was found in a ditch along the A10 motorway near the city of Blois in August 1987, clothed and covered in a blanket. In a news conference on Thursday, Blois prosecutor FrÃ©dÃ©ric Chevallier said her parents, now aged 66 and 64 and named as Ahmed and Halima Touloub, were under investigation for the crimes of murdering a minor, violence against a minor and concealing a corpse. The two separated in 2010, and were arrested at their separate homes on Tuesday morning. Blois prosecutor FrÃ©dÃ©ric Chevallier gave a press conference about the arrested couple on Thursday evening Mr Chevallier said the girl was born on 3 July 1983, and so was four years old when her body was found. She was born in Casablanca in Morocco and initially lived with her maternal grandmother before joining her parents in late 1984 or early 1985. According to the prosecutor, Mr Touloub told police on his arrest that his wife had been violent to him and their children, and that they lived under ""her rule"". He spoke of his ""relief"" that the case had been reopened, Mr Chevallier said. He told authorities he had found Inass dead after returning from a trip to Morocco, and that her body was then abandoned by the side of the road. The mother, however, claimed it was her husband who had been violent. She also admitted ""occasionally"" being violent to Inass but insisted she was not involved in her death, Mr Chevallier said. The girl was buried in an unmarked grave near the location where the body was found When Inass's body was found in 1987, the authorities were unable to identify her and all physical evidence found with the body was preserved. Her body bore marks of horrific, long-standing abuse, including human bite marks, broken bones and burns with an iron. Parts of her body were mutilated. The investigating magistrate in Blois who was in charge of the case at the time said that it was ""practically a case of cannibalism with flesh being removed"". Nicknamed the ""little martyr of the A10"", her body was never claimed and her disappearance never reported. She was buried in an anonymous grave. At the time, the murder sparked one of France's biggest ever investigations, with the girl's photograph posted in public places and an alert sent to more than 30 countries. Some 65,000 schools were visited at the start of the school year, and 6,000 doctors or childminders were contacted to try to find the victim's name. The case baffled police for years.  It was declared unsolved in 1997. Can we still rely on DNA sampling? The detectives who hunt cold case killers In 2008, her DNA was formally identified, and the related information registered in a national genetic prints database. However no identification was made at that stage. The case was reopened in 2012 when a call for witnesses was released with a picture of the dead girl's face and the caption: ""Who is she?"" The apparent breakthrough in the case happened when a man was arrested over a violent incident in 2016. His DNA reportedly identified him as the victim's brother. Months of investigation then led police to the parents. Other prominent cases revived in recent years thanks to DNA evidence include: A former police officer arrested in April and accused of being the ""Golden State killer""who carried out a string of rapes and murders in the US in the 1970s and 80s The murder conviction in 2016 of an Italian man identified through DNA samples as the killer of 13-year-old Yara Gambirasio six years earlier Three held in French child murder mystery Remains of missing French girl found Officers who hunt cold case killers Can police rely on DNA sampling?

"Copies of the CD of the composition will be given to all guests at the thanksgiving service The words of renowned physicist Professor Stephen Hawking will be beamed into space as a ""message of peace and hope"", his family has said. His words have been set to an original score by composer Vangelis, famous for his Chariots of Fire film theme. The music will be beamed towards the nearest black hole following a service of thanksgiving for Professor Hawking's life at Westminster Abbey on Friday. He died in March, aged 76, after a long battle with motor neurone disease. The satellite broadcast will take place after the service, which will feature readings and addresses from people including Benedict Cumberbatch, who played the physicist in a BBC drama, and astronaut Tim Peake. Professor Hawking's life story was made into a film starring Eddie Redmayne The music chosen to accompany her father's words is a ""beautiful and symbolic gesture that creates a link between our father's presence on this planet, his wish to go into space and his explorations of the universe in his mind"", the professor's daughter Lucy said. She added: ""The broadcast will be beamed towards the nearest black hole, 1A 0620-00, which lives in a binary system with a fairly ordinary orange dwarf star. ""It is a message of peace and hope, about unity and the need for us to live together in harmony on this planet."" The composition will be beamed into space from the European Space Agency satellite dish at Ceberos in Spain. A CD of the piece - a personal tribute to the professor byVangelis, the Greek composerof electronic, progressive, jazz, pop rock and orchestral music - will be given to all guests at the Westminster Abbey service. Family and friends are set to attend as well as up to 1,000 members of the public who applied for seats in a ballot. ProfHawking died in Cambridge on 14 Marchand thousands lined the streets of the city for hisfuneral later that month.

"This video can not be played Rolls-Royce to cut 4,600 jobs Engineering firm Rolls-Royce is to cut 4,600 jobs over the next two years as part of a major reorganisation. Middle managers and back-office staff are to bear the brunt of the cuts, which are expected to hit its Derby base hard. The company is refocusing its business on civil aerospace, defence and power systems. About a third of the job cuts are expected to happen by the end of this year, Rolls-Royce said. The programme is expected to continue throughout 2019, with full implementation by mid-2020. Rolls-Royce said that the programme would cost Â£500m to carry out, including redundancies, but would save it Â£400m a year by the end of 2020. The firm also said it would continue to work on its problems with its Trent 1000 engine. Parts in the engines have been wearing out faster than anticipated, causing some planes to be grounded. Rolls-Royce has saidit will take years to modify all the enginesin service. Live reaction to Rolls-Royce job cuts Rolls-Royce cuts 'too far and too fast' Dominic O'Connell, Today programme business presenter Warren East took over at Rolls-Royce in the middle of a full-sized crisis - five successive profits warnings had led shareholders to question whether the company's management was actually in control. He could have taken drastic action then, but company insiders say his first priority was to steady the ship and reassure the City the company was not on a fatal downward spiral. That has largely been achieved. That is crucial to shareholders, because it offers a measure of Rolls-Royce delivering on its ""jam tomorrow"" promise of turning its increasing sales of engines - on which the company loses money - into profitable service and maintenance activities in a few years' time. Now Mr East is carrying out the next stage of the plan, cutting the middle-management fat to make Rolls-Royce even more profitable. But big strategic challenges await. There is a big crossroads looming in the shape of a new generation of small aircraft. Rolls-Royce missed out on this market last time round and probably cannot afford to do so again. Chief executive Warren East told the BBC's Today programme that Rolls-Royce needed fewer layers of management: ""We have too complex a management and support organisation and we need to simplify that so that we can remain competitive."" He said the cuts would be ""most strongly felt"" in Derby, since that was where most of those functions were based. Mr East said it was ""inevitable"" that there would be some compulsory redundancies because of the timescale of the programme, although the firm would honour its commitments to unions. This video can not be played Rolls-Royce boss Warren East says cutting jobs required a very difficult decision Chris Williamson, Labour MP for Derby North, said the job cuts were ""a damning indictment"" of the government's hands-off industrial policy. ""Currently we have private shareholders directing the fate of some of Britain's most premier firms, with total disregard for the economic needs of the country. The government has to intervene,"" he said. A spokesperson from the Department for Business said: ""The government is in regular contact with Rolls-Royce on its plans to reduce its back office and support functions workforce as a result of its restructuring programme. ""This is clearly an uncertain time for affected employees and their families and Jobcentre Plus Rapid Response stands ready to help people back into employment as soon as possible. ""Rolls-Royce continues to invest in its UK operations, most recently with an additional Â£150m in a new large engine test-bed facility in Derby, positioning it to grow further and support increased engine production to deliver on its record order book."" Shares in Rolls-Roycewere up 4% shortly after midday. Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""A slimmer, more efficient Rolls Royce is good for UK aerospace in the long run, though job losses along the way mean the journey comes with a cost."" The company's earnings for 2017 were better than expected, with profits before tax of Â£4.9bn. That followed a Â£4.6bn loss in 2016 - the largest in Rolls-Royce's history - due to settling corruption cases and currency hedges going wrong, among other factors. In June 2017, Rolls-Royce cut a deal with unions to safeguard7,000 front-line engineering jobs in the East Midlands for five yearsand invest in UK aerospace facilities.

"This video can not be played Mr Blackford returned to the Commons the morning after being expelled The SNP will continue to ""frustrate what the government are doing as much as we possibly can"", the party's Westminster leader has said. Ian Blackford led a walk-out of his MPs during Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday over the government's handling of the Brexit bill. Opponents branded the move a ""pre-prepared stunt"" aimed only at furthering the cause of independence. Mr Blackford said it was ""not the end of the matter, it is the beginning"". The walk-out came after Speaker John Bercow expelled Mr Blackford from the chamber when the MP refused to sit down after asking for the Commons to sit in private. SNP MPs were furious after amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill affecting Scotland were passed after less than 20 minutes of debate the previous evening, with the only speech being from Cabinet Office minister David Lidington. Brian Taylor on the Brexit consent row Sturgeon 'proud' of MPs' walkout protest SNP MPs walk out of PMQs in protest Mr Bercow has now granted the party an urgent debate on Brexit and devolution in the Commons, which will be held on Monday and last up to three hours. Holyrood had previously refused to grant formal consent to the bill, with Labour, Green and Lib Dem MSPs uniting with the SNP to outvote the Conservatives. The opposition centres on the bill ""temporarily"" constraining Holyrood's ability to use 24 powers that return from Brussels for up to seven years. SNP MPs including Mr Blackford (centre) gathered on College Green after Wednesday's walk-out The UK government, which reached an agreement with the Welsh government over the issue, says this will ensure the same rules and regulations remain in place across the UK in areas such as agriculture and food labelling. The remainder of the 153 returning powers will go straight to the Scottish Parliament, however. Speaking in the Scottish Parliament, Nicola Sturgeon argued that this week's events had been ""the most clear and powerful evidence so far that the Westminster system simply does not work for Scotland"". The first minister also repeated her claim that the Tories had ""ripped up the convention that has underpinned devolution for nigh on 20 years"" and predicted the party would pay a ""heavy price"". A protest against what the SNP claims is a ""Westminster power grab"" was held outside the Scottish Parliament on Thursday The UK government has signalled that it wants to continue working with its opponents towards finding a resolution to the long-running row. In a statement to MPs on Thursday afternoon, Scottish Secretary David Mundell said the powers at the centre of the row had been ""handed to the European Union through our membership in 1972, long before devolution existed in Scotland"". They had therefore never been under the control of Holyrood, and it was wrong to argue that the powers had been ""taken away"" from the Scottish Parliament, he added. Mr Mundell made a statement to MPs on the row on Thursday afternoon Mr Mundell, who faced calls to resign from opposition parties, said the government would press on with its Brexit plans despite the lack of Holyrood consent, but insisted its aim was still for agreement to be reached between the two sides. He added: ""The Scottish government's position from the outset was that they would be content with nothing less than a veto. However, such an unreasonable position would fundamentally undermine the integrity of the UK internal market. ""We on this side of the house have compromised, we have made every effort to reach agreement. We have sought consent. ""Now, we are legislating in line with the Sewel Convention to ensure the whole of the United Kingdom leaves the EU with as much legal certainty as possible. That's what people and businesses in Scotland need."" The Sewel Convention states that the UK Parliament has the authority to legislate on any issue, whether devolved or not, but will ""not normally"" do so in devolved areas without the consent of the Scottish Parliament. But Mr Mundell said: ""I think anyone would accept the UK leaving the EU are not normal circumstances."" This video can not be played SNP MPs walked out of the Commons in a row with the Speaker Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme earlier on Thursday, Mr Blackford said the SNP and Scottish government would mount a ""very robust defence of our parliamentary democracy, our parliamentary sovereignty and the rights of the Scottish people"". He insisted Wednesday's walk-out, which was backed by Ms Sturgeon, ""certainly hadn't been a stunt"" and that the UK was now in the midst of a ""constitutional crisis"". And he warned that a failure by the UK government to ""think again"" on the Brexit bill and its impact on the devolution settlement would see the SNP ""take whatever action is necessary"". Mr Blackford added: ""I will make sure that we can frustrate as much as we possibly can what the government are doing. ""We will remain civil, we will remain polite, we will remain courteous. But they need to understand that a line has now been crossed - the Conservatives are enacting legislation without the support of the Scottish Parliament. ""We are now in different territory."" Mr Blackford hinted that his party would next target the government's Trade Bill, which aims to ensure the UK can continue its existing trade policy as far as possible immediately after Brexit. Scottish Labour MP Paul Sweeney also criticised Mr Mundell, asking: ""If there is no agreement between the Scottish and UK governments, will he resign?"" Mr Sweeney also said it was clear that neither side had genuinely wanted to reach an agreement, and called for cross-party talks to resolve the dispute. He added: ""We have seen childish antics from the Tories when it comes to the programme motion, and we have seen childish antics from the SNP yesterday. ""The people of Scotland deserve better and they simply want this mess fixed by the politicians that they sent here to stand up for them before this shambles ends up in court."" Mr Mundell said his only regret was to see the ""once proud"" Scottish Labour Party move on to ""nationalist territory"" in backing the SNP over the consent row.

"Millie Bobby Brown has quit Twitter Millie Bobby Brown is the latest star to quit Twitter after being trolled. The 14-year-old Stranger Things actor was the subject of homophobic memes on the social media site. Users added ""quotes"" onto her selfies and photoshopped her into memes to make it appear that she was spreading anti-gay messages. It's not known whether the deactivating of her account is related to the online trolling. Star Wars actress Kelly Marie Tran experienced a fierce backlash from some fans This is part of a trolling trend, as three years ago some Twitter users added fake captions to pictures taken by Demi Lovato on Snapchat and Instagram. The captions discriminated against overweight and disabled people but were nothing to do with Lovato. This comes a week after Star Wars actress Kelly Marie Trandeleted all the posts on her Instagramafter months of abuse on social media. Her fellow Star Wars actorJohn Boyega has also urged fans of the franchise to stop harassing the cast on social media. Selena Gomez takes regular breaks from social media Selena Gomez says when she found out she was the most-followed person on Instagram in 2016  (she currently has 138 million followers) she ""freaked out"". ""It had become so consuming to me. It's what I woke up to and went to sleep to. I was an addict, and it felt like I was seeing things I didn't want to see."" That's the reason she regularly takes breaks from posting content, shetold Vogue in 2017,external. Justin Bieber's Instagram followers - which now number 100 million - got too much for him in 2016 when he accused them of online bullying over his then-girlfriend Sofia Ritchie. ""If you guys are really fans you wouldn't be so mean to people that I like,"" he wrote in a post on the platform. The problems didn't stop, so Bieber quit the platform for six months. Lily James says she has a ""constant inner battle"" about social media Star Wars actress Daisy Ridley said becoming famousmade her delete her social media. The 25-year-old quit Instagram last year. In an interview with Radio Times, she says she did it because of how bad it is for mental health. Ridley said: ""The more I read about teenage anxiety, the more I think it's highly unhealthy for people's mental health. She added: ""It's such a weird thing for young people to look at distorted images of things they should be."" Cinderella actress Lily Jamesagreed with her comments, telling the BBC: ""I'm not on Twitter, I don't want to always have something to say, I want to save that for my life. ""Also I think, especially as a young person, you change your opinions every second, so [you shouldn't] put something down in concrete that's going to come back and haunt you."" The star returned to social media in December 2016 Ed Sheeran famously took a year-long break from social media in between his second and third albums as he said he was spending too much time on his phone. ""I find myself seeing the world through a screen and not my eyes so I'm taking this opportunity of me not having to be anywhere or do anything to travel the world and see everything I missed,"" he wrote in December 2015.

"The shocking case drew attention to the suffering of migrants smuggled to Europe Four men have received 25-year jail terms in Hungary over the deaths of 71 migrants who suffocated in a sealed lorry in August 2015. Police found the victims' decomposing bodies in the lorry, registered in Hungary and abandoned near an Austrian village. It came amid a migrant surge to Europe. An Afghan identified as the gang leader got 25 years, as did three Bulgarian accomplices. Ten others, all but one from Bulgaria, got shorter jail terms. They were all found guilty of people-smuggling. In 2015 Central Europe faced a huge influx of migrants, many of them fleeing Syria and other conflict zones. Austria's migrant disaster: Why did 71 die? Migrants risk death despite lorry tragedy EU court rejects migrant quota challenge The accused, on trial in the city of Kecskemet, can appeal against the verdicts. Most expressed remorse, but three of the Bulgarians remain at large and were tried in absentia. The victims came from Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and Iran. They included eight women and four children; the other 59 were men. All but one were identified. Crammed into the back of a small Volvo meat lorry, with standing room only, the 71 victims are believed to have suffocated less than three hours after it set off. They died on a scorching hot day while the lorry was still in Hungary. It was found near Parndorf, just across the border in Austria. The lorry, emblazoned with pictures of sausages and a chicken's head, had been sealed airtight. The alleged ringleader is an Afghan denied refugee status According to the prosecution, the smugglers knew that the migrants squeezed into the back were going to die, and they ignored the sound of them banging on the sealed interior, as the oxygen ran out. The alleged ringleader is Samsoor Lahoo, a 31-year-old Afghan. The evidence produced against him included a phone-tap recording in which he allegedly ordered the driver to keep going despite the victims' cries for help. Lahoo and three Bulgarians - his deputy, the lorry driver and the driver of a car that escorted it - were found guilty of killing the migrants. Each got 25 years, with no chance of parole - less, however, than the life terms demanded by prosecutors. The others got jail terms ranging from three to 12 years. In all, nine Bulgarians, Lahoo and a Lebanese national were in court. The defendants (centre) were tethered to police officers in court Prosecutors say the group was charging migrants up to â¬3,500 (Â£3,100; $4,100) per head and had planned two more smuggling journeys for 27 August - the day after the bodies were found. Between February and August 2015 they smuggled 1,200 migrants into Austria via Hungary, earning at least â¬300,000, prosecutors said. The tragedy fuelled an outpouring of sympathy for refugees and migrants, and was a catalyst in the decision in August 2015 to open borders and allow them to head on towards Germany. In 2015-2016 about one million were allowed to stay in Germany - a highly controversial decision. But as the crisis continued into 2016 Austria's then foreign minister and now Chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, played a key role in shutting down the Balkan route used by migrants. Barriers went up, including a formidable razor-wire fence on Hungary's southern border, completed in April 2017. Migrants risk death despite lorry tragedy Austria's migrant disaster: Why did 71 die?

"Stan Lee (left) became close to Mr Morgan (right) after his wife's death A temporary restraining order has been issued in Los Angeles against the carer of Marvel Comics magnate Stan Lee, following allegations of elder abuse. Keya Morgan, who has been the 95-year-old's manager for several months, has taken advantage of Mr Lee's vulnerability, his former lawyer Tom Lallas says. Mr Morgan is yet to comment. Stan Lee co-created and promoted comics such as Spider-Man and Black Panther through his company Marvel Comics. Many became household names, leaping from the comic book to the big screen. New York memorabilia dealer Mr Morgan, 41, ""inserted himself into Mr Lee's life"" afterhis British-born wife of 69 years, Joan, died in 2017, Mr Lallas wrote in the petition for the restraining order. Mr Lallas filed the petition on Mr Lee's behalf. Los Angeles Police are investigating the allegations of elder abuse. Who could follow The Avengers? Why the snobbery about superhero films? Critics hail 'bedazzling' Infinity War Mr Lallas has alleged in court documents that Mr Morgan controlled access to Mr Lee, including by hiring security guards, and moved him from his family home. ""Mr Morgan is unduly influencing Mr Lee and isolating him,"" Mr Lallas wrote. Mr Morgan was arrested on Monday on suspicion of making a false call to the police, reporting that a burglary was taking place at Mr Lee's home. Police say the call was made as two detectives and a social worker were conducting a welfare check on Mr Lee. Joan Lee, Stan Lee's wife of almost 70 years, died last July aged 95 According to a transcript of the 30 May call filed with the restraining order, Mr Morgan said that ""three unidentified people have gone inside this house and locked the door and locked his security out and I'm very, very scared that they're harming him"". In a video posted to his Twitter account this week, Mr Lee said that Mr Morgan, who was released on bail, was his ""only partner and business manager."" Allow Twitter content?

"NHS groups have welcomed the decision to relax immigration rules to allow more doctors and nurses from outside the EU into the UK. The Home Office said foreign medics would be excluded from the government's cap on skilled migration. NHS bosses said it would be a ""huge relief"" to health trusts while Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said it was ""extremely welcome"". The cap sets the limit for all non-EU skilled workers at 20,700 a year. It was introduced by Theresa May when she was home secretary but has prompted warnings it makes it hard to fill vacancies in the NHS. Labour described the move as a ""welcome U-turn"" while the Royal College of GPs said it was a ""great step forward"". But an immigration pressure group said the UK should train its own medics and not ""raid other countries"". 1,600 IT workers and engineers denied UK visas 10 charts explaining the UK's immigration system Relaxing visa rules for doctors and nurses So-called Tier 2 visas are used by employers to bring skilled workers to the UK from outside the European Economic Area and Switzerland. Since 2011, there has been a cap on the number of these visas that can be issued. Until December 2017, it had only been exceeded once, in June 2015, but recently it has been hit for several months in a row. The government said this was mostly driven by demand for NHS workers which make up 40% of all Tier 2 places. On Tuesday, it was reported by the Financial Times that 2,360 visa applications by doctors from outside the European Economic Area were refused in a five-month period, apparently because of the cap. And in April, NHS bosses warned that immigration rules were hampering their ability to find workers after visas for 100 Indian doctors were refused. NHS England had 35,000 nurse vacancies and nearly 10,000 doctor posts unfilled in February, according to an NHS Improvementreport,external. According to think tank Global Future, 12.5% of NHS England's staff are from overseas. That number rises to 45% in certain specialities including paediatric cardiologists and neurosurgeons. The current annual cap on these visas has also led to over 1,000IT specialists and engineersbeing denied visas. The proposed change will only apply to doctors and nurses - but the government said it would free up hundreds of visas a month for workers in other industries like IT and teaching. More details are to be set out on Friday. Dr Sandeep Kumar and his family have been affected by the cap Dr Sandeep Kumar contacted the BBC to describe how he had been affected by the cap. ""My wife and I are Indian Citizens. We currently work at the University Hospital in Kerry in Ireland. We both want to be GPs in the UK and after multiple exams we were able to secure training posts at a hospital in Blackpool due to start in August. ""The hospital in Kerry offered to extend our visas so we could continue in our current posts. We said no thank you, we have got our dream job in the UK. They therefore filled our posts. ""Then a month ago I had my visa application rejected because of the cap. My wife is still waiting on hers. ""Our visas in Ireland expire in August. We have a five month old daughter. We have been out of India for three years and no permanent place to go in India. ""I was delighted when I heard the news the cap was to be lifted but I need to know when it will be. We need something immediately. I think it is good to have some immigration controls but if there are skilled areas where there is a shortage then there shouldn't be a cap. ""The NHS needs doctors and we want to come to work there. It is the British public who will suffer in the end if there are staff shortages."" Home Secretary Sajid Javid, who recently suggested a rethink of several key parts of the government's immigration policy, said: ""I recognise the pressures faced by the NHS and other sectors in recent months. Doctors and nurses play a vital role in society and at this time we need more in the UK. That is why I have reviewed our skilled worker visa route."" BBC political correspondent Ben Wright said the announcement could also encourage others to argue for the net migration target of under 100,000 - which has never been met - to be abandoned. This video can not be played Sajid Javid is pressed on the government's migration target Saffron Cordery, of trade body NHS Providers, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the change was ""absolutely the right decision"". ""This is going to be a huge relief for trusts up and down the country who have been really struggling to fill their doctors and nurses vacancies,"" she said. The Royal College of GPs said the cap had been ""arbitrary, unhelpful and in fact quite destructive"" and described excluding medics from it as a ""great step forward"". Alp Mehmet, of pressure group Migration Watch, said he accepted the change but that it should not be the long-term solution. ""What we must not forget to do is train our own medical staff,"" he said, adding that the UK should not ""raid other countries that need doctors and nurses a great deal more than we do"". Speaking at the NHS Confederation's annual conference in Manchester, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said training places for doctors, nurses and midwives were up by 25%. But he added: ""In the period between now and when those training places convert into fully trained clinicians, the government should be flexible on visas. And that is why it is extremely welcome that today the prime minister has announced that doctors and nurses will be removed from the tier 2 visa caps."" UK government policy aims to reduce net migration to below 100,000 a year. ""Perhaps this is a sign that Sajid Javid is willing to take a bolder and more flexible approach to immigration, and deliver the kind of system that Britain will need after we leave the EU,"" said Sunder Katwala, director of the immigration think-tank British Future.

""The NHS needs doctors and we want to come to work there. It is the British public who will suffer in the end if there are staff shortages."" Home Secretary Sajid Javid, who recently suggested a rethink of several key parts of the government's immigration policy, said: ""I recognise the pressures faced by the NHS and other sectors in recent months. Doctors and nurses play a vital role in society and at this time we need more in the UK. That is why I have reviewed our skilled worker visa route."" BBC political correspondent Ben Wright said the announcement could also encourage others to argue for the net migration target of under 100,000 - which has never been met - to be abandoned. This video can not be played Sajid Javid is pressed on the government's migration target Saffron Cordery, of trade body NHS Providers, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the change was ""absolutely the right decision"". ""This is going to be a huge relief for trusts up and down the country who have been really struggling to fill their doctors and nurses vacancies,"" she said. The Royal College of GPs said the cap had been ""arbitrary, unhelpful and in fact quite destructive"" and described excluding medics from it as a ""great step forward"". Alp Mehmet, of pressure group Migration Watch, said he accepted the change but that it should not be the long-term solution. ""What we must not forget to do is train our own medical staff,"" he said, adding that the UK should not ""raid other countries that need doctors and nurses a great deal more than we do"". Speaking at the NHS Confederation's annual conference in Manchester, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said training places for doctors, nurses and midwives were up by 25%. But he added: ""In the period between now and when those training places convert into fully trained clinicians, the government should be flexible on visas. And that is why it is extremely welcome that today the prime minister has announced that doctors and nurses will be removed from the tier 2 visa caps."" UK government policy aims to reduce net migration to below 100,000 a year. ""Perhaps this is a sign that Sajid Javid is willing to take a bolder and more flexible approach to immigration, and deliver the kind of system that Britain will need after we leave the EU,"" said Sunder Katwala, director of the immigration think-tank British Future.

"Fake news, toxic debates and privacy issues are turning people off social news, a study says Fewer people are using Facebook to discover and discuss news, as messaging apps such as WhatsApp gain in popularity, a study has suggested. The seventh annualDigital News Report,externalsaid the fall in users accessing news on Facebook reflected concerns about privacy and the toxic nature of debate. Changes to Facebook's algorithms, which had de-prioritised news in people's feeds, had also played a part. The report sought to explore how people accessed news around the world. The research, by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, at the University of Oxford, was based on a YouGov online survey of 74,000 people in 37 countries. It suggested young audiences were more likely to use WhatsApp, Instagram and Snapchat for news, partly because there was a growing desire to discuss news in relative privacy. The proportion of those surveyed that accessed news via WhatsApp had tripled in four years, to 15%.  This tended to be much higher in countries, such as Malaysia and Turkey, where it can be dangerous to express views in more open networks. Report lead author Nic Newman said: ""We're seeing many switching their focus to more personal, private spaces like messaging apps for sharing and discussing news. ""This gives people more control over where and how they engage, but also potentially makes public debate and news distribution even more fragmented and opaque."" Using Facebook for news has declined in a number of countries. In the US, for example, consumption is down 9% compared with 2017. And focus groups suggested this was partly due to the way people debated issues on the platform. ""I've actually pulled back from using Facebook a lot since the whole political landscape changed over the last few years because I just find everyone's got an opinion,"" said one person, based in the UK. Facebook's decision to change its algorithms to favour posts of friends rather than external news also played a part in the decline of news on its platform, the report said, although much of the polling for the survey had been completed before the changes had taken effect. Concerns about fake news persisted, with most of those polled (54%) saying they were worried about the issue. And this proportion was highest in countries, such as the US, Brazil and Spain, where starkly contrasting political views combined with high social media use. Trust in news overall stood at 44% - but only 34% of those surveyed said they trusted news they found via search, and fewer than a quarter (23%) trusted news on social networks. Three-quarters believed publishers and online platforms were to blame, suggesting many counted biased or inaccurate reporting as fake as well as news that was completely fabricated. ""The frequent use of the dangerous and misleading term 'fake news' resonates with a long-standing crisis of confidence, where much of the public does not feel it can trust the news, especially in countries with highly polarised politics and where many media are vulnerable to undue economic or political influence,"" said Prof Rasmus Kleis Nielsen, one of the report authors. Many news publishers are considering a move to paid-for content - but the report suggested the appetite for this was mixed. Nordic countries had seen more people prepared to pay for content, the report indicated, but that could be due to the small number of publishers, most of which use paywalls to restrict access to news. In other countries, there was little subscription growth, the report said, although in the US the so-called Trump bump had continued as people signed up to digital services in order to follow the political twists and turns of the Trump presidency. Most of those polled were unaware of financial problems in the news industry, but more were willing to pay a subscription or give a donation if they had been made aware of them. ""The verdict is clear - people find that some news is worth paying for, but much of it is not,"" said Prof Nielsen. ""The challenge for publishers now is to ensure that the journalism they produce is truly distinct, relevant and valuable, and then effectively promoting it to convince people to donate or subscribe."" The report also indicated: The use of voice-activated digital assistants such as Amazon Echo and Google Home had continued to grow rapidly, opening new opportunities for news audio Podcasts were becoming popular across the world, and young people were far more likely to listen to them than speech radio The sizes of audiences tuning in for scheduled news bulletins were declining rapidly Consumers remained reluctant to watch news videos on publishers' websites, with Americans and Europeans wanting to see fewer online news videos WhatsApp rises as a force in news media Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

"This video can not be played Mr Blackford returned to the Commons the morning after being expelled The SNP will continue to ""frustrate what the government are doing as much as we possibly can"", the party's Westminster leader has said. Ian Blackford led a walk-out of his MPs during Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday over the government's handling of the Brexit bill. Opponents branded the move a ""pre-prepared stunt"" aimed only at furthering the cause of independence. Mr Blackford said it was ""not the end of the matter, it is the beginning"". The walk-out came after Speaker John Bercow expelled Mr Blackford from the chamber when the MP refused to sit down after asking for the Commons to sit in private. SNP MPs were furious after amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill affecting Scotland were passed after less than 20 minutes of debate the previous evening, with the only speech being from Cabinet Office minister David Lidington. Brian Taylor on the Brexit consent row Sturgeon 'proud' of MPs' walkout protest SNP MPs walk out of PMQs in protest Mr Bercow has now granted the party an urgent debate on Brexit and devolution in the Commons, which will be held on Monday and last up to three hours. Holyrood had previously refused to grant formal consent to the bill, with Labour, Green and Lib Dem MSPs uniting with the SNP to outvote the Conservatives. The opposition centres on the bill ""temporarily"" constraining Holyrood's ability to use 24 powers that return from Brussels for up to seven years. SNP MPs including Mr Blackford (centre) gathered on College Green after Wednesday's walk-out The UK government, which reached an agreement with the Welsh government over the issue, says this will ensure the same rules and regulations remain in place across the UK in areas such as agriculture and food labelling. The remainder of the 153 returning powers will go straight to the Scottish Parliament, however. Speaking in the Scottish Parliament, Nicola Sturgeon argued that this week's events had been ""the most clear and powerful evidence so far that the Westminster system simply does not work for Scotland"". The first minister also repeated her claim that the Tories had ""ripped up the convention that has underpinned devolution for nigh on 20 years"" and predicted the party would pay a ""heavy price"". A protest against what the SNP claims is a ""Westminster power grab"" was held outside the Scottish Parliament on Thursday The UK government has signalled that it wants to continue working with its opponents towards finding a resolution to the long-running row. In a statement to MPs on Thursday afternoon, Scottish Secretary David Mundell said the powers at the centre of the row had been ""handed to the European Union through our membership in 1972, long before devolution existed in Scotland"". They had therefore never been under the control of Holyrood, and it was wrong to argue that the powers had been ""taken away"" from the Scottish Parliament, he added. Mr Mundell made a statement to MPs on the row on Thursday afternoon Mr Mundell, who faced calls to resign from opposition parties, said the government would press on with its Brexit plans despite the lack of Holyrood consent, but insisted its aim was still for agreement to be reached between the two sides. He added: ""The Scottish government's position from the outset was that they would be content with nothing less than a veto. However, such an unreasonable position would fundamentally undermine the integrity of the UK internal market. ""We on this side of the house have compromised, we have made every effort to reach agreement. We have sought consent. ""Now, we are legislating in line with the Sewel Convention to ensure the whole of the United Kingdom leaves the EU with as much legal certainty as possible. That's what people and businesses in Scotland need."" The Sewel Convention states that the UK Parliament has the authority to legislate on any issue, whether devolved or not, but will ""not normally"" do so in devolved areas without the consent of the Scottish Parliament. But Mr Mundell said: ""I think anyone would accept the UK leaving the EU are not normal circumstances."" This video can not be played SNP MPs walked out of the Commons in a row with the Speaker Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme earlier on Thursday, Mr Blackford said the SNP and Scottish government would mount a ""very robust defence of our parliamentary democracy, our parliamentary sovereignty and the rights of the Scottish people"". He insisted Wednesday's walk-out, which was backed by Ms Sturgeon, ""certainly hadn't been a stunt"" and that the UK was now in the midst of a ""constitutional crisis"". And he warned that a failure by the UK government to ""think again"" on the Brexit bill and its impact on the devolution settlement would see the SNP ""take whatever action is necessary"". Mr Blackford added: ""I will make sure that we can frustrate as much as we possibly can what the government are doing. ""We will remain civil, we will remain polite, we will remain courteous. But they need to understand that a line has now been crossed - the Conservatives are enacting legislation without the support of the Scottish Parliament. ""We are now in different territory."" Mr Blackford hinted that his party would next target the government's Trade Bill, which aims to ensure the UK can continue its existing trade policy as far as possible immediately after Brexit. Scottish Labour MP Paul Sweeney also criticised Mr Mundell, asking: ""If there is no agreement between the Scottish and UK governments, will he resign?"" Mr Sweeney also said it was clear that neither side had genuinely wanted to reach an agreement, and called for cross-party talks to resolve the dispute. He added: ""We have seen childish antics from the Tories when it comes to the programme motion, and we have seen childish antics from the SNP yesterday. ""The people of Scotland deserve better and they simply want this mess fixed by the politicians that they sent here to stand up for them before this shambles ends up in court."" Mr Mundell said his only regret was to see the ""once proud"" Scottish Labour Party move on to ""nationalist territory"" in backing the SNP over the consent row.

"NHS groups have welcomed the decision to relax immigration rules to allow more doctors and nurses from outside the EU into the UK. The Home Office said foreign medics would be excluded from the government's cap on skilled migration. NHS bosses said it would be a ""huge relief"" to health trusts while Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said it was ""extremely welcome"". The cap sets the limit for all non-EU skilled workers at 20,700 a year. It was introduced by Theresa May when she was home secretary but has prompted warnings it makes it hard to fill vacancies in the NHS. Labour described the move as a ""welcome U-turn"" while the Royal College of GPs said it was a ""great step forward"". But an immigration pressure group said the UK should train its own medics and not ""raid other countries"". 1,600 IT workers and engineers denied UK visas 10 charts explaining the UK's immigration system Relaxing visa rules for doctors and nurses So-called Tier 2 visas are used by employers to bring skilled workers to the UK from outside the European Economic Area and Switzerland. Since 2011, there has been a cap on the number of these visas that can be issued. Until December 2017, it had only been exceeded once, in June 2015, but recently it has been hit for several months in a row. The government said this was mostly driven by demand for NHS workers which make up 40% of all Tier 2 places. On Tuesday, it was reported by the Financial Times that 2,360 visa applications by doctors from outside the European Economic Area were refused in a five-month period, apparently because of the cap. And in April, NHS bosses warned that immigration rules were hampering their ability to find workers after visas for 100 Indian doctors were refused. NHS England had 35,000 nurse vacancies and nearly 10,000 doctor posts unfilled in February, according to an NHS Improvementreport,external. According to think tank Global Future, 12.5% of NHS England's staff are from overseas. That number rises to 45% in certain specialities including paediatric cardiologists and neurosurgeons. The current annual cap on these visas has also led to over 1,000IT specialists and engineersbeing denied visas. The proposed change will only apply to doctors and nurses - but the government said it would free up hundreds of visas a month for workers in other industries like IT and teaching. More details are to be set out on Friday. Dr Sandeep Kumar and his family have been affected by the cap Dr Sandeep Kumar contacted the BBC to describe how he had been affected by the cap. ""My wife and I are Indian Citizens. We currently work at the University Hospital in Kerry in Ireland. We both want to be GPs in the UK and after multiple exams we were able to secure training posts at a hospital in Blackpool due to start in August. ""The hospital in Kerry offered to extend our visas so we could continue in our current posts. We said no thank you, we have got our dream job in the UK. They therefore filled our posts. ""Then a month ago I had my visa application rejected because of the cap. My wife is still waiting on hers. ""Our visas in Ireland expire in August. We have a five month old daughter. We have been out of India for three years and no permanent place to go in India. ""I was delighted when I heard the news the cap was to be lifted but I need to know when it will be.

"Albert Einstein wrote the travel diaries on a trip to Asia and the Middle East in the 1920s Newly published private travel diaries have revealed Albert Einstein's racist and xenophobic views. Written between October 1922 and March 1923, the diaries track his experiences in Asia and the Middle East. In them, he makes sweeping and negative generalisations, for example calling the Chinese ""industrious, filthy, obtuse people"". Einstein would later in life advocate for civil rights in the US, calling racism ""a disease of white people"". Read more about Albert Einstein Albert Einstein: A life spent re-imagining physics This is the first time the diaries have been published as a standalone volume in English. Published by Princeton University Press,The Travel Diaries of Albert Einstein: The Far East, Palestine, and Spain, 1922-1923,externalwas edited by Ze'ev Rosenkranz, assistant director of the California Institute of Technology's Einstein Papers Project. Einstein travelled from Spain to the Middle East and via Sri Lanka, then called Ceylon, on to China and Japan. The physicist describes arriving in Port Said in Egypt and facing ""Levantines of every shade... as if spewed from hell"" who come aboard their ship to sell their goods. He also describes his time in Colombo in Ceylon, writing of the people: ""They live in great filth and considerable stench down on the ground, do little, and need little."" Einstein went on the trip with his wife Elsa But the famous physicist reserves his most cutting comments for Chinese people. According to a piece in the Guardian about the diaries,he describes Chinese children as ""spiritless and obtuse"",external, and calls it ""a pity if these Chinese supplant all other races"". In other entries he calls China ""a peculiar herd-like nation,"" and ""more like automatons than people"", before claiming there is ""little difference"" between Chinese men and women, and questioning how the men are ""incapable of defending themselves"" from female ""fatal attraction"". Einstein happiness note sold for $1.6m The blackboard Albert Einstein left in Oxford in the 1930s Einstein's waves detected in star smash Noted for both his scientific brilliance and his humanitarianism, Albert Einstein emigrated to the US in 1933 after the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party. The Jewish scientist described racism as ""a disease of white people"" in a 1946 speech at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania. Analysis by Chris Buckler, BBC News, Washington Einstein's theory of relativity changed how people thought about space and time but these diaries demonstrate how his own personal views about race seem to have altered over the years. The writings may have been intended as private thoughts but their publication will upset some in America, where campaigners still celebrate Albert Einstein as one of the voices that helped shine a light on segregation. When he moved to the US in 1933 he was taken aback by the separate schools and cinemas for blacks and whites and Einstein subsequently joined the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. He is said to have told people that he saw similarities in the way Jews were being hounded in Germany and how African-Americans were being treated in his new homeland. He chose Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, a historically black college, to give one of his most damning speeches just a year after the end of World War Two. His diaries are full of gut reactions and private insights. In the context of the 21st Century they may tarnish the reputation of a man who is revered almost as much as a humanitarian as a scientist. But the words were written before he saw what racism could lead to in America and Germany - a country he had effectively fled.

"John Jupp with the huge 1,250 sq ft flag, which he bought from China for Â£380 A self-professed ""mad football fan"" has draped a huge flag across the front of his house to cheer on England in the World Cup.

"John Jupp with the huge 1,250 sq ft flag, which he bought from China for Â£380 A self-professed ""mad football fan"" has draped a huge flag across the front of his house to cheer on England in the World Cup. John Jupp, from Blyton, Lincolnshire, said the flag measures 1,250 sq ft (116 sq m) in size and completely covers the front of his house. England fans in cars have been showing their support by honking their horns, he said. Mr Jupp backed England to progress to the quarter finals of the tournament. ""It turns heads and people are always beeping as they go past,"" he said. More Lincolnshire news Mr Jupp has to use a rear entrance to get into his home as the flag covers the entirety of the front. He has also had to design a makeshift sign asking for all deliveries to go around the back. Mr Jupp, who describes himself as ""a mad football fan who loves international football"", bought the flag from China in 2010 for Â£380. It is thefourth outingfor the gargantuan St George's Cross. Hawking's words to be beamed into space Town airs laundry in support of mum Barlow takes that confetti criticism The flag covers the windows and front door of the house meaning the family have to use a rear entrance Mr Jupp said this summer's World Cup could be its last outing as it was now ""a bit shabby"". However, he has not ruled out buying a replacement, if he can convince his wife it is a good idea. It caused a ""bit of trouble"" for him during the European Championships in 2016 when his wife said ""no more"". ""But I've got her round again and she is fine,"" Mr Jupp said. On England's chances, Mr Jupp said he was confident Gareth Southgate's team would make it through the group stages, but thinks they could lose to Germany, on penalties, in the quarter finals. ""We have a fantastic squad this time round,"" he added. England's first game isagainst Tunisia on Monday. How are you preparing for the World Cup?

"This video can not be played Grenfell memorial events were held to remember the victims About 5,000 people are estimated to have taken part in a silent walk in honour of the 72 people killed in the Grenfell Tower fire a year ago. Firefighters laid down their helmets and formed a guard of honour as the marchers - carrying banners and wearing green - passed by. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and London Mayor Sadiq Khan joined the event near the tower in West London. Earlier a silent procession followed a memorial service at a nearby church. Silent walks have been held in the neighbourhood on the 14th of every month since the fire, attracting hundreds of people. The Met Police estimated 5,000 people took part in the evening walk at the end of the day of remembrance for the victims of the disaster. Firefighters formed a guard of honour for the walk Some of the people on the walk stopped to hug the firefighters as they passed A 72-second national silence was held at midday as part of the anniversary. It was observed across the country, including at government buildings, Parliament and by the Queen and the Duchess of Sussex on a visit to Chester, where the monarchwore green in honour of Grenfell victims. This video can not be played Tube driver stops train and waves green flag in solidarity for Grenfell The names of the 72 victims were read out at the memorial service held at St Helen's Church, near the tower. Bereaved families were invited to light candles in memory of their loved ones at the church, which had been decked out in green - the colour adopted by survivors and relatives of those who died. Clarrie Mendy, who lost two family members in the fire and organised the service attended by several hundred people, said: ""It's a service of healing, community, inclusivity and solidarity, to know we are not alone."" Addressing the service, Labour MP David Lammy, whose family friend died in the fire, said it was a ""bittersweet"" moment as the community celebrated their unity but mourned those lost. White doves were released outside the church after the service. Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Global roots of fire victims 'Grenfell was a symbol of hope' Ms Mendy then led the silent procession towards Grenfell Tower, accompanied by other bereaved relatives carrying a large floral display spelling ""Humanity for Grenfell"". Relatives holding banners marched to the tower after the service Wreaths were laid by the London mayor and the Duke of Kent during another service at a memorial close to the base of the tower. Singers Stormzy, Adele and Marcus Mumford, who have been vocal supporters of those affected by the fire, were at the event. Stormzy joined the mourners for the service at the base of Grenfell Tower Nicholas Burton, whose wife Maria del Pilar Burton died in January and is considered the 72nd victim of the fire, said he chatted with all three singers during the day. He said: ""I went into the sports centre and I hear 'Hi Nick' and it's Adele calling me over, who introduced me to her new husband and then Marcus comes over and we had a hug, then Stormzy comes over - they have all been unbelievable. ""I was thanking them for all they've done behind the scenes that no-one knows about."" Jeremy Corbyn later visited the site and wrote a message on a wall in the shadow of the tower saying: ""Love and sympathy to all at Grenfell. Together we mourn. Together we overcome."" The Labour leader was hugged by a boy after writing a message of support on a memorial wall By BBC reporter Alice Evans, in North Kensington Hundreds of people gathered in the shadow of the charred tower block to pay their respects. Young and old, the survivors and bereaved wore bright green scarves to match the green heart that's become the symbol of this community's solidarity and integrity. Many of the fences, bus stops and lampposts displaying the same vibrant ribbons still have tape markings on them - ghostly reminders of the missing person posters that a year ago today were hastily, hopefully being stuck on any free space. At the commemoration event people wept together, clutching each other as each of the 72 victims' names was read out one at a time so that they could be remembered ""as individuals, and not merely as numbers"". The neighbourhood then led the nation into a silence. Some may welcome this time as a chance for quiet reflection - a peaceful moment in which to pay respects. Here beneath the blackened shell of the tower, it did not feel peaceful though. It was more like a grief-stricken, still-shocked absence of sound as if the community was holding its breath. This video can not be played People fell silent across the country, including the Queen and Meghan The England football team held a minute's silence in Russia Ahead of the services, the tower and other London buildings were lit green at 00:54 BST, the time the fire was first reported in a flat on 14 June 2017. What's happened to money promised for fire survivors? 'I was upset but I didn't know how to express it' BBC London live including Grenfell anniversary coverage The victims' names were also read out at 01:30 BST during a vigil at another church in the area - St Clemet's where people fleeing Grenfell Tower had gathered on the night of the fire.

"This video can not be played Sajid Javid discussing the net migration target earlier this month Key parts of the UK's immigration policy - including on foreign students and doctors coming to the UK - will be reviewed, the home secretary has said. Sajid Javid told the BBC there was a ""perception problem"" over the decision to include students in net migration figures. And he said he would ""think more carefully"" about the cap on the number of skilled workers given visas. Mr Javid became home secretary in April after Amber Rudd quit. Speaking to the Andrew Marr Show, he also said he would be lobbying Chancellor Philip Hammond for more cash for policing, andconfirmed an increase in security officersto boost counter-terrorism efforts. 1,600 skilled workers denied UK visas Davidson 'angry' at Windrush scandal Who is Sajid Javid? 10 charts explaining the UK's immigration system However, Mr Javid said that addressing the issue of the Windrush scandal, which led to Ms Rudd's resignation, would be his top priority. He told the Marr show that changes had already been made to the ""hostile environment"" approach to illegal immigration, which critics say was responsible for the problems. These changes included rethinking restrictions on illegal migrants' rights to open bank accounts, he said. Mr Javid also said seven members of the Windrush generation who were wrongly deported had been contacted so far, with efforts under way to reach a further 24. On the wider approach to immigration, Prime Minister Theresa May has faced repeated calls to exclude foreign students from the government's drive to reduce net migration into the UK, including from Scottish Conservatives leader Ruth Davidson. Mr Javid said he understood criticism of the policy, and that he did ""empathise"" with the view that it did not sound very welcoming. He said that although if students eventually left the country it should have no long-term impact, ""there is a perception problem around this,"" adding: ""It's something I've long considered."" It is ""something I would like to look at again"", he said. The home secretary was also asked about the cap on so-called Tier 2 visas,introduced by Mrs Maywhen she was home secretary as a means of limiting the number of skilled workers from outside the European Union who had a job offer. The annual 20,700 cap has led to thousands of IT specialists and engineers as well as NHS staff being denied visas. ""I see the problem with that,"" Mr Javid said. ""It is something that I'm taking a fresh look at. I know a number of my colleagues certainly want me to take a look at this, and that's exactly what I'm doing. ""And I hope to think about this more carefully and see what can be done."" Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Sir Ed Davey said: ""The home secretary will have the support of almost everyone in Parliament to exclude students and medical staff from the immigration cap, but it's far from clear that the prime minister is willing to admit her long-cherished policy is wrong."" Mr Javid also refused to explicitly endorse another immigration policy, the promise to reduce net migration below 100,000, saying he was committed to the Conservative manifesto which contained the pledge. And he reiterated calls for more funding for frontline police officers. The government had not yet started its spending review for the police, he said, adding: ""But when we do, I'm sure the chancellor will learn of my views."" Labour responded by saying Mr Javid had ""let slip that there is still no new money for our over-stretched police forces"".

"Rebel Wilson was originally awarded the largest defamation payout in Australian history A magazine publisher has successfully appealed against the size of a record defamation payout awarded to actress Rebel Wilson in Australia. Last year,Wilson won a case against publisher Bauer Mediaover articles that she said had wrongly portrayed her as a serial liar. A court had ordered Bauer to pay her A$4.5m (Â£2.7m; $3.6m) - a record for an Australian defamation case. On Thursday, the Victorian Court of Appeal reduced the sum to A$600,000. Wilson, an Australian star of Hollywood films including Pitch Perfect and Bridesmaids, has vowed to give her compensation to charity. The size of the original payout had generated discussion in Australia over whether it could stifle future journalism that is in the public interest. In court last year, Wilson successfully argued that the eight articles published by Bauer magazines in 2015 had resulted in her being sacked from two feature films. In its original finding, the Supreme Court of Victoria awarded her A$650,000 in general damages and $A3.9m for roles she had lost out on. However, the appeals court ruled that Wilson had failed to prove that Bauer was responsible for her missing out on those roles. ""The court has rejected the finding that Rebel Wilson lost the opportunity to earn A$15m by being cast in lead or co-lead roles in Hollywood films from mid-2015 to the end of 2016,"" the judgement read. Wilson was not in court on Thursday, but in a tweet on Wednesday she said her case ""was never about the money"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

During the case, Wilson said the ""grubby"" and ""completely false"" articles had alleged that she lied about her name, age and upbringing in Australia. ""I had to stand up to a bully, a huge media organisation, Bauer Media, who maliciously took me down in 2015,"" she said after winning the case. Bauer welcomed the verdict of the appeal on Thursday, arguing it had ""broader implications"" for the local media industry. Six Australian media firms had also attempted to appeal against the size of the original payout, buttheir application was dismissed by the court.

"Fortnite's maker says the game has attracted 125 million players since it launched last year Sony chiefs are under pressure to respond to complaints about ""cross-play"" restrictions imposed on Fortnite. Gamers have discovered that if they had first played the title on a PlayStation console, they are unable to use the same Fortnite account with the newly released Nintendo Switch edition. This prevents them from being able to make use of outfits and other in-game purchases and rewards they had accrued. There is no such limitation when moving between the Xbox One and Switch. Gamers were already unable to share a Fortnite account between Microsoft and Sony's platforms. Sony and other games companies are showing off new titles at the E3 games expo this week But the appeal of the Switch is that its portable nature allows owners to play when away from home, and so many have bought it as a second games machine. Sony has yet to confirm it is responsible for the constraint, but it issued the following statement to the BBC. ""We're always open to hearing what the PlayStation community is interested in to enhance their gaming experience,"" it said. ""With... more than 80 million monthly active users on PlayStation Network, we've built a huge community of gamers who can play together on Fortnite and all online titles. ""We also offer Fortnite cross-play support with PC, Mac, iOS, and Android devices, expanding the opportunity for Fortnite fans on PS4 to play with even more gamers on other platforms."" ""We have nothing further to add beyond this at this point,"" a spokeswoman added. This video can not be played WATCH: Fans flocked to Fortnite's first live event on Tuesday Both Microsoft and Fortnite publisher Epic Gameshave previously indicated that the Japanese company had chosen,externalto prevent PlayStation gamers competing against other console owners in the title's multi-player fight-to-the-death Battle Royale mode. Sony has faced criticism for blocking cross-play in other titles in the past, including Minecraft and Rocket League. But the sheer scale of Fortnite's success means the backlash has the potential to be more damaging this time round. Fortnite was added to Nintendo's online store earlier this week Epic said this week thatthe title has amassed 125 million players worldwide,external. And Nintendo has announced that its free-to-play version of the gamewas downloaded more than two million times,externalin the 24 hours after its release on the Switch on Tuesday. Fortnite's World Cup to be 'open to all' Switch gets Fortnite and Super Smash Bros Ultimate PS4's Last of Us sequel kisses then kills Complaints about the matter are already threatening to overshadow Sony's publicity efforts at the E3 video games show in Los Angeles. Much of the profit from Fortnite comes from its sale of in-game outfits Each time it posts news about its latest releases to Twitter and Facebook, people have responded by demanding that it allow them to share their Fortnite logins and permit cross-play.

The PlayStation 4 is the strongest selling console of this generation by a large margin, but one industry watcher said that this did not make it immune to attack. ""Sony has got to be very careful about how it manages the situation,"" Samantha Loveridge, associate editor of GamesRadar+ told the BBC. ""Fortnite is absolutely massive and it's only going to get bigger - it's about to come to Android - so Sony has got to start thinking about its closed-garden ecosystem. ""One way or another, gamers deserve an explanation as to why this compatibility issue exists."" Nintendo is showing off its version of Fornite - which is limited to the Battle Royale Mode - at E3 Sony does allow compatibility with the PC and iOS versions of the game, indicating that the Xbox/Switch block it is a strategic choice rather than a technical impossibility. While gamers await comment from the PlayStation firm, its rivals have piled on the pressure. When asked about the matter, Nintendo's North America chiefReggie Fils-Aime told the IGN news site,external: ""What competitors do is their decision to make. We believe being both developer-forward and fan-forward is in the best interest of the game.""

"Stan Lee (left) became close to Mr Morgan (right) after his wife's death A temporary restraining order has been issued in Los Angeles against the carer of Marvel Comics magnate Stan Lee, following allegations of elder abuse. Keya Morgan, who has been the 95-year-old's manager for several months, has taken advantage of Mr Lee's vulnerability, his former lawyer Tom Lallas says. Mr Morgan is yet to comment. Stan Lee co-created and promoted comics such as Spider-Man and Black Panther through his company Marvel Comics. Many became household names, leaping from the comic book to the big screen. New York memorabilia dealer Mr Morgan, 41, ""inserted himself into Mr Lee's life"" afterhis British-born wife of 69 years, Joan, died in 2017, Mr Lallas wrote in the petition for the restraining order. Mr Lallas filed the petition on Mr Lee's behalf. Los Angeles Police are investigating the allegations of elder abuse. Who could follow The Avengers? Why the snobbery about superhero films? Critics hail 'bedazzling' Infinity War Mr Lallas has alleged in court documents that Mr Morgan controlled access to Mr Lee, including by hiring security guards, and moved him from his family home. ""Mr Morgan is unduly influencing Mr Lee and isolating him,"" Mr Lallas wrote. Mr Morgan was arrested on Monday on suspicion of making a false call to the police, reporting that a burglary was taking place at Mr Lee's home. Police say the call was made as two detectives and a social worker were conducting a welfare check on Mr Lee. Joan Lee, Stan Lee's wife of almost 70 years, died last July aged 95 According to a transcript of the 30 May call filed with the restraining order, Mr Morgan said that ""three unidentified people have gone inside this house and locked the door and locked his security out and I'm very, very scared that they're harming him"".

"Ideally, women should plan a pregnancy months in advance, experts say Some women spend more time planning their summer holiday than they do a pregnancy, a survey by baby charity Tommy's suggests. Only one in five started taking folic acid before stopping contraception, while one in six didn't take it at all. A daily folic acid tablet while trying to conceive reduces the risk of your baby having brain or spine defects. Medical experts said nutrition and lifestyle before conception were also crucial to a good pregnancy and birth. There are lots of ways that both parents can improve their chances of a healthy pregnancy, if it is planned weeks or months in advance. These include stopping smoking and drinking alcohol, eating a healthy, balanced diet and getting to a healthy weight. But in a survey of 750 pregnant women, Tommy's found that fewer than half changed their diet during pregnancy and 17% did not take any folic acid at all. In contrast, two-thirds spent three months or longer planning a holiday. Rebecca Ross, from Surrey, became pregnant with her first daughter very quickly and folic acid ""was never on my radar"", she says. She was eight weeks pregnant before she started taking the supplements, following an appointment with a midwife. When number two came along, it was a similar picture. ""I don't think I'd seen or read that it was a good idea to take them pre-conception,"" Rebecca says. However, she continued to keep active, playing hockey and snowboarding until she was six months pregnant. Folic acid tablets contain vitamin B which helps to protect the baby during early pregnancy Tommy's has launched a campaign to help women plan for a healthy pregnancy usingan online tool,external. It provides tailored advice for women who answer an online questionnaire about their lifestyle. take 400mcg of folic acid daily before stopping contraception quit smoking - it can damage your baby's DNA and affect fertility stop drinking alcohol - it increases the risk of miscarriage, premature birth and low birth weight eat plenty of wholegrain, unsaturated fats, lentils and beans get to a healthy weight (BMI) - ideally between 18.5 and 24.9 limit your caffeine intake to 200mg a day (two mugs of instant coffee) do regular, moderate exercise before and after you conceive speak to a GP if taking medication for a mental or physical condition Folic acid is very important during pregnancy and needs time to build up in the body. In the early weeks of pregnancy when the neural tube is developing - the structure that develops into the baby's brain and spine - defects can occur. Taking folic acid tablets for the months before conception reduces the risk of this happening. Even though folic acid (vitamin B9) or folate can be found in broccoli, spinach and chickpeas, a healthy diet is not enough on its own to protect against conditions like spina bifida, which occurs when a baby's spine does not develop properly. Most women are advised to take a 400 microgram supplement every day. Tablets can be bought in pharmacies, supermarkets and via your GP. You can stop taking it after week 12 of pregnancy. If you did not take folic acid before you became pregnant, you should still start taking it as soon as you realise you are expecting a baby. Jane Brewin, chief executive of Tommy's, said the charity's goal was to improve the safety of the mother and baby during pregnancy. ""We know that lack of folic acid, smoking, inadequate nutrition, lack of physical activity and having a high BMI are all things that contribute to negative pregnancy outcomes, and it's almost too late to tackle these after conception."" Prof Lesley Regan, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said one in four pregnant women in the UK is overweight or obese. ""Focusing on the importance of maintaining a healthy diet and weight prior to conception will not only improve the health of individuals, but also the health and quality of life of future generations,"" she said. Prof Viv Bennett, chief nurse and director of maternity and early years at Public Health England, said it was about giving every child the best start in life. ""Good preconception health - how women are in the weeks, months and years leading up to pregnancy - plays a crucial role in the health of women and their babies and on into childhood.""

"The FBI took Apple to court in 2016 to try to get access to a killer's iPhone Apple says it is to change the default settings of its iPhone to stop hackers and others unlocking devices without proper legal authorisation. The move will also make it more difficult for police to unlock handsets without authorisation. However, Apple denied the changes were designed to thwart US law enforcement. The company has been a prominent opponent of US legislation to force technology companies to maintain access to users' communications. The loophole also applies to countries outside the US, including the UK. Police forces say that being able to unlock iPhones and iPads is crucial to their work. But in 2016 Apple refused to help police unlock a phone used by a gunman who killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California. San Bernardino phone hack 'cost FBI more than $1m' FBI pressured on cost of iPhone hack tool ""We're constantly strengthening the security protections in every Apple product to help customers defend against hackers, identity thieves and intrusions into their personal data,"" Apple said in a statement. ""We have the greatest respect for law enforcement, and we don't design our security improvements to frustrate their efforts to do their jobs."" Many iPhone users were alarmed by the idea of law enforcement being able to access handsets The changes to the default settings of the iPhone are intended to stop unauthorised access to the phones via the USB port. In 2016, a court order demanded that Apple help the FBI unlock the phone used by San Bernardino gunman Syed Rizwan Farook. The company resisted and the FBI eventually paid experts to develop technology that unlocked the phone. The FBI has never named the security firm or group of hackers who did the work.

"This video can not be played Trump Kim summit: What happens now? North Korea will not see any economic sanctions lifted until it has demonstrated ""complete denuclearisation"", US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said. Mr Pompeo was speaking at a press conference in Seoul with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts. It comes days after President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un held a historic summit in Singapore. The leaders signed a statement pledging to establish a new relationship. Mr Kim also reaffirmed its previous promises to work towards the ""complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"". But there has been deep scepticism about the agreement, with observers saying it lacked detail on how North Korea would give up its nuclear weapons and how that process would be verified. Mr Pompeo travelled from Singapore to South Korea to brief the US's regional allies on the summit, and on Mr Trump's surprise announcement that he was ending routine US-South Korea military drills. What were the results of the Trump-Kim summit? Imagine life for a North Korean family How does North Korea do business under sanctions? Missed chance to discuss human rights, says defector What are the US-South Korea war games? He said the summit had marked a ""turning point"" in the relationship between the US and North Korea. Mr Pompeodismissed a report by North Korean state mediathat indicated the US would grant concessions to Pyongyang for gradual progress. He said the US remained ""committed to achieving the complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation of North Korea"". These exact terms were not specified in the joint statement signed by Mr Trump and Mr Kim in Singapore, which only made reference to ""complete denuclearisation"". This video can not be played The nuclear word Trump and Kim can't agree on Mr Trump had said after his meeting with the North Korean leader that sanctions - which place stringent restrictions on how North Korea can interact with the outside world - would remain in effect until ""the nukes are no longer a factor"", but it was unclear exactly what that meant. ""At a certain point I look forward to taking them off and they will come off when we know we are down the road,"" he told a news conference on Tuesday. Mr Pompeo also insisted the alliance between the US, South Korea and Japan remained ""ironclad"", despite Mr Trump's announcement about ending military drills. South Korea and Japan have always said the drills - which infuriate North Korea - are necessary to ensure their security. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

South Korea's Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha echoed Mr Trump, saying the relationship between Washington and Seoul was as ""robust as ever"". Her Japanese counterpart Taro Kono called the summit the ""beginning of a challenging yet significant process"", saying that the three countries would ""continue our joint efforts"". The summit in Singapore was the first-ever between a sitting leader of the US and North Korea. North Korea has been isolated on the international stage for decades - with brief bursts of diplomacy - for its appalling human rights record and its relentless pursuit of nuclear weapons. It has long sought a meeting with a US president, something it felt would give legitimacy to the leadership. Activists have said they were disappointed that Mr Trump did not challenge Mr Kim on the human rights situation. Mr Trump tweeted on Wednesday night that it had been ""interesting and very positive"" meeting.

"This video can not be played Revenge porn victim: 'I felt like I had been raped' One in three allegations of so-called revenge porn are withdrawn by the complainant, new figures show. Since it was made a criminal offence in 2015 victims have chosen not to support charges in 2,813 of 7,806 incidents. Some alleged victims say it is because they are not granted anonymity, while others cite a lack of police support. The Ministry of Justice said it was committed to supporting victims but had no current plan to change the law around identification. The North Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner, Julia Mulligan, has launched apetition to change the law,externalto grant victims anonymity, as is the case for complainants in sexual offence cases. To date it has received more than 15,000 signatures. She said: ""We think the law is fundamentally flawed. At the moment [revenge porn] is a communications offence not a sexual offence and that means victims face the likelihood of being publically named and we think that puts people off."" Humans to vet Facebook revenge porn photos Revenge porn almost killed me Facebook 'remembers' nude images to combat revenge porn The BBC obtained figures relating to revenge porn complaints from 34 of the 43 police forces in England and Wales. Revenge porn is described as ""the sharing of private, sexual materials, either photos or videos, of another person without their consent and with the purpose of causing embarrassment or distress"". The offence covers photos or videos showing people engaged in sexual activity which would not usually take place in public. It includes sharing the material as well as posting it online. In England and Wales, the maximum punishment is two years in prison - in Scotland, it is five years. Lydia (whose name has been changed), from West Yorkshire, was with her partner for a year before they split up and he took it badly. ""I didn't know he was taking pictures. I was blindfolded and I didn't know he was taking videos of me. I thought it was just us having fun. ""After I split up with him I got this email from a woman I didn't know saying there were explicit photos of me on a website. ""I looked on the site and typed in my name and saw my pictures - I couldn't believe it - I freaked out, had a complete meltdown. ""I'm a really private person - it was so upsetting. I called the police and I tried to contact different websites to get them to remove my pictures and video. ""He got sentenced to six months in prison. It didn't feel long enough for what he put me through. ""I feel like I was molested - like I was raped."" Lauren Evans, from Hertfordshire, contacted Thames Valley Police in 2015 after she discovered sexual images of her were being shared via social media by a man she had met online. She said, however, she was made to feel that she was responsible for what had happened. ""I felt like it was all my fault,"" she said. ""Even the police officer I told my story to said 'I guess you've learnt your lesson now then', and that shook me to my core. ""I thought if the police think it's my fault then what is the point in going on."" She also said the term ""revenge porn"" should be changed as it ""makes it sound like the victim is deserving of this"". A spokesperson for Thames Valley Police said it could not comment on individual cases but that takes allegations of revenge porn ""extremely seriously"". Catherine Knibbs is a cyber trauma researcher and psychotherapist and said some people will never get over the trauma of being a victim of revenge porn. ""Prosecutions are long, lengthy distressing process for most victims of any kind of crimes,"" she said. ""In terms of sexual crimes - you're looking at the proposition you might be told it's your fault, you asked for it - lot of victim blaming, very difficult for victims to come to terms with."" Data collated by the BBC shows there has been an increase in the number of revenge porn cases reported to police since records began, from 1,861 offences in 2015-16 to 3,307 in 2017-18. The proportion of cases resulting in charges, however, has fallen. In 2015-16 it stood at 14% and in 2017-18 was just 7%. Vanessa Smith, Det Ch Insp of the West Yorkshire Cyber Crime Unit, said: ""Revenge porn itself is extortion, blackmail, it can be sexual harassment or stalking. I would urge people to be trustful of the police - we will treat your call with sensitivity. ""We need to know basics - how it's been posted, to which sites - and then we can work with those sites and organisations. I know Facebook and Twitter have provided more guidance to their customers and have been quite robust monitoring it."" A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: ""Revenge porn is an awful abuse of trust which leaves victims feeling humiliated and degraded. ""By making it a specific offence we sent a clear message that it will not be tolerated, and there have now been almost 300 convictions. ""We are committed to supporting and protecting victims. We have no current plans to extend automatic anonymity to victims of the offence, but we keep the law under constant review.""

"Jeffrey Barry stabbed Kamil Ahmad more than 25 times A series of failings led to the murder of a man by a violent schizophrenia patient, the BBC has learned. Jeffrey Barry stabbed neighbour Kamil Ahmad at their supported flats in Bristol in July 2016, hours after his release from a secure mental hospital. Barry had been detained after hearing voices and threatening to murder Mr Ahmad. But an independent panel was not told of his history of violence towards his neighbour before approving his release. The chief executive of mental health charity Sane said the case was ""a catastrophic litany of errors and blunders"" and called for an independent inquiry. Marjorie Wallace said ""other lives may be lost"" if lessons are not learned. Barry is now serving at least 23 years at Broadmoor secure hospital after beingfound guilty of murdering Mr Ahmadin a ""savage and sustained"" attack, in which he sliced off the Kurdish refugee's penis. The judge described the failures leading to his release as being ""nothing short of calamitous"". This video can not be played Jeffrey Barry admits killing his neighbour to a 999 call operator Barry has allowed the BBC to view some of his medical records which show an independent panel approved his release without all the facts. Because of bed shortages, he was moved from the Callington Road NHS psychiatric hospital to the privately-run Cygnet Hospital in Kewstoke, North Somerset. Barry did not want to stay and asked for his case to be reviewed - a legal right that all patients have - but his NHS care team were only given 24 hours' notice to compile their notes for the independent panel. The panel's notes show they were aware Barry had an ""extensive psychiatric history"" but the details were ""not yet available to the clinical team"" at the private hospital. At points they said they were relying on Barry's own recollection of events and believed he would be more at risk of harm than others. The panel was also not aware of Barry's three-year history of violence towards Mr Ahmad, nor about the withdrawal of key medication a few months before that contributed to his relapse. Kamil Ahmad was not aware Jeffrey Barry had returned to their supported flats Mr Ahmad's relatives have said they want to know why Barry was allowed to move back to the supported flats. Barry was told by the charity that runs them that it did not want him to return after he had made previous threats to Mr Ahmad and others. Staff at the flats were only given a few hours' notice of his discharge, while Mr Ahmad was unaware Barry had returned. Ms Wallace said Barry should ""never have been released to his sheltered housing"" and the case highlighted the failure of psychiatric services which are ""under so much pressure, with not enough beds or nurses"". ""The case beggars belief, that there should have been such a catastrophic litany of errors and blunders,"" she added. Avon and Wiltshire Mental health trust, which was responsible for Barry's care, said: ""We acknowledge and agree with the judge regarding the failings in this case and have been working closely with our partner organisations to prevent such an event happening in the future."" A spokesman for Cygnet Hospital said it was only informed the day before the panel took place that it was to be held. It added that responsibility for informing accommodation providers when a patient is to be released, and for creating care plans, lay with the ""relevant mental health NHS Trust responsible for co-ordinating the patient's overall care"".

"Tim Draper has collected more than 400,000 signatures to put the plan to partition California into three states on the ballot A billionaire venture capitalist's bid to split California into three separate states has earned a spot on the ballot in November's mid-term elections. If Tim Draper's Cal-3 initiative gets a majority vote, it would trigger a long process to split California into northern, southern and central states. Mr Draper had campaigned unsuccessfully for six years, initially with a plan to divide the state into six new regions. It is the first time in 150 years that this choice is on the state's ballot. Should the proposal become a reality, it would be the first division of a state since West Virginia split off from Virginia in 1863. According to a memo filed on Tuesday by California's Secretary of State,,externalMr Draper collected more than 402,468 signatures across the state's counties for the proposal. 'Russian trolls' promoted California independence A man with a plan for six Californias The new California state would centre around Los Angeles up to Monterey County. Northern California would include the Bay Area and Sacramento. Southern California would stretch from San Diego to Fresno. ""Three states will get us better infrastructure, better education and lower taxes,"" Mr Draper toldthe Los Angeles Times,externallast summer, after submitting the proposal. ""States will be more accountable to us and can co-operate and compete for citizens."" The notion of splitting California up has been around as long as the state itself. There have been over 200 attempts to divvy up the state by lawmakers, counties and well-off individuals like Mr Draper since California was founded in 1850. In 1859, California sent a proposal to split the North from the South to US Congress, but the Civil War left lawmakers too preoccupied to vote on it. Since then, initiatives to section the state into thirds or in half have floated around without much momentum. In 2012 and 2014, Mr Draper proposed splitting California into six states - an initiative that failed to make it onto the ballot both times. The 40-year hunt for a killer Justice officials 'at war' with California But he revived his idea as Cal-3 in September 2017. A spokeswoman for Cal-3, Peggy Grande,told the Washington Post,externalthat California is ""not a one-size-fits-all state"". Ms Grande said Cal-3 would make it easier for state lawmakers to focus on problems in smaller regions. ""None of those problems disappear, but what does happen is the solutions become more representative of the people they affect,"" she told the newspaper. California has 55 votes in the electoral college, and these have historically gone to Democratic candidates. That could change if Cal-3 is approved, which could leave Democratic lawmakers uneasy about allowing the change. Based on election data from the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia,external, Southern California could become a swing state if the change is approved. Cal-3 would also add four senators to the US Senate. Californians will vote on the measure on 6 November The US constitution allows for the formation of new states, but it does not make it an easy process. Under Article IV, no new state can enter the union ""without the consent of the legislatures of the states concerned, as well as of the Congress"". That means that if Cal-3 succeeds with voters, California's legislature would also have to approve the move. Then, it would make its way to Washington, DC for federal approval. For now, the move is still a long shot, especially given its history. But on 6 November, Californians will have a chance to weigh in on the matter.

His comments, during a visit to South Korea, follow an unprecedented meeting between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. They signed a deal agreeing to work towards ""complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula"". But the document has been criticised for lacking details on when or how Pyongyang would give up its weapons. Mike Pompeo (right) is in Seoul, South Korea, to discuss the outcome of Mr Trump's summit Mr Pompeo travelled from the summit in Singapore to Seoul, where he was briefing South Korea's government on the outcome of the summit. He said there was still ""a great deal of work to do"" with North Korea, but added: ""Major disarmament... We're hopeful that we can achieve that in the two and half years."" He said he was confident Pyongyang understood the need for any dismantling its nuclear programme to be properly verified - a key .

He also announced an unexpected end to military exercises regularly carried out between US and South Korean forces on the peninsula. The move - long demanded by Pyongyang - has been seen as a major concession to North Korea and appeared to take US allies in the region by surprise. South Korea's presidential Blue House later clarified that it needed to ""find out the precise meaning or intentions"" behind Mr Trump's remarks on ending the joint military drills. What are the US-South Korea war games? After the summit, North Korea's state media said the two leaders had agreed that ""step-by-step and simultaneous action"" was needed to achieve denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula. American hardliners such as Mr Trump's national security adviser John Bolton have previously opposed such a phased approach, whereby the US takes reciprocal action. Most Western observers have said it includes no new commitments from North Korea nor details on how denuclearisation could be achieved or verified. Critics also expressed disappointment that Pyongyang's long record of human rights abuses was not addressed. President Moon Jae-in had on Tuesday hailed the summit as a ""historic event"", adding that it would be recorded as ""[helping] break down the last remaining Cold War legacy on Earth"".

"This video can not be played Yemeni forces backed by a Saudi-led coalition of Gulf states are advancing on Hudaydah Fierce fighting has been reported after pro-government forces in Yemen, backed by a Saudi-led coalition, launched an offensive on the rebel-held city of Hudaydah, a key port for aid supplies. Thirty Houthi rebels and nine members of pro-government forces are said to have been killed. Coalition forces are now within two kilometres of the city's airport, the Emirati envoy to the UN says. The UN Security Council restated its fears about the fate of civilians. The emergency meeting on Thursday, called by the UK, saw members agree the port must be kept open to prevent a further worsening of Yemen's humanitarian crisis. About eight million people are at risk of starvation in the war-torn country and the coastal city is where most aid arrives for people in rebel-held areas. However, there was not enough support on the council for Sweden's motion to demand an immediate halt to the offensive on Hudaydah. Vassily Nebenzia, Russia's UN ambassador and president of the council in June, said the body urged ""all sides to uphold their obligations under international humanitarian law"". Calm before storm in Hudaydah Yemen's conflict in 400 words Why this battle matters Who is fighting whom? The Emirati news agency Wam said attacking forces had managed to ""liberate areas... in the surroundings of the airport"" and captured or killed ""dozens"" of Iranian-backed Houthis. It reported the ""martyrdom"" of four Emirati soldiers but did not give further details of the fighting. Medical sources in the region said early on Thursday that 22 Houthi fighters had been killed in coalition strikes. This video can not be played Former child soldiers, a landmine survivor and an internally displaced child tell their stories Houthi rebels, meanwhile, said they had struck a coalition warship with missiles, although there was no confirmation of this. The rebels also reported that they had successfully launched a missile towards the southern Saudi city of Khamis Mushait, although Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya TV said that Saudi air defences destroyed the weapon. The Hudaydah offensive, which analysts say could be the biggest battle so far in the Yemeni civil war, has raised fears of mass casualties among the city's population of 600,000 people. However, coalition spokesman Col Turki al-Malki said they wanted to avoid a street war with the Houthis ""for the safety of civilians"". He told al-Hadath TV that the aims were to win control of the airport and seaport as well as the main road leading to the capital, Sanaa. The pro-government assault began after Houthi rebels ignored a deadline to withdraw. Separately on Thursday, pro-Yemeni government media reported that President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi and other senior officials had returned to the temporary capital of Aden. The government has spent much of its time in neighbouring Saudi Arabia since Houthi rebels seized control of Sanaa and other areas in the north-west of the country in late 2014. Alarmed by the rise of a group they saw as an Iranian Shia Muslim proxy, Saudi Arabia and eight other Sunni Arab states launched a military campaign in March 2015 to restore Mr Hadi's government.

"This video can not be played Grenfell memorial events were held to remember the victims About 5,000 people are estimated to have taken part in a silent walk in honour of the 72 people killed in the Grenfell Tower fire a year ago. Firefighters laid down their helmets and formed a guard of honour as the marchers - carrying banners and wearing green - passed by. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and London Mayor Sadiq Khan joined the event near the tower in West London. Earlier a silent procession followed a memorial service at a nearby church. Silent walks have been held in the neighbourhood on the 14th of every month since the fire, attracting hundreds of people. The Met Police estimated 5,000 people took part in the evening walk at the end of the day of remembrance for the victims of the disaster. Firefighters formed a guard of honour for the walk Some of the people on the walk stopped to hug the firefighters as they passed A 72-second national silence was held at midday as part of the anniversary. It was observed across the country, including at government buildings, Parliament and by the Queen and the Duchess of Sussex on a visit to Chester, where the monarchwore green in honour of Grenfell victims. This video can not be played Tube driver stops train and waves green flag in solidarity for Grenfell The names of the 72 victims were read out at the memorial service held at St Helen's Church, near the tower. Bereaved families were invited to light candles in memory of their loved ones at the church, which had been decked out in green - the colour adopted by survivors and relatives of those who died. Clarrie Mendy, who lost two family members in the fire and organised the service attended by several hundred people, said: ""It's a service of healing, community, inclusivity and solidarity, to know we are not alone."" Addressing the service, Labour MP David Lammy, whose family friend died in the fire, said it was a ""bittersweet"" moment as the community celebrated their unity but mourned those lost. White doves were released outside the church after the service. Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Global roots of fire victims 'Grenfell was a symbol of hope' Ms Mendy then led the silent procession towards Grenfell Tower, accompanied by other bereaved relatives carrying a large floral display spelling ""Humanity for Grenfell"". Relatives holding banners marched to the tower after the service Wreaths were laid by the London mayor and the Duke of Kent during another service at a memorial close to the base of the tower. Singers Stormzy, Adele and Marcus Mumford, who have been vocal supporters of those affected by the fire, were at the event. Stormzy joined the mourners for the service at the base of Grenfell Tower Nicholas Burton, whose wife Maria del Pilar Burton died in January and is considered the 72nd victim of the fire, said he chatted with all three singers during the day. He said: ""I went into the sports centre and I hear 'Hi Nick' and it's Adele calling me over, who introduced me to her new husband and then Marcus comes over and we had a hug, then Stormzy comes over - they have all been unbelievable. ""I was thanking them for all they've done behind the scenes that no-one knows about."" Jeremy Corbyn later visited the site and wrote a message on a wall in the shadow of the tower saying: ""Love and sympathy to all at Grenfell. Together we mourn. Together we overcome."" The Labour leader was hugged by a boy after writing a message of support on a memorial wall By BBC reporter Alice Evans, in North Kensington Hundreds of people gathered in the shadow of the charred tower block to pay their respects. Young and old, the survivors and bereaved wore bright green scarves to match the green heart that's become the symbol of this community's solidarity and integrity. Many of the fences, bus stops and lampposts displaying the same vibrant ribbons still have tape markings on them - ghostly reminders of the missing person posters that a year ago today were hastily, hopefully being stuck on any free space. At the commemoration event people wept together, clutching each other as each of the 72 victims' names was read out one at a time so that they could be remembered ""as individuals, and not merely as numbers"". The neighbourhood then led the nation into a silence. Some may welcome this time as a chance for quiet reflection - a peaceful moment in which to pay respects. Here beneath the blackened shell of the tower, it did not feel peaceful though. It was more like a grief-stricken, still-shocked absence of sound as if the community was holding its breath. This video can not be played People fell silent across the country, including the Queen and Meghan The England football team held a minute's silence in Russia Ahead of the services, the tower and other London buildings were lit green at 00:54 BST, the time the fire was first reported in a flat on 14 June 2017.

"Rebel Wilson was originally awarded the largest defamation payout in Australian history A magazine publisher has successfully appealed against the size of a record defamation payout awarded to actress Rebel Wilson in Australia. Last year,Wilson won a case against publisher Bauer Mediaover articles that she said had wrongly portrayed her as a serial liar. A court had ordered Bauer to pay her A$4.5m (Â£2.7m; $3.6m) - a record for an Australian defamation case. On Thursday, the Victorian Court of Appeal reduced the sum to A$600,000. Wilson, an Australian star of Hollywood films including Pitch Perfect and Bridesmaids, has vowed to give her compensation to charity. The size of the original payout had generated discussion in Australia over whether it could stifle future journalism that is in the public interest. In court last year, Wilson successfully argued that the eight articles published by Bauer magazines in 2015 had resulted in her being sacked from two feature films. In its original finding, the Supreme Court of Victoria awarded her A$650,000 in general damages and $A3.9m for roles she had lost out on. However, the appeals court ruled that Wilson had failed to prove that Bauer was responsible for her missing out on those roles. ""The court has rejected the finding that Rebel Wilson lost the opportunity to earn A$15m by being cast in lead or co-lead roles in Hollywood films from mid-2015 to the end of 2016,"" the judgement read. Wilson was not in court on Thursday, but in a tweet on Wednesday she said her case ""was never about the money"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

During the case, Wilson said the ""grubby"" and ""completely false"" articles had alleged that she lied about her name, age and upbringing in Australia. ""I had to stand up to a bully, a huge media organisation, Bauer Media, who maliciously took me down in 2015,"" she said after winning the case. Bauer welcomed the verdict of the appeal on Thursday, arguing it had ""broader implications"" for the local media industry. Six Australian media firms had also attempted to appeal against the size of the original payout, buttheir application was dismissed by the court.

"Not all England fans can make the journey to Russia As the World Cup gets under way in Russia, the UK's trade unions have urged bosses to be flexible with staff who want to follow the football action. The TUC says workplaces that operate flexible working can allow staff to put their hours in while still getting the chance to see all the crucial games. ""It's important employers do not score an own goal by acting like killjoys,"" said general secretary Frances O'Grady. And if they can watch at work, so much the better, the TUC says. The tournament kicks off on Thursday, with hosts Russia taking on Saudi Arabia in Moscow's Luzhniki stadium. England's first match comes in Volgograd on Monday, when they face Tunisia at 19:00 UK time. 2018 Fifa World Cup: BBC Coverage The TUC suggests various steps that employers can take to make life easier for football fans: Talk to staff in advance about arrangements for key matches Arrange for them to watch them on the company's premises if appropriate Allow staff to work from home Allow them to come in earlier or later Be as flexible as possible with annual leave requests The Labour Party has backed the TUC's call. Shadow sports minister Rosena Allin-Khan said: ""As a nation, we're proud to cheer on England in the World Cup and we believe that employers should be flexible with fans supporting our national team in the coming weeks."" Conciliation service Acas also puts out guidance to employers every time there is a World Cup, and 2018 is no exception. Its advice includes a word to bosses about the risk of high levels of absence, either due to staff skipping work to watch the football or because they are hung over from ""post-match celebrations"". Other countries are taking a lenient approach. Public sector employees in Brazil will have their working hours officially altered on 22 and 27 June for their national team's matches against Costa Rica and Serbia respectively.

"A year on from the Grenfell Tower fire disaster, survivors are marking a week of remembrance - away from the ""politics"" - for the 72 people who lost their lives. BBC Reality Check has obtained figures showing the scale of the recovery effort, and what's still to be done to start to help the community back onto its feet. In February, at the Brit Awards, London-born grime artist Stormzy used his live performance after picking up two awards to ask the prime minister: ""Theresa May, where's the money for Grenfell?"" At the time, the government said it had pledged Â£58.9m, of which Â£30m had been spent. But the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) was not able to say what it had been spent on - although it responded to a Freedom of Information request made by Reality Check saying the ""majority of the money"" had been spent by the council. Since then, the overall pot of money available has increased. On Tuesday, Theresa May said more than Â£46m of national funds had already been spent on recovery following the fire and another Â£34m had been promised, bringing the total up to Â£80m. The council said it had been promised Â£78m of this, of which it had already received, and spent, Â£43.8m. Including the money received from central government, the council has spent Â£256.7m in total so far, by drawing on its own reserves and taking out loans. The Â£256.7m spent so far has been used for: acquiring and renovating social housing, and other related costs (Â£145.4m) social care (Â£25.9m) emergency accommodation for survivors (Â£25.6m) securing and managing the site of the fire (Â£19m) temporary and permanent accommodation for survivors (Â£13.5m) support services for survivors and the wider community, including providing welfare centres and community-based support (Â£13.2m) compensating leaseholders for loss of property (Â£10.1m) corporate services  - mainly costs relating to supporting the public inquiry and the coroner (Â£4m) During his performance at the Brit Awards, grime artist Stormzy asked Theresa May what had happened to the money for survivors The council has committed over Â£235m to secure 307 homes, most but not all of which has now been spent. And it has also promised to cover costs relating to the future use of the Grenfell Tower site, which ""has yet to be determined by the community"". Meanwhile, in addition to the Â£10m for mental health support services that was given to the council by the Treasury, NHS England spent about Â£4m last financial year and is set to spend Â£6m this financial year, through the local NHS Trust, for mental health services for survivors. rehousing survivors (Â£24m) refurbishing the Lancaster West Estate, which the tower was part of (Â£15m) managing the Grenfell Tower site (Â£12m) mental health support - not including separate money for NHS services - (Â£10m) support for the immediate response, for example emergency repairs (Â£7.3m) funeral costs and cash payments to survivors (Â£6m) welfare centres (Â£3m) In addition to the money pledged by the government and raised by the council, Â£28m was raised in charitable donations, of which Â£24m has now been distributed. And 200 tonnes of physical charitable donations were also made, of which 41 tonnes of new or almost new items were distributed among the community affected by the fire. The remainder was either sold in British Red Cross shops for Grenfell or turned into cash through recycling, raising an additional Â£226,000 for survivors. As well as the Â£80m the government has promised to spend on the survivors and the local area, Â£78m of which is to go through the council, the government has also committed to spend Â£400m on removing potentially dangerous cladding from council and housing association owned tower blocks around England. This money will initially come from an existing pot of money intended to fund the Affordable Homes Programme. In May, it was confirmed there were 323 such buildings taller than 18m (60ft) in England that had unsafe cladding on them - including residential blocks and publicly owned buildings such as schools and hospitals. Of these, 311 were judged to be a fire hazard and unlikely to meet current building regulations. Work has started to remove the cladding from 107 of these but so far has been completed in only 10. A total of 72 people died as a result of the blaze, the judge-led inquiry has said. This includes Maria Del Pilar Burton, 74, who died in January. She had been in hospital since she was rescued from the 19th floor. The survivors, who lived in 138 of the flats in the tower and the adjacent Grenfell Walk, have now split into 203 households - 116 from the tower and 22 from the walk. Some of the original households living in the tower contained multiple generations, for example grandparents and grown-up children, who are now being given the opportunity to have homes of their own. The council said it had committed to securing 307 homes to provide the 203 households with a choice of properties. As of 13 June, according to the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea: the council has made a total of 971 offers of some kind of accommodation to the 203 households 198 of the 203 have now accepted an offer of a home 135 of these have moved in - 52 into an temporary home, 83 into a permanent home 68 households from Grenfell Tower and Walk are still living in emergency accommodation - of these, 42 are in hotels, 22 are in serviced apartments and four are staying with family or friends 90 households from the surrounding estate - but not the tower or Grenfell Walk - are also still living in emergency or temporary accommodation, prior to moving back to their original homes Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter,external Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

"Alemishet Demissie lived on the 12th floor of Grenfell Tower In the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire a year ago, a series of promises were made to the survivors, especially concerning rehousing. Have they been delivered? ""In this property I might feel lonely, but that's life. We have to move on. There is no other way of doing this,"" says Alemishet Demissie, 70, who lived alone on the 12th floor of Grenfell Tower. Since her home was destroyed, she has lived between hotels and temporary flats, but the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme joined her as she moved into a permanent property. ""I'm happy - I can't ask for more, considering the situation,"" she says. After the fire, the government made two separate promises to the displaced residents, who had been living in 138 of the flats in the tower and the adjacent Grenfell Walk. The Prime Minister, Theresa May, promised they would be rehoused within three weeks of the fire. And by 5 July, three weeks after the fire, all of those 138 households that wanted contact with the council had been offered temporary accommodation - but only nine of these offers, of an interim flat or house, had been accepted, with most families still living in hotel rooms. Duke of Cambridge joins DIY SOS Grenfell crew Visual guide to the Grenfell Tower fire Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Grenfell: Inside the 21st floor The second promise, made by Housing Minister Alok Sharma, was that the council, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea (RBKC), would provide the residents of the 138 flats with a permanent home within a year. This video can not be played Mohammed and Zahra used to live in Grenfell Tower, but home has been a hotel room for the past year And as of 13 June, 364 days after the fire, the council has committed over Â£235m to secure 307 homes, most but not all of which has now been spent. The survivors, who lived in 138 of the flats in the tower and the adjacent Grenfell Walk, have now split into 203 households - 116 from the tower and 22 from the walk. Some of the original households living in the tower contained multiple generations, for example grandparents and grown-up children, who are now being given the opportunity to have homes of their own.

Antonio Roncolato lived on the 10th floor of Grenfell Tower with his 27-year-old son, Chris. Since the fire, he has lived in two hotels and, now, a temporary flat. Chris is being rehoused separately. ""It's a beautiful house, but it's not my flat. It doesn't reflect my identity, my way of being,"" Antonio says of his current home. ""It's nicely decorated, but it is not my personal home like I had in Grenfell Tower."" Antonio praised the work of council workers on the ground Over the past year, Antonio, who was aged 57 at the time of the fire, has turned down six offers of permanent accommodation from the council. When asked whether he was worried that people might lose sympathy with survivors turning down offers of permanent accommodation, he said he had shown interest in various properties but ""only a few would match what they would call my 'descriptions'"". ""I'm entitled to a two-bedroom flat, with a kitchen and a bathroom,"" he says. ""Moving a property for the rest of your life, it's not buying a car or a motorbike, where you think you'll keep it for three or four years and replace it. ""So, I have to have a feeling that, 'Yes, this is it.'"" Antonio has turned down flats on the top floors of blocks with no lifts and one because he felt the kitchen was too small with no connection for a washing machine. While praising the council employees on the ground, he criticises its leadership. ""I never asked for promises,"" he says. ""It is unprecedented. It is very difficult."" But, Antonio adds: ""We need to wait as long as it takes for me to find the right accommodation, because they kept on promising things and they cannot [deliver], so what trust can I have?"" Polly Neate, chief executive of housing charity Shelter, says the fact so many people are still living in emergency or temporary accommodation is ""disgraceful"" but a symptom of the fact there is simply not enough housing available. ""It isn't really true to say that the council haven't made any effort to rehouse people,"" she says. ""It also isn't true to say that the former residents of Grenfell are being fussier than they should be in any way. ""There is a dire shortage of housing. And if that teaches us anything, it's that we need to be building more housing."" Council leader Elizabeth Campbell said: ""The families involved are not statistics that need to be moved around a balance sheet.  So, we will no longer set deadlines. They are not required. ""What is required is understanding, support, and above all a willingness to do everything we can to help - no matter how large or small the task."" A spokesman for the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government said: ""Ministers have been clear that the council must work quickly to rehouse survivors. And we expect them to do whatever is necessary to ensure people can move into settled homes as swiftly as possible."" Meanwhile, as she unpacks her belongings, Ms Demissie says: ""We've all been through a lot, but there's no point in thinking about the past - better to aim for a positive future.""

"This video can not be played 'Shortage of doctors has led to treatment delays' Immigration rules are hampering the ability of the NHS to recruit doctors, health leaders are warning. The number of skilled non-EU workers granted UK visas is capped - with the Home Office arguing the restriction is in ""the national interest"". But NHS bosses say increasing numbers of doctors are being refused permission, worsening rota gaps and the waits patients face for treatment. It comes amid a row after visas for 100 Indian doctors were refused. The doctors had been recruited as part of a long-running scheme in the North West which supplies junior doctors to more than 30 NHS trusts. Bosses at the trusts have written to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Home Secretary Amber Rudd asking them to urgently look into the problem. Analysis: 10 charts illustrating NHS woes NHS 'dangerously' short of 100,000 staff Jon Rouse, chief officer of the Greater Manchester Health and Social Care Partnership, which represents services across the region, said he was shocked and concerned by the development. ""As we reach the end of a winter where the NHS has been stretched to its very limits, partly as a result of a lack of medical workforce, we find it almost impossible to understand how this decision can have been reached,"" he said. He said these doctors would have worked across hospital services - and warned rotas would now go unfilled. The NHS is already short of doctors, with a report from the regulator NHS Improvement warning one in 11 posts was vacant.  Can't find your health trust?Browse the full list Rather search by typing?Back to search If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. Danny Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, said he had heard of another 400 cases of blocked visas since December. ""We have examples of clinics being cancelled and delays in terms of patients receiving care. ""It exacerbates pressures in what are relatively small medical teams."" It is unclear exactly why this has happened. There is evidence in the NHS that it is getting harder to recruit and retain EU staff, putting pressure on non-EU sources. The skilled worker cap applies to all sectors so the numbers the NHS can recruit is also influenced by other sectors from IT to banking. Nurses have been placed on the shortage occupation list, which means they are given a priority in international recruitment. A Home Office spokeswoman said the system was in the ""national interest"". She said any Tier 2 applications - as they are known - which are refused in oversubscribed months could reapply in future ones. And she added there were a range of specialities, including A&E and radiology, that were on the shortage occupation list too. The GMC, which assesses the skills of non-EU doctors who want to work in the UK, said hundreds more overseas doctors were applying to them each year but then struggling to get visas. Charlie Massey, chief executive of the GMC, said: ""It is frustrating that while one government department is working hard to recruit doctors into an overstretched health service, another is enforcing eligibility conditions which stifle those efforts.""

"A letter to the prime minister from leading health think tanks is the latest plea for a rethink on visa rules that have affected NHS recruitment from outside the European Union. They argue that the NHS workforce is ""facing a crisis"" with shortages of key staff. The chief executives of the King's Fund, the Nuffield Trust and the Health Foundation have come together to make a joint submission to Downing Street ahead of the much-anticipated long-term plan for the NHS promised by Theresa May. A policy aimed at limiting the number of skilled workers from outside the EU has been criticised by employers. An annual cap of 20,700 has led to thousands of workers, including NHS staff, being denied visas. TheBBC revealedthat visas for 100 Indian doctors had been refused. They had been offered short-term contracts as part of a long-running scheme in the north-west of England that provides junior doctors to more than 20 NHS trusts. Another BBC investigationshowed that genetic counsellors, who identify people at risk of hereditary cancer and other serious conditions, were being turned down for visas even though there were workforce shortages. The Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, has said he will review the visa system for skilled workers, after lobbying by some cabinet ministers. He told theBBC's Andrew Marr programmehe was aware of the difficulties with NHS recruitment. ""I see the problem with that. It is something I'm taking a fresh look at,"" he said. The think tanks' joint letter says there are ""worrying shortages of nurses, GPs and hospital doctors"". It adds: ""There is no option but to recruit more staff from overseas and to relax controls on visas. ""Nurses and some other health professionals, like radiographers, are on a shortage-occupation list, which means they are given priority in allocation of visas. ""But most doctors are not. And there has been a campaign by health employers to put all medical jobs on the shortage list or to take all NHS jobs temporarily out of the visa system."" The think tank Global Future has produced analysis looking at the extent to which the NHS relies on overseas workers. It says: In the NHS in England, which employs about 1.2 million people in total, one in eight of those staff who have a known nationality - 12.5% - are from overseas NHS staff in clinical roles are much more likely to come from abroad. About a quarter of doctors  and 16% of nurses and health visitors are from overseas Up to 45% of staff in some vital NHS specialties, including cardio-thoracic surgeons, paediatric cardiologists and neurosurgeons, are from outside the UK Longer term, the lobbyists say, there needs to be a 10-year workforce strategy. And this must be given top priority and go ""hand-in-hand"" with the new funding settlement. They also call for real-terms funding increases of 4% per year. Anything less, they say, will compromise patient care and delay critical repairs to hospital buildings. NHS leaders, in what looks like a planned campaign, have united behind the 4% per year figure.  They fear that anything closer to 3%, which ministers may want to trumpet as a significant boost to NHS finances, won't allow any improvement to current shortcomings in the system, such as rising waiting lists. They are up against the Treasury, which has wider issues to deal with in the public finances. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has noted that making a chunky new investment in the NHS will have to be accommodated in the government's plan to balance the books by the mid-2020s. ""Unless it is able and willing to implement tax rises or further cuts to the social security budget over the rest of this Parliament, it is hard to see how a significant injection of additional cash into the NHS would be consistent with the government's stated fiscal objective,"" it says. The uncertainty over the path of the economy and future borrowing requirements, adds the IFS, will make the Treasury even more cautious. Expectation around the government's long-term NHS funding plan has been growing by the day. And now added to the calls for higher year-on-year spending are the demands for changes to immigration rules for health workers. That's a lot for Theresa May to think about.

"NHS groups have welcomed the decision to relax immigration rules to allow more doctors and nurses from outside the EU into the UK. The Home Office said foreign medics would be excluded from the government's cap on skilled migration. NHS bosses said it would be a ""huge relief"" to health trusts while Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said it was ""extremely welcome"". The cap sets the limit for all non-EU skilled workers at 20,700 a year. It was introduced by Theresa May when she was home secretary but has prompted warnings it makes it hard to fill vacancies in the NHS. Labour described the move as a ""welcome U-turn"" while the Royal College of GPs said it was a ""great step forward"". But an immigration pressure group said the UK should train its own medics and not ""raid other countries"". 1,600 IT workers and engineers denied UK visas 10 charts explaining the UK's immigration system Relaxing visa rules for doctors and nurses So-called Tier 2 visas are used by employers to bring skilled workers to the UK from outside the European Economic Area and Switzerland. Since 2011, there has been a cap on the number of these visas that can be issued. Until December 2017, it had only been exceeded once, in June 2015, but recently it has been hit for several months in a row. The government said this was mostly driven by demand for NHS workers which make up 40% of all Tier 2 places. On Tuesday, it was reported by the Financial Times that 2,360 visa applications by doctors from outside the European Economic Area were refused in a five-month period, apparently because of the cap. And in April, NHS bosses warned that immigration rules were hampering their ability to find workers after visas for 100 Indian doctors were refused. NHS England had 35,000 nurse vacancies and nearly 10,000 doctor posts unfilled in February, according to an NHS Improvementreport,external. According to think tank Global Future, 12.5% of NHS England's staff are from overseas. That number rises to 45% in certain specialities including paediatric cardiologists and neurosurgeons. The current annual cap on these visas has also led to over 1,000IT specialists and engineersbeing denied visas. The proposed change will only apply to doctors and nurses - but the government said it would free up hundreds of visas a month for workers in other industries like IT and teaching. More details are to be set out on Friday. Dr Sandeep Kumar and his family have been affected by the cap Dr Sandeep Kumar contacted the BBC to describe how he had been affected by the cap. ""My wife and I are Indian Citizens. We currently work at the University Hospital in Kerry in Ireland. We both want to be GPs in the UK and after multiple exams we were able to secure training posts at a hospital in Blackpool due to start in August. ""The hospital in Kerry offered to extend our visas so we could continue in our current posts. We said no thank you, we have got our dream job in the UK. They therefore filled our posts. ""Then a month ago I had my visa application rejected because of the cap. My wife is still waiting on hers. ""Our visas in Ireland expire in August. We have a five month old daughter. We have been out of India for three years and no permanent place to go in India. ""I was delighted when I heard the news the cap was to be lifted but I need to know when it will be. We need something immediately. I think it is good to have some immigration controls but if there are skilled areas where there is a shortage then there shouldn't be a cap. ""The NHS needs doctors and we want to come to work there. It is the British public who will suffer in the end if there are staff shortages."" Home Secretary Sajid Javid, who recently suggested a rethink of several key parts of the government's immigration policy, said: ""I recognise the pressures faced by the NHS and other sectors in recent months. Doctors and nurses play a vital role in society and at this time we need more in the UK. That is why I have reviewed our skilled worker visa route."" BBC political correspondent Ben Wright said the announcement could also encourage others to argue for the net migration target of under 100,000 - which has never been met - to be abandoned. This video can not be played Sajid Javid is pressed on the government's migration target Saffron Cordery, of trade body NHS Providers, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the change was ""absolutely the right decision"". ""This is going to be a huge relief for trusts up and down the country who have been really struggling to fill their doctors and nurses vacancies,"" she said. The Royal College of GPs said the cap had been ""arbitrary, unhelpful and in fact quite destructive"" and described excluding medics from it as a ""great step forward"". Alp Mehmet, of pressure group Migration Watch, said he accepted the change but that it should not be the long-term solution. ""What we must not forget to do is train our own medical staff,"" he said, adding that the UK should not ""raid other countries that need doctors and nurses a great deal more than we do"". Speaking at the NHS Confederation's annual conference in Manchester, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said training places for doctors, nurses and midwives were up by 25%. But he added: ""In the period between now and when those training places convert into fully trained clinicians, the government should be flexible on visas. And that is why it is extremely welcome that today the prime minister has announced that doctors and nurses will be removed from the tier 2 visa caps."" UK government policy aims to reduce net migration to below 100,000 a year.

"Matthew Hankinson is accused of being a member of banned neo-Nazi group National Action A man accused of being a member of a banned neo-Nazi group called for ""traitors"" who supported multi-ethnic Britain to be hanged from lampposts, in a video shown to an Old Bailey jury. In the clip, taken in March 2015, Matthew Hankinson, 24, addressed a crowd in Newcastle upon Tyne. He is one of six men who deny being in National Action after a ban in 2016. On Tuesday one of the group admitted planning to murder a Labour MP as part of what he called a ""white jihad"". Jack Renshaw, 23, of Skelmersdale, Lancashire, pleaded guilty to preparing an act of terrorism by buying a machete to kill West Lancashire MP Rosie Cooper. He also admitted making a threat to kill police officer Victoria Henderson. There is no dispute in the trial that Mr Hankinson, of Newton-le-Willows, Merseyside, is the speaker at the rally which took place more than a year before National Action was banned under terrorism legislation. He and the five other defendants deny being members of the group after it was outlawed in December 2016. During the Newcastle event, Mr Hankinson appears wearing dark sunglasses and surrounded by flag bearers, including one man carrying the National Action insignia. He tells the crowd they need to prepare for a coming race war which was necessary to secure the future of white people. ""If we don't fight and cut out the cancer, Britain will die,"" he says. ""The system will not compromise with us. We need the strongest of our race."" Referring to so-called race traitors who oppose far-right ideology, Mr Hankinson says: ""They will end up hanging from lampposts. We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children. ""Blood must be shed, the blood of traitors. Stand up white men and set our people free."" The jury also watched a video of a demonstration involving National Action in Liverpool which resulted in minor clashes with anti-racism protesters and police in 2016. Jack Renshaw, in the centre holding the flag with his bare hand, from a National Action video of a demonstration in Liverpool in 2016 Mr Atkinson told the jury that Jack Renshaw was a masked man seen to be holding a banner, alongside some of the group's founders. A further video of a Rochdale protest included footage of another of the defendants - Andrew Clarke, 33, of Prescot in Merseyside. The other accused, who all deny being in the group are: Christopher Lythgoe, 32, and Michal Trubini, 35, both from Warrington; and Garron Helm, 24, from Seaforth, Merseyside. Mr Lythgoe also denies encouragement to murder by allegedly giving Renshaw permission to kill Labour MP Ms Cooper on behalf of the group. The court was told it was a whistleblower - Robbie Mullen - who first warned the anti-racism charity Hope not Hate - and, through them, the police - of Renshaw's plan to kill Ms Cooper. Mr Mullen, 25, from Widnes, Cheshire, told jurors he became interested in far-right politics in his late teens and joined National Action in 2015. National Action was against ""every non-white"" group, Robbie Mullen said Asked which ""groups"" National Action was against, he said: ""Jews, blacks, Asians - every non-white."" He said it wanted a ""white Britain"" by ""any means necessary,"" which included ""war"" and ""people getting killed"". Questioned by prosecutor Duncan Atkinson QC, he said he had been a National Action member after it was banned and that the six men in the dock had remained members too. Asked why he had first contacted Hope not Hate in April 2017, he said ""partly the directions things were going in"". When asked to clarify, he said: ""To get out of the organisation - National Action."" He told jurors he had signed an agreement to give him immunity from prosecution over his former membership in return for giving evidence in the case. Andrew Clarke giving a speech in Rochdale in 2016 Mr Mullen said after National Action was banned, Mr Lythgoe took the organisation ""underground"" and had remained in charge. He said the meetings continued with the ""same place, same people, same purpose"". Mr Mullen said: ""The politics was still the same - free white man. The group had gone, the name had gone, but the people were still meeting."" He told the court of a July 2017 meeting at a pub in Warrington during which Renshaw outlined his plan to kill Rosie Cooper and Mr Lythgoe allegedly gave his approval. Mr Mullen said Mr Lythgoe suggested the former home secretary Amber Rudd be targeted, but Renshaw dismissed that because she would be too protected. He added that when Mr Lythgoe had said Renshaw could ""do it in the name of National Action"", Renshaw announced he would do it ""in the name of white jihad"". The case continues.
