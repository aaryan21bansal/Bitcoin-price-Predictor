"This video can not be played Parts of the bridge can be seen collapsing A motorway bridge has collapsed in the northwest Italian city of Genoa, killing 26 people and badly injuring 15, police told the BBC. Dramatic video footage captured the moment of the disaster when one of the huge supporting towers crashed down during torrential rain. Cars and trucks plummeted 45m (148ft) on to rail tracks, buildings and a river along with slabs of concrete. Searches for people trapped in rubble are expected to go into the night. Fears that other parts of the bridge might fall have prompted the evacuation of buildings in the area, a rescuer told Italy's Ansa news agency. Injured people were winched to safety Interior Minister Matteo Salvini promised that anyone found to be responsible for the bridge collapse would be held to account. ""I have crossed that bridge hundreds of times,"" he said. ""Now, as an Italian citizen, I will do everything to get the names and surnames of the managers responsible, past and present, because it is unacceptable to die like that in Italy."" What could have made the bridge collapse? How the Genoa bridge disaster unfolded In pictures: Deadly Italy bridge collapse A representative of the motorway's operator, Autostrade, told Reuters news agency there had been ""no reason to consider the bridge was dangerous"". Shares in Atlantia, Autostrade's parent company which runs much of the country's motorways, fell 6.3% after news of the collapse. It fell around 11:30 local time (09:30 GMT) during heavy rain. Police reported a violent cloudburst. ""We saw lightning strike the bridge,"" eyewitness Pietro M all'Asa was quoted as saying by Ansa. ""And we saw the bridge going down."" Engineers say it is too early to determine the cause of the collapse but that lightning is unlikely to be the reason. Another witness, unnamed, recalled: ""We heard an incredible roar and first we thought it was thunder very close by. ""We live about 5km [three miles] from the bridge but we heard a crazy bang... We were very scared... Traffic went completely haywire and the city was paralysed."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Earlier, fire brigade sources told Ansa unofficially that 35 people were dead and 12 missing. A child is among the dead, said the head of the civil defence agency, Angelo Borrelli. Between 30 and 35 cars and three heavy vehicles were on the bridge at the time of the collapse, he said. ""We are continuing with the rescue operations because we think there are other people alive under the rubble,"" Genoa police spokesperson Alessandra Bucci told Reuters. ""We have extracted people from the rubble and now we are focusing on assisting the people, and later on we will understand what caused the collapse of the bridge."" The full horror of the collapse could be seen in aerial video of the scene. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Patrick Villardry, a French firefighter who came from Nice to help the rescue effort, told AFP news agency the task was huge. ""The first victims have been evacuated and now we have to search under the wreckage of buildings, but there are thousands of tonnes of concrete,"" he said. The Morandi Bridge, built in the 1960s, stands on the A10 toll motorway, which serves the Italian Riviera and southern coast of France. The missing section was dozens of metres in length, and ran across the span of the Polcevera river. The collapse of the bridge was an ""incident of vast proportions on a vital arterial road, not just for Genoa, but for the whole country"", said Mr Toti. ""The Morandi bridge connects three major ports in our country, used by tens, even hundreds of thousands of people. They depart from these ports on holiday. These docks receive most of our country's imported goods. It damages the very structure of the Italian logistics system. We are expecting a very fast response from the government."" Mr Borrelli said the authorities were trying to arrange help for those affected by the disaster, as well as setting up diversions for traffic. ""What we are carrying out at the moment is a search and rescue operation for the victims and the injured, to get the victims out and recover the injured,"" he said. ""Then we are obviously also trying to work out how to set up a viable route that is an alternative to the motorway, and also for entry and exit from the port."" ""It's not acceptable that such an important bridge... was not built to avoid this kind of collapse,"" Mr Rixi was quoted as saying by Reuters. However, Stefano Marigliani, the Autostrade official responsible for the Genoa area, told the agency that the bridge had been ""constantly monitored and supervised well beyond what the law required"". The highway operator said work to shore up its foundation was being carried out at the time of the collapse. Repair work on the bridge was carried out in 2016, Reuters reports. Major repairs also took place in the 1990s. A structural engineer who lectures at Genoa University, Antonio Brencich, warned in 2016 that there were problems with the bridge, Italian media report. The bridge's designer, Riccardo Morandi (1902-1989) had miscalculated the ""viscous deformation"" - an ageing effect on reinforced concrete, Mr Brencich said. ""He was an engineer with great insight but lacking in practical calculations,"" the lecturer said. Italy's recently installed government has pledged to increase public investment in infrastructure. The country spent more than â¬14bn (Â£12.5bn; $16bn) on its roads in 2006 but that had dropped to less than â¬4bn by 2010, according to data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The figures cover spending on new transport construction and the improvement of the existing networks. Spending started to increase in 2013, when total spend was less than Spain, Germany, France and the UK. French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted a message of sympathy to the people of Italy, writing in both Italian and French. He said France was ready to offer any necessary aid. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Parts of the bridge can be seen collapsing Rescuers in the north-western Italian city of Genoa continue to search for possible survivors after the dramatic collapse of a motorway bridge. The interior minister said at least 37 people were killed when dozens of vehicles fell 45m (148ft). About 16 people were injured in the collapse and the number missing ranges from four to 12. About 250 firefighters from across Italy are taking part in the search, using sniffer dogs and climbing gear. ""We're not giving up hope,"" fire official Emanuele Giffi told AFP news agency, vowing teams would work ""round the clock until the last victim is secured"". More than 400 people have been evacuated amid fears other parts of the bridge might fall. The cause of the disaster, which occurred during torrential rain, was not immediately clear but questions had been raised about the safety of the structure. What we know about Italy bridge collapse What could have made the bridge collapse? How the Genoa bridge disaster unfolded In pictures: Deadly Italy bridge collapse Interior Minister Matteo Salvini has vowed to bring anyone responsible for the collapse to book. The Morandi Bridge, built in the 1960s, stands on the A10 toll motorway, an important conduit for goods traffic from local ports, which also serves the Italian Riviera and southern coast of France. The BBC's James Reynolds at the scene says firefighters have been working their way into small cracks in an effort to find anyone who might still be trapped in a vehicle. Genoa police spokesperson Alessandra Bucci told Reuters it was thought that people were still alive. Floodlights guided the search overnight A section measuring 200 metres fell in At least three children were among the dead. The Italian fire service tweeted a video of one person being extracted and carefully lowered on cables from a shattered vehicle, which was suspended in the wreckage of the bridge, high above the ground.

Between 30 and 35 cars and three heavy vehicles were on the bridge at the time of the collapse. A huge tower and sections of the bridge collapsed on to railway lines, a river and a warehouse. The car of Davide Capello, 33, a former goalkeeper for Serie A side Cagliari, came down in the collapse but he survived. ""I was able to get out... I don't know how my car wasn't crushed. It seemed like a scene from a film, it was the apocalypse,"" he said. Marcello de Angelis, who is co-ordinating the Italian Red Cross rescue effort, told the BBC that rescuers were treating the disaster like an earthquake. Rescuers from all over northern Italy came to help Injured people were winched to safety ""There might be the possibility of some niches being created by the rubble itself, with people being protected by the rubble,"" he said. ""The units that we have sent we use during earthquakes. So it is the same sort of situation - and also the risk of other collapses, obviously, is the same."" A section measuring about 200 metres fell at around 11:30 local time (09:30 GMT). Police say there was a violent cloudburst at the time.

"The rail industry should change how it calculates fare rises and staff wages to cut costs for passengers, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has said. He has asked train operators and unions to use a different, lower, inflation measure to set pay and fare increases. The RMT union said it opposed Mr Grayling's call - made hours before January's rail fare rise is announced. The shadow transport secretary said Mr Grayling ""had the power to enforce this, he's just choosing not to."" ""The truth is that our fragmented, privatised railway drives up costs and leaves passengers paying more for less,"" Andy McDonald added. Mick Cash, leader of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, said it would fight any attempt to impose a ""pay cap"" on its members in a drive to protect private train company profits. ""This is a basket-case government and a lame duck transport secretary continuing its all-out war on staff and passengers alike,"" he added. Fares are expected to go up by 3.5% at the start of the next year. The exact increase will be announced on Wednesday when official inflation figures - used to set the price increases - for July are published. Rail fares expected to rise 3.5% for 2019 Rail timetable changes for winter scaled back Economists are predicting that the Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure of inflation - the number used by the Department for Transport to set rail fare increases -  will increase by 3.5%. This year rail fares rose by 3.6% -the biggest jump for five years. Mr Grayling said he wanted to see ""lower levels of increases for passengers in future"". He has asked train operators and unions to use a different inflation measure, the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), to determine rail fare and wage increases. This is lower than the current tool used, the Retail Prices Index (RPI), which includes mortgage costs. Rail passengers have faced ongoing delays this year ""I support paying rail staff decent wages for the hard work they do, but I also now believe it is important that pay agreements also use CPI and not RPI in future,"" he said. Mr Grayling urged the rail companies' membership body the Rail Delivery Group to help the government move towards using CPI for future pay deals. He said the move would help the industry to ""keep costs down"". The letter was sent to all the rail unions, with a separate letter sent to Paul Plummer, the chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group, asking for his support. The TUC union earlier calculated that rail fares had risen over twice as fast as wages over the past decade. Wednesday's fare hike comes after a summer of chaos for many train customers,after a rail timetable overhaul saw scores of cancellations and delays.

"Archbishop Donald Wuerl sent a letter to Pennsylvania priests warning them of ""profoundly disturbing"" details in the report The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has released a grand jury report detailing sex abuse in the Catholic Church, naming over 300 accused clergymen. The landmark grand jury investigation found more than 1,000 children had been abused by members of six dioceses in the state for the last 70 years. Officials say the probe found systematic cover-ups by the church. The report is the latest inquiry into allegations of sex abuse by Catholic clergy worldwide. After an 18-month investigation, ""over one thousand child victims were identifiable, from the church's own records,"" the grand jury states in the report released on Tuesday. ""We believe that the real number - of children whose records were lost or who were afraid ever to come forward - is in the thousands."" US cardinal resigns over abuse claims Sex abuse and the Catholic Church 'Biggest obstacle to the Church is itself' The document states that young boys and girls, as well as teenagers, were abused by clergy. ""All of them were brushed aside by church leaders who preferred to protect the abusers and their institution above all,"" the report reads. Due to alleged cover-up efforts by the church's senior officials, most of the cases are too old for prosecution, the grand jury noted. But officials warned there may be more indictments as the investigation continues. While the report names hundreds of priests, some names remain redacted due to claims that naming them violates their constitutional rights. State Attorney General Josh Shapiro said at a news conference on Tuesday that his office is working to remove those redactions. ""Church officials routinely and purposefully described the abuse as horseplay and wrestling and inappropriate conduct. It was none of those things. It was child sexual abuse, including rape,"" Mr Shapiro said. The report also criticised Washington DC Archbishop Cardinal Donald Wuerl, formerly of the Pittsburgh diocese, for his role in concealing the abuse. The high-profile cardinal defended himself in a statement ahead of the report's release on Tuesday, saying he ""acted with diligence, with concern for the survivors and to prevent future acts of abuse"". ""The report will be a reminder of grave failings that the Church must acknowledge and for which it must seek forgiveness,"" he wrote. The Pennsylvania grand jury, which convened in 2016, interviewed dozens of witnesses and examined more than 500,000 pages of internal documents from every diocese in the state except Philadelphia and Altoona-Johnstown, which had already been investigated. Many victims claimed they were drugged or otherwise manipulated. Some recalled being beaten by family members who did not believe their stories. Archbishop of Washington Cardinal Theodore McCarrick resigned amid allegations that he assaulted a teen while working as a priest in the 1970s Pennsylvania is home to over 3m Catholics. US media report that Pennsylvania has had the highest number of grand jury investigations into child sex abuse in the church in the country. The report comes amid renewed scrutiny of child sex abuse allegations within the Catholic Church. Last month, Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, a former Washington DC archbishop and a high-profile Catholic leader, resigned amid allegations that he sexually abused children and adults for decades. Cardinal McCarrick Cardinal Wuerl replaced Cardinal McCarrick as Washington's archbishop after he retired in 2006. Earlier this year, Pope Francis apologised to Chilean victims for ""serious mistakes"" he made in handling a case of alleged child abuse.

"Ben Stokes' defence barrister told the jury he had acted ""to defend himself or in defence of another"" England cricketer Ben Stokes has been found not guilty of affray after a fight near a Bristol nightclub. The Durham all-rounder, 27, denied the charge following the fracas between a group of men last September. His lawyer Paul Lunt said it was ""the end of an 11-month ordeal"" for Mr Stokes, who was ""keen to get back to cricket being his sole focus"". Ryan Ali, 28 - who was knocked unconscious in the brawl - was also found not guilty of the same charge. The fight happened several hours after England had played a one-day international against the West Indies at the County Ground in the city. Mr Stokes and Mr Ali shook hands on leaving the dock. The cricketer's wife, Clare, cried when the not guilty verdicts were returned while her husband closed his eyes with relief and then looked up. Ryan Ali has been cleared of affray During the six-day trial, Bristol Crown Court heard the incident described as ""a sustained episode of significant violence"" from Mr Stokes - of Castle Eden in Durham - who had ""lost control"". The prosecution said he was ""drunk and enraged"" after being refused entry back into Mbargo nightclub at 02:00 BST on 25 September. But Mr Stokes told the jury he had ""stepped in"" to defend two gay men who were being verbally abused, and then had to defend himself from Mr Ali - of Forest Road in Bristol - and Ryan Hale, 27, who were threatening violence. This video can not be played How events unfolded the night Ben Stokes was arrested Mr Hale, of Burghill Road in Westbury-on-Trym, was acquitted of the same charge last week. 'Sigh of relief for Stokes but questions remain' Stokes recalled by England after verdict Speaking to ITV,externalafter the trial, Kai Barry and William O'Connor - the couple Mr Stokes defended - said they were thankful for what he had done. Mr Barry said: ""I thought he was just a normal lad sticking up for someone that was obviously weaker than he was. This video can not be played Kai Barry: ""I got a bit scared so I carried on walking off"" ""When I realised who he was I thought, fair play, because obviously he put his career at risk for someone that he never knew."" Mr Ali, who works for the emergency services, suffered a fractured eye socket in the brawl while Mr Hale, a former soldier, was left with concussion. As Mr Ali left court, smiling, he told BBC Sport editor Dan Roan he was ""relieved it's all over"" and said he had no further comment to make. This video can not be played Ben Stokes' lawyer, Paul Lunt, said the juryâs decision fairly reflected the truth of what happened in Bristol that night. Outside court, two cricket fans from Bristol - who were part of the crowd awaiting the outcome - said they were pleased with the verdict. Arthur Davis, 30, said: ""He's a great player although not in form and maybe this will change that."" And Javen Rahiman, 26, said: ""I'm pretty pleased but it's not the best example he's setting, especially as the evening of the fight was after such a good victory. ""I hope it's a kick up the backside for him and he can focus more on the game now with no distractions."" After the verdict the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said Mr Stokeswould be added to England's squad for the third Test against India. The BBC's cricket correspondent, Jonathan Agnew, said Mr Stokes would now face an ECB independent disciplinary committee, likely charged with bringing the game into disrepute. Allow Twitter content?

On the first day of the trial, the prosecution team applied for Mr Stokes to be charged with two counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, a lesser charge, but this was rejected by Judge Peter Blair QC. Under the Public Order Act 1986, 'a person is guilty of affray if he uses or threatens unlawful violence towards another and his conduct is such as would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his personal safety'. So, though it may seem odd, the offence is not designed simply to protect those involved in the violent incident itself: it is also designed to protect other people who are present. That could include, for example, passers by in a street, those drinking in a pub, or fans at a football game when violence is threatened or actually occurs. However, the 'person of reasonable firmness' need not actually be present at the scene. This person is sometimes known as the 'hypothetical bystander' and it is he or she rather than the victim, who must fear for his or her personal safety. There must be a 'victim' present against whom the violence is to be directed, and some conduct, beyond the use of words, which is threatening and directed towards a person or people.

After the verdict the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said Mr Stokeswould be added to England's squad for the third Test against India. The BBC's cricket correspondent, Jonathan Agnew, said Mr Stokes would now face an ECB independent disciplinary committee, likely charged with bringing the game into disrepute. Allow Twitter content?

On the first day of the trial, the prosecution team applied for Mr Stokes to be charged with two counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, a lesser charge, but this was rejected by Judge Peter Blair QC. Under the Public Order Act 1986, 'a person is guilty of affray if he uses or threatens unlawful violence towards another and his conduct is such as would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his personal safety'. So, though it may seem odd, the offence is not designed simply to protect those involved in the violent incident itself: it is also designed to protect other people who are present. That could include, for example, passers by in a street, those drinking in a pub, or fans at a football game when violence is threatened or actually occurs. However, the 'person of reasonable firmness' need not actually be present at the scene. This person is sometimes known as the 'hypothetical bystander' and it is he or she rather than the victim, who must fear for his or her personal safety. There must be a 'victim' present against whom the violence is to be directed, and some conduct, beyond the use of words, which is threatening and directed towards a person or people.

"The study found that users had to turn off another setting in order to disable location being recorded Google records users' locations even when they have asked it not to, a report from the Associated Press has suggested. The issue could affect up to two billion Android and Apple devices which use Google for maps or search. The study, verified by researchers at Princeton University, has angered US law-makers. Google said in response that it provides clear descriptions of its tools and how to turn them off. The study found that users' whereabouts are recorded even when location history has been disabled. For example: Google stores a snapshot of where you are when you open the Maps app Automatic weather updates on Android phones pinpoint roughly where a user is Searches that have nothing to do with location pinpoint precise longitude and latitude of users To illustrate the effect of these location markers, AP created a visual map showing the movements of Princeton researcher Gunes Acar who was using an Android phone with location history turned off. The map showed his train commute around New York as well as visits to The High Line park, Chelsea Market, Hell's Kitchen, Central Park and Harlem. It also revealed his home address. To stop Google saving these location markers, users have to turn off another setting called Web and App Activity, which is enabled by default and which does not mention location data. Disabling this prevents Google storing information generated by searches and other activities which can limit the effectiveness of its digital assistant. ""You would think that telling Google that you didn't want your location to be tracked by disabling an option called ""Location History"" would stop the internet giant from storing data about your location,""writes security researcher Graham Cluley on his blog.,external ""It seems pretty sneaky to me that Google continues to store location data, unless you both disable ""Location history"" and ""Web & App Activity."""" In response, Google told AP: ""There are a number of different ways that Google may use location to improve people's experience, including: Location History, Web and App Activity, and through device-level Location Services. ""We provide clear descriptions of these tools, and robust controls so people can turn them on or off, and delete their histories at any time."" Facebook and Google use 'dark patterns' in privacy settings Google and Facebook accused of breaking GDPR laws Gmail messages 'read by human third parties' Following its research,AP created a guide,externalto show users how to delete location data. Presented with the evidence of the AP study, Democratic senator Mark Warner accused technology companies of having ""corporate practices that diverge wildly from the totally reasonable expectation of their users"". Democratic congressman Frank Pallone called for ""comprehensive consumer privacy and data security legislation"". In the UK, a spokesman for the Information Commissioner's Office told the BBC: ""Under the GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018, organisations have a legal duty to be open, transparent and fair with the public about how their personal data is used. ""Anybody who has concerns about how an organisation is handling their personal information can contact the ICO."" Technology firms are under fire for not being clear about privacy settings and how to use them. In June, a report from the Norwegian Consumer Council found evidence that privacy-friendly options are hidden away or obscured. Location-based advertising offers big opportunities to marketers. According to research firm BIA/Kelsey, US brands are poised to spend up to $20.6bn (Â£16.3bn) on targeted mobile ads in 2018. Since 2014, Google has let advertisers track the effectiveness of online adverts with a feature based on footfall data, which relies on location history.

" Harry Uzoka was a successful model - a hard line of work to stay in.Fashions, for faces as well as clothes, change quickly. But Harry had lasted the best part of a decade. He had been booked for jobs that black male models had struggled to get in the past. At 25, he knew he’d had a good run and made a good living, but he was starting to explore the idea of doing something else - writing a film and launching a magazine that would celebrate black excellence. Life was good. His girlfriend Ruby Campbell was also a model. They had flown to St Lucia for Christmas, the first truly big holiday he’d ever had. He was building a house for his mother, Josephine, in her home country Nigeria - where she planned to return. But on Thursday 11 January 2018 all this ended. Harry lay on the pavement, his body punctured with knife wounds. One was to the heart and the paramedics and doctors couldn’t save him. At 17:00, on the cold concrete outside his home in Shepherds Bush in west London, he was declared dead. A confrontation with another male model - lasting just a couple of minutes - had taken everything. I never got to meet Harry, but I knew about him - we moved in some of the same circles. Like me, he was born in London into a Nigerian family. He lived with his mother and his older brother Edmond in Dagenham, where there’s a large Nigerian community. During the 2000s many African families relocated from south London and headed further out, often east. They were looking for cheaper housing, better schools and the hope of peace and quiet. Many found that on the edges of Essex. By the 2011 Census, the black African population in Barking and Dagenham had nearly doubled in a decade. Take a walk down Dagenham’s Heathway - one of the main roads - and you’ll see a black church, a Nigerian restaurant and some African and Caribbean hair shops. The UK seemed to offer new opportunities to our parents, many of whom arrived in the country highly skilled. Most Nigerian households tend to uphold strong cultural values. We were to work hard, “face our books” and fear God. Making our parents proud was key. The importance of being educated and successful was instilled in us from a young age. Growing up, Harry’s passion was football. He attended All Saints Catholic school in Dagenham, where according to childhood friend Jeremie Thompson, he was smart, “a whiz-kid - really good at maths”. When I first heard about Harry, he was still a teenager - but he had already broken through as one of the country’s most promising young black male models. One of my best friends had hosted a photo shoot at her house, and Harry was the model. He was shooting with Leomie Anderson, another young black model from London, who had turned heads on Channel 4’s The Model Agency show. She was also his girlfriend. The pair were barely 18, but for many young black men and women, they were starting to look like a power couple. They’d achieved something already - they’d used their good looks and their determination. In their shoots together, they seemed playful, confident and in love. It was refreshing to see a successful young dark-skinned man celebrating a young dark-skinned woman. When I was growing up, there didn’t seem to be that many young black role models around. So just seeing Harry Uzoka’s face in London’s West End on a big advertising board at Oxford Circus would be enough to stir up a sense of pride. There was just something about him. “Inspirational” is a word that’s been used time and time again to describe him by stylists, agents, photographers and other models. He was fun, oozed personality, was eager to learn and easy to be around, according to his friends. Kevin Morosky, a photographer and filmmaker,shot Harry in one of his first editorials. Harry became “the go-to guy”, he says. “He had a massive impact on the way the fashion industry cast dark-skin boys.” But there were challenges. With his friends Jeremy Boateng and Chuck Achike, Harry helped start a collective of young black models, with the aim of supporting each other in getting ahead. “It was all made up of black boys, black models. In the industry we were sort of blocked,” says Jeremy Boateng. Those in the group felt they only got put up for certain jobs. “Right now for the black models in the industry things are very different, but at the time no-one was doing like the Pradas, we were doing like the JD [Sports] or the River Islands. Not high-end ones. “It wasn’t really common to see a lot of black models doing that, especially boys.” Harry - known as “H” to his friends - radiated infectious positive energy. “He changed a lot of those really young mindsets that I feel a lot of black people have, where it’s like you can’t show love to your bro,” says Jeremy. “He was always that encouragement, like you can do anything. “He used to come to me and be like, ‘J, you can do it - I know you, you can do it.’ “You don’t really get that among your black brothers. A lot of it is just competition.” Harry was driven to help others improve themselves - but at one time he had had to turn his own life around. In 2008 he was sentenced to four years in a young offenders institution for his part in a robbery. He served two years of that sentence. Childhood friend, Jeremie Thompson, was convicted alongside him. “We were kids. We looked like kids,” he says. “It was just mixing with the wrong people. They’re not putting the legit ways of having money - it’s just whatever you can do to get it. We fell in to that.” The pair knew they had done wrong and, as soon as they were inside, Harry’s friend says they were making plans to do something positive once they got out. “People could just tell we didn’t come across like gang members or anything like that. We always spoke about coming out and going into something big.” Inside, Harry spent a lot of time reflecting and reading - particularly books about spirituality, according to his friend. “He got that from his brother. Ed was always talking about things to do with the mind and how powerful your mind is.” Jeremie now works in marketing for a sportswear firm. He knows the impact his friend had on his future. As soon as Harry was released he started changing his life. He enrolled at college. The next step would probably have been university. But one day his brother Edmond - a model signed to the AMCK agency in west London - took Harry along to a meeting. Harry’s potential was spotted immediately and he was soon signed up. After Harry died, ex-AMCK booker Patrick Egbon-Marshall described his modelling career as a “modern day Cinderella story”. He wrote on Instagram that it was his honesty, humility and hard work that had helped pave the way for his success. Shortly after he was signed, Harry walked for London Fashion Week. At the time it still felt unusual to see black teenagers on the catwalk. “For his first ever runway opening, Wretch was there, Tinie Tempah was there,” Jeremie Thompson says. The pair had spent a lot of time in detention listening to the music of Tottenham rapper Wretch 32. Later he was one of the first celebrities to pay tribute to Harry after his death, describing him as “ground-breaking”. As well as getting his head straight while in detention - reading, planning and thinking - Harry had also transformed his body, spending hours in the gym. “He was so skinny when we went in, basically a stick,” says Jeremie. “Then he met this Nigerian guy that basically got Harry massive.” By the time he was 18, Harry had modelled for Nike. He went on to work for brands such as Zara, Asos, Pull & Bear, and Jack Wills. “Harry provided a platform for black male models to come through in a way they hadn’t previously in London,” says Tytiah Blake, a casting director from London. “A lot of success in the industry is linked to your personality - if you don’t have charm, it can be difficult to break through. Harry had that balance of looks and the personality.” Nigerian-British writer and stylist Ayishat Akanbi worked with Harry and knew him as a friend. “Harry represented possibilities to many young working-class black boys. Modelling isn’t the type of industry we’re often encouraged to go into, especially within young male culture. “I think Harry reminded young men in particular that it is OK to be delicate. “He was never not smiling - he had not a single thing to prove. Again these are rare qualities to be regularly met with in the industry, so he really did stand out. “Charming, curious, adorable and kind-hearted are words that come to mind when I think of Harry.” By 2014, he was signed to the prestigious Premier Model Management - which helped shape the career of Naomi Campbell and other big names. He visited glamorous places for work - Paris, Milan, Los Angeles and New York. Even with his new success Harry never forgot about the people he grew up with, recalls Jeremie Thompson. “He’d always say if he’s earning money or if he’s doing well, and all his friends aren’t, he’s not doing well. “I’ve messaged Harry and said, ‘Bro do you think you have five pounds you can send me just so I can get a meal?’. And he’d be like, 'What!’ and come off the phone and send me like £300 and he’d do that without expecting it back.” Despite this, Harry wasn’t lavish in his own life and rarely went on holiday, although he longed to go to Nigeria and explore his heritage. That was just one of his dreams. In an interview with menswear magazine Boys by Girls, he described The Alchemist by Brazilian author Paulo Coelho as “his favourite book of all time”. At the centre of the story is the idea that everyone should dedicate themselves to the pursuit of their dreams. In that magazine interview, Harry spoke about dreams and “how you should never give up on them and how you should never see any negative”. Harry often showed a strong spiritual side, his friends and colleagues felt. “I felt like when I was shooting Harry, I was shooting his soul,” says Kevin Morosky.  “Because he wore his heart on his sleeve. And his soul was so beautiful. When you took pictures of him, you took pictures of his essence.” His commitment to self-improvement was obvious, remembers Ayishat Akanbi. “In his curiosity Harry was definitely an old soul, he felt like he’d been here before and was trying to put together pieces of his past life. “He wanted to learn to open his mind and heart more - a noble challenge.” This notion of self-improvement was something that Harry wanted to share. It was, he believed, a way of empowering young black men. “There was proper no sort of competition in him,” says Jeremy Boateng. “Like even if there was a black guy that looked like him or that was in his agency, most people would act funny… knowing that only one of us can get that spot. He was just like, ‘Nah we can all win.’” Harry was happy to share his experience with new black models starting out in the industry. One of those he helped was George Koh. The two models met in 2015 on a shoot. Three years later, Koh would be on trial at the Old Bailey for murdering Harry. Model Chuck Achike said Harry had been helping a designer teach some models how to walk the runway. One of them was George Koh. Harry went on to advise the other model how to advance his career, giving him tips on how to improve his physique and pick the right agency. The court heard the two became acquaintances, but not friends. There was a physical similarity between them. They were both slim and dark with bone structures that gave their faces a certain softness. “I remember the first time I did see him, this is my true reaction, I remember saying to H, ‘This guy looks a little like you,’” says Jeremy Boateng. But some kind of animosity eventually developed. Some felt that Koh had begun to copy Harry’s playful style in shoots, and among Harry’s friends there was an inside joke that the other model was slightly obsessed with him. It was an issue that was explored at Koh’s trial. The court heard Harry sent a message to Koh asking him to stop following and unfollowing his friends and family on Instagram. Koh blamed it on an app he used to get more followers. Friends of Harry discussed a photo shoot Koh had put on Instagram where he seemed to be copying a pose. When asked by the prosecution if he had become obsessed, Koh replied: “No, I wasn’t obsessed with him.” Things came to a head on 11 January 2018. Seven months later, George Koh, 24, and Merse Dikanda, 24, were convicted of murder. Jonathan Okigbo, 24, was acquitted of murder but convicted of manslaughter. All three had pleaded not guilty at the Old Bailey. Harry’s housemate Adrian Harper had told the murder trial about the events that led up to the tragedy. Harry said he had been told by a woman that Koh was claiming to have slept with Harry’s girlfriend, Ruby Campbell. Harry initially seemed happy to laugh it off, his housemate told the court. But that wasn’t what happened. The two models exchanged messages. GEORGE KOH TO HARRY UZOKA11:42:43Yooo11:42:44G11:43:54Why is your boy messaging me11:44:09What is he on about & what girl HARRY UZOKA TO GEORGE KOH17:24:29What’s your number? GEORGE KOH TO HARRY UZOKA17:48:37[sends his number] HARRY UZOKA TO GEORGE KOH14:21:58Leave my name out of your mouth, its that simple I’ve never spoken bad of you in any way so this is wild. “Harry’s mood didn’t feel right,” another of the model’s housemates, Seun Lawal, told the court. Harry and George Koh had a phone conversation on Wednesday 10 January. Seun Lawal also said Harry said he had spoken to Ruby Campbell and that she insisted she had never met Koh. But the dispute carried on into the next day - 11 January 2018. The court was shown another exchange of messages, which showed the lead-up to Harry Uzoka and George Koh confronting each other. GEORGE KOH TO HARRY UZOKA13:55:51Where you I’ll come there n we can fight bring your friends with U HARRY UZOKA TO GEORGE KOH14:02:04come Shepards Bush GEORGE KOH TO HARRY UZOKA14:04:54Where in bush post code14:05:33U got my number HARRY UZOKA TO GEORGE KOH14:21:58Listen come bush station this is the last thing I’m saying to you. (emoji crying laugh) your a lost soul. GEORGE KOH TO HARRY UZOKA14:23:53Im coming15:08:32Be 2min15:08:48U there yh?15:43:26I’m here George Koh brought Merse Dikanda and Jonathan Okigbo with him. They eventually arrived in Ollgar Close, near to Harry’s flat. They were armed, the court heard, with at least three knives - George Koh had two and Merse Dikanda a machete. Harry’s housemate - Adrian Harper - agreed to come with him, the court was told. The pair armed themselves by taking dumbbell bars with their weights removed. There was no discussion about what they were going to do - the housemate told the court if someone messages you about a fight “you are going to go there and fight”. Adrian Harper was asked by Richard Horwell QC, prosecuting, if he had any expectation the three men they were meeting were armed. “Yeah, but not with knives,” he said. “It is not difficult to work out which side won. Uzoka and Harper were outnumbered and bars stand little chance against knives,” the prosecution told the court. By the prosecution’s account the two groups had met at 15:51. Within two minutes it was over. Harry’s housemate was able to run away, he told the court. But by the time Harry escaped he had already been stabbed. His life was ebbing away. Harry’s death hit many people hard - there were hundreds of tributes in the hours and days after. For some, it’s still difficult to comprehend how a person seen as such a positive force could end up in a such a desperate situation. Some might think that Harry made a bad decision shortly before his life was taken - but it does not erase the fact that a young man was stabbed to death. With the recent spate of knife violence in London and other big cities, it’s easy to lose track of the numbers and names, and merge all the headlines into one. This case stood out. But every victim of knife crime is someone who shouldn’t have died. Everyone was somebody’s child. Every death leaves a hole in a family. To those who knew him, Harry Uzoka was full of love, and his life was so far away from how it ended. Lots of people have made the wrong choice at some point in their lives - Harry clearly did as a teenager. But he made a conscious effort to change. And he made that transformation look effortless, recalls Jeremy Boateng. “You know when someone truly transforms? I didn’t know him when he was in jail. When he came out he had a little bit of, like, still that hoodness in him. “But he was just a young spirit, the second he had removed all that ego from him, completely different guy - it was just love.” In an Instagram tribute to her former boyfriend, with whom she had remained firm friends, Leomie Anderson wrote: “You’ve been all over the world and been an inspiration to so many. You are proof that you can change your entire life and become a role model, no matter the circumstances.” Rapper Wretch 32 posted an impassioned reaction on Instagram to the news, pleading for an end to the violence. After describing Harry as “groundbreaking”, he said: “He’s got nothing to do with nothing… youths start walking around with these mental knives, and you think you can stab people with these knives and they’re going to survive.” Harry was once asked in an interview how he wanted to be remembered. “More than anything, just honest - an honest being of love and light.” Words:Linda Adeywith additional reporting by Jeremy Britton and Naomi Pallas Photography and art:Drew Wheeler, Jeff Hahn, Kevin Morosky, Timo Kerber, Holly Falconer, Clare Shilland, Vicki King, Willprinceart Editors: Kathryn Westcott and Finlo Rohrer Production:Naomi Pallas",Negative,0.00070944795
"The rail industry should change how it calculates fare rises and staff wages to cut costs for passengers, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has said. He has asked train operators and unions to use a different, lower, inflation measure to set pay and fare increases. The RMT union said it opposed Mr Grayling's call - made hours before January's rail fare rise is announced. The shadow transport secretary said Mr Grayling ""had the power to enforce this, he's just choosing not to."" ""The truth is that our fragmented, privatised railway drives up costs and leaves passengers paying more for less,"" Andy McDonald added. Mick Cash, leader of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, said it would fight any attempt to impose a ""pay cap"" on its members in a drive to protect private train company profits. ""This is a basket-case government and a lame duck transport secretary continuing its all-out war on staff and passengers alike,"" he added. Fares are expected to go up by 3.5% at the start of the next year. The exact increase will be announced on Wednesday when official inflation figures - used to set the price increases - for July are published. Rail fares expected to rise 3.5% for 2019 Rail timetable changes for winter scaled back Economists are predicting that the Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure of inflation - the number used by the Department for Transport to set rail fare increases -  will increase by 3.5%. This year rail fares rose by 3.6% -the biggest jump for five years. Mr Grayling said he wanted to see ""lower levels of increases for passengers in future"". He has asked train operators and unions to use a different inflation measure, the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), to determine rail fare and wage increases. This is lower than the current tool used, the Retail Prices Index (RPI), which includes mortgage costs. Rail passengers have faced ongoing delays this year ""I support paying rail staff decent wages for the hard work they do, but I also now believe it is important that pay agreements also use CPI and not RPI in future,"" he said. Mr Grayling urged the rail companies' membership body the Rail Delivery Group to help the government move towards using CPI for future pay deals. He said the move would help the industry to ""keep costs down"". The letter was sent to all the rail unions, with a separate letter sent to Paul Plummer, the chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group, asking for his support. The TUC union earlier calculated that rail fares had risen over twice as fast as wages over the past decade.

After a week soundtracked by reports ofunrest between Rodgers and the boardover a failure to strengthen the squad - and amplified bySaturday's defeatat Hearts - Celtic were two down after 50 minutes in Athens. Scott Sinclair's header with 12 minutes to play left Celtic needing to score once more to progress to the play-off round on away goals. But the Greek champions held on to deny their Scottish counterparts a tie with Hungarian side MOL Vidi. Instead Rodgers will lead Celtic into a Europa League play-off round meeting with Latvia's Spartaks Jurmala or Suduva Marijampole of Lithuania. Suduva hold a 1-0 lead and an away-goal advantage going into Thursday's third qualifying round deciding leg. Rodgers rues lack of Celtic recruitment Lack of spending and familiar flaws - Bonner Reaction & Celtic's defeat as it happened Listen: Sportsound podcast BBC Scotland's senior football reporter Chris McLaughlin in Athens This was coming. Rodgers did everything but spell it out over the past few weeks. He is a man who constantly talks about progress and for the first time since his arrival, the club is going backwards in European football. He saw the signs, made the noises, but all in vain. It was no thumping. The fact it was close will frustrate the Celtic manager all the more. Who knows what difference a couple of new faces may have made for a Celtic side who looked devoid of ideas at times over the two legs? At this level, and given where they have been for the past two years, the margins are fine. That will keep Rodgers awake for the next few nights. The Europa League is little consolation, both in a football and a financial sense but that is where they find themselves. Fans might attempt to soothe the pain with thoughts of a lengthy run in European football's booby prize, but unless Celtic sort out the on and off-field issues, that seems fanciful. Those who refused to believe that cracks were showing, might do well to look again. The manager has said he is going nowhere, now he must fight to arrest a worrying slide. Sinclair's goal gave Celtic hope The preamble to the match had been dominated by headlines about Dedryck Boyata's Celtic future. But without the Belgian international and the suspended Kristoffer Ajer, Rodgers was left with Jack Hendry and the returning Jozo Simunovic as his central defensive pairing. That weakened rearguard was a concern and, as was feared, it was opened up within six minutes. Nicklas Hult pulled back a pass to find Rodrigo Galo in too much space to apply a finish from 14 yards. Celtic did settle after that discombobulating start, enjoying plenty of the ball, but chances were scarce as Rodgers' side searched for the required away goal. Leigh Griffiths led the attack - with record signing Odsonne Edouard injured and Moussa Dembele on the bench - and the Scotland forward latched on to Callum McGregor's teasing delivery only to steer wide under duress from his marker. Celtic were being allowed to push forward by an Athens side content to wait for the right moment to try and put the result beyond doubt. And that moment came just after the break, Vassilis Lambropoulos outjumping Hendry to meet Rodrigo's set piece and direct across the six-yard box for Marko Livaja to nod in. That left the Scottish champions in a desperate predicament as they scrambled to get back into the tie. Simunovic's glancing header and Olivier Ntcham's free-kick were both well saved by Vasilios Barkas, but Sinclair reduced the deficit with 12 minutes remaining when he headed in Kieran Tierney's cross. Another goal would have secured a win on away goals. Celtic pushed forward. AEK grew edgy. In the fifth and final minute of added time the chance came. But Simunovic's flicked cross from McGregor's ball flew inches past a post. And seconds later, the home side were celebrating.

"Daniel Jones was a member of the gang that stole some Â£14m of goods from the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit One of the ringleaders behind the Hatton Garden raid has been given additional jail time for failing to pay his confiscation order. Daniel Jones, 63, has been sentenced to a further six years and 287 days for failing to pay back Â£6,599,021. He was a member of the gang that stole some Â£14m of goods after drilling into a vault at London's Hatton Garden Safe Deposit in Easter 2015. Jones received his additional sentence at Westminster Magistrates' Court. The 63-year-old, from Enfield, was originally jailed for seven years in March 2016after admitting conspiracy to commit burglary. Background to Hatton Garden heist case Cartoon: The Hatton Garden Job Men sentenced for Hatton Garden raid Who's who of the Hatton Garden gang The vault at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd was breached over the 2015 Easter weekend In January, Jones and three other men were ordered to pay a combined Â£6,396,273 between them after it was found they benefitted from an estimated Â£13.69m worth of stolen cash, gold and gems. The gang was also ordered to each pay an extra sum depending on their personal circumstances. The raid has been branded the ""largest burglary in English legal history"" with some two thirds of the valuables taken believed to remain unrecovered. Heather Chalk, specialist prosecutor at the CPS, said Jones had ""gained millions of pounds of criminal cash"" from the burglary. ""In January, the CPS showed the court that Jones had the funds to pay back his ill-gotten gains and today we have successfully argued that his default sentences should be activated,"" she said.

"Staying cool has become a major concern in the current heat wave The next few years could be ""anomalously warm"", according to a new study. Researchers have developed a mathematical model to predict how average global surface air temperatures will vary over the next few years. The results suggest that the period from 2018 to 2022 could see an increased likelihood of extreme temperatures. The findings arepublished in the journal Nature Communications.,external The warming caused by emissions of greenhouse gases like CO2 is not increasing at a perfectly steady rate. In the early years of the 21st Century, scientists pointed to a hiatus in warming. But several analyses show that the five warmest years on record all have taken place since 2010. These variations from year-to-year do not affect the long-term trend in warming temperatures. Now, a new method for trying to predict global temperatures suggests the next few years will be hotter than expected. Rather than using traditional climate simulation techniques, Florian SÃ©vellec, from the CNRS in Brest, France, and Sybren S Drijfhout, from the University of Southampton, developed a statistical method to search through simulations of climatic conditions in the 20th and 21st Century and look for situations that are comparable to the present day. The team then used these climatic ""analogues"" to deduce future possibilities. In particular, the anomalous warmth predicted over the next few years is due to a low probability of intense cold climatic events. Once the algorithm is ""learned"" (a process which takes a few minutes), predictions are obtained in a few hundredths of a second on a laptop. In comparison, supercomputers require a week using traditional simulation methods. Gabi Hegerl, professor of climate system science at the University of Edinburgh, who was not involved with the study, said: ""The authors have tried to predict whether global climate variability will make the next years warmer or cooler overall than the mean warming trend. They have skilfully used worldwide climate model data for previous years to calculate probabilities for the next few years. ""The findings suggest it's more likely we'll get warmer years than expected in the next few years. ""But their method is purely statistical, so it's important to see what climate models predict based on everything we know about the atmosphere and the oceans. Those are more expensive to run but also use more climate physics and observational information. She added: ""These new predictions are not geared up at the moment to predict regional trends such as the hot summer this year; so they may predict how likely it is to have a global record warm year, but not a regional record summer like we've had in the UK."" For the moment, the method only yields an overall average, but scientists now would like to adapt it to make regional predictions and, in addition to temperatures, estimate rain and drought trends.

"Sean McAllister was creative director of the opening event of Hull UK City of Culture 2017 A director is defying film censors by letting under-15s watch his documentary for free in protest at its 15 rating. Sean McAllister is angry that the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) has made A Northern Soul a 15. The film follows Steve, who struggles to make ends meet as he tries to take his hip-hop bus to children in Hull. The BBFC said it was a 15 because there were too many swear words for a 12A, but McAllister said it had been judged on its ""raw depiction of poverty"". In response he's giving under-15s free tickets to screenings in Hull this week. ""An honest depiction of our times has somehow been censored, because the guy is far from offensive, he's far from aggressive in any way at all,"" the director told BBC News. ""He's an inspiration of hope, a gleam of light in dark times for kids who have very little."" A Northern Soul tells Steve's story during Hull's year as UK City of Culture In the film, Steve Arnott attempts to balance working in a warehouse with taking his Beats Bus to disadvantaged communities during Hull's year as UK City of Culture in 2017. The BBFC said it includes ""around 20 uses of strong language and therefore exceeds by some margin anything we have ever permitted at 12A"". But McAllister, who was nominated for a Bafta for his last film, A Syrian Love Story, argues that Steve's language is ""credible and real"" and ""culturally embedded within how he speaks"". The director had hoped to give free screenings in schools and community centres around the country. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""The whole point of this film was to outreach to poorer communities to give hope where there hasn't been hope for years because of austerity cuts,"" he said. ""Stamping a 15 just really limits that and takes all of that potential out of the film. ""My bigger objection is there's a feeling of a misunderstanding of the north, and how awfully class-based a society we are that there's someone in the ivory towers making judgements on how people are and how people speak. ""I really think it's the raw depiction of poverty that people find offensive. I think there's some depiction of raw, unrepentant poverty that they can't take on board, and I think it's down to that."" Steve juggled working in a warehouse with getting his Beats Bus off the ground The film can be screened to under-15s in Hull because councillors there gave it a 12A rating before the BBFC decided on its rating, and the council's decision overrides that of the national authority. The film will be screened as a 15in selected cinemas around the country,externalover the coming months and will be shown after the watershed on BBC Two later this year. The BBFC's guidelines say 12A films may include strong language, ""depending on the manner in which it is used, who is using the language, its frequency within the work as a whole and any special contextual justification"". In a statement, the BBFC said its usual policy for a 12A was ""to accept up to four uses of strong language (by which we mean the 'f' word) in films of normal feature length"". McAllister pointed to other examples, like The King's Speech, which includes a swear-filled scene and which was passed as a 12. The director's decision to give tickets to under-15s mirrors a similar move in the US, where the makers of Eighth Grade put on free screenings for all ages after it was given an R rating. Eighth Grade is an acclaimed comedy-drama written and directed by Bo Burnham about a girl in eighth grade, the school year for children aged 13 or 14. The US Classification and Rating Administration gave it an R rating - which stands for Restricted and means under-17s must be accompanied by an adult - ""for language and some sexual material"".

"The flight had been in the air for about an hour when the couple started arguing, the court heard A flight from Stansted to Gran Canaria had to be diverted to Portugal after a couple started arguing in mid-air, a court has heard. The Boeing 737, flying to Las Palmas, was diverted to Faro on 6 July 2017. Ronald St Ville, 53, and Pauline Gordon, 66, both of Stewart Road, Stratford, east London, have been charged with endangering the safety of an aircraft. The couple denied the charges at Chelmsford Crown Court. Prosecutor Peter Gair said the pair were flying together when an expletive-riddled argument started over a text message. A fellow passenger told the jury he heard the couple arguing and swearing intermittently for over an hour and thought they were drunk. The witness, a former policeman, said Mr St Ville had threatened to hit Ms Gordon in what he described as an ""argument between a domestic couple"". The court heard the cabin crew and pilot made the decision to land the Jet2 plane in Portugal and remove the couple after separating them. The trial continues.

The government held a meeting of its Cobra emergency committee and the prime minister has paid tribute to the ""formidable courage"" and professionalism of the emergency services who ""ran towards a dangerous situation in order to protect the public"". Urging the public to remain vigilant but ""carry on as normal"", Theresa May added: ""For the second time in as many years the home of our democracy, which is a potent symbol of our precious values of tolerance and freedom, has witnessed terrible scenes just yards from its door."" The suspect, who has not been formally identified, is being held at a south London police station and the vehicle is being searched. Sources say he is from the Birmingham area. Security Minister Ben Wallace told the BBC the suspect was British but originally from another country. The suspect, on the right of the image, can be seen being taken away by police Only the area around the scene of the crash remains sealed off A number of eyewitnesses have said the silver Ford Fiesta, which was travelling westbound in Parliament Square, appeared to deliberately hit members of the public as it swerved into the opposite lane. Footage released by the BBC shows the moment when the car then crosses over a traffic island in the middle of the road before crashing into the security barriers. A police officer can be seen jumping over another barrier to get out of the way. Police have released more details about the car's movements before the crash: The car travelled from Birmingham to London on Monday night, arriving in the capital just after midnight The vehicle was in the Tottenham Court Road area from approximately 01:25 BST until 05:55.

British Transport Police said it was increasing patrols in England, Scotland and Wales and that its officers would be ""highly visible on trains and at stations"". By Dominic Casciani, BBC News home affairs correspondent Security arrangements at Parliament have progressively tightened since 2001. In the aftermath of the 7/7 attacks, new truck bomb-proof barriers were installed in an effort to ""target harden"" Westminster. These include the reinforced low black rampart-like walls that surround Parliament itself and a highly visible armed police presence. Visitors need to go through a chicane-like system designed to help armed officers spot suspects. The one significant weak spot was the main vehicle gates - as became apparent in March 2017's one-man attack. That triggered an internal security review that has led to changes that remain secret - although it's apparent to Londoners that there are now more armed police than ever before patrolling the area. The threat of terrorism is a constant concern for Parliamentarians - it's not new. The IRA murdered Airey Neave MP in 1979 in a car bomb that exploded within the palace grounds. And the dilemma remains the same: how best to balance security with guaranteeing that the heart of British democracy remains open to the people.

Footage released by the BBC shows the moment when the car then crosses over a traffic island in the middle of the road before crashing into the security barriers. A police officer can be seen jumping over another barrier to get out of the way. This video can not be played Witness: ""I saw a man drive towards Parliament at speed"" Westminster Tube station was closed and streets around Millbank and Parliament Square cordoned off for several hours. The immediate area around the incident remains taped off and screened by white temporary fencing. Parliament is not currently sitting. British Transport Police said it was increasing patrols in England, Scotland and Wales and that its officers would be ""highly visible on trains and at stations"". The prime minister paid tribute to the ""formidable courage"" and professionalism of the emergency services who ""ran towards a dangerous situation in order to protect the public"". Urging the public to remain vigilant but ""carry on as normal"", Theresa May added: ""For the second time in as many years the home of our democracy, which is a potent symbol of our precious values of tolerance and freedom, has witnessed terrible scenes just yards from its door."" The Houses of Parliament are surrounded with security barriers of steel and concrete. The measures were extended in the wake of the Westminster Bridge attack in March 2017 when Khalid Masood ploughed a car into crowds on Westminster Bridge, killing four people. By Dominic Casciani, BBC News home affairs correspondent Security arrangements at Parliament have progressively tightened since 2001. In the aftermath of the 7/7 attacks, new truck bomb-proof barriers were installed in an effort to ""target harden"" Westminster. These include the reinforced low black rampart-like walls that surround Parliament itself and a highly visible armed police presence. Visitors need to go through a chicane-like system designed to help armed officers spot suspects. The one significant weak spot was the main vehicle gates - as became apparent in March 2017's one-man attack. That triggered an internal security review that has led to changes that remain secret - although it's apparent to Londoners that there are now more armed police than ever before patrolling the area. The threat of terrorism is a constant concern for Parliamentarians - it's not new. Irish republican paramilitaries murdered Airey Neave MP in 1979 in a car bomb that exploded within the palace grounds. And the dilemma remains the same: how best to balance security with guaranteeing that the heart of British democracy remains open to the people. The prime minister's official spokesman said as of the end June 2018 there were 676 live investigations into potential terrorist plots. He said since March 2017, 13 Islamist plots and four far-right plots had been foiled. Scotland Yard is asking anyone with information on Tuesday's crash to call 0800 789 321.

"Babies and young children in prams can be exposed to up to 60% more pollution than adults, a study suggests. Experts said infants were exposed to dirtier air in prams because they were lower to the ground and closer to exhaust pipes. They are also more at risk from the health dangers of dirty air because their bodies are small and developing. The study's authors said avoiding busy roads and using pram covers were ways to reduce pollution exposure. How bad is air pollution in the UK? Even low air pollution may damage heart Researchers at the Global Centre for Clean Air Research, at the University of Surrey, carrying out a review of existing evidence, found that the breathing height of infants in prams was between 0.55m and 0.85m (2ft) above ground level. Because pollution levels are greater within 1m of ground level, these infants are being exposed to up to 60% more fine particle air pollution than adults, the evidence indicates. Roadside pollution contains high levels of toxic metals, which have the potential to impair brain development in infants, the researchers said. Prof Prashant Kumar, one of the authors of the paper, said: ""When you also consider how vulnerable they are because of their tissues, immune systems, and brain development at this early stage of their life, it is extremely worrying that they are being exposed to these dangerous levels of pollution."" Experts say people should avoid pollution hotspots such as traffic lights The researchers said the amount of extra pollution babies in prams breathed in would be lower in areas with less traffic or where pollution was dispersed in other ways, such as with roadside hedges. The study did not look at whether some prams were better or worse for exposure to pollution. The authors called for more to be done to reduce air pollution or lessen its effects, such as lowering the emissions of road vehicles and encouraging greater use of public transport. In the meantime, Prof Kumar said, parents could reduce the risk to their babies and young children by using pram covers and avoiding pollution hotspots, such as busy roads, traffic lights and bus stops. He added: ""With the multitude of evidence we set out in this review, it is important that everyone across the country begins a full and frank conversation about pollution and the impact it has on our most vulnerable - from parents and community leaders, to government officials and industry."" Prof Jonathan Grigg, from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, who was not involved in the research, said the findings were a ""major concern"". ""To help protect children's health we must promote alternatives to cars fuelled by petrol and diesel,"" he added. The study was published in theEnvironment International journal,external.

"The rail industry should change how it calculates fare rises and staff wages to cut costs for passengers, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has said. He has asked train operators and unions to use a different, lower, inflation measure to set pay and fare increases. The RMT union said it opposed Mr Grayling's call - made hours before January's rail fare rise is announced. The shadow transport secretary said Mr Grayling ""had the power to enforce this, he's just choosing not to."" ""The truth is that our fragmented, privatised railway drives up costs and leaves passengers paying more for less,"" Andy McDonald added. Mick Cash, leader of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, said it would fight any attempt to impose a ""pay cap"" on its members in a drive to protect private train company profits. ""This is a basket-case government and a lame duck transport secretary continuing its all-out war on staff and passengers alike,"" he added. Fares are expected to go up by 3.5% at the start of the next year. The exact increase will be announced on Wednesday when official inflation figures - used to set the price increases - for July are published. Rail fares expected to rise 3.5% for 2019 Rail timetable changes for winter scaled back Economists are predicting that the Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure of inflation - the number used by the Department for Transport to set rail fare increases -  will increase by 3.5%. This year rail fares rose by 3.6% -the biggest jump for five years. Mr Grayling said he wanted to see ""lower levels of increases for passengers in future"". He has asked train operators and unions to use a different inflation measure, the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), to determine rail fare and wage increases. This is lower than the current tool used, the Retail Prices Index (RPI), which includes mortgage costs. Rail passengers have faced ongoing delays this year ""I support paying rail staff decent wages for the hard work they do, but I also now believe it is important that pay agreements also use CPI and not RPI in future,"" he said. Mr Grayling urged the rail companies' membership body the Rail Delivery Group to help the government move towards using CPI for future pay deals. He said the move would help the industry to ""keep costs down"". The letter was sent to all the rail unions, with a separate letter sent to Paul Plummer, the chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group, asking for his support. The TUC union earlier calculated that rail fares had risen over twice as fast as wages over the past decade. Wednesday's fare hike comes after a summer of chaos for many train customers,after a rail timetable overhaul saw scores of cancellations and delays.

"This video can not be played Parts of the bridge can be seen collapsing It is not yet clear what caused the collapse of the Morandi bridge in the Italian city of Genoa, but several explanations have been mooted. At least 39 people were killed when part of the bridge, and cars travelling along it, fell 45m (148ft). Structural engineers who spoke to the BBC said there were some clear avenues investigators should explore, but warned no firm conclusions could yet be reached. The Morandi bridge was completed in 1967, and normally a bridge is designed to last for at least 100 years. But Stergios Mitoulis, a senior lecturer at the University of Surrey specialising in bridge design, said some environmental factors may have caused this bridge to deteriorate early. ""One factor could be the proximity to the sea, and the second could be the fact that the bridge was in an industrial area, so the local pollutants could have led to an accelerated decline."" What we know so far In pictures: Deadly Italy bridge collapse Mr Mitoulis highlighted an area of concern in parts of the bridge that are still standing. Rust can be seen at the top of the tendons - the ""arms"" extending from the top of the bridge that sustain the weight of the road underneath. ""From what I have seen,"" he said, ""it is quite obvious that they have deteriorated. Failure of one of those components is like cutting off one's leg and then expecting to be able to sustain the same load on just one leg."" Italy's two deputy prime ministers have criticised motorway operator Autostrade per l'Italia, who were in charge of the bridge. ""Autostrade should have done maintenance and didn't do it,"" one of the ministers, Luigi Di Maio, said. But the company said it had been carrying out regular maintenance checks on the bridge and was satisfied by the results of ""companies and institutions which are world leaders in testing and inspections"". Restructuring work was also carried out on the bridge in 2016. ""A major bridge like this needs regular inspection and maintenance by qualified engineers. This bridge has had quite a lot of maintenance work,"" said Ian Firth, a former president of the UK-based Institution of Structural Engineers, and a structural engineer specialising in bridges. ""In the sad history of bridge collapses, maintenance has sometimes been a factor, if it is poorly planned or implemented."" In December 2012, Genoa's city council discussed the state of the bridge at a public hearing into how to expand the local transport infrastructure. An industry confederation official warned of the collapse of the Morandi bridge ""in 10 years"". Mr Mitoulis said it was very unusual to see only four tendons supporting the weight of the bridge's deck in each section, when any bridges being built in 2018 would have up to 10 times as many. The tendons on the Morandi bridge are also, unusually, made of reinforced concrete. The material contains steel, which rusts, and is prone to weakening over time. ""At that time, when the designer chose these tendons, he was not aware of its potential for failure,"" Mr Mitoulis said. Work on reinforcing the tendons with steel was carried out in the 1990s. Grief and anger in Italy Who were the victims? Antonio Brencich, a structural engineer who lectures at Genoa University, wrote in 2016 that  the designer, Riccardo Morandi, had miscalculated how reinforced concrete aged. ""He was an engineer with great insight, but lacking in practical calculations."" The bridge's ongoing maintenance costs meant it might have been more economical to rebuild it, he wrote. ""Right away, the bridge manifested various problems, beyond the construction costs, which went over budget. ""There are errors in this bridge,external. Sooner or later, it will have to be replaced. I don't know when,"" he warned. General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge on Lake Maracaibo in Venezuela was also designed by Riccardo Morandi The Morandi bridge is very similar to its much larger cousin, the Lake Maracaibo bridge in Venezuela, which was also designed by Mr Morandi. That bridge ""has also experienced problems during its life, so it could be that the design implies a need for a greater degree of maintenance than normal"", said Ian Firth. But he added: ""As yet, there is no evidence to say whether any impact occurred; it is too early to say what triggered the collapse."" The degradation may have also been compounded by heavy traffic on the bridge, over which about 25 million vehicles passed every year. It carries a major artery, the A10, that serves the Italian Riviera and links northern Italy to France. A 2011 report by Autostrade per l'Italia said heavy traffic had taken its toll on the bridge. The ""queues of cars and the volume of traffic provoke intense degradation of the bridge structure on a daily basis in rush hour, as it is subject to major demands"", the report, quoted by Italian news agency Ansa, said. ""The collapse could have been influenced by the consequences of increases in heavy traffic and the punishing treatment the motorway got. It was heavily used, there is no question about that,"" Mr Firth said. But the bridge may have also suffered from the marked drop in investment in the country's infrastructure, which lags behind other economies in western Europe. Engineering experts all agree that in the end, only a thorough specialist investigation will be able to determine the real causes of the collapse. The collapse took place during a storm and amid heavy winds. Separately, the motorway operator said work to shore up the bridge's foundation was being carried out at the time of the collapse, during which time it was being constantly monitored. Italy's government has ordered an investigation, but experts warn it is too soon to focus on any one cause. ""It's easy to understand what happened - we had a loss of support,"" Mr Mitoulis said. ""But it's hard to understand all the factors that led to that collapse.""

""I saw the road ahead of me give way and I found myself helpless inside my car,""Davide Capello told La Repubblica newspaper,external. ""I think I fell for about 30 metres and then incredibly the car stopped. Perhaps it bumped into something - it wasn't a violent jolt."" ""My colleagues say it was a miracle. The only consequence of this for me was that they inserted a needle into my arm as they were taking me to hospital."" An Italian journalist working for the La Repubblica newspaper, Matteo Pucciarelli, has shared images of the scene on social media.

The operator of the motorway says the collapse of the bridge was impossible to predict. Autostrade's Genoa area director told Reuters: ""The collapse was unexpected and unpredictable."" ""The bridge was constantly monitored, even more than was foreseen by the law,"" Stefano Marigliani said. ""There was no reason to consider the bridge dangerous,"" he added. BBC Reality Check investigates... Reality Check Italian Transport Minister Danilo Toninelli told state TV that the disaster revealed the dilapidated state of Italyâs
infrastructure and a lack of maintenance, saying that âthose responsible will
have to payâ. The new government has pledged to increase investment. Italy spent more than â¬14bn (Â£12.5bn; $16bn) on its roads in 2006, but that dropped to less than â¬4bn in 2010. The figures cover spending on new transport construction and the improvement of the existing networks. Spending started to increase in 2013, when total spend was less than Spain, Germany, France and the UK. One of the city's two professional football teams, Genoa FC, has cancelled its first-team training for the day as a result of the bridge collapse. Allow Twitter content?

homes under the segment of bridge no longer held up by any pillars
have been evacuated, as thereâs a risk it will collapse. Italy's fire brigade says at least 35 people are now confirmed dead. Civil Protection chief Angelo Borrelli, quoted by Ansa news agency, says 30-35 vehicles were crossing the bridge when it collapsed, as well as three large trucks.   ""I am deeply saddened by the huge disaster that occurred in Genoa and that has caused numerous deaths, several injuries and huge damage,"" the Archbishop of Genoa, Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco, has said. ""Our prayers are with those affected by the accident. Genoa will rise from the mourning and pain of this day and show its solidarity."" A huge rescue effort is under way Italy's state broadcaster, Rai News, says a man has been extracted alive from the rubble. He is the fourth person to be rescued alive. Matto Salvini has criticised spending limits in response to the bridge collapse Italy's Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini has said that the bridge collapse shows the country must put infrastructure spending before concerns over spending limits. Asked about the collapse by SkyTG24, Salvini said: ""We should ask ourselves whether respecting budget limits is more important than the safety of Italian citizens. Obviously for me it is not."" This is likely to be a reference to the EU -his party is strongly eurosceptic and rejects EU austerity. About 30 people died in the bridge collapse, Italy's deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini told reporters. Many more are badly injured, he said. Â© 2025 BBC.

"President Erdogan has accused the US of seeking to ""stab [Turkey] in the back"" Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said his country will boycott US electronic products, after Washington imposed punitive sanctions on Ankara. ""If [the US] has the iPhone, there's Samsung on the other side,"" Mr Erdogan said, referring to Apple and its South Korean competitor. The US doubled tariffs last week over Turkey's refusal to extradite a US pastor who is imprisoned there. Turkey's weakened currency, the lira, plunged by a full 20% in response. President Erdogan said Turkey was taking measures to stabilise the economy, and should not ""give in to the enemy"" by investing in foreign currencies. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who is visiting Ankara, branded the US sanctions an illegitimate policy at a news conference on Tuesday. He accused the US of seeking an unfair competitive advantage in global trade. Since January, the Turkish lira has lost more than 34% of its value against the dollar, pushing up the price of everyday items. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Erdogan has presided over soaring inflation and borrowing levels, but insists the lira's plight is the result of a ""campaign"" led by foreign powers. Is Turkey heading for an economic crisis? Turkey's lira slump explained In a televised speech on Friday, he called on Turkish citizens to exchange foreign currency and gold for lira, calling it an ""economic war"". Now it appears there may be a small respite for the flailing currency, which has gained slightly in value after days of dramatic falls. Turkey's central bank has promised to provide banks with liquidity. The country's finance minister - who is also Mr Erdogan's son-in-law - will seek to reassure around 1,000 international investors in a teleconference scheduled for Thursday. The BBC Turkey correspondent Mark Lowen says Mr Erdogan's boycott could stoke tensions with the US further - and Turks are waiting nervously for Mr Trump's response. President Erdogan has accused the US of trying to ""bring Turkey to its knees through threats over a pastor"". But the US insists Andrew Brunson, a long-time Turkish resident who ran the tiny Izmir Resurrection Church, is ""a victim of unfair and unjust detention"". US President Donald Trump has called pastor Andrew Brunson ""an innocent man of faith"" An evangelical from North Carolina, he has been held in Turkey for nearly two years over alleged links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party and the Gulenist movement, which Turkey blames for a failed coup in 2016. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the US had seen ""no evidence that Pastor Brunson has done anything wrong"". Mr Brunson has denied charges of espionage, but faces up to 35 years in jail if found guilty. The ruckus between Turkey and the US has impacted on other countries' currencies, including the Indian rupee, as investors fear the lira's wobbles could spread to developing nations. India's government urged people not to panic on Tuesday after the rupee slid to an all-time low against the dollar.

"Jeremy Corbyn was pictured at a wreath-laying ceremony in 2014 Jeremy Corbyn has refused to apologise for being present when a wreath was laid in memory of some of those accused of the 1972 Munich terror attack. The Labour leader has been criticised over the 2014 event in Tunis, with Israel's PM Benjamin Netanyahu saying he deserved ""unequivocal condemnation"". Mr Corbyn said he had attended to take part in a ceremony honouring innocent victims of a 1985 Israeli air strike. And he condemned the Munich attack, describing it as ""appalling"". Israeli PM attacks Corbyn in wreath row Recalling the 1972 Munich Olympics attack Mr Corbyn has faced fresh questions about the 2014 conference after the Daily Mailsaid he was,externalpictured with a wreath near memorials to members of the Black September organisation.

This video can not be played Corbyn asked about Tunisia wreath-laying criticism He said he had been present in Tunis at a conference ""to try and promote peace in the Middle East"". In a reference to the 1985 bombing of the Palestine Liberation Organisation headquarters in the Tunisian capital, he added: ""I remembered those that had died in an attack on Tunis by the Israeli air force which was condemned by the whole world."" He had ""witnessed many other people laying many wreaths"", he said, but his had been for victims of the 1985 bombing. ""There are other people in that cemetery, as are indeed in many other cemeteries around the world, but a wreath was laid in memory of those that died,"" he said. The Labour leader said he had attended the conference alongside people from other political parties and representatives from around the world. One of these was Tory peer Lord Sheikh, the founder of the Conservative Muslim Forum, who told the Press Association: ""If there was a wreath-laying ceremony I was not aware of the wreath-laying ceremony. I did not go to the ceremony."" Labour MP Luciana Berger had taken issue with the Labour leader's response on Monday when asked whether another wreath had been laid, and whether it honoured terrorists. Mr Corbyn had simply replied that a wreath ""was indeed laid"", adding: ""I was present when it was laid. I don't think I was actually involved in it."" Ms Berger tweeted: ""Being 'present' is the same as being involved. ""When I attend a memorial, my presence alone, whether I lay a wreath or not, demonstrates my association and support.

"Ryan O'Carroll was on a surfing trip to Cornwall when the accident happened A man has died after a tree fell on to his tent at a country park in Cornwall. Businessman Ryan O'Carroll, 25, from Southampton, had been camping while on a surfing holiday at Tehidy Country Park near Camborne when the tree fell at about 00:30 BST on Saturday. He sustained serious head injuries and was taken to Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, where he later died. He was staying with his wife and younger brother in a hammock tent suspended between trees. Mr O'Carroll's wife Stephanee Leal O'Carroll paid tribute to her husband on Instagram where she described him as ""very loved and admired by everyone"". Mr O'Carroll had been married to his wife for two years, his family said Mr O'Carroll's family released a statement through his company, Yo Telecom, which described him as ""determined, head strong and passionate about life"". His parents, Giselle and Jeff O'Carroll, said: ""He had built a successful telecoms business with his partner, Nathan. Employing close to 60 staff, including his brother Derek and sister Jess"". ""We are very proud that he was our son and what he achieved, his legacy will forever go on. ""He will be sorely missed and loved by us deeply,"" they said. Natalie Jupp, 37, was one of the first people to offer help after Mr O'Carroll had been injured. She said she was driving home in the early hours of Saturday morning when she saw a torchlight in the woods near the East Lodge of the park. ""There was a young boy flagging us down at the entrance to the woodlands,"" she said. Ms Jupp said two people were trapped in the tent when she and her family arrived at the scene. A tree fell on Mr O'Carroll's tent in the early hours of Saturday morning More stories from Cornwall They helped Mrs Leal O'Carroll escape from the tent and tried to move the tree from on top of Mr O'Carroll. Mrs Jupp and her 19-year-old son Daniel performed first aid on him before the emergency services attended. ""It was horrifying and a freak accident,"" she said. She said she believed the two people were staying in a hammock tent that was hanging 9ft (2.7m) high between three trees. Ryan O'Carroll's business partner Nathan Hanslip (right) described him as ""one of a kind"" Nathan Hanslip, Mr O'Carroll's business partner, said: ""Ryan was an inspirational best friend, brother and business partner.

"UK unemployment fell by 65,000 to 1.36 million in three months to June - the lowest for more than 40 years, official figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show. They also show a rise in productivity, but a slowdown in wage growth. Wages, excluding bonuses, grew by 2.7% in the three months to June, compared with a year ago. The ONS figures also showed the number of European Union nationals working in the UK fell by a record amount. The fall was the largest annual amount since records began in 1997. It continues a trend seen since the 2016 Brexit vote. That contrasted with a rise in the number of non-EU nationals working in the UK to 1.27 million - 74,000 more than a year earlier. The CBI said the size of the UK workforce was shrinking at the same time as vacancies for skills and labour were growing. Matthew Percival, CBI head of employment, said the government needed to guarantee that EU workers could continue to work even in a ""no-deal"" Brexit scenario. 'Economically inactive' The unemployment rate fell to 4% in the quarter to June. That was the lowest since February 1975 and better than the figure expected by economists. The drop came despite a smaller-than-expected 42,000 increase in the number of jobs created over the three-month period. On productivity, the ONS also said output per hour worked was up by 1.5% - the biggest rise since late 2016. The official figures also showed 104,000 people who were employed on ""zero-hours"" contracts, which do not guarantee a set number of hours per week, left such work. That left 780,000 people with those conditions as their main job. It also said the number of people aged 16 to 64 who were not working, looking for work or available to work - what is known as ""economically inactive"" - increased by 77,000 from the first quarter of the year. Andy Verity, economics correspondent Here's something economists have thought for decades that they know for sure: that if unemployment keeps getting lower, wages will improve. For years, the economy's been rudely ignoring the economists' theory, with wages sagging even as the unemployment rate hits fresh lows. But recently, reality's looked just a little more willing to conform to economic predictions. Pay rises (excluding bonuses) averaged 2.7% in the year to the end of June - higher than the official inflation number of 2.4% (but lower than the 3.4% rise in the old-style Retail Prices Index used to calculate rises in rail fares). Judging by the unemployment rate dropping to 4.0% - its lowest since February 1975 - that coincided with an apparently super-tight labour market, meaning lots of jobs available for fewer people to fill them. And there's a key factor making the labour market tighter: a net outflow of EU nationals working in the UK. In the second quarter of the year, the number of EU nationals was 2.28 million on the Office for National Statistics' estimates - down by 86,000. That's the biggest fall in 21 years. Earlier this month, the Bank of England raised interest rates for only the second time in 10 years, as it sought to manage inflation amid signs of a strengthening UK economy. However, Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said this now looked to have been a premature move. ""Achieving sustained increases in wage growth remains a key challenge, with sluggish productivity, underemployment and the myriad of high upfront business costs weighing down on pay settlements,"" he said. ""As such, there remains precious little sign that wage growth is set to take off - undermining a key assumption behind the Monetary Policy Committee's recent decision to raise rates.""

"This video can not be played Parts of the bridge can be seen collapsing A motorway bridge has collapsed in the northwest Italian city of Genoa, killing 26 people and badly injuring 15, police told the BBC. Dramatic video footage captured the moment of the disaster when one of the huge supporting towers crashed down during torrential rain. Cars and trucks plummeted 45m (148ft) on to rail tracks, buildings and a river along with slabs of concrete. Searches for people trapped in rubble are expected to go into the night. Fears that other parts of the bridge might fall have prompted the evacuation of buildings in the area, a rescuer told Italy's Ansa news agency. Injured people were winched to safety Interior Minister Matteo Salvini promised that anyone found to be responsible for the bridge collapse would be held to account. ""I have crossed that bridge hundreds of times,"" he said. ""Now, as an Italian citizen, I will do everything to get the names and surnames of the managers responsible, past and present, because it is unacceptable to die like that in Italy."" What could have made the bridge collapse? How the Genoa bridge disaster unfolded In pictures: Deadly Italy bridge collapse A representative of the motorway's operator, Autostrade, told Reuters news agency there had been ""no reason to consider the bridge was dangerous"". Shares in Atlantia, Autostrade's parent company which runs much of the country's motorways, fell 6.3% after news of the collapse. It fell around 11:30 local time (09:30 GMT) during heavy rain. Police reported a violent cloudburst. ""We saw lightning strike the bridge,"" eyewitness Pietro M all'Asa was quoted as saying by Ansa. ""And we saw the bridge going down."" Engineers say it is too early to determine the cause of the collapse but that lightning is unlikely to be the reason. Another witness, unnamed, recalled: ""We heard an incredible roar and first we thought it was thunder very close by. ""We live about 5km [three miles] from the bridge but we heard a crazy bang... We were very scared... Traffic went completely haywire and the city was paralysed."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Earlier, fire brigade sources told Ansa unofficially that 35 people were dead and 12 missing. A child is among the dead, said the head of the civil defence agency, Angelo Borrelli. Between 30 and 35 cars and three heavy vehicles were on the bridge at the time of the collapse, he said. ""We are continuing with the rescue operations because we think there are other people alive under the rubble,"" Genoa police spokesperson Alessandra Bucci told Reuters. ""We have extracted people from the rubble and now we are focusing on assisting the people, and later on we will understand what caused the collapse of the bridge."" The full horror of the collapse could be seen in aerial video of the scene. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Patrick Villardry, a French firefighter who came from Nice to help the rescue effort, told AFP news agency the task was huge. ""The first victims have been evacuated and now we have to search under the wreckage of buildings, but there are thousands of tonnes of concrete,"" he said. The Morandi Bridge, built in the 1960s, stands on the A10 toll motorway, which serves the Italian Riviera and southern coast of France. The missing section was dozens of metres in length, and ran across the span of the Polcevera river. The collapse of the bridge was an ""incident of vast proportions on a vital arterial road, not just for Genoa, but for the whole country"", said Mr Toti. ""The Morandi bridge connects three major ports in our country, used by tens, even hundreds of thousands of people. They depart from these ports on holiday. These docks receive most of our country's imported goods. It damages the very structure of the Italian logistics system. We are expecting a very fast response from the government."" Mr Borrelli said the authorities were trying to arrange help for those affected by the disaster, as well as setting up diversions for traffic. ""What we are carrying out at the moment is a search and rescue operation for the victims and the injured, to get the victims out and recover the injured,"" he said. ""Then we are obviously also trying to work out how to set up a viable route that is an alternative to the motorway, and also for entry and exit from the port."" ""It's not acceptable that such an important bridge... was not built to avoid this kind of collapse,"" Mr Rixi was quoted as saying by Reuters. However, Stefano Marigliani, the Autostrade official responsible for the Genoa area, told the agency that the bridge had been ""constantly monitored and supervised well beyond what the law required"". The highway operator said work to shore up its foundation was being carried out at the time of the collapse. Repair work on the bridge was carried out in 2016, Reuters reports. Major repairs also took place in the 1990s. A structural engineer who lectures at Genoa University, Antonio Brencich, warned in 2016 that there were problems with the bridge, Italian media report.

homes under the segment of bridge no longer held up by any pillars
have been evacuated, as thereâs a risk it will collapse. Italy's fire brigade says at least 35 people are now confirmed dead. Civil Protection chief Angelo Borrelli, quoted by Ansa news agency, says 30-35 vehicles were crossing the bridge when it collapsed, as well as three large trucks.   ""I am deeply saddened by the huge disaster that occurred in Genoa and that has caused numerous deaths, several injuries and huge damage,"" the Archbishop of Genoa, Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco, has said. ""Our prayers are with those affected by the accident. Genoa will rise from the mourning and pain of this day and show its solidarity."" A huge rescue effort is under way Italy's state broadcaster, Rai News, says a man has been extracted alive from the rubble. He is the fourth person to be rescued alive. Matto Salvini has criticised spending limits in response to the bridge collapse Italy's Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini has said that the bridge collapse shows the country must put infrastructure spending before concerns over spending limits. Asked about the collapse by SkyTG24, Salvini said: ""We should ask ourselves whether respecting budget limits is more important than the safety of Italian citizens. Obviously for me it is not."" This is likely to be a reference to the EU -his party is strongly eurosceptic and rejects EU austerity.

"This video can not be played Parts of the bridge can be seen collapsing A motorway bridge has collapsed in the northwest Italian city of Genoa, killing 26 people and badly injuring 15, police told the BBC. Dramatic video footage captured the moment of the disaster when one of the huge supporting towers crashed down during torrential rain. Cars and trucks plummeted 45m (148ft) on to rail tracks, buildings and a river along with slabs of concrete. Searches for people trapped in rubble are expected to go into the night. Fears that other parts of the bridge might fall have prompted the evacuation of buildings in the area, a rescuer told Italy's Ansa news agency. Injured people were winched to safety Interior Minister Matteo Salvini promised that anyone found to be responsible for the bridge collapse would be held to account. ""I have crossed that bridge hundreds of times,"" he said. ""Now, as an Italian citizen, I will do everything to get the names and surnames of the managers responsible, past and present, because it is unacceptable to die like that in Italy."" What could have made the bridge collapse? How the Genoa bridge disaster unfolded In pictures: Deadly Italy bridge collapse A representative of the motorway's operator, Autostrade, told Reuters news agency there had been ""no reason to consider the bridge was dangerous"". Shares in Atlantia, Autostrade's parent company which runs much of the country's motorways, fell 6.3% after news of the collapse. It fell around 11:30 local time (09:30 GMT) during heavy rain. Police reported a violent cloudburst. ""We saw lightning strike the bridge,"" eyewitness Pietro M all'Asa was quoted as saying by Ansa. ""And we saw the bridge going down."" Engineers say it is too early to determine the cause of the collapse but that lightning is unlikely to be the reason. Another witness, unnamed, recalled: ""We heard an incredible roar and first we thought it was thunder very close by. ""We live about 5km [three miles] from the bridge but we heard a crazy bang... We were very scared... Traffic went completely haywire and the city was paralysed."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Earlier, fire brigade sources told Ansa unofficially that 35 people were dead and 12 missing. A child is among the dead, said the head of the civil defence agency, Angelo Borrelli. Between 30 and 35 cars and three heavy vehicles were on the bridge at the time of the collapse, he said. ""We are continuing with the rescue operations because we think there are other people alive under the rubble,"" Genoa police spokesperson Alessandra Bucci told Reuters. ""We have extracted people from the rubble and now we are focusing on assisting the people, and later on we will understand what caused the collapse of the bridge.""

Patrick Villardry, a French firefighter who came from Nice to help the rescue effort, told AFP news agency the task was huge. ""The first victims have been evacuated and now we have to search under the wreckage of buildings, but there are thousands of tonnes of concrete,"" he said. The Morandi Bridge, built in the 1960s, stands on the A10 toll motorway, which serves the Italian Riviera and southern coast of France. The missing section was dozens of metres in length, and ran across the span of the Polcevera river. The collapse of the bridge was an ""incident of vast proportions on a vital arterial road, not just for Genoa, but for the whole country"", said Mr Toti. ""The Morandi bridge connects three major ports in our country, used by tens, even hundreds of thousands of people. They depart from these ports on holiday. These docks receive most of our country's imported goods. It damages the very structure of the Italian logistics system. We are expecting a very fast response from the government."" Mr Borrelli said the authorities were trying to arrange help for those affected by the disaster, as well as setting up diversions for traffic. ""What we are carrying out at the moment is a search and rescue operation for the victims and the injured, to get the victims out and recover the injured,"" he said. ""Then we are obviously also trying to work out how to set up a viable route that is an alternative to the motorway, and also for entry and exit from the port."" ""It's not acceptable that such an important bridge... was not built to avoid this kind of collapse,"" Mr Rixi was quoted as saying by Reuters. However, Stefano Marigliani, the Autostrade official responsible for the Genoa area, told the agency that the bridge had been ""constantly monitored and supervised well beyond what the law required"". The highway operator said work to shore up its foundation was being carried out at the time of the collapse. Repair work on the bridge was carried out in 2016, Reuters reports. Major repairs also took place in the 1990s. A structural engineer who lectures at Genoa University, Antonio Brencich, warned in 2016 that there were problems with the bridge, Italian media report. The bridge's designer, Riccardo Morandi (1902-1989) had miscalculated the ""viscous deformation"" - an ageing effect on reinforced concrete, Mr Brencich said.

"This video can not be played The car can be seen crashing into a barrier A man has been arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences after a car crashed outside the Houses of Parliament. The vehicle swerved into cyclists and pedestrians shortly after 07:30 BST, injuring three people. The 29-year-old suspect is not believed to be known to MI5 or counter-terrorism police, and is not co-operating with officers. Searches are taking place in Birmingham and Nottingham. Two people were treated in hospital for their injuries but discharged. Scotland Yard's head of counter terrorism Assistant CommissionerNeil Basu said,external: ""Given that this appears to be a deliberate act, the method and this being an iconic site, we are treating it as a terrorist incident."" He added there was ""no intelligence at this time of further danger"" to London or the UK as a whole. Westminster crash: As it happened What we know so far No-one else was in the car and no weapons have been found. The government held a meeting of its Cobra emergency committee and the prime minister has paid tribute to the ""formidable courage"" and professionalism of the emergency services who ""ran towards a dangerous situation in order to protect the public"". Urging the public to remain vigilant but ""carry on as normal"", Theresa May added: ""For the second time in as many years the home of our democracy, which is a potent symbol of our precious values of tolerance and freedom, has witnessed terrible scenes just yards from its door."" The suspect, who has not been formally identified, is being held at a south London police station and the vehicle is being searched. Sources say he is from the Birmingham area. Security Minister Ben Wallace told the BBC the suspect was British but originally from another country. The suspect, on the right of the image, can be seen being taken away by police Only the area around the scene of the crash remains sealed off A number of eyewitnesses have said the silver Ford Fiesta, which was travelling westbound in Parliament Square, appeared to deliberately hit members of the public as it swerved into the opposite lane. Footage released by the BBC shows the moment when the car then crosses over a traffic island in the middle of the road before crashing into the security barriers. A police officer can be seen jumping over another barrier to get out of the way. Police have released more details about the car's movements before the crash: The car travelled from Birmingham to London on Monday night, arriving in the capital just after midnight The vehicle was in the Tottenham Court Road area from approximately 01:25 BST until 05:55. It was then driven around the Westminster and Whitehall area from approximately 06:00 until the incident Cyclists were seen on the ground after the crash Westminster Tube station was closed for entry and exit, and streets around Millbank and Parliament Square cordoned off for several hours after the crash. The immediate area around the incident remains taped off and screened by white temporary fencing. Parliament is not currently sitting.

This video can not be played Witness: ""I saw a man drive towards Parliament at speed"" Barry Williams, a BBC member of staff based at Millbank, said: ""I heard lots of screams and turned round. ""The car went on to the wrong side of the road to where cyclists were waiting at lights and ploughed into them. ""Then it swerved back across the road and accelerated as fast as possible, and hit the barrier at full pelt. ""He hit it at such speed the car actually lifted off the ground and bounced. ""Then the police just jumped. Two officers managed to leap over the security barriers and then the armed police vehicles all sped towards the scene."" Another witness, called Kirsty, said: ""A car drove the wrong way round the road, drove through about 20 cyclists and crashed."" Jason Williams told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the driver had ""driven at speed - more than 40 mph"". He added: ""There was smoke coming out of the car... ""I saw at least 10 people lying down. I was told basically to move away, to run.  I have run for my life."" Eyewitness Ewalina Ochab took this picture shortly after the crash Ewalina Ochab, who also saw the crash, said: ""I think it looked intentional - the car drove at speed and towards the barriers."" She said: ""I was walking on the other side of the road. I heard some noise and someone screamed. I turned around and I saw a silver car driving very fast close to the railings, maybe even on the pavement."" This video can not be played Armed police responded after a vehicle crashed into security barriers The area around the Houses of Parliament was sealed off More than 10 police vehicles and at least three ambulances were at the scene outside Parliament - where firearms officers and police sniffer dogs searched the area. British Transport Police said it was increasing patrols in England, Scotland and Wales and that its officers would be ""highly visible on trains and at stations"". By Dominic Casciani, BBC News home affairs correspondent Security arrangements at Parliament have progressively tightened since 2001. In the aftermath of the 7/7 attacks, new truck bomb-proof barriers were installed in an effort to ""target harden"" Westminster. These include the reinforced low black rampart-like walls that surround Parliament itself and a highly visible armed police presence. Visitors need to go through a chicane-like system designed to help armed officers spot suspects. The one significant weak spot was the main vehicle gates - as became apparent in March 2017's one-man attack. That triggered an internal security review that has led to changes that remain secret - although it's apparent to Londoners that there are now more armed police than ever before patrolling the area. The threat of terrorism is a constant concern for Parliamentarians - it's not new. The IRA murdered Airey Neave MP in 1979 in a car bomb that exploded within the palace grounds. And the dilemma remains the same: how best to balance security with guaranteeing that the heart of British democracy remains open to the people. Home Secretary Sajid Javid expressed his gratitude to the emergency services. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

homes under the segment of bridge no longer held up by any pillars
have been evacuated, as thereâs a risk it will collapse. Italy's fire brigade says at least 35 people are now confirmed dead. Civil Protection chief Angelo Borrelli, quoted by Ansa news agency, says 30-35 vehicles were crossing the bridge when it collapsed, as well as three large trucks.   ""I am deeply saddened by the huge disaster that occurred in Genoa and that has caused numerous deaths, several injuries and huge damage,"" the Archbishop of Genoa, Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco, has said. ""Our prayers are with those affected by the accident. Genoa will rise from the mourning and pain of this day and show its solidarity."" A huge rescue effort is under way Italy's state broadcaster, Rai News, says a man has been extracted alive from the rubble. He is the fourth person to be rescued alive. Matto Salvini has criticised spending limits in response to the bridge collapse Italy's Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini has said that the bridge collapse shows the country must put infrastructure spending before concerns over spending limits. Asked about the collapse by SkyTG24, Salvini said: ""We should ask ourselves whether respecting budget limits is more important than the safety of Italian citizens. Obviously for me it is not."" This is likely to be a reference to the EU -his party is strongly eurosceptic and rejects EU austerity. About 30 people died in the bridge collapse, Italy's deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini told reporters. Many more are badly injured, he said. Â© 2025 BBC.

"UK unemployment fell by 65,000 to 1.36 million in three months to June - the lowest for more than 40 years, official figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show. They also show a rise in productivity, but a slowdown in wage growth. Wages, excluding bonuses, grew by 2.7% in the three months to June, compared with a year ago. The ONS figures also showed the number of European Union nationals working in the UK fell by a record amount. The fall was the largest annual amount since records began in 1997. It continues a trend seen since the 2016 Brexit vote. That contrasted with a rise in the number of non-EU nationals working in the UK to 1.27 million - 74,000 more than a year earlier. The CBI said the size of the UK workforce was shrinking at the same time as vacancies for skills and labour were growing. Matthew Percival, CBI head of employment, said the government needed to guarantee that EU workers could continue to work even in a ""no-deal"" Brexit scenario. 'Economically inactive' The unemployment rate fell to 4% in the quarter to June. That was the lowest since February 1975 and better than the figure expected by economists. The drop came despite a smaller-than-expected 42,000 increase in the number of jobs created over the three-month period. On productivity, the ONS also said output per hour worked was up by 1.5% - the biggest rise since late 2016. The official figures also showed 104,000 people who were employed on ""zero-hours"" contracts, which do not guarantee a set number of hours per week, left such work. That left 780,000 people with those conditions as their main job. It also said the number of people aged 16 to 64 who were not working, looking for work or available to work - what is known as ""economically inactive"" - increased by 77,000 from the first quarter of the year. Andy Verity, economics correspondent Here's something economists have thought for decades that they know for sure: that if unemployment keeps getting lower, wages will improve. For years, the economy's been rudely ignoring the economists' theory, with wages sagging even as the unemployment rate hits fresh lows. But recently, reality's looked just a little more willing to conform to economic predictions. Pay rises (excluding bonuses) averaged 2.7% in the year to the end of June - higher than the official inflation number of 2.4% (but lower than the 3.4% rise in the old-style Retail Prices Index used to calculate rises in rail fares). Judging by the unemployment rate dropping to 4.0% - its lowest since February 1975 - that coincided with an apparently super-tight labour market, meaning lots of jobs available for fewer people to fill them. And there's a key factor making the labour market tighter: a net outflow of EU nationals working in the UK. In the second quarter of the year, the number of EU nationals was 2.28 million on the Office for National Statistics' estimates - down by 86,000. That's the biggest fall in 21 years. Earlier this month, the Bank of England raised interest rates for only the second time in 10 years, as it sought to manage inflation amid signs of a strengthening UK economy. However, Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said this now looked to have been a premature move. ""Achieving sustained increases in wage growth remains a key challenge, with sluggish productivity, underemployment and the myriad of high upfront business costs weighing down on pay settlements,"" he said. ""As such, there remains precious little sign that wage growth is set to take off - undermining a key assumption behind the Monetary Policy Committee's recent decision to raise rates.""

"DIY retailer Homebase has announced plans to close 42 stores, putting up to 1,500 jobs at risk. Restructuring company Hilco, which bought the DIY chain for Â£1 in May, confirmed it was planning a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA). It bought the struggling chain from Australia's Wesfarmers after its disastrous foray into the UK market. The retailer, which has 241 stores, said the affected outlets would be shut over the next 16 months. Damian McGloughlin, chief executive of Homebase, said it had been a difficult decision: ""We need to continue to take decisive action to address the underperformance of the business and deal with the burden of our cost base, as well as to protect thousands of jobs."" Is your Homebase store closing? A total of 17 Homebase stores have already shut this year, while 303 jobs at its head office in Milton Keynes have been cut. A CVA is a controversial insolvency procedure used by struggling firms to close underperforming shops. Restructuring experts at Alvarez & Marsal will carry out the CVA, which will require the support of landlords. Property owners are left out of pocket by CVAs, although the British Property Federation (BPF) said that Alvarez & Marsal and Homebase had consulted with the landlords. CVAs have been adopted by a number of retailers including New Look, Carpetright and Mothercare in recent months. Stephanie Pollitt of the BPF said: ""These situations are never easy, as property owners need to take into consideration the impact on their investors, including those protecting pensioners' savings, as they vote on the CVA proposal. ""Ultimately, it will be for individual property owners to decide how they will vote on the CVA, but the proposal has sought to find a solution that provides a sustainable future for Homebase."" Dave Gill of Usdaw, a union representing Homebase staff, said he was seeking urgent clarification from Hilco about its plans. ""All too often, staff are excluded from the CVA process as the future of their jobs are being decided,"" he said. ""It is crucial that the company listens to the staff and invests in their experience and expertise to turn the business around and again make it a success."" Wesfarmers bought Homebase in 2016 for Â£340m and planned to rebrand the chain under its Bunnings brand. However, the Australian company admitted making a number of ""self-induced"" blunders, including underestimating winter demand for items such as heaters, as well as dropping popular kitchen and bathroom ranges. Catherine Shuttleworth of retail consultancy Savvy said Homebase was a business ""under attack from all sides"", with alienated customers finding ""good alternatives in B&M, supermarkets' own home sections, Wilko and others"". She added: ""This will go down in retail history as an example of needing to know the market - retailing is not necessarily globally portable. Chucking out the management was an ill-advised decision.""

"India's patent office has rejected a plea by a Canadian company to patent a vibrator because sex toys violate ""public order and morality"". Invoking India's obscenity law, the patent office said the law ""has never engaged positively with the notion of sexual pleasure"". The patent office said sex toys are considered to be obscene objects and are illegal in India. Buta 2011 court ruling,externalhad said sex toys could not be considered obscene. Can an orgasm a day keep my stress away? Designers shape sex toys of the future An Ontario-based company called Standard Innovation Corporation had applied for a patent in India for a new vibrator, to prevent generic local copycats being sold in the market, according to Shamnad Basheer, a visiting professor of law at India's National Law School who is working on a book about public health law. In April, the patents office rejected the plea, saying that sex toys lead ""to obscenity and moral deprivation of individuals"". ""These are toys that are not considered useful or productive. Mostly these are considered to be morally degrading by the law,"" the office said. ""The law views sex toys negatively and has never engaged positively with the notion of sexual pleasure"". The office also invoked the Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), a 155-year-old colonial-era law, which criminalises gay sex and unnatural intercourse, in refusing the patent. An appeal to strike down provisions of the law is currently pending before the Supreme Court. ""Why should the patents office handle moral decisions? Officials trained in technical science are not supposed to decide whether an invention is moral or immoral,"" Prof Basheer told the BBC. Sex toys are openly sold online, and in a thriving black market in India.

"Dozens of vehicles were set ablaze one after another in western Swedish cities Dozens of cars have been set alight in Sweden overnight, in what police say may be a co-ordinated criminal action. Up to 80 vehicles were badly damaged by gangs of black-clad youths, beginning at about 21:00 local time (19:00 GMT). Most of the damage took place in the western city of Gothenburg, but incidents were also reported in cities up to 100km (60 miles) away. Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said: ""It looks like very coordinated, almost like a military operation."" Cars were also damaged in Trollhattan to the north of Gothenburg, and Falkenberg to the south.

As far away as Stockholm, a handful of cars were also reported on fire - but the link between those and the widespread arson in western Sweden is not clear. The masked young people broke car windows before pouring flammable liquids inside, Swedish media said. They were also seen throwing stones at police officers. Despite the damage to property, there have been no reports of any injuries. Police said they had identified some young people who were in the area at the time and spoken to their parents - but officers could not say which, if any, were involved in the fires. Speaking to Swedish Radio, Prime Minister Lofven addressed the attackers, simply asking: ""What the hell are you doing?"" There is no clear motive for the widespread destruction, but the arson echoes the damage done duringriots in Stockholm over several nights in May 2013. Stockholm riots throw spotlight on Swedish inequality How Sweden is preparing for Russia to hack its election They followed the death of an elderly man who threatened police - vehicles were set alight in poor immigrant neighbourhoods, also by masked youths. The 2013 riots sparked a debate about immigration in some circles, and unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor in others. Sweden is firmly in election season ahead of September's polls, and immigration remains a key issue. Mr Lofven's government party, the Social Democrats, is facing the worst poll numbers in its history, to the benefit of anti-immigration party the Sweden Democrats.

"The Austrian capital, Vienna, has beaten Australia's Melbourne to be named the world's most liveable city. It's the first time a European city has topped the rankings of the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) annual survey. The worldwide league table ranks 140 cities on a range of factors, including political and social stability, crime, education and access to healthcare. In the survey, Manchester saw the biggest improvement of any European city, rising by 16 places to rank 35th. Manchester's rise puts it ahead of London in the rankings by 13 places, the widest gap between the two cities since the survey began two decades ago. The EIU said Manchester's jump in the rankings was due to an improved security score. The survey was criticised last year,externalfor demoting Manchester after the Manchester Arena attack which killed 22 victims. This year, survey editor Roxana Slavcheva said Manchester had ""shown resilience in the city's recovery from a recent, high-profile terrorist attack, which previously shook up stability"". Ms Slavcheva said security had also improved in ""several western European cities"" and Vienna's top place in the rankings reflected ""a relative return to stability across much of Europe"". It was also praised for its lack of petty crime, described as one of the safest cities in Europe. Melbourne had previously come top for seven years running According to the survey, nearly half of the cities have seen their liveability ranking improve over the past year. Melbourne, which was ranked second in this year's global rankings, had previously come top for seven years running. Two other Australian cities also made this year's top ten: Sydney and Adelaide. At the other end of the scale,  war-torn Damascus in Syria was ranked the least liveable city, closely followed by Dhaka in Bangladesh and Lagos in Nigeria. The EIU said that crime, civil unrest, terrorism or war played a ""strong role"" in the ten-lowest scoring cities. 1. Vienna, Austria 2. Melbourne, Australia 3. Osaka, Japan 4. Calgary, Canada 5.

"Just two of the Premier League's 20 top-flight clubs recorded a loss in 2017, compared to 18 of the 24 in the Championship More than half of Premier League clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal, BBC research has found. In 2016-17, during which clubs benefited from a record Â£8.3bn in global TV revenue, matchday income contributed less than 20p in every Â£1 earned by 18 top-flight outfits. The number of clubs that would have recorded pre-tax profits even if matchday income was taken away rose from two in 2015-16 to 11 in 2016-17. Dr Rob Wilson, a sport finance specialist at Sheffield Hallam University, said the previous Â£3.018bn broadcast deal struck in 2012 signalled a permanent change to top-flight football as a business in England. ""That is when the focus really went toward generating TV money rather than matchday ticket receipts,"" he told BBC Sport. ""The revenue structures of those clubs are fairly well there to stay now. ""When you get a Â£120m payout from the Premier League for kicking a ball around, you can play in an empty stadium if you need to. ""From a revenue generation perspective, clubs do not rely anymore on matchday ticket income."" Crystal Palace also would have made a profit of Â£1.21m - the list of Premier League clubs who could have made a pre-tax profit without matchday income in 2016-17 and the sum of those profits Bournemouth, with the smallest ground capacity in the Premier League of just 11,450 andwho intend to build a bigger stadium,had a turnover of almost Â£136.5m in 2016-17, with Â£5.2m from tickets. That is less than 4p in every Â£1 of its income for the season. So just how important is it to have fans coming through the turnstiles? ""I'd say they are the most important element,"" said Football Supporters' Federation chair Malcolm Clarke. Read more: 'Fans are the only ones that matter' ""Players and managers come and go, but we are always there. The reason that they can get lucrative TV deals is because the product shows the crowd, the noise, the away fans and the atmosphere - it is all part of it. ""On one level they don't need the fans because they have got so much money from broadcasters, but at another level they do need fans to keep an attractive product. ""How boring would it be to watch a Premier League game in an empty stadium?"" In a statement, the Premier League said clubs ""work hard to fill their stadiums"" through a number of ticketing offers, highlighting theÂ£30 cap on away ticketsintroduced at the start of the 2016-17 season. ""The high-quality football produced by clubs, combined with the commitment of fans, led to an extremely high stadium utilisation of 96% in the Premier League last season, and similar levels have been achieved for many consecutive years,"" the statement continued. Following relegation from the Premier League last season, Swansea and West Brom have reduced ticket prices. Their TV incomes have been slashed and replaced by the first instalment of parachute payments. Swansea will also continue to subsidise travelling members so they do not spend more than Â£20 for away tickets. Away tickets are not capped at Â£30 in the Championship, and Swans chief operating officer Chris Pearlman admits it ""may end up costing the club more"". ""We would be nothing without the fans,"" he said. ""The reality of the Premier League is that TV revenues have grown so significantly that it is disproportionate to not only every other league but also every other source of income within the Premier League. ""Having said that, a majority of that money is then invested back into the players."" Pearlman added matchdays also generate the ""greatest amount"" in merchandise sales, with in-stadium signage, local sponsorship deals and programme advertising all heavily dependant on fans attending games. Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish said supporters are ""the only ones that matter"". ""The people that support the team are the people who generate all the interest, the chatter around the club, the intrigue and the interest."" Tottenham, who are set to move into their new 62,062-seat stadium later this season, said they ""re-invest everything back into the club and community"" and emphasised how ""all revenue streams are interrelated"". Hull City vice-chairman Ehab Allam, whose family owns the club and hasa difficult relationship with supportersdespite overseeing their most successful era, said the fanbase is ""crucial"". Overall, ticket sales make up about a quarter of the average club's income, according to analysis of the 2016-17 accounts of 61 football clubs from England's top four divisions that provided a figure for ticket sales or similar income. Some relied on it far more than others. Leaving aside any loans or funding from owners, and not taking into account whether the club made a profit or a loss, Sheffield United were found to be most reliant on matchday income in three of the four seasons - between 2013-14 and 2016-17 - analysed by BBC Sport and BBC England's data unit. Read more: BBC's Price of Football 2017 The Blades made Â£7.9m from tickets out of a total revenue of Â£11.4m in their League One title-winning season of 2016-17, which was just under 70p in every Â£1. They were one of five clubs from England's third tier to feature in the top 10 list of clubs most reliant on fans, with BBC's Price of Football research in 2017 also showing that the division saw a fall in average matchday and season ticket prices. Average season ticket prices across English football's top flight were at their lowest levels since 2013, having fallen for the second consecutive year following a record Â£8.3bn global TV rights deal signed the previous season. The Championship's average lowest matchday ticket price had fallen from Â£22.11 to Â£20.58. However, the average cost of an away ticket remained the highest in any league in Britain. In League Two, the average cost of both the cheapest and most expensive season tickets rose. Clubs, however, need more than just ticket sales, sponsorship and broadcasting revenues to survive. Accounts show 20 clubs out of 66 spent more on their staff costs - which include everyone from players to office workers - than they made. For example, Bolton Wanderers - a club that has staved offthreats of administrationin recent years - spent Â£12.6m on staffing but made just Â£8.26m before tax and other costs. That is 153% of its turnover for the year. Wilson said stadium-going supporters remain ""the lifeblood"" of many clubs outside the Premier League. ""Clubs are acutely aware that they can get a tangible increase in their revenue by getting more money from matchday receipts, but they can also rely on a pretty solid and loyal fan base,"" he said. Clarke, of the FSF, added: ""To some extent supporters, especially those of the big old traditional clubs, buy into the fact that without Premier League TV money, tickets may be more expensive to help get them there. ""The lower down the leagues you go, the more ticket prices are important to the club. If they want to succeed they need to afford the players, therefore fans need to pay more. ""We believe that more money should trickle, or in fact waterfall down from the Premier League in a redistribution of that broadcast money. It's in the Premier League's best interests to keep the football pyramid healthy."" In a statement, the Premier League highlighted how lower league clubs, local communities and the wider economy, through the generation of more than Â£3bn in taxes, ""benefit"" from the money generated in the top-flight. ""There are many other benefits to having a financially healthy Premier League: significant support and investment is made in communities and schools - including working with 15,000 primary schools in to help them deliver PE, English and Maths -  and local sports facilities and the lower leagues,"" the statement said. The Premier League also point out that a number of clubs have either built new stadiums or made ""extensive"" ground developments in recent years. Kieran Maguire, a football finance expert at the University of Liverpool, said that the importance of ticket sales, while overshadowed by huge broadcast deals, remains significant at the top of the sport. Manchester United, recently ranked as the second most valuable sports franchise in the world bybusiness magazine Forbes,,externalbrought in more than Â£111.6m in matchday revenue. None of the Premier League's top five money makers - Manchester United, Manchester City, Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea - would have made a profit without matchday incomes being included. ""Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool have each expanded their ground capacity in recent years, and because they do not have benevolent owners in the same vein as Chelsea and Manchester City, matchday income is essential as a means of providing funding for investment in the playing squad in terms of both wages and transfer fees,"" Maguire said. ""When Liverpool expanded Anfield, a significant proportion of the new seats went to corporate partners and hospitality fans. ""This allows the club to increase its revenue per fan per match, which is an ever more important financial metric given that broadcast income is plateauing and corporate partnership deals are reaching saturation point."" Outside the Premier League, Maguire says relationships with fans are more precious. ""The reliance is different and it often means lower league clubs work harder on building up relationships with fans to ensure they don't become disenfranchised and vote with their feet,"" he said. Blackpool fans have held frequent protest marches against the club's owners, the Oyston family At Blackpool, they stay away in droves. Average attendances at Bloomfield Road dropped from more than 14,200 when they were in the Championship in 2013-14 to 3,456 in 2016-17, a season in which they won promotion from League Two having suffered back-to-back relegations. In that time, combined season ticket and gate receipts dropped from Â£2.77m to just Â£884,565. The long-running campaign against the club's owners, the Oyston family - described as a ""civil war"" by Andy Higgins, deputy chair of Blackpool Supporters' Trust - has intensified in recent years after some supporterswere suedfor comments made online. Some fans stay away, many march in protests and others even invade the pitch. There is also a 'Not A Penny More' initiative in which fans are encouraged not to spend money in the stadium. ""This is an example that the political side of football and power of the fans is still there,"" said Higgins. At Charlton, a section of fans are also boycotting matches in protest against owner Roland Duchatelet. Charlton and Coventry fans threw thousands of plastic pigs on the pitch in a joint protest that interrupted a League One match at The Valley in 2016 Addicks supporters have done everything from stage sit-ins, storm board meetings, flown to Duchatelet's hometown in Belgium to protest and thrown pig-shaped stress relievers on the pitch to make their point. ""The only thing we have now is to boycott,"" said Clive Harris, spokesman for a coalition group called Campaign Against Roland Duchatelet (CARD). In what Harris says has been an ""organic"" decline, attendances at The Valley have dropped from averages of more than 16,100 in 2013-14, when the club was in the Championship, to 11,162 in the 2016-17 season in League One. That has coincided with a fall in matchday revenue from Â£6.315m to Â£3.176m. Harris admits going after the club's bottom line ""is the ultimate card to play"", especially during a time ofcutbacks at the club,externalwhich has seen free breakfasts taken away from academy players. ""All Charlton fans want is to feel that they are part of something,"" he said. ""It almost begs the question of how successful you want a boycott to be. If none of us went, what would happen? It is a dangerous game.""

"Sean McAllister was creative director of the opening event of Hull UK City of Culture 2017 A director is defying film censors by letting under-15s watch his documentary for free in protest at its 15 rating. Sean McAllister is angry that the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) has made A Northern Soul a 15. The film follows Steve, who struggles to make ends meet as he tries to take his hip-hop bus to children in Hull. The BBFC said it was a 15 because there were too many swear words for a 12A, but McAllister said it had been judged on its ""raw depiction of poverty"". In response he's giving under-15s free tickets to screenings in Hull this week. ""An honest depiction of our times has somehow been censored, because the guy is far from offensive, he's far from aggressive in any way at all,"" the director told BBC News. ""He's an inspiration of hope, a gleam of light in dark times for kids who have very little."" A Northern Soul tells Steve's story during Hull's year as UK City of Culture In the film, Steve Arnott attempts to balance working in a warehouse with taking his Beats Bus to disadvantaged communities during Hull's year as UK City of Culture in 2017. The BBFC said it includes ""around 20 uses of strong language and therefore exceeds by some margin anything we have ever permitted at 12A"". But McAllister, who was nominated for a Bafta for his last film, A Syrian Love Story, argues that Steve's language is ""credible and real"" and ""culturally embedded within how he speaks"". The director had hoped to give free screenings in schools and community centres around the country. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""The whole point of this film was to outreach to poorer communities to give hope where there hasn't been hope for years because of austerity cuts,"" he said. ""Stamping a 15 just really limits that and takes all of that potential out of the film. ""My bigger objection is there's a feeling of a misunderstanding of the north, and how awfully class-based a society we are that there's someone in the ivory towers making judgements on how people are and how people speak. ""I really think it's the raw depiction of poverty that people find offensive. I think there's some depiction of raw, unrepentant poverty that they can't take on board, and I think it's down to that."" Steve juggled working in a warehouse with getting his Beats Bus off the ground The film can be screened to under-15s in Hull because councillors there gave it a 12A rating before the BBFC decided on its rating, and the council's decision overrides that of the national authority. The film will be screened as a 15in selected cinemas around the country,externalover the coming months and will be shown after the watershed on BBC Two later this year. The BBFC's guidelines say 12A films may include strong language, ""depending on the manner in which it is used, who is using the language, its frequency within the work as a whole and any special contextual justification"". In a statement, the BBFC said its usual policy for a 12A was ""to accept up to four uses of strong language (by which we mean the 'f' word) in films of normal feature length"". McAllister pointed to other examples, like The King's Speech, which includes a swear-filled scene and which was passed as a 12. The director's decision to give tickets to under-15s mirrors a similar move in the US, where the makers of Eighth Grade put on free screenings for all ages after it was given an R rating. Eighth Grade is an acclaimed comedy-drama written and directed by Bo Burnham about a girl in eighth grade, the school year for children aged 13 or 14. The US Classification and Rating Administration gave it an R rating - which stands for Restricted and means under-17s must be accompanied by an adult - ""for language and some sexual material"".

"Ofcom has fined Royal Mail a record Â£50m for breaching competition law. The fine is for its actions in 2014 when Whistl, which was then known as TNT, was trying to become its first competitor in wholesale mail delivery. The regulator's investigation, which followed a complaint by Whistl, said Royal Mail had abused its dominant market position and discriminated against the company. Whistl is seeking damages, but Royal Mail said it will challenge the fine. Ofcom's investigation found that Royal Mail price rises in 2014 meant any of its wholesale customers such as Whistl that wanted to compete with it would have to pay higher prices in the remaining areas where it used Royal Mail for delivery. Ofcom's investigation found that Royal Mail's actions amounted to ""anti-competitive discrimination against customers, such as Whistl, who sought to deliver bulk mail"". Royal Mail hit by shareholder revolt Moya Greene steps down Jonathan Oxley, Ofcom's competition director, said: ""Royal Mail broke the law by abusing its dominant position in bulk mail delivery. ""All companies must play by the rules. Royal Mail's behaviour was unacceptable, and it denied postal users the potential benefits that come from effective competition."" Royal Mail said it was ""very disappointed"" by Ofcom's decision and ""strongly refutes any suggestion"" that it had breached the Competition Act, adding: ""The decision is without merit and fundamentally flawed."" It said the price changes were designed to protect the Universal Service, which, unlike its competitors, it was required to continue providing. The Universal Service means post is charged at the same rate, regardless of where it is sent to across the UK. Royal Mail said Ofcom's chief role was to prevent rivals from picking off the profitable, usually urban, deliveries. A spokesperson for Whistl said it would review the Ofcom findings and determine the level of damages to seek from Royal Mail. ""Initial advice is that Royal Mail is potentially liable to pay compensation for the significant damage that was caused to Whistl's business, in addition to the fine imposed by Ofcom."" Royal Mail said there were major problems with Whistl's direct delivery business model and it did not believe potential claims for damages from the firm had any legal basis. ""No damages claims are payable until the appeals process is exhausted. We are confident that Ofcom's decision will be overturned,"" a spokesperson said. Analysts at Liberum said even if the fine was upheld, it would not affect Royal Mail's profits - but could limit its expansion. ""Although the fine itself is not material, and the competitor that brought the complaint has long since withdrawn from the market, we see broader potential implications. ""Importantly, we believe this is a reminder that Royal Mail must act with restraint given its dominant market shares in both letters and parcels, and this limits the group's ability to grow parcels revenue over the long term."" After rising in morning trading,Royal Mail shareswere down 1.4% to 455.7p in the afternoon, valuing the company at Â£4.6bn.

"Ben Stokes' defence barrister told the jury he had acted ""to defend himself or in defence of another"" The jury has retired to consider its verdicts in the trial of England cricketer Ben Stokes who is accused of knocking two men unconscious outside a nightclub. Mr Stokes, 27, and Ryan Ali, 28, have denied affray at Bristol Crown Court. Mr Stokes said he was acting in self-defence when he punched Mr Ali and Ryan Hale, 27, during the fracas in Bristol last year. But Mr Ali argued the cricketer needed restraining to protect Mr Hale. Both Mr Stokes and Ryan Ali have denied affray The fight took place several hours after England had played a one-day international against West Indies at the city's County Ground. During the six-day trial, the jury heard the Durham all-rounder was ""drunk and enraged"" after being refused entry back into Mbargo nightclub at 02:00 BST on 25 September. His defence barrister said this was ""complete nonsense"" Ben Stokes 'lied about self-defence' Ben Stokes 'not threatening or aggressive' Ben Stokes 'stepped in' to defend gay men Prosecutor Nicholas Corsellis told the court Mr Stokes had acted ""to defend himself or in defence of another"" when Mr Ali had a bottle in his hand, but then ""quickly turned aggressor"". Mr Ali's defence barrister Anna Midgley said there had been no evidence to show her client had suddenly lost it ""from a calm gentleman to a total personality change"". Mr Stokes, of Castle Eden, Durham, was arrested in the early hours along with emergency services worker Mr Ali, of Bristol, and Mr Hale, of Westbury-on-Trym, who was acquitted of the same charge last Thursday.

"This video can not be played Parts of the bridge can be seen collapsing A motorway bridge has collapsed in the northwest Italian city of Genoa, killing 26 people and badly injuring 15, police told the BBC. Dramatic video footage captured the moment of the disaster when one of the huge supporting towers crashed down during torrential rain. Cars and trucks plummeted 45m (148ft) on to rail tracks, buildings and a river along with slabs of concrete. Searches for people trapped in rubble are expected to go into the night. Fears that other parts of the bridge might fall have prompted the evacuation of buildings in the area, a rescuer told Italy's Ansa news agency. Injured people were winched to safety Interior Minister Matteo Salvini promised that anyone found to be responsible for the bridge collapse would be held to account. ""I have crossed that bridge hundreds of times,"" he said. ""Now, as an Italian citizen, I will do everything to get the names and surnames of the managers responsible, past and present, because it is unacceptable to die like that in Italy."" What could have made the bridge collapse? How the Genoa bridge disaster unfolded In pictures: Deadly Italy bridge collapse A representative of the motorway's operator, Autostrade, told Reuters news agency there had been ""no reason to consider the bridge was dangerous"". Shares in Atlantia, Autostrade's parent company which runs much of the country's motorways, fell 6.3% after news of the collapse. It fell around 11:30 local time (09:30 GMT) during heavy rain. Police reported a violent cloudburst. ""We saw lightning strike the bridge,"" eyewitness Pietro M all'Asa was quoted as saying by Ansa. ""And we saw the bridge going down."" Engineers say it is too early to determine the cause of the collapse but that lightning is unlikely to be the reason. Another witness, unnamed, recalled: ""We heard an incredible roar and first we thought it was thunder very close by. ""We live about 5km [three miles] from the bridge but we heard a crazy bang... We were very scared... Traffic went completely haywire and the city was paralysed."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Earlier, fire brigade sources told Ansa unofficially that 35 people were dead and 12 missing. A child is among the dead, said the head of the civil defence agency, Angelo Borrelli. Between 30 and 35 cars and three heavy vehicles were on the bridge at the time of the collapse, he said. ""We are continuing with the rescue operations because we think there are other people alive under the rubble,"" Genoa police spokesperson Alessandra Bucci told Reuters. ""We have extracted people from the rubble and now we are focusing on assisting the people, and later on we will understand what caused the collapse of the bridge."" The full horror of the collapse could be seen in aerial video of the scene. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Patrick Villardry, a French firefighter who came from Nice to help the rescue effort, told AFP news agency the task was huge. ""The first victims have been evacuated and now we have to search under the wreckage of buildings, but there are thousands of tonnes of concrete,"" he said. The Morandi Bridge, built in the 1960s, stands on the A10 toll motorway, which serves the Italian Riviera and southern coast of France. The missing section was dozens of metres in length, and ran across the span of the Polcevera river. The collapse of the bridge was an ""incident of vast proportions on a vital arterial road, not just for Genoa, but for the whole country"", said Mr Toti. ""The Morandi bridge connects three major ports in our country, used by tens, even hundreds of thousands of people. They depart from these ports on holiday. These docks receive most of our country's imported goods. It damages the very structure of the Italian logistics system. We are expecting a very fast response from the government."" Mr Borrelli said the authorities were trying to arrange help for those affected by the disaster, as well as setting up diversions for traffic. ""What we are carrying out at the moment is a search and rescue operation for the victims and the injured, to get the victims out and recover the injured,"" he said. ""Then we are obviously also trying to work out how to set up a viable route that is an alternative to the motorway, and also for entry and exit from the port."" ""It's not acceptable that such an important bridge... was not built to avoid this kind of collapse,"" Mr Rixi was quoted as saying by Reuters. However, Stefano Marigliani, the Autostrade official responsible for the Genoa area, told the agency that the bridge had been ""constantly monitored and supervised well beyond what the law required"". The highway operator said work to shore up its foundation was being carried out at the time of the collapse. Repair work on the bridge was carried out in 2016, Reuters reports. Major repairs also took place in the 1990s. A structural engineer who lectures at Genoa University, Antonio Brencich, warned in 2016 that there were problems with the bridge, Italian media report. The bridge's designer, Riccardo Morandi (1902-1989) had miscalculated the ""viscous deformation"" - an ageing effect on reinforced concrete, Mr Brencich said. ""He was an engineer with great insight but lacking in practical calculations,"" the lecturer said. Italy's recently installed government has pledged to increase public investment in infrastructure. The country spent more than â¬14bn (Â£12.5bn; $16bn) on its roads in 2006 but that had dropped to less than â¬4bn by 2010, according to data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The figures cover spending on new transport construction and the improvement of the existing networks. Spending started to increase in 2013, when total spend was less than Spain, Germany, France and the UK. French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted a message of sympathy to the people of Italy, writing in both Italian and French. He said France was ready to offer any necessary aid. Allow Twitter content?

"Ryan O'Carroll was on a surfing trip to Cornwall when the accident happened A man has died after a tree fell on to his tent at a country park in Cornwall. Businessman Ryan O'Carroll, 25, from Southampton, had been camping while on a surfing holiday at Tehidy Country Park near Camborne when the tree fell at about 00:30 BST on Saturday. He sustained serious head injuries and was taken to Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, where he later died. He was staying with his wife and younger brother in a hammock tent suspended between trees. Mr O'Carroll's wife Stephanee Leal O'Carroll paid tribute to her husband on Instagram where she described him as ""very loved and admired by everyone"". Mr O'Carroll had been married to his wife for two years, his family said Mr O'Carroll's family released a statement through his company, Yo Telecom, which described him as ""determined, head strong and passionate about life"". His parents, Giselle and Jeff O'Carroll, said: ""He had built a successful telecoms business with his partner, Nathan. Employing close to 60 staff, including his brother Derek and sister Jess"". ""We are very proud that he was our son and what he achieved, his legacy will forever go on. ""He will be sorely missed and loved by us deeply,"" they said. Natalie Jupp, 37, was one of the first people to offer help after Mr O'Carroll had been injured. She said she was driving home in the early hours of Saturday morning when she saw a torchlight in the woods near the East Lodge of the park. ""There was a young boy flagging us down at the entrance to the woodlands,"" she said. Ms Jupp said two people were trapped in the tent when she and her family arrived at the scene. A tree fell on Mr O'Carroll's tent in the early hours of Saturday morning More stories from Cornwall They helped Mrs Leal O'Carroll escape from the tent and tried to move the tree from on top of Mr O'Carroll. Mrs Jupp and her 19-year-old son Daniel performed first aid on him before the emergency services attended. ""It was horrifying and a freak accident,"" she said. She said she believed the two people were staying in a hammock tent that was hanging 9ft (2.7m) high between three trees. Ryan O'Carroll's business partner Nathan Hanslip (right) described him as ""one of a kind"" Nathan Hanslip, Mr O'Carroll's business partner, said: ""Ryan was an inspirational best friend, brother and business partner. ""He gave nothing less than 110% in any area of life, whether it was the business, surfing, snowboarding, reading or any of his many hobbies and interests he was extremely passionate about."" A Yo Telecom statement said: ""It is with great shock and pain that we announce that a pivotal member of our family has sadly passed away. ""He was one of the rare people in this world where when he spoke, you truly listened.""

"Vaping can damage vital immune system cells and may be more harmful than previously thought, a study suggests. Researchers found e-cigarette vapour disabled important immune cells in the lung and boosted inflammation. The researchers ""caution against the widely held opinion that e-cigarettes are safe"". However, Public Health England advises they are much less harmful than smoking and people should not hesitate to use them as an aid to giving up cigarettes. The small experimental study, led by Prof David Thickett, at the University of Birmingham, is published online in thejournal Thorax.,external Previous studies have focused on the chemical composition of e-cigarette liquid before it is vaped. In this study, the researchers devised a mechanical procedure to mimic vaping in the laboratory, using lung tissue samples provided by eight non-smokers. They found vapour caused inflammation and impaired the activity of alveolar macrophages, cells that remove potentially damaging dust particles, bacteria and allergens. They said some of the effects were similar to those seen in regular smokers and people with chronic lung disease. They caution the results are only in laboratory conditions and advise further research is needed to better understand the long-term health impact - the changes recorded took place only over 48 hours. An independent reviewof the latest evidence on e-cigarettes was published by Public Health England in February. The review concluded there was ""overwhelming evidence"" they were far safer than smoking and ""of negligible risk to bystanders"" and advised they should be available on prescription because of how successful they had been in helping people give up smoking. E-cigarettes 'should be on prescription' Vaping - the rise in five charts Prof Thickett said while e-cigarettes were safer than traditional cigarettes, they may still be harmful in the long-term as research was in its infancy. ""In terms of cancer causing molecules in cigarette smoke, as opposed to cigarette vapour, there are certainly reduced numbers of carcinogens,"" he said. ""They are safer in terms of cancer risk - but if you vape for 20 or 30 years and this can cause COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease], then that's something we need to know about. ""I don't believe e-cigarettes are more harmful than ordinary cigarettes - but we should have a cautious scepticism that they are as safe as we are being led to believe."" Martin Dockrell, tobacco control lead at Public Health England, said: ""E-cigarettes are not 100% risk-free but they are clearly much less harmful than smoking. ""Any smoker considering e-cigarettes should switch completely without delay."" How many people vape?

"Ofcom has fined Royal Mail a record Â£50m for breaching competition law. The fine is for its actions in 2014 when Whistl, which was then known as TNT, was trying to become its first competitor in wholesale mail delivery. The regulator's investigation, which followed a complaint by Whistl, said Royal Mail had abused its dominant market position and discriminated against the company. Whistl is seeking damages, but Royal Mail said it will challenge the fine. Ofcom's investigation found that Royal Mail price rises in 2014 meant any of its wholesale customers such as Whistl that wanted to compete with it would have to pay higher prices in the remaining areas where it used Royal Mail for delivery. Ofcom's investigation found that Royal Mail's actions amounted to ""anti-competitive discrimination against customers, such as Whistl, who sought to deliver bulk mail"". Royal Mail hit by shareholder revolt Moya Greene steps down Jonathan Oxley, Ofcom's competition director, said: ""Royal Mail broke the law by abusing its dominant position in bulk mail delivery. ""All companies must play by the rules. Royal Mail's behaviour was unacceptable, and it denied postal users the potential benefits that come from effective competition."" Royal Mail said it was ""very disappointed"" by Ofcom's decision and ""strongly refutes any suggestion"" that it had breached the Competition Act, adding: ""The decision is without merit and fundamentally flawed."" It said the price changes were designed to protect the Universal Service, which, unlike its competitors, it was required to continue providing. The Universal Service means post is charged at the same rate, regardless of where it is sent to across the UK. Royal Mail said Ofcom's chief role was to prevent rivals from picking off the profitable, usually urban, deliveries. A spokesperson for Whistl said it would review the Ofcom findings and determine the level of damages to seek from Royal Mail. ""Initial advice is that Royal Mail is potentially liable to pay compensation for the significant damage that was caused to Whistl's business, in addition to the fine imposed by Ofcom."" Royal Mail said there were major problems with Whistl's direct delivery business model and it did not believe potential claims for damages from the firm had any legal basis. ""No damages claims are payable until the appeals process is exhausted. We are confident that Ofcom's decision will be overturned,"" a spokesperson said. Analysts at Liberum said even if the fine was upheld, it would not affect Royal Mail's profits - but could limit its expansion. ""Although the fine itself is not material, and the competitor that brought the complaint has long since withdrawn from the market, we see broader potential implications. ""Importantly, we believe this is a reminder that Royal Mail must act with restraint given its dominant market shares in both letters and parcels, and this limits the group's ability to grow parcels revenue over the long term."" After rising in morning trading,Royal Mail shareswere down 1.4% to 455.7p in the afternoon, valuing the company at Â£4.6bn.

"The Austrian capital, Vienna, has beaten Australia's Melbourne to be named the world's most liveable city. It's the first time a European city has topped the rankings of the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) annual survey. The worldwide league table ranks 140 cities on a range of factors, including political and social stability, crime, education and access to healthcare. In the survey, Manchester saw the biggest improvement of any European city, rising by 16 places to rank 35th. Manchester's rise puts it ahead of London in the rankings by 13 places, the widest gap between the two cities since the survey began two decades ago. The EIU said Manchester's jump in the rankings was due to an improved security score. The survey was criticised last year,externalfor demoting Manchester after the Manchester Arena attack which killed 22 victims. This year, survey editor Roxana Slavcheva said Manchester had ""shown resilience in the city's recovery from a recent, high-profile terrorist attack, which previously shook up stability"". Ms Slavcheva said security had also improved in ""several western European cities"" and Vienna's top place in the rankings reflected ""a relative return to stability across much of Europe"". It was also praised for its lack of petty crime, described as one of the safest cities in Europe. Melbourne had previously come top for seven years running According to the survey, nearly half of the cities have seen their liveability ranking improve over the past year. Melbourne, which was ranked second in this year's global rankings, had previously come top for seven years running. Two other Australian cities also made this year's top ten: Sydney and Adelaide. At the other end of the scale,  war-torn Damascus in Syria was ranked the least liveable city, closely followed by Dhaka in Bangladesh and Lagos in Nigeria. The EIU said that crime, civil unrest, terrorism or war played a ""strong role"" in the ten-lowest scoring cities. 1. Vienna, Austria 2. Melbourne, Australia 3. Osaka, Japan 4. Calgary, Canada 5. Sydney, Australia 6. Vancouver, Canada 7. Tokyo, Japan 8. Toronto, Canada 9. Copenhagen, Denmark 10. Adelaide, Australia 1. Damascus, Syria 2. Dhaka, Bangladesh 3. Lagos, Nigeria 4.

"Giving tenants greater support so they can hold their landlords to account is being considered as part of government proposals on social housing in England. The measures include speeding up the complaints process and publishing league tables to highlight the performance of landlords. The Green Paper also pledges a scheme to offer tenants the right to buy 1% of their home each year. Labour said the ""pitiful"" plans made no promise to fund more affordable homes. The plans are part of a ""fundamental rethink"" on social housing following the Grenfell tragedy.

Green Papers are government documents which set out policy ideas and enable ministers to consult on the suggestions. Plans include introducing landlord ratings to hold bad practice to account, and providing the regulator with ""sharper teeth"" to intervene on issues that matter most to tenants.

This video can not be played What is social housing and why do we have it? The government has also unveiled a separate consultation into how councils spend the money from Right to Buy sales, as it looks to increase the number of local authority homes.

""Regardless of whether you own your home or rent, residents deserve security, dignity and the opportunities to build a better life."" Official figures, highlighted by housing charity Shelter, showed that1.15 million households were on social housing waiting listsin England last year. Of the 290,000 homes that became available in 2017, fewer than 14,000 were newly-built homes.

The memoirs of Nick Clegg, David Cameron's deputy prime minister, reveal that a very senior government figure asked why would we spend money on social housing - it just breeds Labour voters. Under the Cameron government, the amount of new social housing started, dwindled to almost nothing. Then we had the tragedy of Grenfell. That fire changed the politics overnight. Theresa May said: ""For too long in our country, we simply haven't given enough attention to social housing"", and ""let the legacy of this awful tragedy be that we resolve never to forget these people and instead to gear our policies and our thinking towards making their lives better and bringing them into the political process"".

It does say that one of the principles of the Green Paper and core priorities for the government is that we should be ""building the social homes that we need"". But there is little about how that might be done or how it might be paid for.  And there will be disappointment in the housing sector that this ""once in a generation"" report has so little to say about the central question of supply. There were fewer than 6,000 social homes completed in England in the last year.  Experts say we require between 70,000 and 90,000 every year to meet the need.

"The rainbow trout has been labelled as the true victim of the move If you think there's something fishy about the salmon you're eating, that could be because it's not salmon. New rules introduced in China mean rainbow trout can now be labelled and sold domestically as salmon. Why? Because a media report earlier this year caused a splash by revealing that rainbow trout had for years been labelled as the similar-looking fish. Authorities decided that instead of banning the practice, the best solution would be to legitimise it. Rainbow trout are freshwater fish whereas salmon are born in freshwater but then live much of their lives in saltwater. The two species are outwardly different, but inside, both have reddish meat and closely resemble each other. They're so similar that in May, state media outlet CCTV revealed that a third of fish that had been sold as salmon in China was in fact rainbow trout from Qinghai province. There was a furious backlash from consumers in China, particularly over fears that trout is more susceptible to parasites. The China Aquatic Products Processing and Marketing Alliance has now announced in a ruling,externalthat to standardise the industry, salmon was now considered to be the ""umbrella name of the salmonidae fish"". That's a scientific category which includes trout as well as other similar fish. The ruling has got people complaining that they've been misled, but there's also a degree of sympathy for the reassigned rainbow trout. #RainbowTroutBecomesSalmon has been trending on social media platform Weibo. The rainbow trout fillet does look remarkably similar to a salmon fillet ""The trout must be confused. After so many years its identity has suddenly been changed to a salmon,"" said one person on Weibo. Many have their own suggestions for what could be re-labelled next. ""Can we label seas and lake as the same thing? They are technically the same,"" said one social media user. ""Let's label the crayfish a lobster instead,"" another said. ""If industry standards are determined by the manufacturers, can students mark their own test scores?"" one asked. Some consumers also voiced their fears about parasites again, and whether it was safe to eat salmon raw, as is common in China. However, according to the China Fisheries Association, domestic rainbow trout are bred in safe and quarantined conditions so there's no need to worry. ""Whether salmon has parasites does not depend on whether it is bred in sea water or fresh water,"" it said. How to get rich tossing fish at Chinese New Year.

"DIY retailer Homebase has announced plans to close 42 stores, putting up to 1,500 jobs at risk. Restructuring company Hilco, which bought the DIY chain for Â£1 in May, confirmed it was planning a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA). It bought the struggling chain from Australia's Wesfarmers after its disastrous foray into the UK market. The retailer, which has 241 stores, said the affected outlets would be shut over the next 16 months. Damian McGloughlin, chief executive of Homebase, said it had been a difficult decision: ""We need to continue to take decisive action to address the underperformance of the business and deal with the burden of our cost base, as well as to protect thousands of jobs."" Is your Homebase store closing? A total of 17 Homebase stores have already shut this year, while 303 jobs at its head office in Milton Keynes have been cut. A CVA is a controversial insolvency procedure used by struggling firms to close underperforming shops. Restructuring experts at Alvarez & Marsal will carry out the CVA, which will require the support of landlords. Property owners are left out of pocket by CVAs, although the British Property Federation (BPF) said that Alvarez & Marsal and Homebase had consulted with the landlords. CVAs have been adopted by a number of retailers including New Look, Carpetright and Mothercare in recent months. Stephanie Pollitt of the BPF said: ""These situations are never easy, as property owners need to take into consideration the impact on their investors, including those protecting pensioners' savings, as they vote on the CVA proposal. ""Ultimately, it will be for individual property owners to decide how they will vote on the CVA, but the proposal has sought to find a solution that provides a sustainable future for Homebase."" Dave Gill of Usdaw, a union representing Homebase staff, said he was seeking urgent clarification from Hilco about its plans. ""All too often, staff are excluded from the CVA process as the future of their jobs are being decided,"" he said. ""It is crucial that the company listens to the staff and invests in their experience and expertise to turn the business around and again make it a success."" Wesfarmers bought Homebase in 2016 for Â£340m and planned to rebrand the chain under its Bunnings brand. However, the Australian company admitted making a number of ""self-induced"" blunders, including underestimating winter demand for items such as heaters, as well as dropping popular kitchen and bathroom ranges. Catherine Shuttleworth of retail consultancy Savvy said Homebase was a business ""under attack from all sides"", with alienated customers finding ""good alternatives in B&M, supermarkets' own home sections, Wilko and others"". She added: ""This will go down in retail history as an example of needing to know the market - retailing is not necessarily globally portable.

"At 07:37 BST a silver Ford Fiesta hatchbackcrashed into barriers outside Parliament in central London. Three people were injured and the driver of the car was detained by officers at the scene. Eyewitnesses have said the car appeared to deliberately hit members of the public. This video can not be played The car can be seen crashing into a barrier A 29-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of terror offences and is being held at a south London police station. He was subsequently also arrested for attempted murder. He has been named by government sources as Salih Khater, a British citizen originally from Sudan. Police have been searching three addresses in Birmingham and Nottingham as part of their investigation. Labour's Roger Godsiff, MP for Birmingham Hall Green,tweeted,externalthat the driver was ""believed to have been living in my constituency"". The suspect is not believed to have been known to MI5 or counter-terrorism police, but is understood to have been known to local police. He did not co-operate with officers after his arrest, Scotland Yard said. There was nobody else in the vehicle and no weapons have so far been found. The suspect, in black jacket and white shirt, was led away by police A man and a woman were treated in hospital for serious injuries but have since been discharged. A third patient was treated for minor injuries at the scene. The crash occurred in central London outside the Palace of Westminster. Parliament is not currently sitting. An eyewitness said the vehicle was travelling westbound when it swerved into eastbound traffic. Police are treating the situation as a terrorist incident and the Met's Counter-Terrorism Command is leading the investigation. More than 10 police vehicles and at least three ambulances were at the scene outside Parliament - where firearms officers and police sniffer dogs searched the area. Officers have concluded searches of two properties in Birmingham and one in Nottingham, and are currently searching a third address in Birmingham. Police have released more details about the car's movements before the crash: The car travelled from Birmingham to London on Monday night, arriving in the capital just after midnight The vehicle was in the Tottenham Court Road area from approximately 01:25 BST until 05:55. It was then driven around the Westminster and Whitehall area from approximately 06:00 until the incident Scotland Yard's head of counter terrorism Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said there was ""no intelligence at this time of further danger"" to London or the UK as a whole connected to this incident. Barry Williams, a BBC staff member based at Millbank, said the car drove onto the wrong side of the road and ""ploughed"" into cyclists waiting at the lights. ""Then it swerved back across the road and accelerated as fast as possible, and hit the barrier at full pelt,"" he said. Jason Williams told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme the driver had ""driven at speed - more than 40 mph"". He said: ""I saw at least 10 people lying down. I was told basically to move away, to run."" ""It looked deliberate... it didn't look like an accident,"" he added. This video can not be played Witness: ""I saw a man drive towards Parliament at speed"" Ewalina Ochab, who also saw the crash, said: ""It looked intentional - the car drove at speed and towards the barriers."" She said: ""I was walking on the other side of the road. I heard some noise and someone screamed. I turned around and I saw a silver car driving very fast close to the railings, maybe even on the pavement."" The vehicle did not appear to have a front registration plate when it crashed, she added. The government held a meeting of its Cobra emergency committee on Tuesday afternoon. The prime minister paid tribute to the ""formidable courage"" and professionalism of the emergency services who ""ran towards a dangerous situation in order to protect the public"". Urging the public to remain vigilant but ""carry on as normal"", Theresa May added: ""For the second time in as many years the home of our democracy, which is a potent symbol of our precious values of tolerance and freedom, has witnessed terrible scenes just yards from its door."" Mayor of London Sadiq Khan thanked those who responded first at the scene and said he was in close contact with the Met Police. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his thoughts were with those hurt. Praising the emergency services, he said: ""Their bravery keeps us safe day in, day out."" US President Donald Trump tweeted: ""Another terrorist attack in London... These animals are crazy and must be dealt with through toughness and strength!"" BBC News home affairs correspondent June Kelly said: ""The police will be looking at this man's background, his identity.

" Harry Uzoka was a successful model - a hard line of work to stay in.Fashions, for faces as well as clothes, change quickly. But Harry had lasted the best part of a decade. He had been booked for jobs that black male models had struggled to get in the past. At 25, he knew he’d had a good run and made a good living, but he was starting to explore the idea of doing something else - writing a film and launching a magazine that would celebrate black excellence. Life was good. His girlfriend Ruby Campbell was also a model. They had flown to St Lucia for Christmas, the first truly big holiday he’d ever had. He was building a house for his mother, Josephine, in her home country Nigeria - where she planned to return. But on Thursday 11 January 2018 all this ended. Harry lay on the pavement, his body punctured with knife wounds. One was to the heart and the paramedics and doctors couldn’t save him. At 17:00, on the cold concrete outside his home in Shepherds Bush in west London, he was declared dead. A confrontation with another male model - lasting just a couple of minutes - had taken everything. I never got to meet Harry, but I knew about him - we moved in some of the same circles. Like me, he was born in London into a Nigerian family. He lived with his mother and his older brother Edmond in Dagenham, where there’s a large Nigerian community. During the 2000s many African families relocated from south London and headed further out, often east. They were looking for cheaper housing, better schools and the hope of peace and quiet. Many found that on the edges of Essex. By the 2011 Census, the black African population in Barking and Dagenham had nearly doubled in a decade. Take a walk down Dagenham’s Heathway - one of the main roads - and you’ll see a black church, a Nigerian restaurant and some African and Caribbean hair shops. The UK seemed to offer new opportunities to our parents, many of whom arrived in the country highly skilled. Most Nigerian households tend to uphold strong cultural values. We were to work hard, “face our books” and fear God. Making our parents proud was key. The importance of being educated and successful was instilled in us from a young age. Growing up, Harry’s passion was football. He attended All Saints Catholic school in Dagenham, where according to childhood friend Jeremie Thompson, he was smart, “a whiz-kid - really good at maths”. When I first heard about Harry, he was still a teenager - but he had already broken through as one of the country’s most promising young black male models. One of my best friends had hosted a photo shoot at her house, and Harry was the model. He was shooting with Leomie Anderson, another young black model from London, who had turned heads on Channel 4’s The Model Agency show. She was also his girlfriend. The pair were barely 18, but for many young black men and women, they were starting to look like a power couple. They’d achieved something already - they’d used their good looks and their determination. In their shoots together, they seemed playful, confident and in love. It was refreshing to see a successful young dark-skinned man celebrating a young dark-skinned woman. When I was growing up, there didn’t seem to be that many young black role models around. So just seeing Harry Uzoka’s face in London’s West End on a big advertising board at Oxford Circus would be enough to stir up a sense of pride. There was just something about him. “Inspirational” is a word that’s been used time and time again to describe him by stylists, agents, photographers and other models. He was fun, oozed personality, was eager to learn and easy to be around, according to his friends. Kevin Morosky, a photographer and filmmaker,shot Harry in one of his first editorials. Harry became “the go-to guy”, he says. “He had a massive impact on the way the fashion industry cast dark-skin boys.” But there were challenges. With his friends Jeremy Boateng and Chuck Achike, Harry helped start a collective of young black models, with the aim of supporting each other in getting ahead. “It was all made up of black boys, black models. In the industry we were sort of blocked,” says Jeremy Boateng. Those in the group felt they only got put up for certain jobs. “Right now for the black models in the industry things are very different, but at the time no-one was doing like the Pradas, we were doing like the JD [Sports] or the River Islands. Not high-end ones. “It wasn’t really common to see a lot of black models doing that, especially boys.” Harry - known as “H” to his friends - radiated infectious positive energy. “He changed a lot of those really young mindsets that I feel a lot of black people have, where it’s like you can’t show love to your bro,” says Jeremy. “He was always that encouragement, like you can do anything. “He used to come to me and be like, ‘J, you can do it - I know you, you can do it.’ “You don’t really get that among your black brothers. A lot of it is just competition.” Harry was driven to help others improve themselves - but at one time he had had to turn his own life around. In 2008 he was sentenced to four years in a young offenders institution for his part in a robbery. He served two years of that sentence. Childhood friend, Jeremie Thompson, was convicted alongside him. “We were kids. We looked like kids,” he says. “It was just mixing with the wrong people. They’re not putting the legit ways of having money - it’s just whatever you can do to get it. We fell in to that.” The pair knew they had done wrong and, as soon as they were inside, Harry’s friend says they were making plans to do something positive once they got out. “People could just tell we didn’t come across like gang members or anything like that. We always spoke about coming out and going into something big.” Inside, Harry spent a lot of time reflecting and reading - particularly books about spirituality, according to his friend. “He got that from his brother. Ed was always talking about things to do with the mind and how powerful your mind is.” Jeremie now works in marketing for a sportswear firm. He knows the impact his friend had on his future. As soon as Harry was released he started changing his life. He enrolled at college. The next step would probably have been university. But one day his brother Edmond - a model signed to the AMCK agency in west London - took Harry along to a meeting. Harry’s potential was spotted immediately and he was soon signed up. After Harry died, ex-AMCK booker Patrick Egbon-Marshall described his modelling career as a “modern day Cinderella story”. He wrote on Instagram that it was his honesty, humility and hard work that had helped pave the way for his success. Shortly after he was signed, Harry walked for London Fashion Week. At the time it still felt unusual to see black teenagers on the catwalk. “For his first ever runway opening, Wretch was there, Tinie Tempah was there,” Jeremie Thompson says. The pair had spent a lot of time in detention listening to the music of Tottenham rapper Wretch 32. Later he was one of the first celebrities to pay tribute to Harry after his death, describing him as “ground-breaking”. As well as getting his head straight while in detention - reading, planning and thinking - Harry had also transformed his body, spending hours in the gym. “He was so skinny when we went in, basically a stick,” says Jeremie. “Then he met this Nigerian guy that basically got Harry massive.” By the time he was 18, Harry had modelled for Nike. He went on to work for brands such as Zara, Asos, Pull & Bear, and Jack Wills. “Harry provided a platform for black male models to come through in a way they hadn’t previously in London,” says Tytiah Blake, a casting director from London. “A lot of success in the industry is linked to your personality - if you don’t have charm, it can be difficult to break through. Harry had that balance of looks and the personality.” Nigerian-British writer and stylist Ayishat Akanbi worked with Harry and knew him as a friend. “Harry represented possibilities to many young working-class black boys. Modelling isn’t the type of industry we’re often encouraged to go into, especially within young male culture. “I think Harry reminded young men in particular that it is OK to be delicate. “He was never not smiling - he had not a single thing to prove. Again these are rare qualities to be regularly met with in the industry, so he really did stand out. “Charming, curious, adorable and kind-hearted are words that come to mind when I think of Harry.” By 2014, he was signed to the prestigious Premier Model Management - which helped shape the career of Naomi Campbell and other big names. He visited glamorous places for work - Paris, Milan, Los Angeles and New York. Even with his new success Harry never forgot about the people he grew up with, recalls Jeremie Thompson. “He’d always say if he’s earning money or if he’s doing well, and all his friends aren’t, he’s not doing well. “I’ve messaged Harry and said, ‘Bro do you think you have five pounds you can send me just so I can get a meal?’. And he’d be like, 'What!’ and come off the phone and send me like £300 and he’d do that without expecting it back.” Despite this, Harry wasn’t lavish in his own life and rarely went on holiday, although he longed to go to Nigeria and explore his heritage. That was just one of his dreams. In an interview with menswear magazine Boys by Girls, he described The Alchemist by Brazilian author Paulo Coelho as “his favourite book of all time”. At the centre of the story is the idea that everyone should dedicate themselves to the pursuit of their dreams. In that magazine interview, Harry spoke about dreams and “how you should never give up on them and how you should never see any negative”. Harry often showed a strong spiritual side, his friends and colleagues felt. “I felt like when I was shooting Harry, I was shooting his soul,” says Kevin Morosky.  “Because he wore his heart on his sleeve. And his soul was so beautiful. When you took pictures of him, you took pictures of his essence.” His commitment to self-improvement was obvious, remembers Ayishat Akanbi. “In his curiosity Harry was definitely an old soul, he felt like he’d been here before and was trying to put together pieces of his past life. “He wanted to learn to open his mind and heart more - a noble challenge.” This notion of self-improvement was something that Harry wanted to share. It was, he believed, a way of empowering young black men. “There was proper no sort of competition in him,” says Jeremy Boateng. “Like even if there was a black guy that looked like him or that was in his agency, most people would act funny… knowing that only one of us can get that spot. He was just like, ‘Nah we can all win.’” Harry was happy to share his experience with new black models starting out in the industry. One of those he helped was George Koh. The two models met in 2015 on a shoot. Three years later, Koh would be on trial at the Old Bailey for murdering Harry. Model Chuck Achike said Harry had been helping a designer teach some models how to walk the runway. One of them was George Koh. Harry went on to advise the other model how to advance his career, giving him tips on how to improve his physique and pick the right agency. The court heard the two became acquaintances, but not friends. There was a physical similarity between them. They were both slim and dark with bone structures that gave their faces a certain softness. “I remember the first time I did see him, this is my true reaction, I remember saying to H, ‘This guy looks a little like you,’” says Jeremy Boateng. But some kind of animosity eventually developed. Some felt that Koh had begun to copy Harry’s playful style in shoots, and among Harry’s friends there was an inside joke that the other model was slightly obsessed with him. It was an issue that was explored at Koh’s trial. The court heard Harry sent a message to Koh asking him to stop following and unfollowing his friends and family on Instagram. Koh blamed it on an app he used to get more followers. Friends of Harry discussed a photo shoot Koh had put on Instagram where he seemed to be copying a pose. When asked by the prosecution if he had become obsessed, Koh replied: “No, I wasn’t obsessed with him.” Things came to a head on 11 January 2018. Seven months later, George Koh, 24, and Merse Dikanda, 24, were convicted of murder. Jonathan Okigbo, 24, was acquitted of murder but convicted of manslaughter. All three had pleaded not guilty at the Old Bailey. Harry’s housemate Adrian Harper had told the murder trial about the events that led up to the tragedy. Harry said he had been told by a woman that Koh was claiming to have slept with Harry’s girlfriend, Ruby Campbell. Harry initially seemed happy to laugh it off, his housemate told the court. But that wasn’t what happened. The two models exchanged messages. GEORGE KOH TO HARRY UZOKA11:42:43Yooo11:42:44G11:43:54Why is your boy messaging me11:44:09What is he on about & what girl HARRY UZOKA TO GEORGE KOH17:24:29What’s your number? GEORGE KOH TO HARRY UZOKA17:48:37[sends his number] HARRY UZOKA TO GEORGE KOH14:21:58Leave my name out of your mouth, its that simple I’ve never spoken bad of you in any way so this is wild. “Harry’s mood didn’t feel right,” another of the model’s housemates, Seun Lawal, told the court. Harry and George Koh had a phone conversation on Wednesday 10 January. Seun Lawal also said Harry said he had spoken to Ruby Campbell and that she insisted she had never met Koh. But the dispute carried on into the next day - 11 January 2018. The court was shown another exchange of messages, which showed the lead-up to Harry Uzoka and George Koh confronting each other. GEORGE KOH TO HARRY UZOKA13:55:51Where you I’ll come there n we can fight bring your friends with U HARRY UZOKA TO GEORGE KOH14:02:04come Shepards Bush GEORGE KOH TO HARRY UZOKA14:04:54Where in bush post code14:05:33U got my number HARRY UZOKA TO GEORGE KOH14:21:58Listen come bush station this is the last thing I’m saying to you. (emoji crying laugh) your a lost soul. GEORGE KOH TO HARRY UZOKA14:23:53Im coming15:08:32Be 2min15:08:48U there yh?15:43:26I’m here George Koh brought Merse Dikanda and Jonathan Okigbo with him. They eventually arrived in Ollgar Close, near to Harry’s flat. They were armed, the court heard, with at least three knives - George Koh had two and Merse Dikanda a machete. Harry’s housemate - Adrian Harper - agreed to come with him, the court was told. The pair armed themselves by taking dumbbell bars with their weights removed. There was no discussion about what they were going to do - the housemate told the court if someone messages you about a fight “you are going to go there and fight”. Adrian Harper was asked by Richard Horwell QC, prosecuting, if he had any expectation the three men they were meeting were armed. “Yeah, but not with knives,” he said. “It is not difficult to work out which side won. Uzoka and Harper were outnumbered and bars stand little chance against knives,” the prosecution told the court. By the prosecution’s account the two groups had met at 15:51. Within two minutes it was over. Harry’s housemate was able to run away, he told the court. But by the time Harry escaped he had already been stabbed. His life was ebbing away. Harry’s death hit many people hard - there were hundreds of tributes in the hours and days after. For some, it’s still difficult to comprehend how a person seen as such a positive force could end up in a such a desperate situation. Some might think that Harry made a bad decision shortly before his life was taken - but it does not erase the fact that a young man was stabbed to death. With the recent spate of knife violence in London and other big cities, it’s easy to lose track of the numbers and names, and merge all the headlines into one. This case stood out. But every victim of knife crime is someone who shouldn’t have died. Everyone was somebody’s child. Every death leaves a hole in a family. To those who knew him, Harry Uzoka was full of love, and his life was so far away from how it ended. Lots of people have made the wrong choice at some point in their lives - Harry clearly did as a teenager. But he made a conscious effort to change. And he made that transformation look effortless, recalls Jeremy Boateng. “You know when someone truly transforms? I didn’t know him when he was in jail. When he came out he had a little bit of, like, still that hoodness in him. “But he was just a young spirit, the second he had removed all that ego from him, completely different guy - it was just love.” In an Instagram tribute to her former boyfriend, with whom she had remained firm friends, Leomie Anderson wrote: “You’ve been all over the world and been an inspiration to so many. You are proof that you can change your entire life and become a role model, no matter the circumstances.” Rapper Wretch 32 posted an impassioned reaction on Instagram to the news, pleading for an end to the violence. After describing Harry as “groundbreaking”, he said: “He’s got nothing to do with nothing… youths start walking around with these mental knives, and you think you can stab people with these knives and they’re going to survive.” Harry was once asked in an interview how he wanted to be remembered. “More than anything, just honest - an honest being of love and light.” Words:Linda Adeywith additional reporting by Jeremy Britton and Naomi Pallas Photography and art:Drew Wheeler, Jeff Hahn, Kevin Morosky, Timo Kerber, Holly Falconer, Clare Shilland, Vicki King, Willprinceart Editors: Kathryn Westcott and Finlo Rohrer Production:Naomi Pallas",Negative,1.2212717e-10

"This video can not be played The car can be seen crashing into a barrier A man has been arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences after a car crashed outside the Houses of Parliament. The vehicle swerved into cyclists and pedestrians shortly after 07:30 BST, injuring three people. The 29-year-old suspect is not believed to be known to MI5 or counter-terrorism police, and is not co-operating with officers. Searches are taking place in Birmingham and Nottingham. Two people were treated in hospital for their injuries but discharged. Scotland Yard's head of counter terrorism Assistant CommissionerNeil Basu said,external: ""Given that this appears to be a deliberate act, the method and this being an iconic site, we are treating it as a terrorist incident."" He added there was ""no intelligence at this time of further danger"" to London or the UK as a whole. Westminster crash: As it happened What we know so far No-one else was in the car and no weapons have been found. The government held a meeting of its Cobra emergency committee and the prime minister has paid tribute to the ""formidable courage"" and professionalism of the emergency services who ""ran towards a dangerous situation in order to protect the public"". Urging the public to remain vigilant but ""carry on as normal"", Theresa May added: ""For the second time in as many years the home of our democracy, which is a potent symbol of our precious values of tolerance and freedom, has witnessed terrible scenes just yards from its door."" The suspect, who has not been formally identified, is being held at a south London police station and the vehicle is being searched. Sources say he is from the Birmingham area. Security Minister Ben Wallace told the BBC the suspect was British but originally from another country. The suspect, on the right of the image, can be seen being taken away by police Only the area around the scene of the crash remains sealed off A number of eyewitnesses have said the silver Ford Fiesta, which was travelling westbound in Parliament Square, appeared to deliberately hit members of the public as it swerved into the opposite lane. Footage released by the BBC shows the moment when the car then crosses over a traffic island in the middle of the road before crashing into the security barriers. A police officer can be seen jumping over another barrier to get out of the way. Police have released more details about the car's movements before the crash: The car travelled from Birmingham to London on Monday night, arriving in the capital just after midnight The vehicle was in the Tottenham Court Road area from approximately 01:25 BST until 05:55. It was then driven around the Westminster and Whitehall area from approximately 06:00 until the incident Cyclists were seen on the ground after the crash Westminster Tube station was closed for entry and exit, and streets around Millbank and Parliament Square cordoned off for several hours after the crash.

""Then it swerved back across the road and accelerated as fast as possible, and hit the barrier at full pelt. ""He hit it at such speed the car actually lifted off the ground and bounced.

Another witness, called Kirsty, said: ""A car drove the wrong way round the road, drove through about 20 cyclists and crashed.""

British Transport Police said it was increasing patrols in England, Scotland and Wales and that its officers would be ""highly visible on trains and at stations"". By Dominic Casciani, BBC News home affairs correspondent Security arrangements at Parliament have progressively tightened since 2001. In the aftermath of the 7/7 attacks, new truck bomb-proof barriers were installed in an effort to ""target harden"" Westminster. These include the reinforced low black rampart-like walls that surround Parliament itself and a highly visible armed police presence. Visitors need to go through a chicane-like system designed to help armed officers spot suspects. The one significant weak spot was the main vehicle gates - as became apparent in March 2017's one-man attack. That triggered an internal security review that has led to changes that remain secret - although it's apparent to Londoners that there are now more armed police than ever before patrolling the area. The threat of terrorism is a constant concern for Parliamentarians - it's not new. The IRA murdered Airey Neave MP in 1979 in a car bomb that exploded within the palace grounds. And the dilemma remains the same: how best to balance security with guaranteeing that the heart of British democracy remains open to the people.

"Keith Jenkin (centre) his wife Lorna and friends decided to help build socially affordable housing in Lyme Regis More funding is now being made available for community groups who want to develop and protect affordable housing in their local area. The government's Â£60m Community Housing Fund was originally launched in 2016 and designed to help areas where high levels of second home ownership stop key workers and low-income families from buying or even renting a home - because they've been priced out of the market. The extension commits an additional Â£163m in funds (up to March 2020) that will be distributed via the government body Homes England. The early focus on rural areas of beauty meant that much of the money went to coastal areas of the South West or rural Northern England. But now the cash is available across England. Much of the Community Housing Fund initially went to the South West or rural Northern England Second home ownership has increased by about third since 2000, says the Resolution Foundation think tank. Meanwhile, only a fifth of homes built last year were deemed to be affordable on a private rental or a purchase basis - and the construction of social rented homes is at a 70-year low. In Lyme Regis in Dorset, house prices in the town have risen an estimated 30% in the last decade, pricing many locals out of the market. Keith Jenkin, his wife Lorna and friends Robert McLaughlin and Brian Rattenburg decided they wanted to do something about it. Lyme Regis house prices have risen an estimated 30% in the last decade ""The 20 to 40 year-olds are having to move out. The first-time buyers, the people who play for the local football team, who crew the lifeboat, these people are important,"" says Mr Jenkin. ""I've lived here for over thirty years and I felt it would be great to put something back."" The 15 homes they've built are home to council staff, working parents, part time employees of the tourism industry and the retired. And the spaces will always be rented at 20% less than the going market rate. Applications to move in were oversubscribed by 300%, but Abby, Frankie, Jack & Holly, all under 30, are amongst the lucky ones all moved in, having previously been stuck in low quality expensive rentals or with their parents. ""It's nice to have the different age groups here, and the kids running around in the evenings,"" says Jack. ""Knowing we've been born and bred here, we should be given a chance, I say."" Jack (right) and his family have benefitted from the social housing initiative The business model used by Keith and his friends is called a Community Land Trust. They are not new, originally born out of social projects in India and the US in the 1960s and 1970s. In Britain, their ranks have swelled from just 16 in 2008 to over 240 today. The methods of managing and developing homes varies, but the uniting principle is that the properties they are responsible for will always be available to local people in need at below the going market rate. The construction of rented homes in the UK is at a 70-year low The Community Housing Fund could see these trusts expand further and the cash has been welcomed by the body behind this fast-growing movement. ""Traditional housing models just aren't cutting it, and new approaches to house-building must play a bigger role if we are to see off the housing crisis,"" says Catherine Harrington, director of the Community Land Trust Network. ""We are delighted that government has recognised the potential."" Another group hoping to make the most of the extra cash is Leeds Community Homes. Steve Hoey and his team maintain that affordable housing is as much of an issue in urban areas: Leeds Community Homes want to build 1,000 homes over the next 10 years, says Steve Hoey ""Leeds city centre is a very expensive place to rent so we want to make those homes available to people who are on low incomes - working families, people who wouldn't normally be able to access decent housing."" They've already worked with Leeds City Council to fund the development of 16 houses within a larger development to the south of the city. Seven will be sold at 65% of market value, and can never be resold for profit, and the remaining nine will be rented out at 50% the market rate. But this is just the start of Steve Hoey's ambitions: ""We've got an ambition to build or enable 1,000 homes over 10 years so this fund will definitely help us to get nearer to that target. ""We could use it to build new homes, renovate empty homes, and just get projects through to their next stage."" Keith Jenkin says the Lyme Regis social housing project has ""kept me involved and in touch"" Applications for funding are now open to community groups, charities, social enterprises and small co-operatives. Quite where the money will be allocated will be determined by their local authorities and Homes England, the government's new national housing agency. Critics argue that the sums are still small compared to the size of Britain's housing crisis. Polly Neate, CEO of Shelter, said: ""We welcome any new money to build more homes. Particularly when it fully involves the community and lets them have a meaningful say over how these homes are built. ""To combat this housing emergency properly what we really need as well is a bold new plan for social housing. Until we see this, families everywhere will continue to find themselves living on the edge of homelessness."" But Keith Jenkin and his friends are still keen. ""The tenants, almost without exception, feel that they have really landed on their feet, and we feel proud. ""Plus, it's kept me involved and in touch. And it's kept the brain box working, you know.""

"Grandfather and commercial engineer Freddy Emmanuel has been on the waiting list for social housing for 18 years. During this time he has sofa-surfed, stayed in hostels, rented and had periods of homelessness, in Kensington and Chelsea, mostly. He spent two months sleeping rough under a tree off Portobello Road. And almost a year on from the Grenfell fire, Freddy, 56, is one of more than 1.15 million households stuck on social housing waiting lists in England. ""My family has been in this borough for a long time,"" he said. ""And for me to stick in the area would be good for the community. This is my neighbourhood. ""I feel that I should be helped by the council,"" says Freddy, who had to ""start all over again"" in 2000 when a relationship broke up. The official figures highlighted by housing charity, Shelter, also show 290,000 homes became available in 2017, leaving a shortfall nationally of about 800,000. But fewer than 14,000 of these were newly-built homes. Most became available after tenants were evicted, died, or simply moved on inside or outside the social housing sector. In some local areas, the number of available homes is dwarfed by the number of households on waiting lists. The gap is being caused by the lack of new social homes being built and the fact that many existing ones are sold off through right to buy without the proceeds having been used to build new ones. In Newham, central London, the 588 homes available for social rent are outnumbered by a factor of 44. This leaves 25,729 households chasing these properties. While in Merton, there are 35 households waiting for every one of its 270 available homes, leaving 9,581 on its list. And the homes crush stretches beyond the capital, with 24,392 households waiting in Brighton and Hove for a social home, and 19,905 in Medway. Fylde in north-west England has 23 households waiting for every one of its 214 available homes, while Dacorum in Hertfordshire has 18 households waiting for each of its 689 free properties. Freddy, who has recently moved to a privately rented flat in Cricklewood as a temporary measure, said: ""Not having a settled place makes it hard to do anything. Even getting letters delivered so you can get accepted for the doctors is hard. ""I'm in my mid-50s and at this age I should be looking after my family and relaxing in the job that I've been doing for a long time, but I can't do any of that until I get my own place. ""Instead I'm in a situation where I am still left dangling."" Shelter chief executive Polly Neate said the way Grenfell survivors had been treated, with some still lacking permanent homes, had shaken people's trust in the safety net the state is meant to provide. She said: ""Imagine then, how frustrating life must be for the millions of people elsewhere in the country who have been stuck on waiting lists, often for years on end. This is not just confined to London but happening right across the country, from Brighton to Blackpool. ""Families are unable to get settled and unable to get on with their lives."" The data shows about a quarter of those on housing waiting lists have been on them for five or more years. She added: ""The Grenfell tragedy must mark a turning point in our nation's approach to social housing and its tenants - we clearly need a bold new plan for social housing so families are not condemned to waiting lists but given safe, secure and affordable housing as quickly as possible."" A spokesman for the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government said everyone deserved a safe and decent place to live and highlighted that more than 357,000 new affordable properties had been delivered since 2010. ""We are determined to do more, and are investing a further Â£9bn in affordable homes, including Â£2bn to help councils and housing associations build properties for social rent. ""We have also committed to giving councils the power to borrow Â£1bn to build new properties in the areas were there are the greatest affordability pressures.""

"Freedom of Information requests showed councils were selling off homes faster than they were building them Social housing in the south of England is being sold off four times as fast as it is being replaced, a BBC investigation has found. Southampton City Council is losing homes at the fastest rate, despite generating Â£24m through the Right to Buy Scheme since 2015. Homes in Reading are being sold twice as quickly as they are built, with the council making Â£7m. Leaders said the government was making it difficult to reinvest in new homes. John Ennis, Reading Borough Councillor for housing, said the town was ""facing a real crisis of homelessness and a lack of affordable accommodation"". ""Affordability has become a real issue, we know it's a national crisis and we are feeling it here,"" he added. A government spokesman said since 2010, councils across the country had delivered ""94% of the replacements required to meet the one-for-one target"". He added: ""We're ambitious to do much more which is why we're already investing over Â£9bn in affordable homes and enabling councils to borrow an extra Â£1bn to build more social housing."" Freedom of Information requests showed that since 2015, 372 properties have been sold by Southampton City Council through the Right to Buy scheme, with only about 93 homes built to replace them. Portsmouth City Council made about Â£16.2m by selling 271 homes and only built 146 new properties over the same period, compared to Reading where the local authority acquired and built a total of 63 properties after selling off 127 homes. Meanwhile, Bournemouth Borough Council sold off 85 properties but has built and acquired 132 since 2015. A former homeless man named Peter told BBC Radio Berkshire he had to wait two years to get a council home in Reading. He said: ""I was living on the streets for a few months. There's some people I know, they have got nowhere. ""They are not building enough council houses.""

"Ofcom has fined Royal Mail a record Â£50m for breaching competition law. The fine is for its actions in 2014 when Whistl, which was then known as TNT, was trying to become its first competitor in wholesale mail delivery. The regulator's investigation, which followed a complaint by Whistl, said Royal Mail had abused its dominant market position and discriminated against the company. Whistl is seeking damages, but Royal Mail said it will challenge the fine. Ofcom's investigation found that Royal Mail price rises in 2014 meant any of its wholesale customers such as Whistl that wanted to compete with it would have to pay higher prices in the remaining areas where it used Royal Mail for delivery. Ofcom's investigation found that Royal Mail's actions amounted to ""anti-competitive discrimination against customers, such as Whistl, who sought to deliver bulk mail"". Royal Mail hit by shareholder revolt Moya Greene steps down Jonathan Oxley, Ofcom's competition director, said: ""Royal Mail broke the law by abusing its dominant position in bulk mail delivery. ""All companies must play by the rules. Royal Mail's behaviour was unacceptable, and it denied postal users the potential benefits that come from effective competition."" Royal Mail said it was ""very disappointed"" by Ofcom's decision and ""strongly refutes any suggestion"" that it had breached the Competition Act, adding: ""The decision is without merit and fundamentally flawed."" It said the price changes were designed to protect the Universal Service, which, unlike its competitors, it was required to continue providing. The Universal Service means post is charged at the same rate, regardless of where it is sent to across the UK.

"This video can not be played Alcohol misuse is the ""greatest healthcare problem facing Northern Ireland"", a coroner has said Alcohol misuse is the ""greatest healthcare problem facing Northern Ireland"", a coroner has said. Figures obtained by BBC News NI show the number of alcohol-related deaths in Northern Ireland is the highest on record. Between 2001 and 2016, more than 3,500 deaths in Northern Ireland were attributed to alcohol. Coroner Joe McCrisken said: ""We have an enormous problem with alcohol use, misuse and abuse in Northern Ireland."" ""The figures are frightening because they show that the number of alcohol-related deaths is increasing, so it's important to raise awareness about the dangers,"" he added. Dealing with alcohol-related illnesses costs the health service about Â£250m a year, said Dr George O'Neill, the chairman of Addiction NI. He added that 12,000 people were admitted to hospital each year with alcohol-related problems in Northern Ireland, where 170,000 people drank hazardously and 47,000 drank harmfully. Mr McCrisken has previously warned that Northern Ireland has a serious problem with drug abuse, particularly with prescription drugs. But from 2006 to 2016 there were over 1,500 more alcohol related-deaths (2,668) in Northern Ireland than deaths connected to drugs (1,149). Mr McCrisken said: ""I've spoken before about how worrying the drug-death statistics are in Northern Ireland, but alcohol deaths dwarf those figures in terms of the sheer numbers."" He said that while the statistics were shocking, ""they probably underplay the scale of the problem"". ""These figures are only the tip of the iceberg because these are only deaths where alcohol can be directly attributed,"" he said. ""The statistics don't include cases where alcohol was involved but may not be noted on the post-mortem report such as car accidents caused by drink driving, or a range of conditions such as heart attacks and strokes that can also be caused by chronic alcohol use."" The figures were provided to BBC News NI by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (Nisra). Michael Bailey has struggled with alcohol addiction for most of his life Michael Bailey lost his job, his family and eventually ended up homeless as a result of alcohol abuse. After a four-year recovery, he now works for Addiction NI. ""I was a daily drinker, from the age of 17 until I was 38, I could have counted the number of days on one hand that I didn't use alcohol. I couldn't sleep without it. ""My life looked perfect; two nice cars outside a detached four-bedroom house with a family and a good job, but inside my head was melting. My abuse of alcohol led to me losing all of it. ""I was homeless for two years and sleeping rough for seven months. Day-to-day I was stealing alcohol from supermarkets and surviving on packets of ham. It was pretty bleak. ""You're caught in that place where you wanted to die but you didn't have the guts to do it, although I did attempt it a number of times. But they were also cries for help. My life was spiralling out of control. ""One Sunday, I woke up in a park and it was a light bulb moment. I thought: 'There has to be more to life than this'. ""I enrolled in a 12-week rehabilitation programme and it was the first time I was alcohol-free for years. That was the start of the road to recovery. ""Thanks to help with counselling and organisations like Addiction NI, I haven't looked back. Whenever I went to rehab I was eight stone and yellow. This year I ran the Belfast marathon."" Mr McCrisken is to hold preliminary inquest hearings into five recent alcohol-related deaths at one sitting on Wednesday to try to raise awareness of the issue. He said there was a challenge in trying to educate the public about the dangers of alcohol, but that the government also has a role to play. This video can not be played 'June' lost her husband and youngest daughter to drink ""The Scottish government appreciated they had a big problem with alcohol deaths and because they have a functioning devolved government they have taken steps to address that,"" he said. ""They have increased the alcohol price per unit. That means if somebody has Â£10 in their pocket and they can buy two bottles of wine, if you increase the price so they can only buy one, you've literally cut that person's alcohol consumption in half for that evening."" He added: ""Alcohol in Northern Ireland today has never been cheaper, more widely available and with more choice than ever before. It doesn't take a mathematician to work out that we have an even bigger problem coming down the line. ""As a coroner, I know I'm going to be dealing with the issue of alcohol deaths for the rest of my career."" The Department of Health said the alcohol-related death statistics ""should serve as a stark reminder of the tragic impact alcohol misuse has on individuals, families and communities across Northern Ireland.

"Police described the location where the children were found as a ""makeshift compound"" A boy whose remains were found in a remote desert compound in New Mexico died during a ""ritual ceremony"", US prosecutors said. The boy's remains were discovered after police rescued 11 malnourished children who were being held at the site. Five adults have been arrested on charges of abusing the children - charges they have denied. The district judge granted all five bail, ruling the prosecution had not conclusively proven they were a threat. Defence lawyers have argued that the prosecution are treating the five suspects unfairly because they are Muslim - something prosecutors deny. US children 'trained to attack schools' Boy's remains found at New Mexico site Police raided the compound, near Amalia, on 6 August as part of their search for a missing three-year-old boy, Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj. Abdul-Ghani was not among the 11 children rescued from the compound - but police later found the remains of a young boy there. Abdul-Ghani's father, Siraj Wahhaj,  is suspected of abducting the boy from his Georgia home in December. Suspects Siraj Wahhaj (L) and Lucas Morton He was arrested at the site, along with Lucas Morten, Jany Leveille, Hujhrah Wahhaj and Subhannah Wahhaj. Prosecutors had argued that the five were dangerous and should not be granted bail, because they had trained the children to use weapons and carry out school shootings. They also said that the remains found at the site belonged to Abdul-Ghani and that the other children said the boy had died during a ""religious ritual... intended to cast out demonic spirits"", where Siraj Wahhaj had put his hand to his son's forehead, and recited verses from the Koran. Abdul-Ghani suffered from seizures, but Mr Wahhaj believed the boy was possessed by the devil and needed to be exorcised, court papers said. An FBI agent told the court that after Abdul-Ghani died, the children were told he would return ""as Jesus"" and tell them where to carry out attacks, an FBI agent told the court. However, Judge Sarah Backus said that while the information she had heard was ""troubling"", prosecutors had not proved that the defendants posed a threat to the wider community. ""The state alleges that there was a big plan afoot, but the state hasn't shown to my satisfaction, in clear and convincing evidence, what that plan was,"" she said. All five must wear ankle monitors and have weekly contact with their lawyers on bail, she ordered. From left to right: Jany Leveille, Hujhrah Wahhaj, Subhannah Wahhaj Defence lawyer Thomas Clark said the prosecution was using a double standard because the suspects are ""black and Muslim"". ""If these people were white and Christian, nobody would bat an eye over the idea of faith healing, or praying over a body or touching a body and quoting scripture,"" he said. He criticised the prosecution for what he said were suggestions that ""when black Muslims do it, there seems to be something nefarious, something evil"". The discovery of the 11 children earlier this month had shocked many in the US. Officers who discovered the children said they looked ""like Third World country refugees not only with no food or fresh water, but with no shoes, personal hygiene and basically dirty rags for clothing"". Authorities had raided the site after receiving a message from someone that read: ""We are starving and need food and water.""

"Ofcom has fined Royal Mail a record Â£50m for breaching competition law. The fine is for its actions in 2014 when Whistl, which was then known as TNT, was trying to become its first competitor in wholesale mail delivery. The regulator's investigation, which followed a complaint by Whistl, said Royal Mail had abused its dominant market position and discriminated against the company. Whistl is seeking damages, but Royal Mail said it will challenge the fine. Ofcom's investigation found that Royal Mail price rises in 2014 meant any of its wholesale customers such as Whistl that wanted to compete with it would have to pay higher prices in the remaining areas where it used Royal Mail for delivery. Ofcom's investigation found that Royal Mail's actions amounted to ""anti-competitive discrimination against customers, such as Whistl, who sought to deliver bulk mail"". Royal Mail hit by shareholder revolt Moya Greene steps down Jonathan Oxley, Ofcom's competition director, said: ""Royal Mail broke the law by abusing its dominant position in bulk mail delivery.

Royal Mail said it was ""very disappointed"" by Ofcom's decision and ""strongly refutes any suggestion"" that it had breached the Competition Act, adding: ""The decision is without merit and fundamentally flawed."" It said the price changes were designed to protect the Universal Service, which, unlike its competitors, it was required to continue providing.

"Almost a third of British Asians say they have been treated worse following a terrorism attack, a ComRes survey for the Asian Network suggests. Muslims (40%) were most likely to have experienced a rise in negative treatment, followed by Sikhs (26%). The poll also implied British Asians were less likely than others in the UK to say immigration is too high. More than 2,000 British Asians responded to the poll as part of the BBC's Big British Asian Summer. Among those who said they had been treated worse, the most common observation was that they had been treated with more awkwardness (59%) and more suspicion (53%). Just under a third said other people had been abusive, while 11% said they had been excluded from events. British Asians 'more socially conservative' The club celebrating London's LGBT South Asians Boris Johnson comments 'will inflame Islamophobia' Of the 2,026 respondents to the British Asian survey, 1,197 were born in the UK - with countries of origin being predominantly India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. Security think tank Quilliam director of policy David Toube said: ""The purpose of terrorism is to sow division within our society. It should be a matter of concern to everybody when a large minority within any ethnic group feels that some in this country are against them. ""A vital part of fighting Islamist terrorism and extremism is ensuring that far-right reciprocal radicalisation also fails."" The survey will be discussed on a special live debate show on theAsian Network, on Tuesday from 22:00 BST until midnight. Results from the survey also suggested British Asians were less likely than the wider population to say the level of immigration is too high - though 34% said it was. When the wider population was asked the same question, 56% said they felt it was too high. Only 8% of British Asians say immigration is too low, in comparison with 3% of the general population. The survey also looked into sporting allegiances among British Asians. With regards to international football, British Asians overwhelmingly support one of the UK nations. More than three quarters of respondents said they supported one of England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland, with only 6% supporting other countries. However, when asked about allegiances in cricket, 19% support a UK team while 54% support an Asian team.

"Philip Wilson was convicted in May of concealing child sexual abuse A former Catholic archbishop will serve a maximum 12-month sentence in home detention for concealing child sexual abuse, an Australian court has ruled. The decision means Philip Wilson, who resigned as archbishop of Adelaide after his conviction, will avoid jail. Wilson, 67, is the world's most senior Catholic cleric to be convicted of covering up sexual abuse. His lawyers said they would lodge an appeal on Tuesday. A magistrate said Wilson would commence his sentence immediately at a relative's home, where he would be monitored by a tracking device. He will be eligible for parole after six months. As he left court on Tuesday, Wilson did not respond to an abuse survivor who confronted him to demand an apology. During his trial, Wilson denied knowing that paedophile priest James Patrick Fletcher had abused altar boys in the 1970s. However, the court ruled in May that Wilson had been alerted to the abuse by victims, and failed to report it. Peter Gogarty, who has spoken openly about abuse he suffered, demanded an apology from Wilson Fletcher was convicted of nine child sexual abuse charges in 2004, and died in jail in 2006. Magistrate Robert Stone said Wilson had stayed silent out of a desire to protect the Church's reputation. Last month, he ordered Wilson to be assessed for home detention. Magistrate Stone said the senior clergyman had shown ""no remorse or contrition"" during the trial. On Tuesday one of Fletcher's victims, Peter Gogarty, approached Wilson to call for an apology. He remained silent, but one of his supporters confronted Mr Gogarty. ""I haven't got time for rubbish like you, mate,"" the supporter said, Australian media reported.

"This video can not be played Stand your ground: CCTV captured the shooting in a Florida car park A white man who shot and killed an unarmed black man over a parking dispute in Florida has now been charged with manslaughter, prosecutors say. Michael Drejka, 47, shot Markeis McGlockton after a fight broke out over a disabled parking space on 19 July. He was not immediately arrested due to the state's ""stand your ground"" law, which protects those claiming self-defence after a violent incident. Police arrested him on Monday. His bail has been set at $100,000 (Â£78,000). Four 'stand your ground' cases,external America's gun culture in 10 charts,external The statistics behind the violence,external Pinellas County State Attorney Bernie McCabe said his office ""filed the charge we think we can prove"", theTampa Bay Times newspaper,externalreported. He did not offer further comment about the case. According to the arrest warrant, viewed by the Times, police noted Mr McGlockton had immediately stepped back ""when confronted with the firearm"" and turned away from Mr Drejka. Investigators also found Mr Drejka was around 12 ft (3.6m) away from Mr McGlockton when he shot him. Mr McGlockton's family said in a statement that the arrest was ""a small measure of comfort in our time of profound mourning,"" US media reported. ""While this decision cannot bring back our partner, our son, our father, we take solace in knowing our voices are being heard as we work for justice. ""This man killed Markeis in cold blood, without a second thought about the devastating impact his actions would have on our family, but this charge gives us a measure of hope that the truth will win and justice will prevail in the end."" The family's lawyer, Benjamin Crump - who also represented the family of Trayvon Martin - said in a statement on Monday ""it's about time"" Mr Drejka was arrested. ""This self-appointed wannabe cop attempted to hide behind 'Stand Your Ground' to defend his indefensible actions, but the truth has finally cut through the noise,"" Mr Crump said. Michael Drejka had a valid concealed weapons licence, police say Florida's ""stand your ground"" or ""shoot first"" law gives protection from criminal prosecution or civil liability to people who claim self-defence after a shooting or violent incident. Police faced criticism for the initial decision not to charge Mr Drejka in July. ""I don't make the law. I enforce the law,"" Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri had said at the time. ""I'm going to enforce it the way it's written. Others can have the debate about whether they like it or not."" Mr Gualtieri had forwarded the case to the state attorney's office on 1 Aug. In a statement on Monday, Mr Gualtieri said: ""I support the State Attorney's decision and will have no further comment as the case continues to work its way through the criminal justice system."" Mr McGlockton's family said he was trying to protect them when he shoved Mr Drejka Mr Drejka was shoved over by Mr McGlockton after he confronted his girlfriend who was parked in a space for the disabled. Footage of the shooting was recorded on CCTV outside the convenience store and shows Mr McGlockton rushing back inside the building while clutching his chest. Witnesses say he then collapsed before shoppers called 911. He was taken to hospital in the city of Clearwater and pronounced dead.

"This video can not be played Emile and Lleucu both have unconditional offers but said they still worked hard The education system is being undermined by universities making more unconditional offers, according to the head of Wales' biggest college. David Jones, of Coleg Cambria, said offers were coming half way through courses and meant many A-level students were taking their ""foot off the pedal"". Figures from admissions service Ucasshow a big rise in the number of unconditional offers for 18-year-olds. Universities Wales said they were still ""a small percentage"" of the total. Unconditional offers guarantee a university place to students, whichever grades they get in their A-level exams. Ucas said the total number of these type of offers made to 18-year-olds from England, Northern Ireland, and Wales had risen by 65,930 over the past five years - from 2,985 in 2013 to 67,915 in 2018. This means nearly a quarter (23%) of applicants received an unconditional offer this year. Why might students get an unconditional offer? Outstanding students who the university wants to tempt to commit to studying. Mature students who already have their qualifications. Creative arts subjects where a portfolio is submitted. But there has been concern that the growth of unconditional offers in recent years is driven by the pressure for universities to secure student places in a highly competitive market. Mr Jones, chief executive of Coleg Cambria, which has 27,000 students in Wrexham, Flintshire and Denbighshire, said some of what resulted from this intense competition was ""bordering on immoral"". Huge rise in unconditional offers 'Ditch A-level predicted grades' urge lecturers MPs concerned over unconditional offers Overseas student decline challenge Mr Jones said it could also lead to less effort by students ""once they had got the ticket to get them where they want to go in advance"". ""It totally undermines the education system because it's about demonstrating with evidence - and exams are one example of it - that you have skills and knowledge. If you continue to undermine that system, we will be on a very slippery slope, where education levels across the UK will reduce even further."" He said he was also finding more universities were offering very low entry grades for students who have not done very well. In a freedom of information request, BBC Wales asked individual universities about the number of unconditional offers they have made for all undergraduates of all ages: TheUniversity of Wales Trinity St Davidsaid unconditional offers made to students through Ucas for full-time undergraduate courses accounted for 26% of the total offers made. It said the figure for all its courses was 53.4%. Cardiff Universitysaid it made 6,504 unconditional offers - 26% of the total offers for that year. It said it only gave unconditional offers to students who had already received their exam results, and that they were not given where results were still unknown. Cardiff Metropolitan Universitysaid the 21% of unconditional offers it made in 2017 were partly due to the implementation of unconditional offer schemes in the school of art and design and education. Bangor Universitysaid 6.4% of its offers in 2017-18 were unconditional,Swansea University's figure was 10%, whileAberystwythsaid the 9.3% of unconditional offers it made included offers to those who had passed the scholarship exam. Wrexham Glyndwr Universitysaid 20% of its 2017-18 offers were unconditional and theUniversity of South Walesdid not provide figures, saying it operated in a ""competitive environment"" and wished to protect information it considered to be ""sensitive"". Universities Wales - which represents higher education institutions - said unconditional offers represented 5.3% of all offers made to 18-year olds. It said it was important to remember that students came from a diverse range of backgrounds with a variety of qualifications. ""As such, Welsh universities use a whole range of factors and contextual data when considering whether to offer a place to ensure that everyone with the determination, skills and desire to access higher education should be able to do so,"" said a spokeswoman.

Up to 30 homes were evacuated overnight as fire crews fought the blaze. Residents, who took refuge in Bury and Rochdale Magistrates' Court, were allowed back home after 00:55 BST. Rochdale fire station manager Nick Hince said: ""Seats of fire remain in the building and will be difficult to reach until the building has been demolished. ""Smoke in the area has been reduced and is currently blowing away from local residents but the safety advice remains the same - please keep your windows and doors closed if you live locally."" Firefighters say the building collapse had hampered their efforts The building collapsed as a result of the fire Mr Hince added: ""One side of Queensway has reopened but the other side remains closed so please avoid the area if you can. We are working hard to extinguish the fire completely so please bear with us as we do so. ""Crews will remain at the scene throughout the day but I would like to thank all of our firefighters and partner agencies who have worked throughout the night, helping us bring the blaze under control."" One resident told the BBC the flames were as high as the mill at one stage and he did not wait to be told to evacuate his house. Simon Gray, whose home is 50m away from the mill, said  ""We heard the fire crackling to begin with and looked through the loft windows to see how big it was - I was worried it might spread to our house as we've got trees nearby."" The mill on Greenfield Lane is understood to house several businesses.

The serious mental illness affects one in one thousand mums and can lead to hallucinations after giving birth. Laura said: ""The last six months can only be described as hell, it's been the worst time of my life.""

Laura is a poet, author, illustrator and short story writer, and she went to the same school as Adele - the Brit School of Performing Arts in Croydon. In her blog post she talks about a ""horrific"" labour which her doctor believes might have triggered the illness. After coming home with her son, Laura describes feeling like ""I had pushed out my personality as well as a baby"". Laura and Adele have been friends since they were teenagers She says she had suicidal thoughts. ""I was begging my sister to let me go, I was begging my mum to let me go. ""I have never had those thoughts before in my life and no history of mental illness, this completely took me by surprise and threw me against the rocks."" Laura says that her skin went pale, she couldn't eat or drink and she started getting severe anxiety attacks. As things got worse, Laura needed her partner Hugo to send her photos of herself with friends and family to remind her who she was. ""Even though postnatal depression and the psychosis are both treatable, even when my doctor said I would 100% recover I remember thinking, 'Maybe others do but not me, this is me forever'.""

"Giving tenants greater support so they can hold their landlords to account is being considered as part of government proposals on social housing in England. The measures include speeding up the complaints process and publishing league tables to highlight the performance of landlords. The Green Paper also pledges a scheme to offer tenants the right to buy 1% of their home each year. Labour said the ""pitiful"" plans made no promise to fund more affordable homes. The plans are part of a ""fundamental rethink"" on social housing following the Grenfell tragedy. The latest announcement comes a day after the government unveiled itsÂ£100m strategy to tackle rough sleeping on England's streets. 'I've spent 18 years on housing waiting list' Shortage of affordable homes, report warns No affordable homes? We'll build them ourselves In September last year, then-communities secretary Sajid Javid said the government would produce the Green Paper as soon as possible in the wake of the Grenfell blaze, which killed 72 people. Green Papers are government documents which set out policy ideas and enable ministers to consult on the suggestions. Plans include introducing landlord ratings to hold bad practice to account, and providing the regulator with ""sharper teeth"" to intervene on issues that matter most to tenants. It also outlines changes to make it easier for tenants to own their homes, such as allowing them to use the government's shared ownership scheme to purchase as little as 1% of their property each year. This video can not be played What is social housing and why do we have it? The government has also unveiled a separate consultation into how councils spend the money from Right to Buy sales, as it looks to increase the number of local authority homes. It sets out proposals to make it easier for councils to replace properties sold under Right to Buy, and to build more affordable homes. Social housing in 'crisis' in south Town halls buy back Right to Buy homes Housing Secretary James Brokenshire, who is launching a consultation on the proposals, said: ""Our Green Paper offers a landmark opportunity for major reform to improve fairness, quality and safety for residents living in social housing across the country. ""Regardless of whether you own your home or rent, residents deserve security, dignity and the opportunities to build a better life."" Official figures, highlighted by housing charity Shelter, showed that1.15 million households were on social housing waiting listsin England last year. Of the 290,000 homes that became available in 2017, fewer than 14,000 were newly-built homes. By BBC home editor Mark Easton David Cameron's government tended to view social housing with antipathy bordering on outright hostility. Advisers in Number Ten argued that social housing caused welfare dependency and increased poverty. The memoirs of Nick Clegg, David Cameron's deputy prime minister, reveal that a very senior government figure asked why would we spend money on social housing - it just breeds Labour voters. Under the Cameron government, the amount of new social housing started, dwindled to almost nothing. Then we had the tragedy of Grenfell. That fire changed the politics overnight. Theresa May said: ""For too long in our country, we simply haven't given enough attention to social housing"", and ""let the legacy of this awful tragedy be that we resolve never to forget these people and instead to gear our policies and our thinking towards making their lives better and bringing them into the political process"". The housing minister was sent round the country to listen to social housing tenants as his then boss, Sajid Javid, said: ""The green paper will be the most substantial report of its kind for a generation"". As Green Papers go, it is very green.  More the start of a conversation than offering solutions. There are welcome words about the need to reduce the stigma of social housing, of ensuring that tenants' rights and concerns are treated properly, that the homes themselves are decent. It does say that one of the principles of the Green Paper and core priorities for the government is that we should be ""building the social homes that we need"". But there is little about how that might be done or how it might be paid for.  And there will be disappointment in the housing sector that this ""once in a generation"" report has so little to say about the central question of supply. There were fewer than 6,000 social homes completed in England in the last year.  Experts say we require between 70,000 and 90,000 every year to meet the need.  Warm words do not build affordable houses. Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, said the government's plan was ""full of warm words, but doesn't commit a single extra penny towards building the social homes needed by the 1.2 million people on the waiting list"". Judith Blake, housing spokeswoman for the Local Government Association, said the proposals were ""a step towards delivering more social homes"" - but ""only a small step"".

"Many people are making a poor financial decision by taking some of their pension pot in cash, a regulator says. Some pensioners could receive 37% more retirement income every year by investing rather than cashing in, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said. Workers should be given more guidance about what to do with their pension, and could be sent ""wake up"" information packs from the age of 50. Savers can cash in their pension from the age of 55. The reforms were introduced by the chancellor at the time, George Osborne, in April 2015. By September 2017, some 1.5 million pension pots had been accessed. Previously, people would have bought an annuity - a financial product that provides a guaranteed retirement income - with their pension pot, although this is an option that remains open to them. How to get a pension of Â£20,000 by the time you retire Annuity or drawdown? Transgender woman wins pension court battle Three-quarters of consumers who took money from their pension pots did so before the age of 65, but the FCA is concerned that they are not always getting a good deal - partly because they stick with the same pension provider. Some choose a so-called drawdown pension - which allows them to withdraw as much money as they like at any one time while the rest remains invested in a pension.  Twice as many pots have been used for drawdown than to buy an annuity. Glenn Mousley, 64, ran an events management company and decided to stagger his retirement. As a seasoned investor, he decided that converting two pensions to an income drawdown product was the best option for him. He argues that it allows him to take an income while still growing his pension pot, and offers him the opportunity to leave money to his family. Mr Mousley, who is a battlefield guide in his spare time, said it was important to understand the products you were signing up to. ""You have to do your homework. This is not for the completely faint-hearted, you have got to accept that markets go up and down,"" he said. The FCA warned that some people could be paying too much in charges and that, by switching provider, consumers could increase their annual income by 13%. However, it said many of these charges were complex, opaque and hard to compare. It suggested these charges could be displayed in pounds and pence and has not ruled out a cap. It said many would be better off re-investing some of the money they drew from their pension - and drawing an income from that - rather than keeping it as cash. This would add an extra layer of complexity to their financial affairs, so more help should be given to people ahead of such a major decision, the FCA said. The regulator is proposing that pension providers send ""wake-up"" packs to their customers at the age of 50 and for every five years after that until they access their pension. This would include a single-page summary in clear language. ""We know that the choices introduced by the pension freedoms have been popular with many consumers,"" said Christopher Woolard, executive director at the FCA. ""However, they are now required to make more complicated decisions than ever before. Many people need more support when making choices."" Providers have said that these information packs need to be well designed. Tom Selby, senior analyst at AJ Bell, said: ""We believe much of the literature issued to customers is barely read and poorly understood, and have long called for a fundamental rethink in this area. ""Our own research points to a lack of engagement and understanding among many drawdown investors, with accessing tax-free cash often the priority."" Huw Evans, of the Association of British Insurers, which represents many pension companies, said: ""We have already laid the foundations for how a drawdown comparison tool could work in practice because we recognise how important it is for customers to be able to shop around. We agree a simpler presentation of charges will need to be a part of that."" However, Frank Field, who chairs the Work and Pensions Committee, said the FCA should act quicker in ensuring reforms. ""The FCA wants another year to mull over a charge cap while life savings are shamelessly milked. There has been more than enough warning. They should just introduce it,"" he said.

"Keith Jenkin (centre) his wife Lorna and friends decided to help build socially affordable housing in Lyme Regis More funding is now being made available for community groups who want to develop and protect affordable housing in their local area. The government's Â£60m Community Housing Fund was originally launched in 2016 and designed to help areas where high levels of second home ownership stop key workers and low-income families from buying or even renting a home - because they've been priced out of the market. The extension commits an additional Â£163m in funds (up to March 2020) that will be distributed via the government body Homes England. The early focus on rural areas of beauty meant that much of the money went to coastal areas of the South West or rural Northern England. But now the cash is available across England. Much of the Community Housing Fund initially went to the South West or rural Northern England Second home ownership has increased by about third since 2000, says the Resolution Foundation think tank. Meanwhile, only a fifth of homes built last year were deemed to be affordable on a private rental or a purchase basis - and the construction of social rented homes is at a 70-year low. In Lyme Regis in Dorset, house prices in the town have risen an estimated 30% in the last decade, pricing many locals out of the market. Keith Jenkin, his wife Lorna and friends Robert McLaughlin and Brian Rattenburg decided they wanted to do something about it. Lyme Regis house prices have risen an estimated 30% in the last decade ""The 20 to 40 year-olds are having to move out. The first-time buyers, the people who play for the local football team, who crew the lifeboat, these people are important,"" says Mr Jenkin. ""I've lived here for over thirty years and I felt it would be great to put something back."" The 15 homes they've built are home to council staff, working parents, part time employees of the tourism industry and the retired. And the spaces will always be rented at 20% less than the going market rate. Applications to move in were oversubscribed by 300%, but Abby, Frankie, Jack & Holly, all under 30, are amongst the lucky ones all moved in, having previously been stuck in low quality expensive rentals or with their parents. ""It's nice to have the different age groups here, and the kids running around in the evenings,"" says Jack. ""Knowing we've been born and bred here, we should be given a chance, I say."" Jack (right) and his family have benefitted from the social housing initiative The business model used by Keith and his friends is called a Community Land Trust. They are not new, originally born out of social projects in India and the US in the 1960s and 1970s. In Britain, their ranks have swelled from just 16 in 2008 to over 240 today. The methods of managing and developing homes varies, but the uniting principle is that the properties they are responsible for will always be available to local people in need at below the going market rate. The construction of rented homes in the UK is at a 70-year low The Community Housing Fund could see these trusts expand further and the cash has been welcomed by the body behind this fast-growing movement. ""Traditional housing models just aren't cutting it, and new approaches to house-building must play a bigger role if we are to see off the housing crisis,"" says Catherine Harrington, director of the Community Land Trust Network. ""We are delighted that government has recognised the potential."" Another group hoping to make the most of the extra cash is Leeds Community Homes. Steve Hoey and his team maintain that affordable housing is as much of an issue in urban areas: Leeds Community Homes want to build 1,000 homes over the next 10 years, says Steve Hoey ""Leeds city centre is a very expensive place to rent so we want to make those homes available to people who are on low incomes - working families, people who wouldn't normally be able to access decent housing."" They've already worked with Leeds City Council to fund the development of 16 houses within a larger development to the south of the city. Seven will be sold at 65% of market value, and can never be resold for profit, and the remaining nine will be rented out at 50% the market rate. But this is just the start of Steve Hoey's ambitions: ""We've got an ambition to build or enable 1,000 homes over 10 years so this fund will definitely help us to get nearer to that target. ""We could use it to build new homes, renovate empty homes, and just get projects through to their next stage."" Keith Jenkin says the Lyme Regis social housing project has ""kept me involved and in touch"" Applications for funding are now open to community groups, charities, social enterprises and small co-operatives. Quite where the money will be allocated will be determined by their local authorities and Homes England, the government's new national housing agency. Critics argue that the sums are still small compared to the size of Britain's housing crisis. Polly Neate, CEO of Shelter, said: ""We welcome any new money to build more homes. Particularly when it fully involves the community and lets them have a meaningful say over how these homes are built. ""To combat this housing emergency properly what we really need as well is a bold new plan for social housing. Until we see this, families everywhere will continue to find themselves living on the edge of homelessness."" But Keith Jenkin and his friends are still keen. ""The tenants, almost without exception, feel that they have really landed on their feet, and we feel proud. ""Plus, it's kept me involved and in touch. And it's kept the brain box working, you know.""

"Grandfather and commercial engineer Freddy Emmanuel has been on the waiting list for social housing for 18 years. During this time he has sofa-surfed, stayed in hostels, rented and had periods of homelessness, in Kensington and Chelsea, mostly. He spent two months sleeping rough under a tree off Portobello Road. And almost a year on from the Grenfell fire, Freddy, 56, is one of more than 1.15 million households stuck on social housing waiting lists in England. ""My family has been in this borough for a long time,"" he said. ""And for me to stick in the area would be good for the community. This is my neighbourhood. ""I feel that I should be helped by the council,"" says Freddy, who had to ""start all over again"" in 2000 when a relationship broke up. The official figures highlighted by housing charity, Shelter, also show 290,000 homes became available in 2017, leaving a shortfall nationally of about 800,000. But fewer than 14,000 of these were newly-built homes. Most became available after tenants were evicted, died, or simply moved on inside or outside the social housing sector. In some local areas, the number of available homes is dwarfed by the number of households on waiting lists. The gap is being caused by the lack of new social homes being built and the fact that many existing ones are sold off through right to buy without the proceeds having been used to build new ones. In Newham, central London, the 588 homes available for social rent are outnumbered by a factor of 44. This leaves 25,729 households chasing these properties. While in Merton, there are 35 households waiting for every one of its 270 available homes, leaving 9,581 on its list. And the homes crush stretches beyond the capital, with 24,392 households waiting in Brighton and Hove for a social home, and 19,905 in Medway. Fylde in north-west England has 23 households waiting for every one of its 214 available homes, while Dacorum in Hertfordshire has 18 households waiting for each of its 689 free properties. Freddy, who has recently moved to a privately rented flat in Cricklewood as a temporary measure, said: ""Not having a settled place makes it hard to do anything. Even getting letters delivered so you can get accepted for the doctors is hard. ""I'm in my mid-50s and at this age I should be looking after my family and relaxing in the job that I've been doing for a long time, but I can't do any of that until I get my own place. ""Instead I'm in a situation where I am still left dangling."" Shelter chief executive Polly Neate said the way Grenfell survivors had been treated, with some still lacking permanent homes, had shaken people's trust in the safety net the state is meant to provide. She said: ""Imagine then, how frustrating life must be for the millions of people elsewhere in the country who have been stuck on waiting lists, often for years on end. This is not just confined to London but happening right across the country, from Brighton to Blackpool. ""Families are unable to get settled and unable to get on with their lives."" The data shows about a quarter of those on housing waiting lists have been on them for five or more years. She added: ""The Grenfell tragedy must mark a turning point in our nation's approach to social housing and its tenants - we clearly need a bold new plan for social housing so families are not condemned to waiting lists but given safe, secure and affordable housing as quickly as possible."" A spokesman for the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government said everyone deserved a safe and decent place to live and highlighted that more than 357,000 new affordable properties had been delivered since 2010. ""We are determined to do more, and are investing a further Â£9bn in affordable homes, including Â£2bn to help councils and housing associations build properties for social rent. ""We have also committed to giving councils the power to borrow Â£1bn to build new properties in the areas were there are the greatest affordability pressures.""

"The Pensions Regulator recommended the 'scorpion' leaflet which warns pension scheme members about scams Northumbria Police has been told to reinstate all the money lost by one of its officers because it failed to warn him about pension scams. The Pensions Ombudsman found the force did not issue a fraud warning leaflet or conduct adequate checks. The officer transferred all of his savings out of the police pension scheme in November 2013. Northumbria Police said it respects the decision, which has cost it Â£135,400, including Â£1,000 for distress. The officer, named only as 'Mr N' in the ombudsman's ruling, decided to move his savings from the Northumbria Police pension scheme to a new one. But after discovering that all his money may have been lost or misappropriated, he put in a complaint about the way his transfer had been handled. He argued that Northumbria Police had failed to provide him with sufficient warnings about pension scams or conducted adequate checks on where his money was going. In February 2013, The Pensions Regulator had recommended that members of pension schemes who were transferring their savings should be sent a leaflet warning them about scams. Although Northumbria Police had included a link to the leaflet on its own internal website, it had not sent a copy of it directly to the officer before it processed his request. The Pensions Ombudsman also found the force had not conducted appropriate checks before releasing the money and had ignored things which other schemes had identified as potential ""red flags"". Northumbria Police had argued the officer would have gone ahead with the transfer anyway, because at the time he had complete trust in his financial adviser. Sir Steve Webb, a former pensions minister who now works for the pension firm Royal London, told Radio 4's You & Yours ""a ruling which says people in charge of pension schemes have a duty to go that extra mile for members is very encouraging"".

"President Donald Trump signed a military spending bill that includes tougher measures on foreign investment The US has passed a new law that strengthens the government's power to review - and potentially block - business deals involving foreign firms. US President Donald Trump signed the bill, which is part of a broader military spending measure, on Monday. The US worries Chinese firms use investments and acquisitions to gain access to new technology - a concern also behind the US-led trade war. China was critical of the US defence act. The law was supported by both Republicans and Democrats in Congress, which approved the measure earlier this year. It comes as other countries, including the UK, consider ways to toughen their scrutiny of foreign deals with an eye to China. UK ramps up powers to block foreign takeover deals Chinese takeover of German firm Leifeld collapses The new law expands the type of deals subject to potential review by the  Committee on Foreign Investment in the US (CFIUS), which vets foreign investments to see if they pose a risk to national security. For example, it directs the committee to consider how potential transactions might affect personal data and cyber-security and whether an investment gives foreigners access to ""material"" non-public information. It also strengthens export controls, allowing the US to review overseas deals, such as joint ventures. The new law does not specifically name China. However, it directs CFIUS officials to consider whether the transaction involves a ""country of special concern that has a demonstrated or declared strategic goal of acquiring a type of critical technology or critical infrastructure"". China criticised the measures, saying it would comprehensively assess them. ""The US side should objectively and fairly treat Chinese investors, and avoid CFIUS becoming an obstacle to investment cooperation between Chinese and US firms,"" China's Commerce Ministry said, according to Reuters. The broader military spending legislation,externalalso says ""long-term strategic competition with China"" is a principal priority for the US. US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he welcomed the new law. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Even without the new law, rising US scrutiny of Chinese transactions appears to have dampened investor appetite. Chinese firms completed deals worth $1.8bn (Â£1.4bn) in the first half of 2018 - the lowest level in seven years and down more than 90% from the same period in 2017,according to the Rhodium Group, a US research firm,external. The decline followed tighter Chinese controls on overseas activity, which contributed to aglobal contraction in foreign investment,externallast year. Rhodium found US regulators blocked about $2bn in Chinese deals in the first six months of 2018. Those included the sale of a US money transfer firm to Ant Financial, Alibaba's digital payments arm, and the acquisition of Skybridge Capital by HNA. US blocks sale of Moneygram to China's Ant Financial Overall, foreign investment in the US fell 32% from 2016 to 2017, when it totalled about $260bn,according to the  US Commerce Department,external.

"This video can not be played Emile and Lleucu both have unconditional offers but said they still worked hard The education system is being undermined by universities making more unconditional offers, according to the head of Wales' biggest college. David Jones, of Coleg Cambria, said offers were coming half way through courses and meant many A-level students were taking their ""foot off the pedal"". Figures from admissions service Ucasshow a big rise in the number of unconditional offers for 18-year-olds. Universities Wales said they were still ""a small percentage"" of the total. Unconditional offers guarantee a university place to students, whichever grades they get in their A-level exams. Ucas said the total number of these type of offers made to 18-year-olds from England, Northern Ireland, and Wales had risen by 65,930 over the past five years - from 2,985 in 2013 to 67,915 in 2018. This means nearly a quarter (23%) of applicants received an unconditional offer this year. Why might students get an unconditional offer? Outstanding students who the university wants to tempt to commit to studying. Mature students who already have their qualifications. Creative arts subjects where a portfolio is submitted. But there has been concern that the growth of unconditional offers in recent years is driven by the pressure for universities to secure student places in a highly competitive market. Mr Jones, chief executive of Coleg Cambria, which has 27,000 students in Wrexham, Flintshire and Denbighshire, said some of what resulted from this intense competition was ""bordering on immoral"". Huge rise in unconditional offers 'Ditch A-level predicted grades' urge lecturers MPs concerned over unconditional offers Overseas student decline challenge Mr Jones said it could also lead to less effort by students ""once they had got the ticket to get them where they want to go in advance"". ""It totally undermines the education system because it's about demonstrating with evidence - and exams are one example of it - that you have skills and knowledge. If you continue to undermine that system, we will be on a very slippery slope, where education levels across the UK will reduce even further."" He said he was also finding more universities were offering very low entry grades for students who have not done very well. In a freedom of information request, BBC Wales asked individual universities about the number of unconditional offers they have made for all undergraduates of all ages: TheUniversity of Wales Trinity St Davidsaid unconditional offers made to students through Ucas for full-time undergraduate courses accounted for 26% of the total offers made. It said the figure for all its courses was 53.4%. Cardiff Universitysaid it made 6,504 unconditional offers - 26% of the total offers for that year. It said it only gave unconditional offers to students who had already received their exam results, and that they were not given where results were still unknown. Cardiff Metropolitan Universitysaid the 21% of unconditional offers it made in 2017 were partly due to the implementation of unconditional offer schemes in the school of art and design and education. Bangor Universitysaid 6.4% of its offers in 2017-18 were unconditional,Swansea University's figure was 10%, whileAberystwythsaid the 9.3% of unconditional offers it made included offers to those who had passed the scholarship exam. Wrexham Glyndwr Universitysaid 20% of its 2017-18 offers were unconditional and theUniversity of South Walesdid not provide figures, saying it operated in a ""competitive environment"" and wished to protect information it considered to be ""sensitive"". Universities Wales - which represents higher education institutions - said unconditional offers represented 5.3% of all offers made to 18-year olds. It said it was important to remember that students came from a diverse range of backgrounds with a variety of qualifications. ""As such, Welsh universities use a whole range of factors and contextual data when considering whether to offer a place to ensure that everyone with the determination, skills and desire to access higher education should be able to do so,"" said a spokeswoman.

Unconditional offers guarantee a university place to students, whichever grades they get in their A-level exams. Ucas said the total number of these type of offers made to 18-year-olds from England, Northern Ireland, and Wales had risen by 65,930 over the past five years - from 2,985 in 2013 to 67,915 in 2018. This means nearly a quarter (23%) of applicants received an unconditional offer this year. Why might students get an unconditional offer? Outstanding students who the university wants to tempt to commit to studying. Mature students who already have their qualifications. Creative arts subjects where a portfolio is submitted. But there has been concern that the growth of unconditional offers in recent years is driven by the pressure for universities to secure student places in a highly competitive market. Mr Jones, chief executive of Coleg Cambria, which has 27,000 students in Wrexham, Flintshire and Denbighshire, said some of what resulted from this intense competition was ""bordering on immoral"". Huge rise in unconditional offers 'Ditch A-level predicted grades' urge lecturers MPs concerned over unconditional offers Overseas student decline challenge Mr Jones said it could also lead to less effort by students ""once they had got the ticket to get them where they want to go in advance"". ""It totally undermines the education system because it's about demonstrating with evidence - and exams are one example of it - that you have skills and knowledge. If you continue to undermine that system, we will be on a very slippery slope, where education levels across the UK will reduce even further."" He said he was also finding more universities were offering very low entry grades for students who have not done very well. In a freedom of information request, BBC Wales asked individual universities about the number of unconditional offers they have made for all undergraduates of all ages: TheUniversity of Wales Trinity St Davidsaid unconditional offers made to students through Ucas for full-time undergraduate courses accounted for 26% of the total offers made. It said the figure for all its courses was 53.4%. Cardiff Universitysaid it made 6,504 unconditional offers - 26% of the total offers for that year. It said it only gave unconditional offers to students who had already received their exam results, and that they were not given where results were still unknown. Cardiff Metropolitan Universitysaid the 21% of unconditional offers it made in 2017 were partly due to the implementation of unconditional offer schemes in the school of art and design and education. Bangor Universitysaid 6.4% of its offers in 2017-18 were unconditional,Swansea University's figure was 10%, whileAberystwythsaid the 9.3% of unconditional offers it made included offers to those who had passed the scholarship exam. Wrexham Glyndwr Universitysaid 20% of its 2017-18 offers were unconditional and theUniversity of South Walesdid not provide figures, saying it operated in a ""competitive environment"" and wished to protect information it considered to be ""sensitive"". Universities Wales - which represents higher education institutions - said unconditional offers represented 5.3% of all offers made to 18-year olds. It said it was important to remember that students came from a diverse range of backgrounds with a variety of qualifications. ""As such, Welsh universities use a whole range of factors and contextual data when considering whether to offer a place to ensure that everyone with the determination, skills and desire to access higher education should be able to do so,"" said a spokeswoman.

"Iranian-born Bahareh Letnes and Per Sandberg Norway's fisheries minister has resigned after breaching security protocol during a holiday to Iran last month with his Iranian-born girlfriend. Per Sandberg, 58, admitted he had gone with Bahareh Letnes, 28, without informing the prime minister and had taken a government phone to Iran. The PM governs in coalition with his anti-immigration Progress Party. The trip risked exposing Mr Sandberg to Iranian spies, as he should not have taken a work phone with him. Ms Letnes is a former beauty queen who now manages a fish export business. She has Norwegian residency and has denied any links to Iran's Islamist government. Norwegian intelligence is reported to be investigating her activities now. Mr Sandberg had to hear a reprimand from PM Solberg Prime Minister Erna Solberg said she had ordered Mr Sandberg to hand his phone to police for safety checks. He has also resigned as deputy leader of the Progress Party. ""Per himself asked to step down, and I think it was the right decision,"" Ms Solberg, a Conservative, told reporters. ""He didn't show the necessary common sense when it comes to handling security issues,"" AFP news agency quoted her as saying. Seafood is Norway's second-largest export industry after oil and gas.

"One man displays a penchant for public performance A boat cruise along the River Seine is one of most popular ways to see Paris, but angry locals are worried that a new installation may spoil the experience. Bright-red, fully exposed, urinals have been placed across the city to reduce peeing on the streets. But the eco-friendly devices, which are filled with straw and designed to be odourless, have left many unconvinced. Furious residents are calling for the urinals to be removed and are planning to submit a petition. One particular urinal, which has been placed near Notre Dame cathedral and overlooks passing tourist boats, has been singled out for criticism. Uritrottoir is a combination of the French words for urinal and pavement ""There's no need to put something so immodest and ugly in such an historic spot,"" Paola Pellizzari, who owns a nearby art dealership, told Reuters news agency. ""It's beside the most beautiful townhouse... the Hotel de Lauzun,"" she said, adding that she was worried the urinal ""incites exhibitionism"". ""It's horrible,"" another resident said. ""We're told we have to accept this but this is absolutely unacceptable. Can't people behave?"" The open-air urinals are filled with straw that turns into compost for use in local parks But the local mayor, Ariel Weil, says the urinals are needed. ""If we don't do anything, then men are just going to pee in the streets,"" he told Reuters. ""If it is really bothering people, we will find another location.""

"Police described the location where the children were found as a ""makeshift compound"" A boy whose remains were found in a remote desert compound in New Mexico died during a ""ritual ceremony"", US prosecutors said. The boy's remains were discovered after police rescued 11 malnourished children who were being held at the site. Five adults have been arrested on charges of abusing the children - charges they have denied. The district judge granted all five bail, ruling the prosecution had not conclusively proven they were a threat. Defence lawyers have argued that the prosecution are treating the five suspects unfairly because they are Muslim - something prosecutors deny. US children 'trained to attack schools' Boy's remains found at New Mexico site Police raided the compound, near Amalia, on 6 August as part of their search for a missing three-year-old boy, Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj. Abdul-Ghani was not among the 11 children rescued from the compound - but police later found the remains of a young boy there. Abdul-Ghani's father, Siraj Wahhaj,  is suspected of abducting the boy from his Georgia home in December. Suspects Siraj Wahhaj (L) and Lucas Morton He was arrested at the site, along with Lucas Morten, Jany Leveille, Hujhrah Wahhaj and Subhannah Wahhaj. Prosecutors had argued that the five were dangerous and should not be granted bail, because they had trained the children to use weapons and carry out school shootings. They also said that the remains found at the site belonged to Abdul-Ghani and that the other children said the boy had died during a ""religious ritual... intended to cast out demonic spirits"", where Siraj Wahhaj had put his hand to his son's forehead, and recited verses from the Koran. Abdul-Ghani suffered from seizures, but Mr Wahhaj believed the boy was possessed by the devil and needed to be exorcised, court papers said. An FBI agent told the court that after Abdul-Ghani died, the children were told he would return ""as Jesus"" and tell them where to carry out attacks, an FBI agent told the court. However, Judge Sarah Backus said that while the information she had heard was ""troubling"", prosecutors had not proved that the defendants posed a threat to the wider community. ""The state alleges that there was a big plan afoot, but the state hasn't shown to my satisfaction, in clear and convincing evidence, what that plan was,"" she said. All five must wear ankle monitors and have weekly contact with their lawyers on bail, she ordered. From left to right: Jany Leveille, Hujhrah Wahhaj, Subhannah Wahhaj Defence lawyer Thomas Clark said the prosecution was using a double standard because the suspects are ""black and Muslim"". ""If these people were white and Christian, nobody would bat an eye over the idea of faith healing, or praying over a body or touching a body and quoting scripture,"" he said. He criticised the prosecution for what he said were suggestions that ""when black Muslims do it, there seems to be something nefarious, something evil"". The discovery of the 11 children earlier this month had shocked many in the US. Officers who discovered the children said they looked ""like Third World country refugees not only with no food or fresh water, but with no shoes, personal hygiene and basically dirty rags for clothing"". Authorities had raided the site after receiving a message from someone that read: ""We are starving and need food and water.""
