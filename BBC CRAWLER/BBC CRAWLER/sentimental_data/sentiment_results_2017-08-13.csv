"""No, I'm just looking."" Words most of us have said when approached politely by a sales assistant while browsing in a shop. Most of us will not have then experienced the sales assistant snarling: ""Then 'op it, mate!"" Hearing those words in a London shop made quite an impression on Harry Gordon Selfridge. The year was 1888, and the flamboyant American was touring the great department stores of Europe - in Vienna, Berlin, the famous Bon Marche in Paris and then Manchester and London - to see what tips he could pick up for his then-employer, Chicago's Marshall Field. Field popularised the phrase ""the customer is always right"". Evidently, not yet the case in England. Two decades later, Selfridge was back in London, opening his eponymous department store on Oxford Street - now a global destination for retail, then an unfashionable backwater, but handily near a station on a newly opened Tube line. Selfridges - pictured on its opening day, 15 March 1909 - became renowned for sumptuous window displays Selfridges caused a sensation, partly due to its sheer size: the retail space covered six acres (24,000 sq m). Selfridge also installed the largest glass windows in the world - and created, behind them, the most sumptuous shop displays. But more than scale, what set Selfridges apart was attitude. Harry Gordon Selfridge introduced a whole new shopping experience, one honed in the department stores of late-19th Century America. ""Just looking"" was positively encouraged. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can findmore information about the programme's sourcesandlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. As he had in Chicago, Selfridge swept away the previous custom of stashing merchandise behind locked glass doors in cabinets, or high up on unreachable shelves. Instead, he laid out the open aisle displays we now take for granted, where you can touch a product, pick it up, and inspect it from all angles, without a salesperson hovering by your side. In the full-page newspaper adverts he took out when his store opened, Selfridge compared the ""pleasures of shopping"" to those of ""sightseeing"". Harry Gordon Selfridge revolutionised the shopping experience Shopping had long been bound up with social display. The old arcades of the great European cities, displaying their fine cotton fashions - gorgeously lit with candles and mirrors - were places for the upper classes not only to see, but to be seen. Selfridge had no truck with snobbery or exclusivity. His adverts pointedly welcomed the ""whole British public"": ""No cards of admission are required."" Management consultants nowadays talk about the fortune to be found at the ""bottom of the pyramid"" - Selfridge was way ahead of them. In his Chicago store, he appealed to the working classes by dreaming up the concept of the ""bargain basement"". Selfridge did perhaps more than anyone to invent shopping as we know it. But the ideas were in the air. Another trailblazer was an Irish immigrant named Alexander Turney Stewart. Stewart introduced New Yorkers to the shocking concept of not hassling customers the moment they walked through the door, a novel policy he called ""free entrance"". Alexander T Stewart set his prices low, hoping to make profits from high volumes of sales AT Stewart and Co was among the first stores to practise the now-ubiquitous ""clearance sale"", periodically moving on old stock at knockdown prices to make room for new. Stewart also offered no-quibble refunds. He made customers pay in cash, or settle their bills quickly. Traditionally, shoppers had strung out their lines of credit for up to a year. He also recognised that not everybody liked to haggle, with many welcoming the simplicity of being quoted a fair price, and being told to take it or leave it. Stewart made this ""one-price"" approach work by accepting unusually low mark-ups. ""[I] put my goods on the market at the lowest price I can afford,"" he said, ""although I realise only a small profit on each sale, the enlarged area of business makes possible a large accumulation of capital"". This idea wasn't totally unprecedented, but it was certainly considered radical. The first salesman Stewart hired was appalled to discover he'd not be allowed to apply his finely tuned skill of sizing up the customer's apparent wealth and extracting as extravagant a price as possible. He resigned on the spot, telling the youthful Irish shopkeeper he'd be bankrupt within a month. By the time Stewart died, over five decades later, he was one of the richest men in New York. The great department stores became cathedrals of commerce. At Stewart's ""Marble Palace"", the shopkeeper boasted: ""You may gaze upon a million dollars' worth of goods, and no man will interrupt either your meditation or your admiration."" They took shopping to another level, sometimes literally. Corvin's in Budapest installed a lift that became such an attraction in its own right that they began to charge for using it. In London, Harrods's moving staircase carried 4,000 people an hour. In such shops, one could buy anything from cradles to gravestones. Golf champion John Henry Taylor instructing customers at Harrods in 1914 Harrods offered a full funeral service. There were picture galleries, smoking rooms, tea rooms, concerts. The shop displays bled out into the street, as entrepreneurs built covered galleries around their stores. It was, says historian Frank Trentmann, the birth of ""total shopping"". The glory days of the city centre department store have faded a little. With the rise of cars has come the out-of-town shopping mall, where land is cheaper. Tourists in England still enjoy Harrods and Selfridges, but many also head to Bicester Village, a few miles north of Oxford, an outlet that specialises in luxury brands at a discount. But the experience of going to the shops has changed remarkably little since pioneers such as Stewart and Selfridge turned it on its head. And it may be no coincidence that they did it at a time when women were gaining in social and economic power. There are, of course, some tired stereotypes about women and their supposed love of shopping. But the evidence implies that the stereotypes aren't completely imaginary. How the barcode changed retailing and manufacturing How the lift transformed the shape of our cities The tiny pill which gave birth to an economic revolution TV dinners: The hidden cost of the processed food revolution Time-use studies suggest women spend more time shopping than men. Other research indicates that this is a matter of preference as well as duty: men tend to say they like shops with easy parking and short checkout queues. Women are more likely to prioritise different aspects of the shopping experience, such as the friendliness of sales assistants. This wouldn't have shocked Harry Gordon Selfridge. He saw that female customers offered profitable opportunities that other retailers were bungling. One quietly revolutionary move was that Selfridges featured a ladies' lavatory, a facility London's shopkeepers had hitherto neglected to provide. He saw - as other men apparently had not - that women might want to stay in town all day, without having to use an insalubrious public convenience or retreat to a respectable hotel for tea whenever they wanted to relieve themselves. Selfridges was designed to be as attractive as possible to women Selfridge's biographer Lindy Woodhead even thinks he ""could justifiably claim to have helped emancipate women"".  That's a big claim for a shopkeeper, but social progress can sometimes come from unexpected directions. And Harry Gordon Selfridge certainly saw himself as a social reformer. He once explained why, at his Chicago store, he'd introduced a creche. ""I came along just at the time when women wanted to step out on their own,"" he said. ""They came to the store and realised some of their dreams.""

"Sylvia Mac has spent most of her life trying to conceal the extensive scars which cover her body - the legacy of a childhood accident. Here she explains why, at the age of 48, she decided it was time to stop hiding and come out into the open. There's not actually any part of my body apart from my face that is normal. My burns start from the top of my neck all the way down to the top of my bottom, and then around the front of my stomach and down my left leg. And then on the rest of my body I've got lots of little pinprick holes all down my arms and my legs from where they took skin. I was very badly burned when I was three years old, suffering third- and fourth-degree burns. My mum was boiling water in saucepans for our bath. She would pour the water into bowls and she put the bowls on the bathroom floor. We were just playing around, me and my siblings, and I ran into the bathroom and shut the door. We were told not to go in there. I went in there and my sister pushed the door, and that's when I fell backwards into the bowl of boiling water, causing very bad burns. There was pandemonium in the house, screamingâ¦ I went into shock and was having fits. Then the ambulance arrived. They gathered my family together and told them that I wasn't going to make it through the night. They baptised me and I had my last rites. My first recollection was lying in the hospital bed wrapped in bandages from underneath my arms down to my hips. I remember always being in pain. Whenever I visited the hospital I would have to undress from top to toe and stand on a bed and turn around so that they could inspect my back and the rest of my body, with all the student nurses looking at me. I had nightmares over it. I've probably had hundreds of operations now. When I was growing up a lot of people used to tell my mum, ""Oh, she's beautiful, she's pretty."" But in my head I always thought, ""Why are they saying, 'You're pretty'? I'm not. Underneath my clothes I'm burned."" I always felt ugly, so it's affected me mentally as well as physically. Children would call me different names like ""witch"" and ""snakeskin"", and they were really nasty. I was told that I would never have boyfriends, never get married, never have children. Showing my back was always going to be a negative thing. Hear Sylvia Mac talking to Ena Miller onWoman's Houron BBC Radio 4 I loved swimming - once I was in the water I was in a different world, it was great - but I was terrified about people seeing my body. When everybody got out of the water I'd wait until they went to change and be the last one to sneak out. There was a particular teacher at secondary school, our PE teacher, who decided that we were all going to have showers at the end of the lesson. We all had to queue up with our towels around us. As I got to her, I was pleading with her, ""Please, please, I can't shower, there's no way I can shower,"" and she just pulled off my towel and pushed me into the shower. Having everybody look at me was awful, I just felt like everyone was laughing at me. Eventually my dad wanted me to join the local swimming club. I don't know if he did it in the hope that it would help me open up and meet people, but actually it was quite damaging. I never actually won a race just because of the thought of everybody having to look at me if I did come first. Having my picture taken was always something I avoided - even school photos - so it's difficult to find pictures of me as a youngster. And sometimes I'd get a bit paranoid that people might be taking photos of me even if they weren't. I couldn't go through many things in life, I couldn't sit exams, I couldn't go to job interviews because I just had no confidence and had low self-esteem, and I didn't realise why I was so down and so depressed. It was almost like I was encased in a shell and I couldn't get out, and people never really listened to me. In my teenage years there were times when I thought, ""I'm going to step in front of that bus and just finish my life."" I can't look back now and say it was my mother's fault. But there were times when I took it out on her. I got to a point where I was attacking everybody around me and it was the only way that I could deal with my emotions. I'd literally call people up, like my sisters, and be really nasty to them, a really vile, nasty, horrible person. Relationships were very difficult. When I used to go out clubbing with my friends, I'd dance with guys and they'd be rubbing their hands up my back and they'd whisper in my ear, ""Oh, that's really nice, you're wearing a basque or a corset."" They could feel the burns, they were like ropes - they still are today. And I'd just walk away. This video can not be played Sylvia Mac spoke to Ena Miller about living with her scars Eventually I met a really lovely guy and we just got talking all night. I explained to him about my burns because I felt so comfortable, he was a really good friend. He said he didn't have any problem with it, and that I was still beautiful. I was in love straight away because he accepted me. It just felt right. I've gone on to have three children with him and a grandchild. Last year I was on holiday with my mum. We were at the pool, it was quite busy and the sun beds were close together. I had a bikini on. We were sitting down and I noticed the guy behind us pointing his phone towards me so I decided to get up. He moved his phone to follow me and every time I moved he followed me with his phone, so I knew then he was recording me. It was really upsetting me so I said to my mum, ""This is horrible, I want to get out of here."" So she said, ""Let's go to the beach."" I saw my mum sitting on the sun lounger and she had her head down, and I remember just seeing her so sad, it was quite upsetting actually. I realised that what I've gone through has affected her as well. I had always noticed her looking at my burns. I wanted to say something to her - to say, ""It's OK, I'm OK."" At that moment something just clicked in my brain and I decided that I was going to draw a line and make her happy. I took my dress off and I walked down to the edge. People were looking at me and I looked at my mum and I smiled, and I went, ""Mum! Look! Look at me!"" And she started to smile. I put my hands on my hips and I started to pose on the water's edge and she was so happy. I went over to her and I said, ""From now on I'm going to let people take pictures, and every time they do I'm going to smile and I'm going to pose."" I think that moment on the beach was just a turning point where I realised that no counselling, nothing on Google, was going to help me. It was time for me to help myself. I went out and bought a swimming costume - it had a big hole in the back - and then I set up my swimming classes at my local pool in Highbury, north London. I invite people with disfigurements to come and swim. When I'm in the water and I'm swimming I just feel at peace, I feel calm, and I can think of lots of wonderful things. I also started a website,Love Disfigure,external, and became active on social media to raise awareness and show support for those living with a disfigurement. It may comfort people to know there are others out there going through the same thing. Find out how to get into swimming with theGet Inspired guide I talk to a lot of people that have been burned, too. There are youngsters who want to kill themselves when they've just been burned, and I try to tell them, ""Look, I've got all the way through my life and you can do this too."" It's been such a long journey. It's like taking off a coat and saying, ""This is me now, and I don't care what people think."" I've noticed a big change in my life and I've been able to accept the way I look. My message to people with disfigurement is to just go for it, do whatever you want to do in life. Don't let anything stop you or stand in your way.

"The day Giles Fuchs learned he had failed his A-levels, his family gathered around the dining table for dinner as normal. His father didn't say a word during the meal, waiting until the plates had been cleared to turn to his son and say: ""Giles, I hope you're good with your hands."" Hoping to prove his dad wrong despite the dismal results, the next day Mr Fuchs knocked on the door of the biggest estate agent chain in Northamptonshire to ask for a job. ""I'll be the best negotiator you've ever had,"" the teenager told the manager. ""Can you start on Monday?"" was his response. Today a multi-millionaire 52-year-old, and co-founder and boss of UK serviced office business Office Space In Town (OSIT), Mr Fuchs says that the three years he spent working for that estate agency in the East Midlands gave him an invaluable grounding. OSIT's buildings are designed to unique theme, in this case Alice in Wonderland ""It taught me how to interact with people - and how to sell,"" he says. Ambitious to be his own boss, at the age of 21 Mr Fuchs opened his own firm of estate agents with a friend in 1987. The business was a success, and numerous other profitable ventures followed, including a disaster recovery company, until in 2010 he decided to join forces with his sister Niki and launch OSIT. Just seven years later OSIT enjoys annual revenues of more than Â£20m. Now valued at Â£200m, it has six buildings in London, and a further four in other parts of the UK. Tenants at its office near Monument in the City of London have access to a roof terrace Serviced offices provide everything an entrepreneur or company needs to go into business. In addition to office space, they have internet access, desks, chairs, meeting rooms and even reception staff they can rely on. The decision of Mr Fuchs and his sister to start OSIT was very much them following in the family tradition, as back in 1979 their mother had set up the first such businesses in the UK. Niki had taken over the running of her mother's business, City Executive Centres, and Mr Fuchs joined her in the early 2000s, before the business was ultimately sold in 2005. OSIT's first office opened in January 2011 in the Euston Tower in central London, using leased space. Giles and his sister Niki divide up the workload However, a year later OSIT was able to start buying its own buildings, after joining forces with a property fund. Mr Fuchs says this development was pivotal. ""That turned us from being a serviced office manager, into a property company - and a successful one."" As the owner of its own buildings, OSIT has more freedom to design and fit them out to its own specifications. To stand out from the crowd, its interiors are all designed to a different, and some might say - outlandish - theme, from board game Monopoly to Alice in Wonderland and the interior of a luxury yacht. The interiors of the offices are far from dull Mr Fuchs says this gives each building a unique ""character and personality"". Owning its buildings, rather than leasing them, has also made it easier for OSIT to add extra facilities, such as hair salons, gyms, cafes, bars and hotel rooms. It also means that OSIT can lower its fees in the event of an economic downturn, as well as reap the gains as the value of commercial property rises. That's not to say that Mr Fuchs is expecting to cut charges any time soon. A firm advocate of Brexit, he believes the pain of leaving the European Union will prove to be ""a storm in a teacup... the truth is, Britain is doing really well"". He adds that while the fall in the value of the pound has helped exporters, it has also made investing in the UK more attractive to foreign entities. ""There is a wall of money arriving in London at the moment,"" he says. Last year a Chinese real estate asset manager called Kailong took a stake in OSIT for an undisclosed sum, and Mr Fuchs argues that the serviced office sector will continue to grow more appealing to investors. The company currently doesn't have any plans to expand overseas Currently the serviced office sector accounts for 7% of the UK office market. This is worth Â£16bn, according to a report last year by research group Capital Economics, which predicts that the UK industry will rise to just over Â£60bn by 2025. Andrew Shepherd-Barron, a serviced office sector analyst at Peel Hunt, agrees that the sector is ripe for further expansion. MoreThe Bossfeatures, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world: The Swedish physicist revolutionising birth control The restaurateur who puts hospitality above food How Bite Beauty is building an all-natural lipstick business The millionaire boss who admits he had a lot of luck He says that this growth is led by companies - both big and small - increasingly wanting the flexibility that serviced offices can offer, rather than being tied into long traditional office hire leases. At OSIT while Mr Fuchs has the chief executive title, his sister is managing director. He explains how they divide up the workload:  ""Niki looks into the business, running the business operationally, day-to-day. Mr Fuchs' mother opened the UK's first serviced office in this building in Northampton ""I look out, raising finance, finding buildings, and creating strategy."" He adds that working with his sister is a ""fabulous experience"". ""I absolutely know she's got my back covered."" While Mr Fuchs may not have done well in his A-levels, he says that his dad is very pleased - not unsurprisingly - with what he has gone on to achieve. ""Both our parents are very proud [of both Niki and me],"" he says. ""My mother started the [serviced offices] industry in the UK in 1979, in a tiny building in Northampton, and they are exceptionally pleased that we have picked up the baton and run with it.""

"The cuteness does nothing for Elizabeth Ohene In our series of letters from African writers, veteran Ghanaian journalist Elizabeth Ohene reflects on her lack of passion for ""man's best friend"". I note that a Nigerian court recently cleared a man who had been charged with conduct likely to cause a breach of the peace for naming his dog after President Muhammadu Buhari. The man said he did it out of love: ""I named my beloved pet dog, Buhari, who is my hero... My admiration for Buhari started far back when he was a military head of state."" Regardless of my love or otherwise for a head of state I am unlikely to ever face the kind of problem that led to this man's entanglement with the law. I do not own a dog, have never owned one, have never been tempted to own one, and will never own a dog. Dogs just do not feature in my world. My story, or to be accurate, my non-story about dogs has to do with the place I call my hometown, Abutia, which is a little village in the Volta Region of Ghana. I lived with my grandmother in Abutia, between the ages of five and nine, and I never saw a dog. I suspect that the first time was after I left Abutia as dogs are not allowed in the village, neither at that time or now. And it was only when I left Abutia that it dawned on me that dogs can play a major role in people's lives. I went to San Francisco and was taken to a pet cemetery which was far, far more beautiful than any cemetery I had seen for human beings. I met someone laying a bunch of beautiful flowers on the grave of his dog which had died five years previously. I decided I would let people have their dogs and I will keep out of their way. Then I went to live in the United Kingdom and I discovered dogs occupied an elevated place in the lives of the natives there. I saw dogs being cuddled and being kissed, I saw dogs licking the faces and mouths of their owners. I saw dogs lying on sofas and beds and I saw dogs being groomed in very fancy and expensive salons. I noted that every news report about famine and unrest anywhere contained a line about a hungry dog. I noted the frequency with which Queen Elizabeth's corgis got mentioned. I came close to changing my position on dogs when I got mesmerised by the guide dog of visually-impaired cabinet minister David Blunkett. I decided I should make an effort to learn the ways of my hosts and learn about dogs. I went to the greyhound races in Oxford with friends. It was a great outing but it did nothing for me in raising the status of dogs in my estimation. Dogs get to show off their skills at the Crufts competition In 1987, I became very excited when the dog belonging to someone with a Ghanaian sounding name - Chris Amoo - won the top prize at Britain's premier canine show, Crufts, with his Afghan hound. The next year I surreptitiously went to the Crufts show and saw dogs at their most exotic. I tried, but I am afraid after living in the UK for 19 years I stuck firmly to my Abutia upbringing: No dogs. Elizabeth Ohene: Dogs just do not feature in my world. I should state that my position and the attitude in Abutia is not universal in Ghana. Increasingly, we have ferocious guard dogs. And there are some people here who do have pet dogs; we once had a first lady who attested to having dogs that she named Candy and Sweetie Pie. Indeed, there are parts of Ghana where dogs are a delicacy. I make no comments about that. But in the place where I come from, no-one has to think about a name for a dog as they do not exist there. So there is no danger I will be caught naming a dog after friend or foe.

"J Balvin has scored his first truly global smash with Mi Gente Earlier this summer, Luis Fonsi'sDespacitobecame the most-streamed song of all time - an incredible feat for a record that's predominantly in Spanish. But it increasingly looks like it won't be a one-off. Another Latin American song,Mi Gente,external, has replaced Despacito at the top of Spotify's Global Top 50. Here in the UK, it's just broken into the top 20. ""It's amazing. It's such a blessing,"" says singer J Balvin, the Colombian artist who's behind the song. Already a huge star in South America, Balvin has been credited with revitalising reggaeton - a hip-hop-infused blend of reggae and rap that originated in Puerto Rico in the late 1990s. Over the course of four albums, he's taken the genre once called ""reggae en Espanol"" and infused it with African, electronic and Caribbean flavours. Despacito breaks global streaming record The secrets of a hit summer song Gangnam Style loses YouTube crown More importantly, his lyrics trade reggaeton's gritty, underground roots for a more universal, romantic narrative. ""Mi mÃºsica no discrimina a nadie,"" he sings in Mi Gente, meaning ""my music doesn't discriminate against anybody"". ""Exactly!"" says the star, when we reference the lyric. ""I'm Latino but I don't do music for Latinos. My music is for everybody in the world. ""Music has to be a tool to unite people, to get people together. It doesn't matter the race, the language, the culture. So that's what I'm saying when I sing that line."" The colourful video for Mi Gente makes the most of J Balvin's idiosyncratic style The global perspective is evident on Mi Gente, which has its roots in a French track -Voodoo Song,external, by Willy William. That song, with its chopped-up vocals samples and hopscotch drumbeats, provides a bonkers backbone to Balvin's hit (which William also produced and sings on). ""We took a risk to make new music, new colours, new ways,"" says Balvin. ""It's crazy what we created."" So what lies behind this sudden explosion in music from Latin America? Aside from Luis Fonsi and J Balvin's megahits, there are five other Spanish-language songs in the Spotify top 50. Sir Lucian Grainge, head of Universal Records, says streaming is the key - giving Latin American artists a platform they would never have received on US (and UK) linguistically conservative radio stations. ""Streaming has changed the face of music discovery and music consumption,""he told the BBClast month. ""We're at the forefront of a new creative era [where] anyone who is good can find an audience."" ""The beautiful thing about streaming is that people arelookingfor this stuff,"" stresses Balvin. ""It's like, they really want to play this music. They're looking for it especially. It's the people talking."" This video can not be played Luis Fonsi's Despacito has become the most-streamed song of all time. Spotify itself has been actively promoting Latin American music in regions outside South America - not least because Mexico and Brazil are two of the streaming service's biggest markets. ""We're proactively trying to push its consumption in countries like Germany, Italy, Switzerland, the UK [and] obviously the US,"" said Rocio Guerrero, Spotify's head of Latin culture. ""There has been a domino effect,"" sherecently told Billboard magazine,external. ""The more songs that we put on the global chart, people are getting more used to listening to songs in a different language."" Balvin has his own take on the phenomenon: ""Well, I think right now kids and the whole world is more open minded,"" he tells the BBC on the phone from Uruguay. ""People are just more open to listening to good vibes, even though they don't understand the words. ""That's beautiful. That's amazing. It's like we're showing the world this is not luck... This is really down to good faith and hard work."" Energia, the singer's fourth album, won best urban album at the 2016 Latin Grammy Awards Balvin has certainly put in the hours since launching his music career 11 years ago. Born JosÃ© Ãlvaro Osorio Balvin, he grew up in Medellin, a striking, hilltop metropolis that was once branded ""the most dangerous city on earth"" - thanks largely to the cocaine-trafficking cartel run by Pablo Escobar. The young musician was largely insulated from that seedy side of the city, growing up in a large house with his well-off family - although they fell on hard times when his economist father went bankrupt in his teenage years. He wasn't particularly aware of reggaeton, sound-tracking his childhood with US rock bands like Metallica and Nirvana. ""Since I was eight, I started playing guitar and that's how I fell in love with Nirvana,"" says the star, who has the band's name tattooed on his knee. ""It's such amazing music. It's a big part of my life."" Aged 18, he went to the US as an exchange student, and discovered hip-hop culture - then spent the next few years bouncing between Medellin, Miami and New York, trying to launch a music career while working illegally in the US as a roofer. It wasn't until he settled back in Colombia and joined a production team called Infinity Music that he started to build a reputation locally, tirelessly promoting his music around the country. ""We travelled by bus, ate the cheapest fast food, spent hours and hours outside radio stations,"" Infinity Music's Juan Pablo Piedrahitarecalled to The Fader in 2015,external. ""We don't want to follow nobody,"" says the star. ""We just want to be us."" The grind paid off: Balvin was signed to EMI Colombia in 2009 and subsequently set up a 360 deal with Universal subsidiary Capitol Latin. All four of the singles from his second album La Familia charted in Colombia's top 10, and he was a featured vocalist on the Colombian version of Robin Thicke's hit singleBlurred Lines,external.  His break-up balladAy Vamos,external, meanwhile, racked up one billion views on YouTube - the first ""urban"" Latin track to do so. Now Balvin is edging on to the world stage. His last album, Energia featured collaborations with Pitbull, Camilla Cabello and Pharrell Williams, while the star found himself watching Kanye West record last year's Life Of Pablo album. ""I went to the studio the day Kanye was doing Ultralight Beams and it was just amazing to see how he works,"" the 32-year-old marvels. ""He would brainstorm with his crew, and they all wanted to find the best idea. It really opened up my mind -  I want to apply that to my own work."" The singer is already one of the biggest stars in Latin America One lesson he won't be taking from the famously mercurial Kanye, however, is how to handle his social media accounts. Balvin is an engaging, witty presence online, posting all of his own messages himself. He's even recorded a song calledSnapchat,externaland another,Ginza,external, which is named after an Instagram filter. ""I can't lie: the phone is like my right hand,"" he jokes. ""But right now the best way to keep connected with people, with your fanbase is through your cell phone. ""I'm on it all the time - but I'll turn it off when I'm going to sleep. I just want to get those frequencies out of my brain, so I turn it off and I take it outside."" When he's not posting photographs from the stage of his current tour, Balvin is ""working like crazy"" on his next album which, he says, will represent both sides of his musical personality - ""the global side and the Latino side"". And, despite having the world's most listened-to song, his ambition is undiminished. ""I want to go bigger,"" he says. ""Everything started with a dream. I dreamt about having one of the biggest Latin albums, I dreamt I'd be a global artist. ""And dreams do come true.""

"Nationalists descended on Charlottesville to defend a Confederate statue In the middle of Emancipation Park in Charlottesville on Saturday, two young women, one white and one black, took each other's hands and held them tightly, and with their other hands they gripped the steel barrier in front of them. A few feet away, a young white man with a buzzed haircut and sunglasses leaned towards them over a facing barrier. ""You'll be on the first f*****g boat home,"" he screamed at the black woman, before turning to the white woman. ""And as for you,"" he said coolly, ""you're going straight to hell."" Then he gave a Nazi salute. For the third time in a few months, white nationalists had descended on the small, liberal city of Charlottesville in the southern state of Virginia, to protest against the planned removal of a statue of Confederate general Robert E Lee. This time they came under the banner of the so-called ""alt-right"", for a rally they called ""Unite the Right"". They were a motley crew of militia, racists, and neo-Nazis, and some who said they simply wanted to defend their Southern history. They gathered early in the morning at Emancipation Park - formerly Lee Park - where the statue sits. Some were dressed in full tactical gear and openly carrying rifles. Others wore black shirts, helmets, and boots. In a column they surged into the park, using sticks and their fists to shove aside anti-fascist counter-protesters. Then they blocked off the entrance with shields. Inside, David Duke, the former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, grinned and waved as the crowd, almost entirely white and male, cheered him on, chanting his name and putting their arms up in Nazi salutes. They had reason to be pleased. They were in the middle of the largest gathering of white nationalists in America for decades. Nationalists clash with counter-protesters at the entrance to Emancipation Park White nationalist militia descended on Charlottesville armed with rifles and handguns In the park, in a pen ringed by steel barriers, the nationalists shouted anti-immigrant, anti-semitic and racist slogans and targeted white women counter-protesters, calling them ""traitors"" who ""needed to get subjugated"". Outside, anti-fascist protesters threw bottles, rocks and paint and chanted ""Off our streets, Nazi scum"". Pepper spray, used by both sides, filled the air. Eventually, riot police moved into the park and the streets around it, pushing everyone back. The governor of Virginia declared a state of emergency and the rally was cancelled. The national guard began to close off the area, but not before a driver ploughed into a crowd of counter-protesters two blocks away, killing a young woman and injuring 19 others. Twenty-four hours earlier, Reverend Brenda Brown-Grooms closed her eyes and prayed for peace. Sitting in a side room at St Paul's Memorial Church, while volunteers undertook non-violent resistance training next door, she prepared herself for a ""reckoning"" the following day in her home town. ""This is physically a very beautiful place, it has always been my template for what a city should look like,"" she said. ""But I've always understood that this beautiful place is also quite ugly. And the statue has become the match point for that ugliness."" Reverend Brown-Grooms was born in Charlottesville in 1955. She grew up in Vinegar Hill, a black neighbourhood since razed to the ground in one of a series of redevelopment programmes that pushed the black community out of the city and into housing projects. As a girl, under segregation, she did not dare set foot in the white neighbourhood which was home to Emancipation Park - then Lee Park - and she had never been there until May, when the KKK came to town and lit torches under the statue. ""This summer has been one long prayer here in Charlottesville,"" she said. ""And now today we are praying again, we are praying that the alt-right don't start something tonight, ahead of the rally."" Rev Brenda Brown-Grooms: ""This beautiful place is also quite ugly"" Within a few hours, her prayer went unanswered. About 200 white nationalists gathered after dark in Nameless Field, down the road from where she sat, and marched through the University of Virginia campus holding torches. They chanted ""Blood and soil"" - an old Nazi slogan - and ""Jews will not replace us"". At the base of the university's statue of Thomas Jefferson, on the Main Street side of the campus, they were met by university students who came to resist them, linking arms and surrounding the statue. The air was hot from the torches and acrid from smoke. ""The heat here is nothing compared to what you're going to get in the ovens,"" shouted Robert Ray, a writer for the white supremacist website Daily Stormer. ""It's coming,"" he spat. ""White supremacists walking through my university with torches, I never thought I'd have to see this in America in my lifetime,"" said one of the counter-protesters, a student who did not want to be named. Hundreds of white nationalists gathered at the UVA statue of Thomas Jefferson on Friday night Directly across the street, at the same time, more than 500 people were packed into St. Paul's church for a multi-faith service. There were readings from the Bible and the Koran, spirituals sung by a choir, and a speech by activist and Harvard professor Dr Cornel West that drew everyone in the house to their feet. ""It is bleak that we are about to see the largest neo-fascist gathering in decades, but it is also a joy to be able to struggle against it, to bear witness to it,"" said Dr West after the service. ""The alt-right is a new danger. We have a right-wing gangster in the White House who emboldens them, who empowers them. So they feel they have permission for their hate to come out in public, and maybe even harm others. We are in a dangerous moment."" As the service drew to a close, and the last spirituals were sung, the congregation filed slowly out of a side door to avoid the white nationalists who were walking back up Main Street. The speakers booked for the rally in Charlottesville were all men. The people who came to attend the rally were almost all men, and across the country the following of the so-called ""alt-right"" is overwhelmingly male. One of the few women who speaks regularly at white nationalist events is Avialae Horton, a 20-year-old from Georgia who is editor of the Revolutionary Conservative, an online, right-wing newspaper with a mission to ""defend Western civilisation"". The members of the ""new-right"" are being unfairly branded as ""Nazis and fascists"", she said in Charlottesville ahead of the rally. ""We stand in confidence in our convictions, irrespective of what others think of that. And I absolutely believe that we have been misrepresented."" Speakers from the white nationalist movement claim its members are being misrepresented Three women from the Revolutionary Conservative flew into Charlottesville for the rally. They preach what they call ""racial realism"", which they say is not racism. ""It's natural for people to want to be with their own kind, and to look to their own interests,"" said RS McCoy, another member of staff from the paper, who came from California. ""We're going to care about our interests first, black people are going to care about their interests first, and even moving outside of race into things like LGBT, they're going to care about their interests first. And that is not bad, it doesn't have to be demonised."" Charlottesville victim was 'a strong woman' White supremacists face backlash Who is the car-ramming attack suspect? The removal of the Robert E Lee statue in Charlottesville, and the removal of other Confederate statues in the South, threatened to strip away American history, Ms McCoy said. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, more than 60 Confederate monuments or symbols have been removed or renamed since the 2015 massacre of nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, by white supremacist Dylann Roof. Tearing down the statues was depriving black Americans of the chance to learn their own history, said Ms McCoy. ""If we look at it from their perspective even, which is you know - Oh we've had slavery and racism and all these horrible things and we want to make this go away, so we're going to tear down monuments and rename all these streets - how are future generations going to learn?"" Standing in the middle of Emancipation Park on Friday, looking up at the statue of Robert E Lee, the city's deputy mayor Wes Bellamy took a different view. ""I've been told I will be hung from this"": Wes Bellamy looks on at the Robert E Lee statue Mr Bellamy is the first black deputy mayor of the city. A sharply-dressed, outgoing character, emphatic in his desire to see the statue removed - ""155%"" - he has become a lightning rod for people who believe their heritage is being torn up. ""I get hate mail and death threats every day. I've been told I will be hung from this statue. I've been told I will be hung from the trees in this park,"" he said. ""But that lets you know what you're doing is right. How can you have a 28ft statue to a man who, if he were alive today, I would not be allowed to look in the eye? Who, if he were walking down the street, would make me walk off the sidewalk? How can we have that statue here, if we are to be an equitable city?"" Mr Bellamy stopped in the park to speak to residents, who congratulated him on passing his doctorate that day, and to local police officers, some of whom he knew by name. Then he headed off, under strict instructions from police, as the white nationalists came into town, to keep his whereabouts on Saturday a secret. As the National Guard closed down the streets around Emancipation Park on Saturday evening, the protesters dissipated into smaller skirmishes nearby. Daryl Vaughan, 24, who came from Newcastle, Virginia to join the white nationalists, got caught alone, surrounded by anti-fascist protesters who beat him, kicking him in the face and chest as he lay on the ground. Bloodied, he retreated to a side street. ""They've come here to take my history away, to make my history look bad,"" he said. ""Black lives matter, that's bullshit to me."" A few hundred white nationalists moved north and gathered in McIntyre Park, but with little attention on them in the large, open park, they began to disperse, some marching in a column along the highway to their cars, while passing drivers honked in support or hurled abuse. Daryl Vaughan, 24, was surrounded and beaten by counter-protesters Slowly the chaos and violence of earlier gave way to reflection and to tragedy. A 32-year-old woman had been killed, run over by a man who ploughed into peaceful counter-protesters on the street near Emancipation Park, and who was later arrested and charged with murder. In a separate incident, two state police employees died when their helicopter, which had hovered over downtown Charlottesville for most of the day observing the rally, crashed. ""Condolences to the family of the young woman killed today, and best regards to all of those injured, in Charlottesville, Virginia. So sad!,"" the president tweeted. It was left to Terry McAuliffe, the governor of Virginia, to condemn the white nationalists that poured into the city from around the country. ""Go home,"" he said at a press conference. ""There is no place for you here."" Three years ago, the US National Bureau of Economic Research named Charlottesville America's happiest city. ""Joy Town, USA"", the media called it. But spirits were low around Joy Town on Saturday. ""I wonder if Charlottesville will ever be the same after this,"" said Henry McHenry, 63, as he watched the National Guard march past his home of 30 years. ""We must get past this state of us against them,"" he said. Late on Saturday night, after a long day that began with a dawn prayer service at 6am, Reverend Brown-Grooms tried to make some sense of what she had seen on the streets of her city that day. ""I come from a people who were enslaved, and to make it through that misery there has to be a spirit which allows you to see past what your eyes see in front of you and what your ears hear, and to understand how hope forms in your heart,"" she said. ""As our people used to say, trouble don't last always. It might last all of my lifetime, but not always."" Governor tells supremacists: 'Go home' Car rams into crowd at Virginia rally.

"A farmer cuts back weeds on his coca plantation in La Carmelita In the remote region of Putumayo in southern Colombia, the economy depends almost entirely on one thing: coca, the raw ingredient for cocaine. From the stores that sell fertiliser and pesticides, to the ubiquitous pool halls where ""raspachines"" (field hands who harvest the coca leaves) come to spend their modest earnings on cold beer and fried empanadas, it all comes back to one plant. Colombia's government wants to change this, as part of the peace deal it reached with the country's left-wing rebel group, theRevolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia(Farc) last year. It will not be an easy task. ""Everyone from here who has gone to university has done so because of money from growing coca,"" explains Jon, who has been harvesting the leaf since childhood and is now studying forensic science at a technical institute in Mocoa, Putumayo's capital. A ""raspachin"" (field hand) takes a break from processing coca leaves in the jungle of Putumayo As per the terms of the peace deal, the government has signed up almost 76,000 families to an ambitious campaign to substitute the growing of coca, poppy and marijuana with legal agricultural projects. Jon's family was one of 500 selected from the communities around the village of La Carmelita to participate in a pilot of the national programme. Read more: Colombia coca cultivation on the rise Colombia's coca crop plan Has Plan Colombia really worked? Who are the Farc? Success, in the long term, will depend not only on the viability of the new crops, but on the state's ability to transform its relationship with the marginalised regions where the 50-year armed conflict raged. ""For years, we've made clear that we're committed to leaving coca behind, given certain necessary conditions for our survival,"" said Luz Deify VelÃ¡zquez Quintero, a community leader in La Carmelita. Residents of La Carmelita hope the government is committed to the programme ""Now it's time to find out if the government is serious."" This is not the first attempt to wean Putumayo off growing coca. La Carmelita residents saw little of the money earmarked for ""alternative development"" Under the US-backed Plan Colombia, the authorities attempted to eradicate the plants from the air by spraying them with herbicides. Hundreds of millions of dollars were also channelled to the country for ""alternative development"" assistance, resources that locals say rarely found their way to Putumayo and the pockets of farmers there. While the new programme is largely welcomed by La Carmelita's coca growers, distrust of government programmes is an all-too-familiar sentiment. ""Unless there's transparency and a real willingness to involve and empower the communities, what's most likely is that people end up going back to coca,"" warns Yuli Zuluaga, a regional representative of a recently formed national coca-grower's association. Government officials say they have learned the lessons of Plan Colombia. They think that having former Farc rebels on board will make a big difference. The rebels financed their armed struggle through ""taxes"" on coca production and therefore had a vested interest in the business flourishing. But even with a peace process now firmly in place, challenges remain. In June, participants in the pilot scheme received the first of six bimonthly food subsidies worth 2m Colombian pesos ($665; Â£500) each. In exchange, those who received it have promised to take part in a two-month voluntary coca eradication scheme. The border village of Teteye, just 20km from La Carmelita, has no electricity, water or sewerage system But whether the farmers' new projects will be productive will ultimately depend on whether money is invested in Putumayo's poor healthcare, education, and infrastructure, conflict monitoring groupIdeas for Peace Foundation,externalconcluded in a recent report. There are no hospitals or drinking water and only little electricity for miles in any direction from La Carmelita. The only adequately funded public institutions are the military bases built to protect the region's oil pipelines. ""The problem isn't figuring out what to produce,"" explained JesÃºs Antonio Toro MartÃ­nez, president of Agropal, a local farmer's association. JesÃºs Antonio Toro MartÃ­nez has left behind coca farming to grow plantains ""The problem is that we don't have electricity to store it, we don't have the equipment to process it, and we don't have roads to bring it to market. In other words, we don't have commerce."" Mr Toro, a local farmer and former ""raspachin"", says that taking plantains to the nearest urban centre if Puerto AsÃ­s is no easy task. He says that the costs for transporting bundles on speed boats or local buses known as ""chivas"" can add up to as much as 90% of the final sale value. In March, the US released figures suggesting that a record 188,000 hectares (1,880 sq km) of land in Colombia had been planted with coca last year, an 18% increase compared with 2015. The government hopes La Carmelita residents will move away from planting coca for good and dedicate themselves to other trades The report triggered renewed claims from opponents to the peace process in Colombia and conservatives in Washington that the government's reformist approach has promoted lawlessness. With pressure mounting and the 2018 national elections looming, President Juan Manuel Santos announced that he intends to eradicate 100,000 hectares by next year, half through substitution, and half through manual eradication. ""We need results, to prove to ourselves, to the country, and to the world that this is the right way forward,"" Miguel Ortega, a government substitution official, told La Carmelita residents.

"This video can not be played The events in Charlottesville were the culmination of months of protests by white supremacists The White House has defended President Donald Trump's reaction to deadly violence over a white supremacist rally in Virginia, amid criticism he did not explicitly condemn far-right groups. But a spokesman said his condemnation included white supremacists. A woman was killed on Saturday when a car rammed into a crowd protesting against the rally in Charlottesville. Separately, a rally organiser was chased away by protesters as he tried to give a press conference on Sunday. Jason Kessler, who organised the ""Unite the Right"" march, was heckled and booed as he blamed the police for not preventing the violence, which he also condemned. This video can not be played Jason Kessler was booed and chased away from his press conference, as the BBC's Joel Gunter reports Nineteen people were injured in the car-ramming incident, and another 15 people were wounded in separate clashes related to the far-right march on Saturday afternoon. Charlottesville victim was 'a strong woman' White supremacists face backlash A reckoning in Charlottesville Who is the car-ramming attack suspect? Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Monday said the deadly violence met ""the definition of domestic terrorism"", adding that the Justice Department was pursuing a case. ""You can be sure we will charge and advance the investigation towards the most serious charges that can be brought because this is unequivocally an unacceptable evil attack,"" he said on ABC News' Good Morning America. He told the television programme that FBI agents from the terrorism and civil rights divisions were also investigating the matter. Protests and vigils in support of Charlottesville were held in many US cities on Sunday. In Seattle, police used pepper spray to stop protesters approaching a pro-Trump rally. Hours after the violence erupted, Mr Trump said he condemned ""in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides"". ""The hate and the division must stop right now,"" he told reporters in New Jersey, where he is on a working holiday. ""We have to come together as Americans with love for our nation."" But his comments did not explicitly condemn the white extremist groups involved in the rally, an omission that was strongly criticised by Republicans and Democrats alike. This video can not be played The US president ignored questions over whether his response went far enough Many, including senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, echoed the sentiment of Colorado Senator Cory Gardner, who tweeted: ""Mr President - we must call evil by its name. These were white supremacists and this was domestic terrorism."" The president's national security adviser, HR McMaster, went further by commenting: ""Anytime that you commit an attack against people to incite fear, it meets the definition of terrorism."" Mr Trump's daughter too also appeared to offer stronger condemnation than her father. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The mayor of Charlottesville, Democrat Mike Signer, drew a link between the events and the rhetoric of Mr Trump's 2016 presidential campaign,saying,externalthat ""these anti-Semites, racists, Aryans, neo-Nazis, KKK"" had come out of the shadows after having ""been given a key and a reason to come into the light"". In response to the criticism, the White House issued a statement on Sunday clarifying that Mr Trump's condemnation had included white supremacists. ""The president said very strongly in his statement yesterday that he condemns all forms of violence, bigotry and hatred. Of course that includes white supremacists, KKK, neo-Nazi and all extremist groups,"" a spokesperson said. In pictures: Charlottesville protest GoDaddy expels US neo-Nazi website Mr Sessions also came to the president's defence on Monday, saying he ""explicitly condemned the kind of ideology behind these movements of Nazism, white supremacy, the KKK."" That is his unequivocal position,"" Mr Sessions said, ""He totally opposes those kind of values"". Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter Clues for how the president would react to such a situation were scattered across his presidential campaign. In February 2016, Mr Trump initially declined to disavow support from the Ku Klux Klan and David Duke, the former Klan leader who became a Louisiana Republican politician. ""Any candidate who cannot immediately condemn a hate group like the KKK does not represent the Republican Party, and will not unite it,"" said Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, the first black Republican elected from a Southern state since 1881. After a week, Mr Trump gave a firm statement denouncing the KKK, but his initial hesitance would be an issue for the remainder of his presidential race. If, as Mr Trump's critics suggest, his statements following the Charlottesville incident were yet another ""dog whistle"" to white supremacists, there's evidence that the message was clearly heard.

The far-right demonstrators, who included neo-Nazis and Ku Klux Klan (KKK) members, clashed violently with counter-protesters. A 32-year-old woman, Heather D Heyer, was later killed when a car was driven into a crowd of dispersing counter-protesters. Ms Heyer's mother paid tribute to her daughter, who was a civil rights activist and lawyer. A makeshift memorial has been set up at the site of the incident ""She always had a very strong sense of right and wrong, she always, even as a child, was very caught up in what she believed to be fair,""she told the Huffington Post,external.

"The violence in Charlottesville is considered in the editorial columns. Much of the focus is on President Donald Trump's failure to single out  for blame the white supremacists who rallied there. The Guardian says,externalhe utterly failed in his primary duty to uphold equality and speak the truth about the racist violence that had taken place. ""Mr Trump's words were by turns slippery, banal and morally compromised,"" it concludes. For the Financial Times,external, Mr Trump's condemnation only of ""violence on many sides"" had the ""subtlety of a billy club"". It says senior Republicans must fill the void of moral leadership. The Daily Mirror,externalsays it shows an ""even more sinister side"" to Mr Trump than the sexism, crassness and bullying it says we already knew about. In its dispatch from Charlottesville,the Daily Telegraph,externalhears from some of those who took part in the rally. One of them denies being ""an angry racist"", saying white nationalists ""aren't all hateful"", adding that ""we just want to preserve what we have"". The Times,externalleads on claims by ""senior Whitehall officials"" that Brexit decisions are being ""rushed through."" It says concerns have been raised that a series of government policy papers - to be released in the coming weeks - are being put together in ""essay crisis mode"". A ""well placed Whitehall figure"" tells that paper it is either an attempt to avoid proper scrutiny, or further proof ministers weren't ready for Brexit when they triggered Article 50. Theresa May will return from her summer holiday on Monday The European Union will seek to implement more rigorous screening of the foreign takeovers of European companies, according tothe Financial Times,external. The paper says the issue has risen up the EU's political agenda because of growing fears that China wants to buy European know-how, while heavily restricting investment in its own domestic market. It also points out that EU leaders have previously clashed over what kind of action to pursue, with nations such as the Nordic countries resisting a formal mechanism to restrict foreign takeovers. The Daily Mail,externalleads on plans to give millions of people checks for what it calls ""silent killer"" conditions at GP surgeries and pharmacies in England. It is hoped the strategy will bring down the number of people - currently estimated at seven million - who are unaware they have disorders such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol and irregular heartbeats. The Mail says it will be backed by ""hard-hitting campaigns on Facebook and local radio"", telling adults to get themselves checked. The Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg spent the weekend playing down reports he has prime-ministerial ambitions. He has now written an article inthe Daily Telegraph,externalheadlined: ""I don't want to be prime minister, but if I was, here's what the Conservative Party would do"". In it, he sets out a series of policies he thinks the government should adopt, ranging from cutting stamp duty to tackling ""scarcely competent monopolies"", such as the energy markets. Despite emphasising again he does not want to be party leader himself, he allows himself some criticism of the incumbent. The Tory backbencher suggests Theresa May's election campaign was ""too managerial"" and ""lacking inspiration"". Finally,the Sun's splash,externalis of a literal variety. It leads with a report that Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has had a Â£44,000 toilet and shower suite installed in his office. The high cost of the loo - which is pictured for the benefit of the paper's readers - is apparently down to luxuries such as floor to ceiling slate tiles and sensor-activated lights. A Department for Health spokesman has attempted to pour cold water on the story, however, saying Mr Hunt did not approve any costs relating to the department's new building.

"A House of Lords committee report called for tougher rules on the sale of alcohol at airports Arrests of passengers suspected of being drunk at UK airports and on flights have risen by 50% in a year, a BBC Panorama investigation suggests. A total of 387 people were arrested between February 2016 and February 2017 - up from 255 the previous year. Meanwhile, more than half of cabin crew who responded to a survey said they had witnessed disruptive drunken passenger behaviour at UK airports. The Home Office is ""considering"" calls for tougher rules on alcohol. The arrest figures obtained by Panorama came from 18 out of the 20 police forces with a major airport in their area. Trade body Airlines UK said it should be made illegal for people to drink their own alcohol on board a plane. A total of 19,000 of the Unite union's cabin crew members were surveyed and 4,000 responded, with one in five saying they had suffered physical abuse. A former cabin crew manager with Virgin, Ally Murphy, quit her job last October after 14 years and told Panorama: ""People just see us as barmaids in the sky. ""They would touch your breasts, or they'd touch your bum or your legs. I've had hands going up my skirt before."" This video can not be played Ally Murphy: ""Drunk passenger tried to open plane door"" In July 2016 the aviation industry introduced a voluntarycode of conduct on disruptive passengers,,externalwhich most of the big airlines and airports signed up to. The code's advice included asking retailers to warn passengers not to consume duty-free purchases on the plane, while staff were also asked not to sell alcohol to passengers who appeared drunk. Panorama found more than a quarter of cabin crew surveyed were unaware of the code of practice and, of those who had heard of it, only 23% thought it was working. One anonymous crew member told Panorama: ""The code of conduct isn't workingâ¦ we're seeing these incidents on a daily, a weekly, a monthly basis. It's the alcohol mainly in the duty free that is the significant problem."" Entering an aircraft when drunk or being drunk on an aircraft is a criminal offence, with a maximum sentence of two years' imprisonment Licensing laws which prevent the sale of alcohol outside permitted hours do not apply to airside sales of alcohol at UK international airports. Bars can remain open to serve passengers on the earliest and latest flights - from 04:00 in some cases About 270m passengers passed through UK airports last year* and about a fifth of all duty-free purchases involved wine and spirits** The Civil Aviation Authority reported a 600% increase in disruptive passenger incidents in the UK between 2012 and 2016 with ""most involving alcohol"". They say the increase is partly down to improved reporting of incidents Sources: Airlines UK* and UK Travel Retail Forum** Manchester Airport is one of the signatories but when Panorama's undercover reporter asked at World Duty Free whether she could open alcohol bought at a duty free shop to consume on the plane, she was told ""officially probably not, unofficially I think you'll get away with it"". Another shop in the airport did give the right advice. World Duty Free said it was committed to dealing with the issue and that it displays ""clear advisory notices at till points, on till receipts and on carrier bags that remind customers that alcohol purchases cannot be opened until their final destination is reached"". Airlines UK, which represents carriers such as Virgin, British Airways and EasyJet, wants the government to amend the law to make consumption of a passenger's own alcohol on board an aircraft a criminal offence. Airlines can limit the amount of alcohol sold to passengers on board flights. Low-cost airline Jet2 has already banned alcohol sales on flights before 08:00 and managing director Phil Ward agreed further action was needed. ""I think they [airports] could do more. I think the retailers could do more as well. ""Two litre steins of beer in bars, mixes and miniatures in duty free shops, which can only be there for one reason - you know, they're items that are not sold on the high street. ""We can't allow it not to change."" ""One passenger was so drunk he had to have a member of crew do up his seat belt. During landing we had passengers standing up, despite repeatedly being told to sit down. I heard the most despicable things, totally racist and sexist and disgusting.""Nikki Webber ""There was one woman whose language was vile all through the flight with the hen party. The last straw was once the plane had landed, she walked up the aisle and shouted the vilest language in front of my son.""Sharon Richards ""As the plane is landing... the lads remove their (seatbelts) and start scrapping really badly. I looked around and I saw one lad kick the girl behind me. They kicked me and without thinking about it I heard myself shouting really loudly at them to sit down and put their seatbelts back on.""Tania Chambers ""One passenger was so drunk by the end of the flight, he was unable to leave the aircraft unaided by the time we arrived. The departure time was before 8am.""Paul Shah ""I was seated just behind a stag group who had been drinking in the airport and continued to drink duty free clear spirits from water bottles on the flight. The airline staff did not serve any alcohol that flight and moved a family with young children.""David Moult A House of Lords committee report earlier this year called for tougher rules on the sale of alcohol at airports. Committee chair Baroness McIntosh of Pickering said: ""We didn't hear one shred of evidence to show the voluntary code was either working now or had any possible vestige of success in working any time soon."" The Home Office said it was considering the report's recommendations, which include revoking the airports' exemption from the Licensing Act, ""and will respond in due course"". Karen Dee, chief executive of the Airport Operators Association, said: ""I don't accept that the airports don't sell alcohol responsibly. The sale of alcohol per se is not a problem. It's the misuse of it and drinking to excess and then behaving badly."" She said they were working with retailers and staff to make sure they understand the rules.

"This video can not be played Anthony Scaramucci gave his first interview after being sacked by President Trump in July There are people in Washington DC working against President Donald Trump, the former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci has said. He said there were ""elements"" within the White House trying to eject Mr Trump, and he had ""named some names"". Mr Scaramucci spoke to ABC News for the first time since being sacked last month - after just 10 days in office. It followed a phone recording in which he strongly attacked then-White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus. He also directed profanity-laced insults at Chief Strategist Steve Bannon. Mr Scaramucci said he had thought the interview was off the record, and he had ""paid the consequences for that conversation"". Arrivederci, Mooch - The story of Anthony Scaramucci Anthony Scaramucci: Fired after 10 days The White House revolving door: Who's gone? ""What happens in Washington... is the president is not a representative of the political establishment class, so for whatever reason the people have made a decision that they want to eject him,"" he told George Stephanopoulos of ABC News on Sunday. ""I think there are elements inside of Washington, also inclusive in the White House, that are not necessarily abetting the president's interests or his agenda."" However, he said the president needed to bring in ""more loyalists"" in order to carry out his agenda. Anthony Scaramucci (C) was fired after an audio recording was released in which he insulted adviser Steve Bannon (L) and then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus The Wall Street financier criticised the influence of Mr Bannon and the right-wing Breitbart News website, which he helped to launch. He suggested the president needed to move more towards the mainstream and moderates in order to push through ""a very successful legislative agenda"". Mr Scaramucci made a lasting impact in his short term in office, triggering a White House shake-up that saw the departure of both Mr Priebus and spokesman Sean Spicer. 'The Mooch' is back.

"This video can not be played Watch: Edris shocks Farah in 5,000m And so that is it for Mo Farah in championship track finals: seven years of wonder, 10 global golds in a row and a silver to finish, dancing under the lights from Korea to Rio, Moscow to Beijing, to London and then back again. It began with innocence and it ended with a sold-out stadium of his compatriots roaring his name. Along the way he has been both a constant and an agent of change - a guaranteed gold until the very end, a lonely long distance runner every kid and granny in the country knows; a draw big enough to have pubs show his finals on big screens, the face of an open, forward-facing nation in an fractured, introspective time. British crowds in this stadium and on sofas across the country have made that journey with him. Wonder at the start, an intimacy as it developed with his tactics and celebrations afterwards, a collective desire to see him finish in the perfect way. Farah accuses media of 'trying to destroy' legacy Farah's devastation that his last championship race ended with a first defeat since August 2011 was clear as he fell to the Stratford track. The deafening wave of noise that had chased him round the stadium throughout the preceding 12 and a half laps broke into a stunned silence. The roars soon returned. Firstthe British women's quartet stormed to a 4x100m relay silverthat represented a perfect synergy of their burgeoning individual talents.Then GB's men went one better,putting together an impeccable combination of changeovers and legs to win the nation's first sprint relay gold at a World Championships. This video can not be played Farah reflects on 'amazing journey' In those moments you sensed a generational shift, a feeling intensified by the sight ofUsain Bolt stricken halfway down the home straight,his own valediction ending in pain and defeat and very nearly a wheelchair before he limped away, lost in the bedlam. Farah and Bolt, old friends, partners in track hegemony over the past decade, had shared a hug on the access road deep under the main stand as the Briton left the arena after his 5,000m and the Jamaican arrived for his sprint relay final. Just as Bolt had been after his defeat by Justin Gatlin in the 100m final a week ago, Farah is left without the scripted happy ending. The two champions have discovered in the same few days that time catches up with even the fastest of men, although the Briton did win 10,000m gold on the opening day of these championships. In a strange way Farah's defeat may eventually both bring a greater appreciation for all that has come before and tighten further the bond between him and his audience. This video can not be played Farah wins world 10,000m title for third time in a row The problem with perfection is that you can begin to believe there might be nothing else. You can start to think that repetition means it might be easy. You lose the connection between your humble world and theirs. When flaws eventually show, when muscles that were pushed to their limits finally refuse to give back as they have before, you see the effort and the character that might previously have slipped by unnoticed. So it was with Farah, who knew coming into the last 70 metres that Ethiopia's Muktar Edris could not be caught but threw everything he had into fighting past Paul Chelimo and Yomif Kejelcha for a silver that at the start of the night he would have considered failure. As former Olympic and world decathlon champion Daley Thompson said, watching for BBC Sport, it was like watching a gunslinger die with his boots on. So too with Bolt, who has probably known all year that he should have waved farewell after Rio a year ago, but tried forcing his creaking, popping body to respond one final time. Innocence and wonder always seemed to come naturally to Farah, the naÃ¯ve immigrant kid who on his first day at Oriel Junior School in Hanworth had gone home with a black eye after trying the least appropriate of his three English phrases (""Excuse me"", ""Where is the toilet?"" and ""Come on then"") on the playground bully. Mo Farah winning 5,000m gold at the London 2012 Olympics, the first of four double golds at global championships In his school races at Feltham Community College he sometimes misunderstood the instructions, took wrong turns and had to double back. As a talented teenager carrying heavy hopes he would be surprised when told how greater success would come - drinking, partying, jumping off Kingston Bridge into the Thames for a dare. But there was never a naivety in the way he raced as a matured champion, up against 14 other men in global 5,000m finals, posses from other nations ganging up to disrupt his tactics, all trying to mess with his rhythm, sitting in his eyeline or breathing down his neck, slipping an unseen elbow into his ribs or leaning a little shoulder in as pumping arms came together. Great distance runners must have intuition and intelligence and the physical weapons to utilise them. They must be aware of what is happening in front of them and behind them and on either side, to calculate what those 14 rivals might want to be doing, and to respond to every challenge thrown at them - a burst from the gun, a punishing jab-hook of laps alternated fast and slow, a wind up from way out, an explosive kick from the bell or final all-out kick down the home straight. Not all the innocence went with the appreciation of that. After the holy nights of London 2012 and Farah's crescendo to Super Saturday came the hangover:a series of allegations against Farah's coach Alberto Salazarandleaks from the Russian hackers Fancy Bearsthat made many wonder in a different way. UK Athletics's review found ""no evidence of any impropriety"" in Farah nor any reason to ""lack confidence"" in his training programme. Salazar is still being investigated by the US Anti-Doping Agency. Farah's family were watching on from the stands once again Some of those around Farah changed too. An uncomplicated man who lived to run employed PR firm Freuds to help manage his image. His smile, always unaffected and never far away, was repurposed by his shoe sponsor Nike as the subject of an advertising campaign. And so some wondered and speculated, even as the majority wondered and marvelled. Saturday night in Stratford, summer evening sky up above all pale blue and purple clouds, stands down below packed with partisans and Union flags, spoke only of belief. ""Would you have been prouder to have done it for Somalia?"" a reporter had asked Farah in the aftermath of his 10,000m win in London five long summers ago. The obsessive Arsenal fan had been indignant. ""Not at all, mate. This is my country."" As he stepped off the track on Saturday, beaten at last, it still felt that way, both looking at the crowd and the man they had come to roar home. Innocence to some, a wonder to far more.

"In North Korea and Charlottesville Donald Trump faces the first pivotal tests of his presidency. His responses have been telling but, for those who watched him on the campaign trail, they shouldn't be surprising. For the first six-plus months as president, the challenges Mr Trump has confronted have been largely of his own making. The aides with whom he has chosen to surround himself have bickered and leaked to the press. The rollout of key policy proposals - the immigration ban and prohibition of transgender individuals serving in the military, for instance - were often haphazard. The struggles to pass key pieces of his agenda through Congress, particularly healthcare reform, were the result of poor management of a disparate group of Republican legislators. Such trials and travails can be difficult to handle but are predictable obstacles for most administrations. They are not the challenges that define a presidency. A presidency is defined by how the person in the Oval Office handles external adversity. Unpredictable crises are the crucible in which a presidential legacy is forged. Mr Trump has faced two such challenges in the last week - one foreign and one domestic. When North Korea tested an intercontinental ballistic missile, with reports that their nation had successfully miniaturised a nuclear warhead, Mr Trump responded with a rhetorical fusillade that represented a marked departure from the measured words of his predecessors. Kim Jong-un faced ""fire and fury like the world has never seen"". The US military was ""locked and loaded"", and prepared to strike against North Korea if necessary. This video can not be played President Trump threatened a response 'like the world has never seen' Mr Trump's comments prompted criticism from across the political spectrum. ""I take exception to the president's comments because you've got to be sure that you can do what you say you're going to do,"" Senator John McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, said. ""The great leaders I've seen don't threaten unless they're ready to act and I'm not sure President Trump is ready to act."" White House's mixed messages on N Korea Trump's longstanding nuclear fixation Democratic Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer of New York called the comments ""reckless"", reminiscent of the type of attacks on Mr Trump that were prevalent during his presidential campaign. ""His is not the temperament of a stable, thoughtful leader,"" 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romneysaid in a speech in March last year,externalurging his fellow Republicans to resist Mr Trump's quest for the presidency. Three months later, Democrat Hillary Clinton expressed similar sentiment. ""Imagine if he had not just his Twitter account at his disposal when he's angry, but America's entire arsenal,"" she said. ""Do we want him making those calls - someone thin-skinned and quick to anger, who lashes out at the smallest criticism? Do we want his finger anywhere near the button?"" Trump and the nuclear codes Should you worry about nuclear war? Enough American voters answered that question with an affirmative to put Mr Trump in the White House. During remarks last week in Bedminster, the president reminded the nation that he was elected to do things differently - and that includes how he handles Kim Jong-un. ""He has said things that are horrific,"" Mr Trump said. ""And with me he's not getting away with it. He got away with it for a long time, between him and his family. He's not getting away with it. This is a whole new ball game."" The second test of the Trump presidency came on Saturday, when a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, ended in tragedy as a car sped into a crowd of peaceful counter-protesters. The president, in tweets and a press statement, declined to directly denounce the sentiment expressed by the demonstrators who chanted anti-minority, anti-Semitic and anti-gay slogans during the event. ""We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides,"" he said, adding that the problem has ""been going on for a long time in our country. It's not Donald Trump; it's not Barack Obama."" This video can not be played The US president ignored questions over whether his response went far enough Those comments also prompted outcry from more than the usual critics on the left. Colorado Republican Senator Cory Gardner and Marco Rubio, the Florida senator who challenged Mr Trump for the Republican presidential nomination, were quick to tweet out that the president had not taken a strong enough stand. ""Very important for the nation to hear [the president] describe events in Charlottesville for what they are, a terror attack by white supremacists,"" Mr Rubiotweeted,external. ""Make America hate again,"" blared the headline of the conservative Drudge Report, which was an early supporter of Mr Trump's presidential campaign. Again, however, clues for how the president would react to such a situation as president were scattered across his presidential campaign. In February 2016 Mr Trump initially declined to disavow support from the Ku Klux Klan and David Duke, the former Klan leader who became a Louisiana Republican politician. David Duke turned up for Saturday's far-right rally in Charlottesville, which turned violent ""Any candidate who cannot immediately condemn a hate group like the KKK does not represent the Republican Party, and will not unite it,"" Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, the first black Republican elected from a Southern state since 1881, said. ""If Donald Trump can't take a stand against the KKK, we cannot trust him to stand up for America against Putin, Iran or ISIS."" After a week Mr Trump gave a firm statement denouncing the KKK, but his initial hesitance would be an issue for the remainder of his presidential race. ""Trump is reinforcing harmful stereotypes and offering a dog whistle to his most hateful supporters,"" Mrs Clintonsaid in an August 2016 speech,external. ""It's a disturbing preview of what kind of president he'd be."" Mr Duke was among the white nationalists in Charlottesville on Saturday, and he continued his praise of the president. ""We are going to fulfil the promises of Donald Trump,""he said,external. ""That's what we believed in. That's why we voted for Donald Trump, because he said he's going to take our country back."" Why US right-wing groups are on the rise A reckoning in Charlottesville The rise of the alt-right If, as Mr Trump's critics suggest, his statements following the Charlottesville incident were yet another ""dog whistle"" to white supremacists, there's evidence that the message was clearly heard. ""Trump comments were good,"" one poster on the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormerwrote,external. ""He didn't attack us. He just said the nation should come together."" The White House released an unsigned statement on Sunday that ""of course"" the president condemns the KKK and white supremacists, but at this point perceptions have been largely cemented in place. On North Korea and Charlottesville the president's actions have largely been telegraphed by his words and actions over the past two years. If some Americans were expecting a different Donald Trump as president than the man who has been in the public eye for decades, this week has been yet another disappointment. For his supporters, however - the ones who voted for a man who would talk tough on foreign relations and offer an inclusive message, even to more unsavoury elements in American society - the past week may be further confirmation that they made the right choice. The president has been tested, and his responses are proving to be as divisive as ever. Right-wing groups on the rise?

"The pair were photographed just before departing on Thursday Danish police believe that a submarine at the centre of an investigation into a missing Swedish journalist was deliberately sunk. Kim Wall, 30, was last seen on Thursday evening on board the vessel with the owner, 46-year-old Peter Madsen. The submarine later sank and Mr Madsen was rescued before being arrested and charged with manslaughter. The stricken vessel, the Nautilus, has been raised but no body was found and the search for Ms Wall goes on. Mr Madsen initially said that he dropped Ms Wall off before it sank but police say he has now changed his statement - although they have not said what to. Who is DIY submariner Peter Madsen? Police gave no other information on why they thought the Nautilus was deliberately sunk, but it contradicts Mr Madsen's explanation that there was a technical fault. Mr Madsen has denied involvement in Ms Wall's death, and will be held in custody for 24 days while investigations continue. Ms Wall's boyfriend first reported her missing after she failed to return from what should have been a short trip on the submarine.

"This video can not be played What has been achieved in 30 years of redevelopment in Cardiff Bay? Future development of Cardiff Bay needs a more coordinated approach to ensure its success, the man behind its reinvention 30 years ago has said. Lord Crickhowell has hailed the overall regeneration of the former derelict docklands as a major success. But he is fiercely opposed to the latest plans to redevelop land for flats, including a24-storey building. Three decades after he sparked plans for one of the biggest overhauls the city has seen, what has been achieved? Cardiff Bay waterfront in 1977 - derelict before regeneration Once the epicentre of Wales' booming coal and export industries, by the 1980s, Cardiff Bay had become an abandoned wasteland of derelict docks and mudflats. A victim of a dramatic fall in trade following World War Two and competition from other ports saw its decline and a plan was put in place to bring it back to life and reconnect it to the city centre. The Cardiff Bay Development Corporation (CBDC) was set up in April 1987 to regenerate the 1,100 hectares (2,700 acres) of dockland between Cardiff and Penarth. Part of the British government's Urban Development Programme - to regenerate deprived areas of inner cities - its aim was to ""put Cardiff on the international map"" and boost the image and economic wellbeing of the area. Its main objectives were to: promote development and provide an environment where people want to live, work and play reunite the city centre with its waterfront build a mixed development to create jobs achieve the highest standard of design and quality in its development and investment establish the area as a recognised centre of excellence in urban regeneration Cardiff Bay in 1987 The main catalyst for regeneration came with proposals for a barrage. The structure was needed to trap water from the extremely tidal Severn estuary, without which the bay would be without water for much of the day at low tide. But it was not without controversy. Many residents, politicians and conservationists were against the plan with worries including the potential flood risk to homes and the loss of habitat for wading birds and migrating wildlife. The barrage is now a big draw for visitors Others were concerned about its Â£220m cost -  including then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher who claimed the plan""just hasn't been worked out enough"", and Labour MPs such as future First Minister Rhodri Morgan. But after four years of political battles, five failed parliamentary bills and a resignation threat from then-Welsh Secretary Nicholas Edwards, now Lord Crickhowell, work began in 1994. It wascompleted in 1999,externaland was one of the biggest engineering projects in Europe, creating a permanent 200-hectare freshwater lake. The barrage is 1.1km long and extends from Cardiff docks in the north to Penarth Mermaid Quay is home to shops, restaurants and bars Along with it came the shops, bars and restaurants of Mermaid Quay that overlook it and later the construction of Lloyd George Avenue linking the waterfront with the city centre. Recalling the cold, wet day when he first went to assess what could be done to revitalise the area, Lord Crickhowell remembers a ""vast area of dereliction"". He said despite the then-South Glamorgan Council showing confidence in the bay by building its County Hall headquarters at Atlantic Wharf in 1981, the majority of the area was not in use. He said: ""I suddenly realised that what we want to be doing was bringing people back to live and work and play in the area. ""I think it [Cardiff Bay] has been an immense success. There's a whole generation who has no idea what it was like before. ""We cannot contemplate Cardiff without the bay. It's the centre of the city - it's highly successful. ""And all the critics... concerns about ground water and possible flooding and anxieties - all that was quite unjustified. ""The barrage has protected Cardiff from flooding and tidal surges. It's provided protection and not a threat."" Wales Millennium Centre replaced earlier plans for a Cardiff Bay Opera House Further expansion came in the years that followed, namely in the form of thousands of flats - a trend that continues in earnest today - along with a mass of office space. But its skyline was to change further in 2004 and 2006 with the opening of what could now be argued are two of its most iconic buildings. The first wasWales Millennium Centre,external- a dedicated opera and arts house - which opened following a 20-year campaign. But much like the barrage before it, it too was dogged with problems. It began in 1995 when an international contest was launched to find an architect for what was then called the Cardiff Bay Opera House. Iraqi-born Dame Zaha Hadid won but her project was later considered too big and risky, and it was rejected. Further concerns about the subsequent building's cost saw its size cut but it eventually opened in 2004. The Senedd was opened by the Queen in 2006 At the same time plans for anew home for assembly memberswere being developed following the formation of the National Assembly for Wales in 1999. As well as being designed with the aim of creating the most distinctive building in the country, the Senedd has won numerous design awards and achieved the highest sustainability award for a new-build in Wales. Designed by architects Lord Richard Rogers and Ivan Harbour, who wanted to create an accessible building that appeared to rise on a plinth of Welsh slate from Cardiff Bay, it opened in 2006. Both buildings were eventually completed after the CBDC was wound up in 2000, but supporters believe the organisation paved the way for the bay's development which continues today. Cardiff Bay now hosts many events including a beach at Roald Dahl Plass during the summer Roger Thomas, former chairman of Cooke and Arkwright chartered surveyors, which helped advise on the feasibility of the early redevelopment, said the CBDC had left a legacy to be proud of. ""I hate to think what Cardiff would be like if it hadn't been done,"" he said. ""There was a lot of political opposition to the barrage and during the next 20 years of its life it [the bay] went through economic recessions, that doesn't help anyone, but it has put Cardiff on the European and world map."" He said while early ideas to build double the four billion square feet of office space eventually developed were rightly stood down, some people's fears that too many flats were built too quickly were unfounded. He said the ""completely disregarded"" area around Mount Stuart Square had been ""vastly improved"" but admitted one ""missing link"" was the planned extension of the M4 to the bay via St Mellons which never came to fruition. The Coal Exchange, where the first Â£1m cheque was signed, has reopened as a hotel in Mount Stuart Square But Cardiff Bay's revamp has not been without its critics. In 2012, award-winning planning consultant Adrian Jones stated it was a contender for the ""worst example of waterside regeneration in Britain"". Writing in theBevan Foundation Review,external, he said its regeneration was a ""dumb plan"" which lacked any ""coherent urban structure, of real streets or worthwhile public spaces"". He claimed the bay had turned its back on the existing Butetown community and said much public money had been wasted on ""vanity projects"" instead of providing much-needed public housing. Cardiff Bay is now home to thousands of flats such as Adventurer's Quay Housing in the bay is another area which has drawn criticism, with some questioning the need for the sheer amount of flats built. Estate agent Mike Jones fears it has been a victim of overdevelopment, claiming supply has outstripped demand for some years. ""I just feel they're over building, over supplying the apartments and where they feel the market is, I'm not quite sure,"" he said. ""If you look at property portals you will see where prices have been reduced and properties have been on for months. ""When the market was on a high in 2007, 2008 people were paying Â£250,000 for a two-bedroom flat and 12 months later they were struggling to sell for Â£130,000. ""The bay, I think, has been spoiled to a great extent. I think it's such a pity they built so many flats."" This video can not be played Lord Crickhowell said it was ""inconceivable"" tall buildings could be built on area originally intended to be Cardiff Bay's ""oasis"" Indeed, housing is at the centre of the latest controversy with much public opposition to Associated British Ports' (ABP) plans for a 24-storey apartment building behind the Norwegian Church. Campaigners, including Lord Crickhowell, fear it will result in the loss of parkland and will ""look dreadful"". He has now urged a more united approach to the bay's further expansion and called for a more collaborative input from the city council, Welsh Government and land owners. He said: ""There has been a lack of any form of coordinated planning which embraces the land on the south side of the lock or to the east of the lock."" ""What they ought to be doing is leading a coordinated approach to planning which involves the Welsh Government."" Rhys Morgan, property manager at ABP South Wales, said the development supported the council's aspiration for high quality regeneration on the waterfront. He added: ""The views of local people have been central to shaping our vision for Dolffin Quay. As a result of feedback, we've made changes to our original plans to increase the size of the new park. ""The scheme will also bring together other key areas undergoing regeneration as Cardiff looks to make its case as a world-class capital city."" Campaigners fear Dolffin Quay would dwarf the Norwegian Church and result in the loss of parkland So what lies ahead for Cardiff Bay? The city council is in the process of drawing up aCardiff Bay masterplan,external, which - much like thecity's local development plan,external- will identify possible areas of development. It said the plan would aim to maximise regeneration opportunities, balancing community need while maintaining its heritage, maritime history and historic character. Among the proposals already put forward by developers are a""box city""of hotel apartments, offices and street food venues built out of shipping containers.

"This video can not be played The events in Charlottesville were the culmination of months of protests by white supremacists US President Donald Trump is facing criticism from both Republicans and Democrats for his response to violence at a Virginia white supremacist rally. A woman was killed and 19 were injured when a car ploughed into a crowd of counter-protesters in Charlottesville. Mr Trump condemned violence by ""many sides"" - but stopped short of explicitly condemning the far-right. The White House has since clarified in a statement that his condemnation included white supremacists. ""The president said very strongly in his statement yesterday that he condemns all forms of violence, bigotry and hatred. Of course that includes white supremacists, KKK, neo-Nazi and all extremist groups,"" a spokesperson said on Sunday. There were dramatic scenes later in the day as one of the organisers of the march, Jason Kessler, was chased away by protesters during a press conference. This video can not be played Jason Kessler was booed and chased away from his press conference, as the BBC's Joel Gunter reports Hundreds of white nationalists converged for Saturday's ""Unite the Right"" march, called to protest against the removal of a statue of a general who had fought for the pro-slavery Confederacy during the US Civil War. The far-right demonstrators, who included neo-Nazis and Ku Klux Klan (KKK) members, clashed with counter-protesters. People punched and kicked each other, and pepper spray, used by both sides, filled the air. The crowd in Charlottesville, almost entirely white and male, put their arms up in Nazi salutes and cheered on the former grand wizard of the KKK, David Duke. A reckoning in Charlottesville In pictures: Charlottesville protest Why Trump's reactions shouldn't surprise us As the rally was dispersed, a car was driven into a crowd of counter-protesters, the force of the crash flinging people into the air. A 32-year-old woman, Heather D Heyer, was killed in the crash, Charlottesville Police Department said. This video can not be played Photojournalist Ryan M Kelly was covering the protest when the car ploughed into the crowd Twenty-year-old James Fields from Ohio, the alleged driver, is in detention on suspicion of second-degree murder and the FBI has opened a civil rights investigation. Apart from the car-ramming incident, Charlottesville police said at least 15 were wounded in other violence related to the far-right march. The governor of Virginia, Terry McAuliffe, said thathis only messagefor the white supremacists who had come to Charlottesville was ""Go home"". Heather Heyer was killed when a car struck a number of pedestrians on Saturday March organiser Jason Kessler was heckled, booed and eventually forced to run away during a press conference for ""Unite the Right"" on Sunday. Amid protester chants of ""shame on you"", Mr Kessler blamed the police for not preventing the violence, which he condemned. But he also reiterated the organisers' right to hold the rally. Snipers took position before Mr Kessler's speech, the BBC's Joel Gunter in Charlottesville says Some observers say that Mr Trump's election to the White House has re-energised the far right across the US. The Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights organisation,says,externalthat ""Trump's run for office electrified the radical right, which saw in him a champion of the idea that America is fundamentally a white man's country."" Are right-wing groups on the rise? America's alt-right movement Why do people still fly the Confederate flag? Mr Trump said he condemned ""in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides"". ""The hate and the division must stop right now,"" he told reporters, speaking in New Jersey, where he is on a working holiday. ""We have to come together as Americans with love for our nation."" But his comments did not explicitly condemn the white extremist groups involved in the rally. This video can not be played The US president ignored questions over whether his response went far enough Asked whether the car-ramming was domestic terrorism, Mr Trump's National Security Adviser HR McMaster said ""anytime that you commit an attack against people to incite fear, it meets the definition of terrorism"". Mr Trump's daughter too also appeared to offer stronger condemnation than her father. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter Clues for how the president would react to such a situation were scattered across his presidential campaign. In February 2016, Mr Trump initially declined to disavow support from the Klu Klux Klan and David Duke, the former Klan leader who became a Louisiana Republican politician. ""Any candidate who cannot immediately condemn a hate group like the KKK does not represent the Republican Party, and will not unite it,"" Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, the first black Republican elected from a Southern state since 1881, said. After a week, Mr Trump gave a firm statement denouncing the KKK, but his initial hesitance would be an issue for the remainder of his presidential race. If, as Mr Trump's critics suggest, his statements following the Charlottesville incident were yet another ""dog whistle"" to white supremacists, there's evidence that the message was clearly heard. ""Trump comments were good,"" one poster on the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormerwrote,external. ""He didn't attack us. He just said the nation should come together.""

"A driver was photographed eating his lunch while on the M20 in Kent Lorry drivers have been photographed on England's roads eating, reading and using a phone while behind the wheel. Four drivers were photographed on the M20 near Ashford in Kent. Two were reading, one was holding cutlery and a food container and another appeared to be steering with his elbows. Road safety campaigners Brake branded the images as ""shocking"" while the AA said the consequences of such behaviour could be ""dire"".

The Department for Transport said anyone who is distracted can be prosecuted for careless or dangerous driving. Edmund King from the AA, said some lorry drivers get bored, particularly on motorways.

She appeared with two Casualty stars earlier this year, finishing second with a routine set to Bruno Mars' Uptown Funk. She said: ""When I was 13, I made the finals of a disco dancing competition once but there was this amazing girl who exploded onto the stage with a gorgeous sequined costume, throwing glitter everywhere.

Coles, who had hits with Jimmy Somerville in The Communards including Don't Leave Me This Way, said he had a ""comprehensive briefing"" from former Strictly star Ed Balls as part of his preparations for the show - and has also ""cut down on pork pies"". But he said he might not be able to take part in the Strictly live tour, as it clashes with Epiphany. He hosts BBC Radio 4's Saturday Live and is a contributor to Pause for Thought on Chris Evans' show - as well as being vicar of St Mary's Church in Finedon, Northamptonshire.

Charlotte Hawkins's broadcasting career has included stints reporting on LBC, Sky News and Channel 5. But she currently reads the news on Good Morning Britain, which airs weekdays on ITV. ""I did dancing as a child, a bit of ballet, and I do a bit of dancing round the kitchen with my two-year old but I don't know if that counts,"" Hawkins joked on Monday's programme as she announced she'd be doing Strictly. She added: ""Thank you for all the support. This is setting me on the way now. The excitement's really beginning. It doesn't feel like it's really happening until people know.""

His appearance follows that of former Royal Marine and fellow amputee Cassidy Little, who took part in a ""people's"" edition of Strictly in 2015 as well as that year's Christmas show. ""The opportunity to be the first contestant with a disability to take part in Strictly's main show was too good to turn down,"" he said. ""I've got no previous dance history outside of the occasional 'worm' at a mate's party and I know this will be a challenge and a new experience. ""I can't wait to see what I can achieve and how far I can push myself."" ChefSimon Rimmerrevealed he will be a Strictly contestant during his Sunday morning Channel 4 show, Sunday Brunch, which he co-hosts with Tim Lovejoy.

Singer Sam Smith has posted a shirtless photo of himself on Instagram, as a way to ""reclaim"" his body. While these kinds of posts aren't an unusual for celebrities on social media, Smith used this moment to open up about his battle with body image, admitting to starving himself for weeks ahead of upcoming photo shoots. ""Some may take this as narcissistic and showing off,""he wrote in his Instagram post,external, which features some bad language so obviously ask your mum before you click. ""But if you knew how much courage it took to do this and the body trauma I have experienced as a kid you wouldn't think those things."" With nearly a million likes, his fans have praised him for ""inspiring"" them with his ""beautiful"" message. Ina 2016 survey,externalof more than 1,000 boys aged between eight and 18, 55% said they would consider changing their diet to look better and 23% said they believed there was ""a perfect male body to strive for"". The survey also found that the four biggest sources of pressure on secondary school boys to look good were: Friends (68%) Social media (57%) Advertising (53%) Celebrities (49%) Despite the relentless pressure that young men can feel from the media, the survey found that more than half of the boys (56%) would find it difficult to talk to a teacher about their confidence and nearly one-third (29%) would find it difficult talking to their parents about it. Here are eight other male celebrities who have spoken out about body image and are calling on the media to change their attitudes. In 2017, Blue singer Antony Costaappeared on Lorraine,externaland opened up about the ""fat-shaming"" he had experienced on social media. Costa explained that when he first started out in show business before the dawn of social media, receiving criticisms ""was water off a duck's back"" but now, the public are quick to point out flaws in selfies and paparazzi photos which he believes can be harmful. ""Me as a bloke in the business, it's hard because you've got to keep up with the joneses, to be seen to have the six pack,"" he said. ""But I'd rather be me and have a good personality then have a six pack"". Yes, you read that right! Actor Chris Pratt - who plays the gun-toting, butt-kicking, ripped Star-Lord in Guardians of the Galaxy - has struggled with body image, too. In a press conference for the film in 2014, he said: ""I'm sure I can't relate to what females go through in Hollywood. I'm sure I can't. ""But, I do know what it feels like to eat emotionally, andâ¦ to be sad and make yourself happy with food. ""And then to be almost immediately sad again and now ashamed and then to try to hide those feelings with more food. I know what that's like. It's a vicious cycle and it's a very real thing."" In aninterview with Rolling Stone in 2016,external, talk show host James Corden opened up about how he dealt with his confidence in school. He explained: ""If you're big at school, you've really got two choices. You're going to be a target. If you go to school and you're me, you go, 'Right, I'm just going to make myself a bigger target. My confidence, it will terrify them.' That's how I felt in school."" Corden also touched on his frustrations on the way Hollywood represents larger people. He said: ""I could never understand when I watch romantic comedies. The notion that for some reason unattractive or heavy people don't fall in love. ""If they do, it's in some odd, kooky, roundabout way - and it's not. It's exactly the same."" Prison Break actor Wentworth Miller opened up about his depression after being the subject of an internet meme joke by The Lad Bible in 2016. Millerwrote in a Facebook post:,external""In 2010, at the lowest point in my adult life, I was looking everywhere for relief/comfort/distraction. And I turned to food."" He continued: ""It could have been anything. Drugs. Alcohol. Sex. But eating became the one thing I could look forward to. Count on to get me through"". Alex Sharp starred alongside Lily Collins in Netflix drama To The Bone, which follows a girl's treatment for anorexia. When Collins' character is admitted into a recovery home with six other patients, she meets Luke (played by Sharp), the only male patient in the house. Talking to Broadway World,externalabout portraying a man struggling with an eating disorder, Sharp said: ""It happens a lot and I think sometimes - because it is under-discussed and a taboo subject generally - when it is discussed it tends to be more about the female experience, because it is more prevalent, numerically. ""There had never been a representation of that in a feature-length movie. So that was something I was very interested in doing."" Iron Man 3 star Ashley Hamilton told People in 2013,externalthat he had suffered from bulimia and anorexia since he was a teenager and that he used drugs and alcohol to control his food addiction. ""I've been free from bulimia for years but I still struggle with food, restricting or overeating. That's been the hardest for me in sobriety,"" he admitted. He continued: ""It's almost like drug addiction is totally acceptable to talk about in Hollywood. But food addiction? Nobody wants to talk about that. It's really shameful as a man to have that."" The chart-topping singer told Planet Radio,externalin a 2014 interview: ""I was never really happy with my image and then I realised it was because I was eating fried food and drinking beer every day. You don't have to kill yourself by getting into shape. Just eat right and don't drink every day."" Commenting on body image pressures in the music industry, Sheeran said: ""There's enough fat people in the industry and there's enough skinny people in the industry and there's enough ginger people in the industry.

Clarks said it was removing the Dolly Babe shoe, which it described as an ""old and discontinued line"", from its stores. The row follows another claim of sexism levelled against Clarks earlier this month by Jemma Moonie-Dalton, whowrote a Facebook post,externalabout trying to buy school shoes for her seven-year-old daughter and five-year-old son at a Clarks store in east London. ""In the boys' section the shoes are sturdy, comfortable and weatherproof with soles clearly designed with running and climbing in mind,"" she wrote. ""In contrast, the girls' shoes have inferior soles, are not fully covered and are not well padded at the ankle. They are not comfortable and are not suited to outdoor activities in British weather."" Clarks said it was creating more unisex shoes in response to customer feedback and promoting its gender-neutral stance both online and in store. But Williams said Clarkshad failed to learn lessons,externalfrom a similar controversy last summer.

"There are dozens of KKK groups in the US stretching from New Jersey to Los Angeles The deadly violence on the streets of Charlottesville, Virginia, comes at a time of a dramatic rise in prominence of far-right movements in the US. The election of Donald Trump to the White House has been cited as a factor in the re-energisation of activists and groups in America that reject both left-wing ideology and mainstream conservatism. Social media is also said to be playing a large part in promoting these ideologies. A prominent US civil rights group, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) says that it is currently tracking more than 1,600 extremist groups in the country. But who are these groups, how popular have they become, and what do they hope to achieve? Here is a look at the most visible of the white supremacist movements in the US today. Virginia governor tells white supremacists: 'Go home' The alternative right (or alt-right) is a disparate group of provocateurs who hate political correctness and love Mr Trump, although critics say they are bigoted white nationalists. This movement's recent rise is said to have been encouraged in part by the rhetoric employed during the 2016 US presidential election campaign, in which Mr Trump was accused of ""textbook racism"", anti-Semitism, and anti-Muslim bigotry. This video can not be played Post-war US anti-Nazi film makes comeback Mr Trump, for his part,denounced the movementin November 2016, saying he disavowed their views. The phrase ""alt-right"" started to gain traction in the mainstream media when Mr Trump, as then Republican nominee in July 2016, tweeted an image of Hillary Clinton alongside a six-pointed star resembling the Star of Israel containing the words: ""Most Corrupt Candidate Ever!"". Alt-right factions, according to a guide written by Breitbart's Allum Bokhari andMilo Yiannopoulos, include ""intellectuals"", ""natural conservatives"" and ""the meme team"" - mostly young activists with a penchant for internet trolling. The movement's ideals focus on ""white identity"" and the preservation of ""traditional western civilisation"", according to Richard Bertrand Spencer, who coined the term ""alternative right"" in 2008. Liberty, free speech and the right to offend are its touchstones. Opponents call it racist, misogynist and anti-Semitic. This video can not be played 'Alt-right is unstoppable,' says Milo Yiannopoulos Number of membersAs a predominantly online movement, the alt-right does not officially have membership, therefore exact numbers are hard to come by. Where are they?The presence of this ""amorphous"" movement is online and its popularity is said to be increasing nationwide. Are they growing?A relatively new political movement, the group has gained increased prominence over the past year due to its enthusiastic support for Mr Trump. However estimating its strength is difficult. Who are the 'alt-right'? America's most infamous supremacist group, the initial KKK was formed by ex-Confederate officers in the southern states of the US in the aftermath of the American Civil War in 1865. The Klan soon flourished in the south before spreading nationwide in the 1900s. Divisions of the group discriminate against black Americans, Jews and immigrants, and more recently gays and lesbians. It became a vigilante movement with the aim of preventing these groups from enjoying the same civil liberties and rights as their fellow Americans. This video can not be played Riot police stood between Ku Klux Klan and its rivals in Virginia in July Members historically wore hooded costumes and carried out lynchings and other violent attacks on those challenging white supremacy in the southern states. Factions of the group describe it as a ""White Patriotic Christian organization that bases its roots back to the Ku Klux Klan of the early 20th century"". Number of membersKlan groups are active in most US states and are estimated to have between 5,000 and 8,000 members,according to the SPLC,external. Where are they?There are dozens of KKK groups in the US stretching from New Jersey to Los Angeles. Groups include theConfederate White Knightsand the Traditionalist American Knights. Are they growing?In 2016 the Klan said that it was in the midst of a revival with a ""surge in membership across the Deep South"". The term neo-Nazi relates to a group of separatist activists who share anti-Semitic ideals and a love for Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany. The views of neo-Nazi groups in the US are protected by the courts and the nation's First Amendment. In one well-known case, the Supreme Court invoked the First Amendment to uphold the right of a neo-Nazi group to march through the predominantly Jewish town of Skokie, Illinois, and display swastikas. This video can not be played Neo-Nazi Craig Cobb (centre) apparently imagined Leith would accept the new order. He was wrong Number of membersThere are several high-profile neo-Nazi organisations in the US, including the American Nazi Party and the National Socialist Movement (NSM). The most visible of these groups is the National Alliance (NA). A spin-off of the NA, Vanguard America, participated in the ""Unite the Right"" march on 12 August 2017 that left one woman dead and dozens of protesters and counter-protesters injured following clashes. The most recent membership figures for the NA, for 2012, are estimated to be at least 2,500, while an article published in theNew York Times in 2011,externalsaid that the NSM consisted of about 400 members. Where are they?A number of these groups were formed or originally based in Virginia. They have become more widespread in recent years with members of groups such as the NSM active in 32 states. Are they growing?The manipulation of the mainstream media is attributed to a rise the far-right neo-Nazi movement, according to the Data and Society Research Institute. Links between US and European neo-Nazis are also said to be growing stronger,according to the SPLC,external. National Socialist Movement: Founded in 1994, it is one of the largest neo-Nazi groups in the US, with chapters in more than 30 states.

"The first taste of motorway driving can be an anxious experience for some Learner drivers in England, Wales and Scotland will be allowed to have lessons on the motorway by next year, the government has announced. The Department for Transport (DfT) said lessons would be in a dual-control car with an approved driving instructor. Currently only those who have passed their test can drive on a motorway, but in 2015 the DfT said it wouldconsider a law change. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said the lessons would make UK roads safer. He said: ""Allowing learners to drive on motorways in a supportive environment will help them develop a practical understanding of how to use motorways safely before driving independently."" Mr Grayling said young drivers were more likely to be killed or seriously injured on Britain's roads - and a lack of experience was an ""important factor"". ""The UK has some of safest roads in the world and we want to make them even safer,"" he said. New driver Leonnie Wharton, from Wigan, told the BBC: ""I passed my test a week ago and have been on the motorway twice on my own. ""It was quite a scary experience, I'd read up on the theory but actually doing it is completely different. ""I'm apprehensive about doing it again on my own, but I don't want to get to the point where I actively avoid going on the motorway."" The 25-year-old said motorway lessons would have definitely helped with her nerves and she agrees that motorway instruction should be part of learning to drive. ""It's ridiculous that it isn't already when it is a big part of driving. Learners should feel confident on the motorway; it would make the roads safer,"" she said. Top tips for learners Instructor Sharon Starr, whose driving school is based in Stoke Newington, north London, is in favour of the plans - but cautioned many instructors do not offer motorway lessons as they perceive them to be more dangerous. She has this advice for first-time motorway drivers: Keep calm.The most important thing is to keep calm, and remember your instructor is there to help if you have a problem. Motorways are similar to dual carriageways - which learners have already driven on - so it's the same but a bit faster. Plan ahead.Sometimes you need to ease off the accelerator to create the gap ahead. You need to build up speed quite quickly when you are joining the motorway. Don't hesitate.If you hesitate while joining the motorway or changing lanes you can put yourself or other drivers in danger. Once you've begun to move, they are expecting you to go. Watch speed limits.Lots of people don't realise the speed limit isn't only 70mph. There are average speed cameras where the speed limit is 50mph so you need to be careful. There were 1,810 deaths on UK roads in the year to September 2016, in line with the previous year, according toprovisional estimates,externalpublished by the DfT. In 2015, a DfTpolicy document,externalsuggested motorway lessons alongside a number of proposals, including increasing penalty points for using a mobile phone while driving and a Â£2m research programme to improve safety for inexperienced drivers. The RAC's safety spokesman Pete Williams backed the changes, which ministers have been consulting on this year. He said: ""While motorways are statistically our safest roads, it can be daunting using them for the first time after passing the driving test."" Mr Williams said drivers the RAC had surveyed were ""overwhelmingly supportive"" of motorway lessons. AA president Edmund King said a lack of motorway experience was the ""Achilles heel"" of learner drivers. ""Almost half of motorists know friends or family who avoid driving on motorways."" Under changes to the practical driving test effective from 4 December,learner drivers will be tested on their ability to use a sat nav. Drivers will also be expected to answer vehicle safety questions while on the move and complete 20 minutes of independent driving rather than 10. Motorway rules When joining the motorway give priority to traffic already on the road. Match your speed to fit safely into the traffic flow and remain in the left-hand lane long enough to adjust to the speed of traffic before considering overtaking When you can see well ahead and the road conditions are good, drive at a steady cruising speed within the speed limit Always drive in the left-hand lane when the road ahead is clear. If you are overtaking slower-moving vehicles, return to the left-hand lane as soon as you are safely past Only overtake on the right-hand side, when it safe and legal to do so. In congested conditions, however, you may keep up with the traffic in your lane even if this means passing traffic in the lane to your right. Do not weave in and out of lanes to overtake Do not stop on the hard shoulder except in an emergency Do not reverse, cross the central reservation, or drive against the traffic flow.

"Brazilian officials have arrested at least 11 people caught looting containers that had fallen from a cargo ship near the port of Santos. Local people had gone out in small boats to the floating containers, taking consumer goods including bicycles and clothing. Port officials said 45 containers had worked loose from the ship's deck. An investigation is under way to work out the cause of the accident. Police said the thieves had used small boats to reach the containers and had picked up air-conditioning units, other white goods, clothing, hospital equipment and bags. They said they had chased down two speed boats loaded with goods. Local media said the  Brazilian-registered ship, the Log-In Pantanal, unloaded 248 containers at the Port of Santos on Thursday and took 341 on board. The company responsible for the ship said it believed the accident had been caused by bad weather. Social media videos showed the ship rolling heavily in a high sea swell.

"This video can not be played Watch: Edris shocks Farah in 5,000m And so that is it for Mo Farah in championship track finals: seven years of wonder, 10 global golds in a row and a silver to finish, dancing under the lights from Korea to Rio, Moscow to Beijing, to London and then back again. It began with innocence and it ended with a sold-out stadium of his compatriots roaring his name. Along the way he has been both a constant and an agent of change - a guaranteed gold until the very end, a lonely long distance runner every kid and granny in the country knows; a draw big enough to have pubs show his finals on big screens, the face of an open, forward-facing nation in an fractured, introspective time. British crowds in this stadium and on sofas across the country have made that journey with him. Wonder at the start, an intimacy as it developed with his tactics and celebrations afterwards, a collective desire to see him finish in the perfect way. Farah accuses media of 'trying to destroy' legacy Farah's devastation that his last championship race ended with a first defeat since August 2011 was clear as he fell to the Stratford track. The deafening wave of noise that had chased him round the stadium throughout the preceding 12 and a half laps broke into a stunned silence. The roars soon returned. Firstthe British women's quartet stormed to a 4x100m relay silverthat represented a perfect synergy of their burgeoning individual talents.Then GB's men went one better,putting together an impeccable combination of changeovers and legs to win the nation's first sprint relay gold at a World Championships. This video can not be played Farah reflects on 'amazing journey' In those moments you sensed a generational shift, a feeling intensified by the sight ofUsain Bolt stricken halfway down the home straight,his own valediction ending in pain and defeat and very nearly a wheelchair before he limped away, lost in the bedlam. Farah and Bolt, old friends, partners in track hegemony over the past decade, had shared a hug on the access road deep under the main stand as the Briton left the arena after his 5,000m and the Jamaican arrived for his sprint relay final. Just as Bolt had been after his defeat by Justin Gatlin in the 100m final a week ago, Farah is left without the scripted happy ending. The two champions have discovered in the same few days that time catches up with even the fastest of men, although the Briton did win 10,000m gold on the opening day of these championships. In a strange way Farah's defeat may eventually both bring a greater appreciation for all that has come before and tighten further the bond between him and his audience. This video can not be played Farah wins world 10,000m title for third time in a row The problem with perfection is that you can begin to believe there might be nothing else. You can start to think that repetition means it might be easy. You lose the connection between your humble world and theirs. When flaws eventually show, when muscles that were pushed to their limits finally refuse to give back as they have before, you see the effort and the character that might previously have slipped by unnoticed. So it was with Farah, who knew coming into the last 70 metres that Ethiopia's Muktar Edris could not be caught but threw everything he had into fighting past Paul Chelimo and Yomif Kejelcha for a silver that at the start of the night he would have considered failure. As former Olympic and world decathlon champion Daley Thompson said, watching for BBC Sport, it was like watching a gunslinger die with his boots on. So too with Bolt, who has probably known all year that he should have waved farewell after Rio a year ago, but tried forcing his creaking, popping body to respond one final time. Innocence and wonder always seemed to come naturally to Farah, the naÃ¯ve immigrant kid who on his first day at Oriel Junior School in Hanworth had gone home with a black eye after trying the least appropriate of his three English phrases (""Excuse me"", ""Where is the toilet?"" and ""Come on then"") on the playground bully. Mo Farah winning 5,000m gold at the London 2012 Olympics, the first of four double golds at global championships In his school races at Feltham Community College he sometimes misunderstood the instructions, took wrong turns and had to double back. As a talented teenager carrying heavy hopes he would be surprised when told how greater success would come - drinking, partying, jumping off Kingston Bridge into the Thames for a dare. But there was never a naivety in the way he raced as a matured champion, up against 14 other men in global 5,000m finals, posses from other nations ganging up to disrupt his tactics, all trying to mess with his rhythm, sitting in his eyeline or breathing down his neck, slipping an unseen elbow into his ribs or leaning a little shoulder in as pumping arms came together. Great distance runners must have intuition and intelligence and the physical weapons to utilise them. They must be aware of what is happening in front of them and behind them and on either side, to calculate what those 14 rivals might want to be doing, and to respond to every challenge thrown at them - a burst from the gun, a punishing jab-hook of laps alternated fast and slow, a wind up from way out, an explosive kick from the bell or final all-out kick down the home straight. Not all the innocence went with the appreciation of that. After the holy nights of London 2012 and Farah's crescendo to Super Saturday came the hangover:a series of allegations against Farah's coach Alberto Salazarandleaks from the Russian hackers Fancy Bearsthat made many wonder in a different way. UK Athletics's review found ""no evidence of any impropriety"" in Farah nor any reason to ""lack confidence"" in his training programme. Salazar is still being investigated by the US Anti-Doping Agency. Farah's family were watching on from the stands once again Some of those around Farah changed too. An uncomplicated man who lived to run employed PR firm Freuds to help manage his image. His smile, always unaffected and never far away, was repurposed by his shoe sponsor Nike as the subject of an advertising campaign. And so some wondered and speculated, even as the majority wondered and marvelled. Saturday night in Stratford, summer evening sky up above all pale blue and purple clouds, stands down below packed with partisans and Union flags, spoke only of belief. ""Would you have been prouder to have done it for Somalia?"" a reporter had asked Farah in the aftermath of his 10,000m win in London five long summers ago. The obsessive Arsenal fan had been indignant. ""Not at all, mate. This is my country."" As he stepped off the track on Saturday, beaten at last, it still felt that way, both looking at the crowd and the man they had come to roar home. Innocence to some, a wonder to far more.

"This video can not be played Footage captured the moment a car rammed into a crowd of counter-protesters in Charlottesville The governor of Virginia, Terry McAuliffe, has said that his only message for the white supremacists who brought chaos to the city of Charlottesville is ""Go home"". A woman died and 19 people were injured when a car rammed a crowd of people opposing a far-right rally there. The FBI has opened a civil rights investigation into the incident. Earlier, street brawls erupted between white nationalists and counter-protesters. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said ""the violence and deaths in Charlottesville strike at the heart of American law and justice. ""When such actions arise from racial bigotry and hatred, they betray our core values and cannot be tolerated."" Twenty-year-old James Fields from Ohio, the alleged driver of the car, is in detention on suspicion of second-degree murder. In detail: A reckoning in Charlottesville In addition to those injured in the car incident, the Charlottesville Police Department said 15 were wounded in other violence related to the far-right march. Late in the afternoon, a Virginia State Police helicopter crashed in woodland south-west of the city, killing two police officers.  The helicopter had been part of the operation to monitor the clashes. A number of people received first aid after a vehicle drove into a crowd The ""Unite the Right"" march was called to protest against plans to remove a statue of General Robert E Lee, who had fought for the pro-slavery Confederacy during the US Civil War. Mr McAuliffe told a press conference: ""I have a message for all the white supremacists, and the Nazis who came into Charlottesville today. Our message is plain and simple: Go home. You are not wanted in this great commonwealth. Shame on you. You pretend that you're patriots, but you are anything but a patriot. ""You came here today to hurt people. And you did hurt people. But my message is clear: We are stronger than you."" The governor, who is a Democrat, said he had spoken to President Trump, and twice urged him to begin a movement to bring people together. He thanked the police and law enforcement officials, who he said had prevented ""a much worse day"", and praised the emergency services who helped the wounded. This video can not be played Governor of Virginia Terry McAuliffe: ""We are stronger than you"" Witnesses said the car backed up and hit the crowd more than once The violence in Charlottesville - a liberal college town - is a stark demonstration of the growing political divide in the US, which has intensified since President Trump's election last year. Right-wing blogger Jason Kessler had called for a ""pro-white"" rally, and white nationalists promoted the gathering widely. Oren Segal, director of the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism, said several ""white power"" groups were present - including neo-Nazis and factions of the Ku Klux Klan.
