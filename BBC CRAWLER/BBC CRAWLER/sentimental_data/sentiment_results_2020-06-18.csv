"Companies that benefited from slavery must go further than apologising, the chairman of the Caribbean Reparations Commission has said. Many British and European firms and their predecessors ""drank from the well of Caribbean slavery"", said Prof. Sir Hilary Becklesin a Reuters interview.,external The comments came as several financial institutions apologised for their historical links to the slave trade. He called on British firms to fund development projects in the Caribbean. ""Unfortunately, one cannot go back and remake the history but you can make atonement: it is not enough to make your apology as a public spectacle, it is not enough to present it as public relations exercise,"" said Prof. Beckles, who is vice-chancellor of the University of the West Indies. The historian added that British institutions should sit down with Caribbean nations to fund development projects. Alternatively, they could consider a type of ""Marshall Plan"" - a reference to the US aid given to Europe after World War Two. ""All the institutions that created this mess really have to come and help in practical ways to clean it up,"" he said. The Bank of England and the Church of England have apologised for the role that some of their senior figures played in the slave trade. The Daily Telegraph,which first reported the news,external, said the Church called its links a ""source of shame"". The Bank said it would ensure that images of former governors who were involved in the slave trade are not displayed in its buildings. Pub chain and insurance hub 'sorry' for slave links Pressure has been growing on companies around the world to address links to slavery and tackle racial inequality following the death of George Floyd in the US last month while in police custody. ""Racism - the ideology used to justify slavery - is a legacy that still shapes the life chances for people of African and Caribbean heritage in the UK,"" said Dr Katie Donington, a senior lecturer in history at the London South Bank University. ""It is an important step that firms with historical links to trans-Atlantic slavery are now beginning the process of acknowledging the past."" In 2006, the Churchvoted to apologise,externalto the descendants of victims of the slave trade. Its missionary arm, the Society for the Propagation of the Christian Religion in Foreign Parts (SPG), inherited three sugar estates in the Caribbean. The plantation was run for the Church by professional planters, but its profits went to the missionary group. Slaves working on the estate were branded on their chests with the word ""society"". And now, the Telegraph has reported that nearly 100 clergymen also benefitted individually from slavery. ""While we recognise the leading role clergy and active members of the Church of England played in securing the abolition of slavery, it is a source of shame that others within the Church actively perpetrated slavery and profited from it,"" the spokeswoman said. When slavery was abolished in 1833, the UK government raised huge amounts for compensation. However, that money was not paid to those who had been enslaved, but was given instead to slave-owners for their ""loss of human property"". A database compiled byUniversity College London,externalshows that at least 11 former Bank governors and 16 early directors either benefitted from those payments or had links to the slave trade. ""There can be no doubt that the 18th and 19th Century slave trade was an unacceptable part of English history,"" a Bank spokeswoman said. ""As an institution, the Bank of England was never itself directly involved in the slave trade, but is aware of some inexcusable connections involving former governors and directors and apologises for them."" She said the Bank had started a ""thorough review"" of its image collection to ensure no pictures of anyone involved in the slave trade remained on display. Pressure has been growing on companies around the world to address links to slavery and tackle racial inequality following the death of George Floyd in the US last month while in police custody. Videos showed Mr Floyd, who was unarmed and in handcuffs, dying after a white policeman knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. On Wednesday, pub chain Greene King and insurance market Lloyd's of Londonalso apologised for their historical linksto the slave trade. One of Greene King's founders owned a number of plantations in the Caribbean, while the maritime insurance business, which centred around Lloyd's, thrived on the trans-Atlantic slave trade.

"2 Sisters produces a third of all poultry products consumed in the UK from a number of sites Nearly 100 workers at two factories which supply food to hospitals, shops and restaurants have tested positive for coronavirus. Public Health Wales confirmed 58 cases at the 2 Sisters chicken factory in Llangefni on Anglesey, with all staff now being told to self-isolate. In Wrexham, 38 staff have tested positive at Rowan Foods, which makes food for supermarkets across the UK. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said the Anglesey outbreak was a ""concern"". Wales TUC, who campaign for workers' rights, said it was ""alarmed to see a pattern of workplace outbreaks in food manufacturing"", but the companies said they had put staff safety first during the pandemic. Other countries have also recorded outbreaks in meat processing plants, including inFrance and the US, where workers in at least two food factories have died amid outbreaks. The untold story of America's biggest outbreak Five ways coronavirus is disrupting the food industry Concerns over Covid-19 cases in NI meat plants 2 Sisters has suspended production and closed the Anglesey chicken factory, which supplies local authorities, hospitals, restaurants and small businesses, following the outbreak. The company supplies food to KFC and supermarkets including Marks & Spencer, Aldi, Asda, Co-op, Morrisons, Sainsbury's, Tesco and Waitrose. Public Health Wales (PHW) said staff and contractors working at the processing plant, which has 560 workers, had been asked to self-isolate for 14 days. It said staff at the factory would be tested, with all workers being contacted by the company to arrange the tests. A testing site has been set up Llangefni, while an existing facility in Bangor is also being used.Â  A further site is also being set up in Holyhead. Rowan Foods in Wrexham has said there is no clear evidence to suggest that there is a spread of the virus within the site Meanwhile Rowan Foods, which employs 1,500 people, said 38 staff were ""absent due to testing positive for Covid-19"", but said there was ""no clear evidence to suggest that there is a spread of the virus within the site"". The company, owned by Oscar Meyer Quality Foods, makes ready meals for companies across the UK, including Aldi, Asda, and Sainsbury's. In a statement, it said none of the staff were ""seriously ill or had been hospitalised"" and contact tracing was taking place. 2 Sisters said ""the health, safety and well-being of our colleagues is ultimately the thing that matters most at our business"". ""In light of the current Covid-19 cases at our Llangefni site, we have decided to take the necessary action to clearly demonstrate how seriously we take this issue by doing the right thing,"" a statement said. ""Doing the right thing means from today [18 June] we will temporarily suspend production at our Llangefni site with immediate effect for a period of 14 days. ""We will not tolerate any unnecessary risks - however small - for our existing loyal workforce at the facility."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Oscar Meyer Quality Foods said its priority had been the safety of staff at the Wrexham plant and it had made ""significant operational changes at the site"" to maintain social distancing, including putting in screens and visors. ""Whilst we are seeing a number of cases on site, Public Health Wales support our view that there is no clear evidence to suggest that there is a spread of the virus within the site, we are seeing a reflection on site of the increases in cases within the locality,"" it said. ""We will continue to do all we can to remain vigilant and to keep our colleagues and families safe."" 2 Sisters Food Group is one of the largest food producers in the UK, and produces about a third of all the poultry products eaten each day in the UK. According to PHW figures, there were 11 confirmed new Covid-19 cases in Anglesey on Wednesday and 11 more on Thursday - the most in any Welsh county on both days. The health minister said he was ""concerned"" the outbreak would lead to more cases. ""Given that this is a closed setting in which these people would have been working, I'm obviously concerned that we may well see more confirmed cases of coronavirus,"" Mr Gething told the Welsh government's daily briefing. Wales' health minister says the outbreak ""reiterates the importance of social distancing and appropriate hygiene measures"" He added the outbreak showed ""that even with a low prevalence of coronavirus, it hasn't gone."" ""It also reiterates the importance of our test, trace, protect system - and that people really do need to follow the advice that they're given on getting a test, and on self isolating."" PHW said it was ""working in partnership"" with 2 Sisters, Anglesey council, Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, the Health and Safety Executive and the Food Standards Agency to ""manage the incident"". ""We are working in close collaboration with the employer and Anglesey council, and our priority is to bring this outbreak to a swift conclusion,"" said Christopher Johnson. The Food Standards Agency said there was no reason food would not be safe The Food Standards Agency said it was ""very unlikely you can catch coronavirus from food"" as the virus is a respiratory illness. The agency's Caroline Kitson said the virus was ""not known to be transmitted by exposure to food or food packaging"". More than 1,000 workers at the GÃ¼tersloh plant, in Germany, have been tested after an outbreak at the meat processing plant Paddy McNaught, the regional organiser for the union Unite, said the number of cases of coronavirus at the Anglesey factory had risen ""significantly"" in the past few days. ""In fairness, the company, they have tried to work with us to provide a safe working environment, where social distancing - as best as it can - takes place,"" he said. But he said production line work at the plant meant adhering to the distancing rule had been ""virtually impossible"" and there had been the ""usual"" concerns from staff about ""social distancing and face masks"". He added that the union would be working with the company to make sure the factory had a professional deep clean before workers were allowed back at the site. In Wales,employers are required by lawto do everything they can to make sure workers can socially distance while in the workplace, or face a fine of up to Â£120. Wales TUC general secretary Shavanah Taj said she was ""alarmed to see a pattern of workplace outbreaks in food manufacturing"". ""We've had long-held concerns about health and safety in this industry during the crisis and the risks posed to these key workers, who are employed in an industry with some of the lowest rates of average pay,"" she said. Some of the biggest outbreaks of Covid-19 worldwide have been in meat processing factories and slaughterhouses. In Ireland for example, a special national outbreak team has been put in place to deal with the large number of clusters at meat plants. On Wednesday, thousands of people in Germanywere told to quarantine after 650 workers tested positive for the virus at a meat processing plant. There are various theories about why meat plants are particularly susceptible. But a combination staff working in close proximity, doing very physical work, indoors in a cold environment where the virus is known to thrive are likely to be contributory factors. What is certain is that 58 confirmed cases in a factory that employs around 560 staff will not only be a worry to the workers and their families but also to the wider community. And of course the number is very likely to rise with all staff now being tested and their contacts traced.

"The founder of the pub chain Oakman Inns has vowed to reopen all of its sites on 4 July even if the government has not relaxed restrictions. ""We cannot wait for the government to make a decision,"" Peter Borg-Nealwrote on Twitter,external. The government has said pubs would not be able to reopen until July at the earliest under lockdown measures. But it has not yet given a definitive date for reopening pubs, despite pressure from the industry. Mr Borg-Neal's vow came as the British pubs' trade body demanded a definitive date so that staff could prepare. But some health experts fear that opening venues such as pubs or restaurants too early could increase the number of coronavirus cases, especially as outbreaksreoccur in countries such as China. ""To open without proper forward planning would also be wrong,"" Mr Borg-Neal wrote. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He later told the BBC: ""I'm not trying to be some reckless rebel. ""We need to plan ahead, get staff off furlough, remove furniture, install hand-washing stations, change layouts in pubs,"" he said. ""You can't just give us a couple of days' notice and expect us to open safely."" He added: ""We would not open unless we thought it was 100%-safe to do so."" Oakman Inns told the BBC that it had not yet received a response from the government following the announcement. ""If they wanted to stop us, they could threaten a licensing review, in which they would need to show that we have broken licensing laws. I do intend to seek legal advice on this,"" Mr Borg-Neal said. ""In a conflict situation we might not open all of our pubs immediately, I could just open one or two to see what they do."" On 21 March, the government brought inregulations,externalrequiring pubs, cafes and restaurants to stop serving customers food and drink for consumption on the premises. Mr Borg-Neal said he would have no choice but to open regardless in July, whether the regulations were still in force or not. ""We can hang around and definitely go bust, or open and see if they destroy us,"" he said.

""Without this certainty by the end of this week, many businesses in the sector will be forced to cut costs to ensure their survival through the extended period of financial uncertainty,"" it said. ""This could result in hundreds of thousands of job losses and permanent pub closures."" It said that pubs and beer businesses are ""burning through Â£100m every month in cash while they remain closed"". ""These costs... could tip many pubs over the edge unless they are given clarity and confidence on when exactly they can reopen,"" it said. Other pub bosses also joined in the call for clarity. Mark Davies, chief executive of the Hawthorn Leisure chain, said: ""Our pubs are part of the social fabric of their communities, but there's so much our partners need to do to get ready for reopening, from bringing staff off furlough, to adopting new health and hygiene protocols and implementing social distance measures, not to mention getting beer into their pubs from suppliers. ""If we're to stand any chance of getting the Great British pub open by 4 July, it's imperative that the government provides clear guidance by Friday at the absolute latest.""

"This video can not be played Coronavirus: Extended households can now stay over Most shops in Scotland are to reopen from 29 June as part of a further easing of the country's lockdown rules. The changes will also see anyone who lives on their own - or only with children - to form an ""extended group"" with one other household from tomorrow. People will also be able meet outdoors with two other households at the same time rather than just one. Face coverings are to be made compulsory foreveryone using public transportfrom Monday. And people who have previously been told to shield during the lockdown because they are at high risk are now able to meet other people outside for the first time. No decision has yet been made on when pubs, restaurants or beer gardens will be able to reopen. Coronavirus in Scotland - latest developments Masks to be compulsory on public transport Shielding: What changes have been made? Shops expected to reopen in Wales from Monday The announcement by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon means the country has now moved to the second phase of its four-phase ""route map"" aimed at ending the lockdown while continuing to suppress the virus. But Scottish Conservative leader Jackson Carlaw called for ""much more ambition"", saying everything Ms Sturgeon had announced had already happened in England two weeks ago. And he claimed Ms Sturgeon ""simply doesn't understand or comprehend the depth of the economic crisis we're about to go through"". The Scottish government has generally been taking a more cautious approach to opening up the economy again than the UK government has in England, where shops were able to reopen earlier this month. Ms Sturgeon is concerned that moving too quickly will risk a resurgence of the virus that has already been linked to the deaths of more than 4,000 people in Scotland. She said she understood the desire of all businesses to reopen quickly, but it was vital that they do so ""safely and in a way that is consistent with continued suppression of the virus"". Non-essential shops in Scotland have been closed since the lockdown was imposed on 23 March Her announcement means that shops of all sizes will be able to open from 29 June long as they have outdoor entrances and exits - so indoor shopping centres will remain closed except for essential retailers such as supermarkets and pharmacists. Ms Sturgeon said retailers should now start to put plans in place to ensure that customers and staff are able to keep the required 2m apart. She added: ""Of course, all of us as customers have a role to play. When shops do re-open, I ask everyone to exercise patience, stick to the measures that are in place for your safety, and at all times please respect retail staff who will be asking you to shop in a different way."" David Lonsdale, chief executive Scottish Retail Consortium, said the announcement was a ""significant milestone"" and provided ""much needed clarity on the path ahead"". From today (Thursday), people in the shielding group can meet other people outside and take part in outdoor leisure activities such as golf From tomorrow (Friday), people living alone or with only children can meet one other household indoors Also from tomorrow, people can meet two other households outside in groups of no more than eight From Monday 22 June, facemasks will be compulsory on all public transport including taxis Also from Monday, dentists will be able to open, professional sport can resume behind closed doors and places of worship can reopen for individual prayer From 29 June, most shops and many other indoor businesses can reopen, but not shopping centres, pubs or restaurants Read more about what is changing in phase two Other changes outlined by the first minister include dentists being allowed to reopen for urgent care from Monday, while professional sport will be allowed to resume behind closed doors and places of worship will reopen for individual prayer. Many indoor workplaces such as factories, laboratories and warehouses will also start to reopen from 29 June, subject to strict physical distancing and hygiene rules. And outdoor outdoor markets, playgrounds and sports facilities will reopen on the same day, along with some visitor attractions such as zoos - although visitors should still not travel more than five miles from their homes and tickets should be bought in advance. The wider tourism industry has previously been told to prepare for the possibility of reopening on 15 July. Figures released this week showed that Scotland's economy shrank by 18.9% in April, slightly lower than the 20.4% recorded for the UK as a whole, while its unemployment rate is now the highest of any country in the UK at 4.6%. No decision has yet been made on when pubs and restaurants will be able to reopen People in Scotland have previously only been able to meet outdoors with residents of one other household, and only in groups of up to eight. The changes announced by Ms Sturgeon will see the restrictions relaxed slightly, with people now able to meet two other households at the same time - but again, only in groups of no more than eight. For the first time, these outdoor meetings can include people who in the shielding group who have previously been advised not to go outside. People will also be able to go inside to use the toilet when meeting in someone else's garden, the first minister added. The Scottish government is still considering whether to reduce the current 2m distance rule in some settings And anyone who lives on their own - or only with children under 18 - will be able to form an ""extended household group"" with one other household. These extended groups will be able to meet indoors, without physical distancing, and will also be able to stay overnight - but cannot include people who are part of the shielding group. Ms Sturgeon said: ""It will, from tomorrow, allow a grandparent who lives on their own to form a group with another household in their family. ""It will allow a single parent and their children to join with another household for support. And it will allow a non cohabiting couple, where at least one of them lives alone, to be reunited indoors without physical distancing. ""It will, I hope, help to ease some of the isolation which is one of the cruellest consequences of tackling this virus."" Phase 1 (already in place):Virus not yet contained but cases are falling. From 28 May you should be able to meet another household outside in small numbers. Sunbathing is allowed, along with some outdoor activities like golf and fishing. Garden centres and drive-through takeaways can reopen, some outdoor work can resume, and childminding services can begin. Phase 2 (now being implemented):Virus controlled. You can meet wider group of people outdoors, and some people can form extended household groups. Construction, factories, warehouses and laboratories can resume work, and most shops can reopen - but not indoor shopping centres. Playgrounds and sports courts can reopen, and professional sport can begin again. Phase 3:Virus suppressed.  You can meet people from more than one household indoors. Non-essential offices would reopen, along with gyms, museums, libraries, cinemas, larger shops, pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and dentists. Live events could take place with restricted numbers and physical distancing restrictions. Schools should reopen from 11 August. Phase 4:Virus no longer a significant threat. University and college campuses can reopen in full, mass gatherings are allowed. All workplaces open and public transport is back at full capacity. The Scottish government, like its UK counterpart, has been facing calls to reduce the current 2m social distancing rule to make it easier for the hospitality and tourism industries to reopen. But the first minister said the current guidance will not change ""without rigorous consideration and appropriate assurance"". She added: I have asked our advisers to consider whether there are particular settings and circumstances in which, with additional mitigations, it might be possible in future to recommend a distance of 1 or 1.5 metres. ""I hope to also have this advice within two weeks and will report on it then."" RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job? SCHOOLS:When will children be returning?

""She'll never be forgotten. Her music lives on."" Dame Vera was able to ""move everybody in the country"", Lesley Garrett said Lesley Garrett told BBC Radio 4's The World At One that Dame Vera was ""still able to stir us"" until late in life.

""She had the ability to move everybody in the country - royalty, politicians, you name it, she was an inspiration to them."" Lyricist Sir Tim Rice also paid tribute, saying: ""Dame Vera Lynn was one of the greatest ever British popular singers, not just because of her immaculate voice, warm, sincere, instantly recognisable and musically flawless.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson and Emmanuel Macron viewed documents and artefacts relating to General Charles de Gaulle Boris Johnson has met French President Emmanuel Macron in Downing Street to mark the 80th anniversary of a famous wartime broadcast. In 1940, French Resistance leader Charles de Gaulle used the BBC to send a radio message to Nazi-occupied France, urging people not to give up the struggle against Hitler. Mr Johnson praised the ""courage and sacrifice"" of those who fought on. The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall welcomed Mr Macron to the UK. And the Red Arrows and their French counterparts, La Patrouille, performed a flypast above London to mark the occasion. Prince Charles to welcome Macron to London PM had to soothe concerns over virus strategy New momentum needed in trade talks, say UK and EU Churchill statue uncovered ahead of Macron visit During their meeting, Mr Johnson and Mr Macron discussed post-Brexit trade arrangements between the UK and EU, with No 10 saying the prime minister ""welcomed the agreement to intensify talks in July"". The air display flew directly over Westminster and the recently-uncovered Winston Churchill statue A spokesperson added that he had restated that the UK ""does not believe it makes sense for there to be prolonged negotiations into the autumn"". The ""transition period"" - during which the UK remains in the EU single market and customs union - is due to finish at the end of the year. The two leaders also talked about easing the 14-day coronavirus quarantine measures in place for visitors to - and UK citizens returning to - the UK. Mr Macron was exempt from the requirements, as a ""representative of a foreign country on business"". The Red Arrows and La Patrouille flew over Buckingham Palace It was earlier announced that four surviving French Resistance fighters are to be appointed honorary MBEs. Edgard Tupet-Thome, 100, Daniel Bouyjou-Cordier, 99, Hubert Germain, 99, and Pierre Simonet, 98, are already members of the Order of Liberation, an honour given by France to those who played an outstanding role in freeing the country from its four-year wartime occupation. Mr Macron's visit also comes after it was announced that Dame Vera Lynn, the singer dubbed the ""forces' sweetheart"" for her morale-boosting performances during World War Two,has died aged 103. Social distancing was maintained during the French president's visit to London The two leaders viewed artefacts and letters from General de Gaulle's time in London and from his partnership with the UK's wartime prime minister, Sir Winston Churchill. Mr Johnson presented Mr Macron with a framed montage of a telegram sent from General de Gaulle to Sir Winston on VE Day, in 1945, and Sir Winston's reply. He also gave him a model of Sir Winston's open-top Land Rover and a photograph of General de Gaulle in Paris, shortly after the city's liberation from German forces in 1944. By Gavin Stamp, BBC News It was 80 years ago that General Charles de Gaulle broadcast a historic message from London to his fellow countrymen imploring them not to give up the fight against Hitler. France was on its knees at the time, German troops having entered Paris four days earlier, and on the verge of agreeing an armistice confirming its formal military surrender. In the message, broadcast in French, De Gaulle said: ""Whatever happens, the flame of the French resistance must not be extinguished and will not be extinguished."" Transmitted on the BBC's French Service, the broadcast was not recorded and relatively few people in France heard it. But a similar broadcast four days later on the same network reached a wider audience and went a long way to establishing de Gaulle as his country's leader in-exile. The 18th June 1940 remains one of the most important dates in UK-French history and still has enormous resonance on both sides of the channel. After the fall of France, General de Gaulle made a speech from London 18 June 1940. Known as the ""Appel"", or appeal, it rallied the country in support of the Resistance. This video can not be played When she was 21, Olivia Jordan found herself driving French resistance leader Charles de Gaulle around London Mr Macron, speaking next to General de Gaulle's statue in Carlton Gardens, in central London, said: ""This is where de Gaulle was able to call on the French people to join the Resistance, the soldiers of the shadows. ""Because 80 years ago today, on June 18 1940, the United Kingdom gave Free France its first weapon, a BBC microphone."" Emmanuel Macron laid a wreath at the statue of Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother Mr Johnson said General de Gaulle had arrived in 1940 knowing that Britain and France's shared values of ""freedom, tolerance and democracy"" were under threat and pledging to defend them. ""The struggles we face today are different to those we confronted together 80 years ago. But I have no doubt that - working side by side - the UK and France will continue to rise to every new challenge and seize every opportunity that lies ahead,"" he said.

"Sir Keir Starmer was elected Labour leader in April A new leader and the end of Brexit as an election issue will not be enough for Labour to win back power, a review of the party's 2019 defeat has warned. The Labour Together project says the party has a ""mountain to climb"" after slumping to its lowest number of seats since 1935 in December's poll. It says the historic defeat had been a ""long time coming"" and deep-seated changes were needed. Labour will have been out of power for 14 years by the next election in 2024. The Conservatives won December's election with a majority of 80, while Labour lost 59 seats and saw its vote share fall by eight points. Labour leadership takes blame over result Miliband to join review of Labour's election failure Starmer vows to lead party into 'new era' Departing Corbyn believes he won the fight Labour's defeat led to the resignation of Jeremy Corbyn as party leader. He was replaced in April by Sir Keir Starmer. TheLabour Together report,external, which was largely compiled before the coronavirus pandemic, warned that ""disunity and division within our party over time has badly damaged our electoral fortunes"". And the commissioners of the review agreed it would ""be a mistake to believe that a different leader, with Brexit no longer the defining issue, would in itself be sufficient to change Labour's electoral fortunes"". The organisation, which describes itself as a network of activists from all Labour traditions, surveyed 11,000 members, held in-depth interviews with former MPs and party candidates, and spoke to polling experts and academics. It identified a manifesto viewed as ""undeliverable"" by many voters, concerns about Mr Corbyn's leadership and the party's position on Brexit as the ""interlinked and indivisible"" factors behind the 2019 defeat. But it says the party's problems run far deeper and its failure to properly analyse previous defeats ""sowed the seeds for our failure in 2019"". Mr Corbyn has said Labour ""won the argument"" at last year's election but blamed media bias for the party's defeat and the fact that the campaign was dominated by Brexit. The report paints a portrait of a party riven by ""factionalism"", ""internal arguments"" and ""division"". But it issues a stark warning to those who believe that a change in both the party leadership and in the political landscape will necessarily bring Labour much closer to power. The report says: ""It would be a mistake to believe that a different leader, with Brexit no longer the defining issue, would in itself be sufficient to change Labour's electoral fortunes."" And this is perhaps the true value of the report for the new leadership - it serves as both a reality check for activists and an opportunity for the new regime to argue that a break for the past is necessary. It declares that Labour has ""a mountain to climb"" - and the authors are clearly thinking of K2 rather than a Scottish munro. Read Iain's full analysis. The Labour Together review was headed by MP Lucy Powell - who ran Ed Miliband's unsuccessful 2015 election campaign, leading the party to win more seats than Mr Corbyn in 2019, but with a slightly lower vote share. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she said Labour needed to address a long-standing ""disconnect"" with working-class voters to win again. The ""red wall"" of seats in the party's traditional strongholds, she said, had ""been crumbling for twenty years"". She said there was ""no sign yet that long-term decline is in any way abating,"" adding it could put a number of Labour MPs in formerly safe seats at risk in future. Mr Miliband, who has returned to the shadow cabinet under Sir Keir and was a member of the Labour Together panel, said winning the next election would be a ""Herculean task"". Writing for the Guardian,external, he said the party's ""new core vote"" of younger graduates in big cities are ""not enough on their own to win us the election"". But he said the party needed to maintain a commitment for ""economic transformation,"" adding this was desired by both Leave and Remain voters. Jeremy Corbyn said he would stand down after the 2019 election loss The report said responsibility for the defeat did not rest ""wholly with one side or part of our movement"". But it said Mr Corbyn's low poll ratings going into the election could not ""easily be disentangled from the handling of issues like Brexit, party disunity and anti-Semitism"". Momentum, the campaign group formed out of Mr Corbyn's successful 2015 leadership bid, called the report a ""much needed contribution"" to the debate over Labour's future election strategy. A spokesperson said the party needed to ""professionalise the party machine,"" and better engage party members through ""community organising"". They added the group was happy to offer its ""expertise"" in digital campaigning to help the party reach more voters online. Other issues highlighted in the report included: Labour losing all types of voters compared with the 2017 election, but losing support amongst working class communities the most The loss of voters ""stretched back over two decades"", especially with those who ended up voting Leave in the 2016 EU referendum The party ""suffered a meltdown"" in Scotland over Brexit, the leadership and Labour's position on a second independence referendum Labour ""lost the online campaign"", spending too much time talking to its own members, rather than persuading other voters to support them. In its recommendations, the report warned Labour could ""could fall further, unless it faces up to the disconnect between the party and the public and is realistic about the scale of the political and organisational task ahead"". It said the party needed to ""build a winning coalition of voters which spans generations, geographies and outlooks"", while holding onto Labour's existing supporters and ""inspiring more younger voters"".

"Shopping centres like Friars Walk in Newport have been closed since March Non-essential retailers in Wales will be told they can reopen from Monday, the first minister is expected to announce. Mark Drakeford will set out further changes to the lockdown laws at a press conference on Friday. Businesses will be expected to ensure two-metre social distancing is observed. Other small changes may be announced, but the advice to stay local is likely to remain in place. Shops in England have been trading since the start of the week. But after that prompted queues outside retailers, Health Minister Vaughan Gething said he does not want to see large crowds outside reopened retailers. The Welsh Government is expected to keep its cautious approach, and says its priority continues to be ""keep Wales safe"". Earlier the Scottish Government announced that retailers there could reopen on29 June. This video can not be played Non-essential shops in England reopened on Monday At the daily Welsh Government press conference Mr Gething said he did not want to see a repeat ""of crowds bunched together outside shops in complete breach of what social-distancing guidance is supposed to deliver"". Earlier in the week Mr Drakeford said reopening retail was one of a ""package"" of measures being looked at. He said he was keen for the economy to reopen in Wales, but public health must come first ""as that is the best way for our economy"". Currently people in Wales are only allowed to travel locally - with five miles given as a guide. That is not expected to change on Friday. The rule has been criticised by Conservative politicians who say it unfairly harms people in rural areas. Reopening shops is a move that has been heavily trailed by ministers and they are keen to stress that caution remains their watchword. The approach from the Welsh Government has been to announce one big thing in each review and then monitor its effect on the reproduction rate of the virus. Recently though, they have started putting sectors ""on notice"" for reopening - shops next week, followed by schools the week after. Perhaps this time there will be something for the tourism sector to look forward to? Retailers have been given time to prepare to reopen Non-essential shops have been closed to the public in Wales since lockdown began in late March. Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Paul Davies claimed the Welsh Government had ""listened"" to its calls to begin to reopen the Welsh economy. ""But while we welcome this announcement, it frankly beggars belief as to why travel restrictions are not being lifted too,"" he said. ""Many retailers need custom from a wide area to survive and will go to the wall if they are forced to rely on local trade alone."" Plaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said the announcement did ""not come as a surprise"". ""Many people will be glad to see yet another element of easing restrictions,"" he said. ""However, we need to know not only which restrictions are being eased in the here and now but also which restrictions are expected to be lifted in the weeks and months ahead.""

Public Health Wales confirmed 58 cases at the 2 Sisters chicken factory in Llangefni on Anglesey, with all staff now being told to self-isolate. In Wrexham, 38 staff have tested positive at Rowan Foods, which makes food for supermarkets across the UK. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said the Anglesey outbreak was a ""concern"". Wales TUC, who campaign for workers' rights, said it was ""alarmed to see a pattern of workplace outbreaks in food manufacturing"", but the companies said they had put staff safety first during the pandemic.

It said staff at the factory would be tested, with all workers being contacted by the company to arrange the tests. A testing site has been set up Llangefni, while an existing facility in Bangor is also being used.Â  A further site is also being set up in Holyhead. Rowan Foods in Wrexham has said there is no clear evidence to suggest that there is a spread of the virus within the site Meanwhile Rowan Foods, which employs 1,500 people, said 38 staff were ""absent due to testing positive for Covid-19"", but said there was ""no clear evidence to suggest that there is a spread of the virus within the site"". The company, owned by Oscar Meyer Quality Foods, makes ready meals for companies across the UK, including Aldi, Asda, and Sainsbury's. In a statement, it said none of the staff were ""seriously ill or had been hospitalised"" and contact tracing was taking place. 2 Sisters said ""the health, safety and well-being of our colleagues is ultimately the thing that matters most at our business"". ""In light of the current Covid-19 cases at our Llangefni site, we have decided to take the necessary action to clearly demonstrate how seriously we take this issue by doing the right thing,"" a statement said. ""Doing the right thing means from today [18 June] we will temporarily suspend production at our Llangefni site with immediate effect for a period of 14 days. ""We will not tolerate any unnecessary risks - however small - for our existing loyal workforce at the facility."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Oscar Meyer Quality Foods said its priority had been the safety of staff at the Wrexham plant and it had made ""significant operational changes at the site"" to maintain social distancing, including putting in screens and visors. ""Whilst we are seeing a number of cases on site, Public Health Wales support our view that there is no clear evidence to suggest that there is a spread of the virus within the site, we are seeing a reflection on site of the increases in cases within the locality,"" it said. ""We will continue to do all we can to remain vigilant and to keep our colleagues and families safe."" 2 Sisters Food Group is one of the largest food producers in the UK, and produces about a third of all the poultry products eaten each day in the UK. According to PHW figures, there were 11 confirmed new Covid-19 cases in Anglesey on Wednesday and 11 more on Thursday - the most in any Welsh county on both days. The health minister said he was ""concerned"" the outbreak would lead to more cases. ""Given that this is a closed setting in which these people would have been working, I'm obviously concerned that we may well see more confirmed cases of coronavirus,"" Mr Gething told the Welsh government's daily briefing. Wales' health minister says the outbreak ""reiterates the importance of social distancing and appropriate hygiene measures"" He added the outbreak showed ""that even with a low prevalence of coronavirus, it hasn't gone."" ""It also reiterates the importance of our test, trace, protect system - and that people really do need to follow the advice that they're given on getting a test, and on self isolating."" PHW said it was ""working in partnership"" with 2 Sisters, Anglesey council, Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, the Health and Safety Executive and the Food Standards Agency to ""manage the incident"". ""We are working in close collaboration with the employer and Anglesey council, and our priority is to bring this outbreak to a swift conclusion,"" said Christopher Johnson. The Food Standards Agency said there was no reason food would not be safe The Food Standards Agency said it was ""very unlikely you can catch coronavirus from food"" as the virus is a respiratory illness. The agency's Caroline Kitson said the virus was ""not known to be transmitted by exposure to food or food packaging"". More than 1,000 workers at the GÃ¼tersloh plant, in Germany, have been tested after an outbreak at the meat processing plant Paddy McNaught, the regional organiser for the union Unite, said the number of cases of coronavirus at the Anglesey factory had risen ""significantly"" in the past few days. ""In fairness, the company, they have tried to work with us to provide a safe working environment, where social distancing - as best as it can - takes place,"" he said. But he said production line work at the plant meant adhering to the distancing rule had been ""virtually impossible"" and there had been the ""usual"" concerns from staff about ""social distancing and face masks"". He added that the union would be working with the company to make sure the factory had a professional deep clean before workers were allowed back at the site. In Wales,employers are required by lawto do everything they can to make sure workers can socially distance while in the workplace, or face a fine of up to Â£120. Wales TUC general secretary Shavanah Taj said she was ""alarmed to see a pattern of workplace outbreaks in food manufacturing"". ""We've had long-held concerns about health and safety in this industry during the crisis and the risks posed to these key workers, who are employed in an industry with some of the lowest rates of average pay,"" she said. Some of the biggest outbreaks of Covid-19 worldwide have been in meat processing factories and slaughterhouses. In Ireland for example, a special national outbreak team has been put in place to deal with the large number of clusters at meat plants. On Wednesday, thousands of people in Germanywere told to quarantine after 650 workers tested positive for the virus at a meat processing plant. There are various theories about why meat plants are particularly susceptible. But a combination staff working in close proximity, doing very physical work, indoors in a cold environment where the virus is known to thrive are likely to be contributory factors. What is certain is that 58 confirmed cases in a factory that employs around 560 staff will not only be a worry to the workers and their families but also to the wider community. And of course the number is very likely to rise with all staff now being tested and their contacts traced.

"Pupils who have fallen behind during school closures are expected to be offered focused tuition as part of the government's catch-up plans. England's schools will receive funding for support through a national tutoring programme to run for up to three years. The scheme will use proven tutoring organisations and charities, using volunteer and paid tutors. Head teachers support the plans but want to be able to use the service to supplement their own catch-up work. A pilot tutoring project, led by several social mobility groups including the Sutton Trust and the Education Endowment Foundation and Impetus, is looking at how best pupils affected by school closures can be supported. It is expected that this will be rolled into a national tutoring service, but it is not known how many pupils will be supported or how much is being invested. The scheme is likely to offer primary pupils support in maths and English in six-week blocks, while secondary pupils would be offered targeted help in specific subjects from specialist graduates and post-graduates. Summer activity schemes and emotional support are also set to be offered in the run up to schools re-opening in September. The government said it was drawing up proposals for an extended catch-up last week, adding that they would involve all pupils, not just those from poor backgrounds who are believed to have fared worst during closures. By Judith Burns, BBC education reporter Nana, 17, from Enfield north London is aiming for a place at Cambridge to study human, social and political science. Since lockdown began, her tutor with the Access Project has been sending her sample exam questions which she does to time and sends back for feedback. Weekly face-to-face sessions with a graduate volunteer who works in finance in the City of London, have been keeping her on track. Nana will apply for Cambridge next term At first they focused on reading and discussing excerpts from key historical or political texts. Nana's mum is a cleaner and her dad is a nursing assistant, and the idea that she could apply to one of the best universities in the world didn't occur to her until her mentor at the education charity, The Access Project suggested it at the start of Year 12. ""She said: 'You have the potential, you might as well try,'"" Nana remembers. ""I didn't know about the collegiate system, that you had to do an admissions test or an interview or how important the personal statement was,"" she says. The Access Project has helped her get to grips with all that and drilled into her the importance of wider reading in order to get top grades in her A-levels in history, sociology and English literature. Now similar schemes could be rolled out to help other young people fulfil their potential at this difficult time. Boris Johnson said his Education Secretary Gavin Williamson would be setting out plans soon. The government has been under intense pressure over its back to school policy. Concerns had been raised about the potential for a lost generation of learners, whose education will have been interrupted for at least six months even if schools return, as now planned, in September. Geoff Barton, leader of the Association of School and College Leaders, agrees there is evidence that high quality one-to-one tuition is beneficial but suspects ""the devil will be in the detail"". ""It is enormously frustrating that we haven't had the opportunity to discuss these points with the government ahead of an announcement and that we once again find ourselves having to guess what they will say."" The move comes after the education secretary ditched plans for all primary pupils to return to school before the summer break. However, pupils in Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 have been prioritised and are attending in many schools for at least part of the week. And pupils facing GCSEs and A-Levels next year are being invited into schools in smaller groups for time with their teachers over the next few weeks. Paediatricians seek clear plans on school return A third of pupils 'not engaging with set work' Rashford seeks more change after food voucher win England's back-to-school plans 'lie in tatters' But this can be anything from a half hour catch-up appointment to a few hours' learning each week. The Prime Minister has been accused of ""flailing around"" over schools. Labour leader Keir Starmer has called for a national recovery plan, saying the current plan to get pupils back to classrooms were ""lying in tatters"". School capacity is severely restricted by guidelines on social distancing. Classes have been divided into smaller groups of up to 15 pupils, depending on classroom size, which means only a fraction of children can be on site at any one time. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? IMPACT:What the virus does to the body RECOVERY:How long does it take? LOCKDOWN:How can we lift restrictions? ENDGAME:How do we get out of this mess? Schools in Wales are re-opening at the end of June, with only a third of pupils in class at any time, In Scotland, schools are preparing to re-open on 11 August, and in Northern Ireland ministers are aiming to start bringing pupils back on 17 August.

"The boy appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court A 14-year-old boy has appeared in court accused of trying to make homemade bombs containing shrapnel. The teenager, from Eastleigh, was arrested on Friday after concerns were raised by social services. He appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court charged with one count of preparation of a terrorist act. The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is thought to be the youngest person ever accused of planning a terrorist attack in the UK. The defendant did not enter a plea and was remanded in youth detention. He is next due to appear at the Old Bailey on Monday 22 June. The court was told the boy had converted to Islam. It is alleged he researched how to make explosives, constructed a series of devices with the aim of making them explosive devices containing shrapnel, and had recorded a video saying he wanted to be a martyr.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson and Emmanuel Macron viewed documents and artefacts relating to General Charles de Gaulle Boris Johnson has met French President Emmanuel Macron in Downing Street to mark the 80th anniversary of a famous wartime broadcast. In 1940, French Resistance leader Charles de Gaulle used the BBC to send a radio message to Nazi-occupied France, urging people not to give up the struggle against Hitler. Mr Johnson praised the ""courage and sacrifice"" of those who fought on. The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall welcomed Mr Macron to the UK. And the Red Arrows and their French counterparts, La Patrouille, performed a flypast above London to mark the occasion. Prince Charles to welcome Macron to London PM had to soothe concerns over virus strategy New momentum needed in trade talks, say UK and EU Churchill statue uncovered ahead of Macron visit During their meeting, Mr Johnson and Mr Macron discussed post-Brexit trade arrangements between the UK and EU, with No 10 saying the prime minister ""welcomed the agreement to intensify talks in July"". The air display flew directly over Westminster and the recently-uncovered Winston Churchill statue A spokesperson added that he had restated that the UK ""does not believe it makes sense for there to be prolonged negotiations into the autumn"". The ""transition period"" - during which the UK remains in the EU single market and customs union - is due to finish at the end of the year. The two leaders also talked about easing the 14-day coronavirus quarantine measures in place for visitors to - and UK citizens returning to - the UK. Mr Macron was exempt from the requirements, as a ""representative of a foreign country on business"". The Red Arrows and La Patrouille flew over Buckingham Palace It was earlier announced that four surviving French Resistance fighters are to be appointed honorary MBEs. Edgard Tupet-Thome, 100, Daniel Bouyjou-Cordier, 99, Hubert Germain, 99, and Pierre Simonet, 98, are already members of the Order of Liberation, an honour given by France to those who played an outstanding role in freeing the country from its four-year wartime occupation. Mr Macron's visit also comes after it was announced that Dame Vera Lynn, the singer dubbed the ""forces' sweetheart"" for her morale-boosting performances during World War Two,has died aged 103. Social distancing was maintained during the French president's visit to London The two leaders viewed artefacts and letters from General de Gaulle's time in London and from his partnership with the UK's wartime prime minister, Sir Winston Churchill. Mr Johnson presented Mr Macron with a framed montage of a telegram sent from General de Gaulle to Sir Winston on VE Day, in 1945, and Sir Winston's reply. He also gave him a model of Sir Winston's open-top Land Rover and a photograph of General de Gaulle in Paris, shortly after the city's liberation from German forces in 1944. By Gavin Stamp, BBC News It was 80 years ago that General Charles de Gaulle broadcast a historic message from London to his fellow countrymen imploring them not to give up the fight against Hitler. France was on its knees at the time, German troops having entered Paris four days earlier, and on the verge of agreeing an armistice confirming its formal military surrender. In the message, broadcast in French, De Gaulle said: ""Whatever happens, the flame of the French resistance must not be extinguished and will not be extinguished."" Transmitted on the BBC's French Service, the broadcast was not recorded and relatively few people in France heard it. But a similar broadcast four days later on the same network reached a wider audience and went a long way to establishing de Gaulle as his country's leader in-exile. The 18th June 1940 remains one of the most important dates in UK-French history and still has enormous resonance on both sides of the channel. After the fall of France, General de Gaulle made a speech from London 18 June 1940. Known as the ""Appel"", or appeal, it rallied the country in support of the Resistance. This video can not be played When she was 21, Olivia Jordan found herself driving French resistance leader Charles de Gaulle around London Mr Macron, speaking next to General de Gaulle's statue in Carlton Gardens, in central London, said: ""This is where de Gaulle was able to call on the French people to join the Resistance, the soldiers of the shadows. ""Because 80 years ago today, on June 18 1940, the United Kingdom gave Free France its first weapon, a BBC microphone."" Emmanuel Macron laid a wreath at the statue of Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother Mr Johnson said General de Gaulle had arrived in 1940 knowing that Britain and France's shared values of ""freedom, tolerance and democracy"" were under threat and pledging to defend them.

Actress and singer Sheridan Smith, who performed Dame Vera's anthem We'll Meet Again for the 75th anniversary of D-Day last year, told BBC Radio 5 Live her music is ""so relevant today, just as it was back then"". ""She boosted morale with her music and brought the nation together though music, and it's been very relevant recently. A lot of people have been using it again at this strange time,"" Smith said. ""She'll never be forgotten. Her music lives on."" Dame Vera was able to ""move everybody in the country"", Lesley Garrett said Lesley Garrett told BBC Radio 4's The World At One that Dame Vera was ""still able to stir us"" until late in life. ""She had the ability to communicate to an extraordinary degree, and there was nobody who she didn't touch,"" she said. ""She had the ability to move everybody in the country - royalty, politicians, you name it, she was an inspiration to them."" Lyricist Sir Tim Rice also paid tribute, saying: ""Dame Vera Lynn was one of the greatest ever British popular singers, not just because of her immaculate voice, warm, sincere, instantly recognisable and musically flawless. ""She will be remembered just as affectionately for her vital work in the Second World War and for her own Charitable Foundations in the 75 years since. A link with more certain times has been irrevocably broken."" BBC director general Tony Hall said she ""demonstrated how music and entertainment can bring joy in the most challenging times"".

"The Bank of England will pump an extra Â£100bn into the UK economy to help fight the ""unprecedented"" coronavirus-induced downturn. Bank policymakers voted 8-1 to increase the size of its bond-buying programme. However, they said there was growing evidence that the hit to the economy would be ""less severe"" than initially feared. The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) also kept interest rates at a record low of 0.1%. The move comes just days after Bank governor Andrew Bailey saidpolicymakers were ready to take actionafter the economy suffered its biggest monthly contraction on record. The UK economy shrank by 20.4% in April, while official jobs data showed the number of workers on UK payrollsfell by more than 600,000 between March and May. The Bank said more recent indicators suggested the economy was starting to bounce back. Minutes from the MPC's June meeting,externalsaid: ""Payments data are consistent with a recovery in consumer spending in May and June, and housing activity has started to pick up recently."" However, Mr Bailey warned that the outlook for the economy remained uncertain. He said: ""We don't want to get too carried away by this. Let's be clear, we're still living in very unusual times."" The minutes added: ""While recent demand and output data had not been quite as negative as expected, other indicators suggested greater risks around the potential for longer-lasting damage to the economy from the pandemic."" What is QE and how will it affect you? Job cuts warning as 600,000 roles go in lockdown Back in May, policymakers warned the economy washeading for its sharpest recession on record. Scenarios drawn up by the Bank suggested the economy could shrink by 25% in the three months to June. However, the MPC said more recent evidence suggested the contraction would be less severe. The extra monetary stimulus - known as quantitative easing (QE) - will raise the total size of the Bank's asset purchase programme to Â£745bn. Policymakers said the injection would help to support financial markets and underpin the recovery. However, Andy Haldane, the Bank's chief economist, voted against the increase. He said the recovery was happening ""sooner and materially faster"" than the Bank expected in May. Policymakers said the jobs market was likely to remain weak for some time, with a risk of ""higher and more persistent unemployment"". Millions of workers have already seen their pay packets shrink as a result oflower pay for furloughed employees. A survey by the Bank said other companies had postponed or cancelled pay rises this year. Mr Bailey said: ""Even with the relaxation of some Covid-related restrictions on economic activity, a degree of precautionary behaviour by households and businesses is likely to persist. The economy, and especially the labour market, will therefore take some time to recover towards its previous path."" Mr Bailey also addressed the recent fall in UK inflation in anopen letter to Chancellor Rishi Sunak,external. Inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI),fell to 0.5% in May, from 0.8% in April- well below the Bank of England's 2% target. Mr Bailey said weak inflation had been by driven by falling oil and energy prices, as well as a global drop in economic activity. The Bank expects inflation to return to target within two years. Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics expects the Bank to increase QE again later this year. ""Unemployment looks set to rise sharply in the second half of this year and to fall back slowly thereafter,"" he said. ""The resulting prolonged weakness in domestically generated inflation likely will necessitate the MPC doing more to stimulate the economy in the winter."" The Bank of England has increased its support for the economy, despite it assessing that the outlook is not quite as awful as its scenario last month. The economy is on course for a hit in the second quarter of about 20% compared with the final three months of 2019. That's still historic, and off the scale, but not quite as extreme as the 27% it predicted in May. The extra Â£100bn of purchases of government bonds also has the air of an insurance policy. Most of the MPC were concerned about a couple of factors, A less awful outlook does not mean the recovery will be quick. This is for two reasons stretching beyond economics. There is a fear that the ""prevalence of the virus"" in the UK will mean that Britons will continue to socially distance, voluntarily, holding back the recovery more than other nations (Germany would be an example). Related to that was the idea that more QE now could mitigate the economic impact of ""higher rates of Covid-19 infection going forward"" - a second wave. So the news is still bad, but less awful. But risks beyond the purely economic led to more billions being injected into the economy. What is quantitative easing?

"Nearly 100 workers at food plants in Llangefni and Wrexham have tested positive for Covid-19 Non-essential shops in Wales are expected to be told tomorrow they can reopen from Monday Only one of the field hospitals set up in Wales to help ease demand during the coronavirus pandemic has treated any patients Firefighters help families after 200 properties in the south Wales valleys are flooded, some for the third time this year Matt Lloyd, Philip Marsh and Andy Roberts That's it for today's live page coverage of the flooding and coronavirus crisis in Wales. Here's a recap of the main developments today:  Click herefor continued coverage of coronavirus developments around the world. We'll be back tomorrow when First Minister Mark Drakeford will announce any changes to the lockdown regulations in Wales. Poor communications between the UK and Welsh governments are ""hampering"" efforts to tackle coronavirus, a senior Welsh Parliament committee has warned. The Finance Committee has been looking at the Â£2.4bn extra Welsh ministers are spending on dealing with the outbreak. The committee says London-Wales ""communication channels"" were""not as open as they could be""and co-ordination was being ""hampered"". UK ministers said the administrations had ""worked more closely than ever"" together. The committee'sreport,externalpraises the Welsh Government's ""swift action"" during the crisis, but says it is not clear what Welsh ministers are doing to prepare for life after lockdown is eased. First Minister Mark Drakeford said on Monday he had not spoken to the PM for over a fortnight Felicity EvansBBC Wales political editor Itâs expected that non-essential retailers will be told they can open from Monday, when the first minister reveals the latest changes to the coronavirus laws on Friday. Welsh retailers were told to prepare for a possible reopening three weeks ago, while shops in England have been trading since Monday. The Welsh Government will continue to emphasise caution and says its priority continues to be âkeep Wales safeâ. Businesses will be expected to ensure two-metre social distancing is observed in their premises, after Health Minister Vaughan Gething said he did not want to see large crowds gathering near shops. First Minister Mark Drakeford referred to a âpackageâ of measures in his last press briefing, and he may also announce some smaller easing of restrictions, although the controversial âstay localâ message is likely to remain in place. Reopening shops is a move thatâs been heavily trailed by ministers and theyâre keen to stress that caution remains their watchword. The approach from the Welsh Government has been to announce one big thing in each review and then monitor its effect on the reproduction rate of the virus. Recently though, theyâve started putting sectors âon noticeâ for reopening â shops next week, followed by schools the week after. Perhaps this time there will be something for the tourism sector to look forward to? Owain ClarkeBBC Wales Health Correspondent Some of the biggest outbreaks of Covid-19 worldwide have
been in meat processing factories and slaughterhouses. In Ireland, for example, a special National Outbreak Team has been put in place to deal with the large
number of clusters at meat plants. There are various theories about why meat plants are particularly
susceptible. But a combination staff working in close proximity, doing very
physical work, indoors in a cold environment where the virus is known to thrive
-  are likely to be contributory factors. What's certain is that 58 confirmed Covid-19 cases in a factory that
employs around 560 staff - 2 Sisters in Llangefni, Anglesey - will not only be a worry to the workers and their
families but also to the wider community. And
of course the number is very likely to rise with all staff now being tested and
their contacts traced. Children and young people have been invited to put their questions to Wales' education minister about the reopening of schools and colleges. Kirsty Williams will give her replies next Wednesday, with schools set to partially reopen from 29 June. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A coronavirus outbreak at a chicken processing plant on Anglesey has now affected 58 workers. Public Health Wales (PHW) said the number of confirmed cases at the2 Sisters factory in Llangefnihad risen from 51 to 58 with more than 200 people told to self-isolate for 14 days. All of the plant's 560-strong workforce are now to be tested, PHW said. Production at the plant has been suspended and the site closed for two weeks as the company said it wanted to show ""how seriously we take this issue"". Health Minister Vaughan Gething admitted the outbreak was a ""concern"". A factory in Wrexham which produces food ranges for supermarkets
across the UK has confirmed 38 staff have tested positive for Covid-19. Rowan Foods - owned by Oscar Meyer Quality
Foods - employs 1,500 people. It makes prepared foods for UK supermarket chains including Aldi, Asda and Sainsburyâs. The company said there was ""no clear evidence"" the virus had spread within the factory but was a ""reflection"" of an increase in the number of cases across the Wrexham area. It said: âThe site
has 38 staff absent due to testing positive for Covid-19, this is across our
direct and agency workforce which totals 1,500. ""We are very thankful that none
of our colleagues are seriously ill or hospitalised from this virus. âFollowing notification of a positive Covid case we have
worked with Public Health Wales and had already implemented a track-and-trace
process to highlight any close contacts. ""These colleagues are required to
isolate for a 14-day period of isolation. Any member of staff who has tested
positive for Covid-19 is asked to isolate for at least seven days. âThe safety of our colleagues remains our priority and
our focus is remaining Covid-19 secure as a site. âWe are aware through discussions with Public Health
Wales that the Wrexham area is seeing significantly high numbers of positive
cases. It is concerning but not surprising that we are seeing a number of our
staff affected by this local trend. ""Similarly, we are experiencing a high
number of staff required to isolate.  A large proportion of our teams are from
the same household/family and interact outside of work as well as being work
colleagues."" It follows news that more than 50 staff at the2 Sisters chicken processing plant in Llangefni, Anglesey, have tested positive for coronavirus. Rowan Foods management said there was ""no clear evidence"" the virus had spread within the factory The Pro14 rugby tournament will returnafter a five-month Covid-19 pandemic hiatus from 22 August with Welsh derbies. Teams from the same nation will play against each other home and away before the season is concluded by semi-finals and a final. Those finishing in the top two places in Conference A and B will contest the semi-finals. The final is scheduled to take place on Saturday, 12 September with the venue to be confirmed. Bethan LewisBBC Wales Family & Education Correspondent Schools and councils will have the final say on whether the summer term is extended for an extra week, the Welsh Government has said. Discussions are believed to be continuing between government officials, unions and councils. There are union concerns that extending the term to 27 July causes major problems relating to staff contracts. Education Minister Kirsty Williams wants all pupils to get a taste of school from 29 June before the summer break. But some unions have questioned the safety and practicality of the proposal and have warned there may not be sufficient numbers of cleaners and teaching assistants to enable schools to open for an extra week. Anglesey has the highest number of new coronavirus cases for the second day running. According to data from Public Health Wales, 11 of the 48 new cases were on the island. They were among the 25 new cases reported within the Betsi Cadwaladr health board region, which covers north Wales. There were 13 new cases in Cardiff and Vale, three in the Aneurin Bevan health board area, two in Cwm Taf, two in Hywel Dda (both in Ceredigion), none in Powys and none in the Swansea Bay health board region. The news comes as the2 Sisters chicken processing plant at Llangefni on Anglesey suspends productionand closes due to a coronavirus outbreak. Public Health Wales said there were 51 confirmed cases at the plant, with more than 200 people said to be self-isolating. The 2 Sisters chicken processing plant at Llangefni has closed after a coronavirus outbreak Handling the coronavirus pandemic in Wales has been ""responsible"", Health Minister Vaughan Gething has insisted. It comes after Sir David King, who chairs an independent panel of scientific experts, told the Senedd it had been âdisastrousâ and âirresponsibleâ to launch a test and trace scheme so late into the pandemic. Giving the Welsh Government's daily briefing, Mr Gething said: âI think we've been responsible throughout the course of the pandemic. âThat doesn't mean that with the benefit of hindsight, we wouldn't make different choices with the knowledge we have today. âAnd what we have done is we have built up our capacity. ""We weren't able to simply flick a switch to turn on the significant capacity that we now have, itâs taken time to get there.â Mr Gething added he was âvery proudâ of the work that the NHS and local government have done to create the test, trace and protect service. To date 1,471 people are known to have died with coronavirus in Wales. The number of new deaths being declared is less than at the peak of the pandemic. Public Health Wales publishes a daily total of the number of people who have died with Covid-19, with figures provided by health boards. Here is how the deaths have been tracked, allocated to the day they occurred rather than the day they were announced. Public Health Wales says 1,471 people are now known to have died with coronavirus in Wales. Today a further five deaths were confirmed by local authorities. The area with the highest number of total deaths is the Betsi Cadwaladr health board area in north Wales. Health Minister Vaughan Gething says the Welsh Government is committed to âproviding reassurancesâ to teaching staff and parents who may have concerns about the reopening of schools in Wales on 29 June. A survey by the trade union Unison shows over 70 percent of school support staff across Wales believe opening schools before September is too soon. Speaking during the Welsh Government coronavirus press conference today, Mr Gething said it was âreally importantâ to listen to concerns of those already in work and those who may be returning. âWe are certainly doing nothing to have unacceptable risk, weâre not asking staff to go and put themselves at risk,"" he said. âIn the conversations with education unions, I think there is an understanding that there is harm being caused to childrenâs future prospects by not being able to see more education activity restart.â Mr Gething added: âIâm committed to providing reassurance for the understandable concerns that some of our staff have, to make sure we have all our systems in place working with the education minister and local governments and indeed employers."" Five further people have died with coronavirus in Wales, taking the total to 1,471. A further 48 new cases were declared by health boards on Thursday, taking the total to 14,970. But Public Health Wales, who publish the figures, have repeatedly warned the figure could be much higher, as not everyone with symptoms is tested. ""Localised action"" may be needed to tackle Covid-19 hotspots, said the health minster Vaughan Gething. He was being quizzed following the outbreak at an Anglesey chicken processing plant, where 51 workers have contracted coronavirus. The 2 Sisters site at Llangenfi has been closed in a bid to control the virus spread. He said the Welsh Government had been clear that it did not want to take a ""regional approach to easing out of lockdown"". ""We've not ruled out the prospect or the possibility that there could be very localised measures put in place that go beyond individual households being asked to isolate,"" the minister said at the daily briefing. ""But as and when those choices need to be made, we will of course need to communicate those with the public."" Vaughan Gething The Secretary of State for Walesâ intervention on behalf of tourism businesses was ""clumsy and ill-judged"", Mr Gething has told the briefing. ""Weâre all learning and Iâm sure the secretary of state for Wales recognises that he has learning to take from the coronavirus pandemic too,â he said. Simon Hart MP, the Secretary of State for Wales, wrote to members of the Senedd and council leaders urging them to put pressure on Mark Drakeford to re-open the tourism industry in Wales. At todayâs coronavirus briefing, Mr Gething said Mr Hart had âthe luxury of not being a decision makerâ and it would be âmuch better for all of us if the Secretary of State engaged in a more constructive discussion with usâ. âWe are making very difficult decisions about balancing the risks in public health with the harms lockdown cause,"" he said. âI think it was a clumsy and ill-judged intervention for the secretary of state to make,â he added. Tourism intervention 'clumsy and ill-judged', said health minister Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething says he does not want to see ""crowds bunched together outside shops"" if non-essential retailers are allowed to open next week. First Minister Mark Drakeford, is due to announce the outcome of the latest lockdown review in Wales on Friday. Answering questions on Thursday, Mr Gething said a Covid-19 outbreak at a chicken processing plant in Llangefni, Anglesey, showed the importance of maintaining social distancing. Mr Gething told the Welsh Government's daily coronavirus news conference he did not want to see shop workers or shoppers ""put at risk"". ""People really do need to take a step back and realise the seriousness of the position we're in, and to recognise that the release from lockdown comes with responsibilities for all of us in the way that we choose to behave,"" he said. Shoppers queued outside a Nike store in London after lockdown was eased in England The outbreak of Covid-19 at at a chicken factory on Anglesey âreiterates the importance of social distancing and hand hygieneâ, Wales' health minister says. Public Health Wales has announced it has identified51 confirmed cases of the virus at the 2 Sisters plant in Llangefni. Speaking at the Welsh Governmentâs daily press briefing, Vaughan Gething also said he was âconcernedâ there may be more confirmed cases to come. âObviously this reiterates a number of points: it reiterates the fact that even with a low prevalence of coronavirus it hasn't gone, it reiterates the importance of social distancing and appropriate hygiene measures, it also reiterates the importance of our test trace protect system,"" he said. ""People really do need to follow the advice that they're given on getting a test, and on self isolating. âGiven that this is a closed setting in which these people would have been working, I'm obviously concerned that we may well see more confirmed cases of coronavirus,â he added. All residential care homes in Wales have been offered coronavirus testing, the health minister says. By the start of this week, more than 22,800 care home residents and 28,780 staff had been tested, Vaughan Gething told the daily coronavirus briefing. ""Of these,1,212 residents and 1,206 care workers have tested positive for coronavirus."" There are more than 1,200 residential care homes in Wales. However, Mr Gething added: ""There are about 30 care homes across Wales, that have not yet agreed and completed how testing will take place. ""These are care homes where there has not been an outbreak of coronavirus. ""Understandably they have been reluctant to allow testing to take place because they are worried about the risk of coronavirus entering their homes, however small that risk may be. ""Health boards, Care Forum Wales and Care Inspectorate Wales are working with these homes to understand their reasons for not accepting the offer of testing and to encourage take up."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"The Principality Stadium, in Cardiff, was transformed into a field hospital to treat coronavirus patients Only one of the field hospitals set up to help ease demand during the coronavirus pandemic has treated any patients, despite costing Â£166m. Buildings, including sports stadiums and theatres, were rapidly turned into 17 hospitals at the peak of the crisis. But only the Dragon's Heart Hospital in Cardiff has received any patients. Health Minister Vaughan Gething defended the decision saying in hindsight he would have ""made different choices at the time"". ""If we had needed extra capacity, in much greater numbers, and I had not acted as I did, I think the public would have rightly said, 'Why on earth didn't that man in charge do something about it?',"" he said. In a bid to ease pressure on hospitals,17 field hospitals were rapidly built to provide 6,000 additional beds, doubling the Welsh NHS's capacity at the peak of the pandemic. It took just eight weeks to build those field hospitals, and two additional community step-down facilities for non-coronavirus patients. This video can not be played Cameras got a first look inside the field hospital at the Principality Stadium Since the Dragon's Heart Hospital at the Principality Stadium opened in April, 46 patients have been treated at the home of the Welsh Rugby Team, which is now empty and on standby in case of a second wave. No-one has been admitted to the other 16 locations around the country, including the 1,000-bed facility at Swansea Bay Studios and Venue Cymru in Llandudno, Conwy. A pre-recorded message from Prince Charles was played on a big screen during the opening ceremony at the Dragon's Heart field hospital Mr Gething said the Welsh Government had set up the hospitals after seeing how parts of the health service in Italy had been overwhelmed. A review is due later this month to decide how many field hospitals will be retained or repurposed. A health economist from Swansea University said that, in hindsight, spending Â£166m on 46 patients was ""not a good use of limited resources"". Prof Ceri Phillips said: ""Elective operations were cancelled, the level of demand was reduced, out-patients was reorganised so people weren't coming into hospital."" Wales' coronavirus field hospitals cost Â£166m Principality Stadium: Contract extended for coronavirus field hospital Mr Gething said it was possible ""fewer field hospitals"" would be needed in the coming months. ""It's also possible we can make more use of the current capacity we have as we restart more normal NHS activity,"" he added. Roy Thomas gave one of his buildings at Bay Studios to be used as a field hospital The owner of Swansea Bay Studios, Roy Thomas, signed a lease allowing the Welsh NHS to use the largest building on his site free of charge for a year to help tackle the virus. But Mr Thomas said the complex needed financial support to survive. He said: ""I see myself in next 12 months serving two masters. ""One is the health authority, to maintain whatever requirement they have 12 months in the future. and the other is to attempt to play my part in maintaining the filming industry for Neath Port Talbot, Swansea and west Wales."" Swansea Bay UHB's Chief Operating Officer, Chris White, said it was fortunate the beds at the two field hospitals had not been needed at the peak of the pandemic. But while cases have fallen, Mr White said it was important the field hospitals were ""ready in case we need them"". Wales' field hospitals doubled the capacity for the Welsh NHS during the pandemic Venue Cymru in Llandudno also faces financial challenges after giving over its building to create 350 extra beds for the Betsi Cadwaladr health board. The theatre and conference centre, which is owned by Conwy council, has a three-month contract to act as field hospital until 6 July. The deal, which is based on it having no financial impact on the local authority, will then be extended by agreement on a month-by-month basis. But Venue Cymru said it would need financial help to restart shows after the pandemic. Mark Wilkinson, from Betsi Cadwaladr health board, said the focus was now on how to ""resume services which had been put on hold to manage the initial wave of Covid-19 patients"". Bangor University agreed to a three-month minimum lease with the Welsh Government for the use of the Canolfan Brailsford sport centre at Bangor University, to be reviewed on a monthly basis after that. The Welsh Government review into field hospitals will look at how many extra beds the Welsh NHS might need if the transmission rate of coronavirus begins to rise towards a second peak. It will also examine whether the field hospitals can be used to help the resumption of medical services that were suspended while the NHS focussed on treating Covid-19 cases. The Dragon's Heart Hospital is the second biggest field hospital in the UK behind London's Nightingale hospital Cardiff and Vale The health board has said the Dragon's Heart Hospital site would be ""retained until the autumn and will be available to admit coronavirus patients should a surge in capacity be required"". The Welsh Rugby Union, who own the stadium, have said the contract for it to remain as a field hospital has been extended until early autumn. This video can not be played A sports centre in Bangor was turned into a field hospital - in just 16 days There are three field hospitals, Deeside Leisure Centre in Queensferry, Canolfan Brailsford sports hall at Bangor University and Venue Cymru in Llandudno. The three ""Rainbow hospitals"" are ""available and ready"" to accept patients but the health board said the focus is now to ""resume services that were put on hold to manage the initial wave of Covid-19 patients"". Parc y Scarlets in Llanelli is currently home to a makeshift hospital There are nine field hospitals here: Bluestone Wales resort in Pembrokeshire; the leisure centres in Cardigan, Carmarthen, Llanelli and Plas Crug (Aberystwyth); two at the Parc y Scarlets in Llanelli, one in the stadium and the other in the training 'barn'; the Selwyn Samuel Centre in Llanelli and Ysgol Penweddig in Aberystwyth. Hywel Dda health board said it was ""exploring many different options"" for the next 12 months including ""different uses of our facilities"" as part of national discussions. The WRU training facility at The Vale Resort, was turned into a field hospital to provide 290 extra beds Bridgend Industrial Estate is the only remaining field hospital in the region after it was announced the 290-bed hospital at the WRU's Centre of Excellence at Hensol was being decommissioned this week. The health board is also operating ""community step-down facilities"" Abergarw Manor in Bridgend and Marsh House in Merthyr Tydfil for non Covid-19 patients to move out of hospitals.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson and Emmanuel Macron viewed documents and artefacts relating to General Charles de Gaulle Boris Johnson has met French President Emmanuel Macron in Downing Street to mark the 80th anniversary of a famous wartime broadcast. In 1940, French Resistance leader Charles de Gaulle used the BBC to send a radio message to Nazi-occupied France, urging people not to give up the struggle against Hitler. Mr Johnson praised the ""courage and sacrifice"" of those who fought on. The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall welcomed Mr Macron to the UK. And the Red Arrows and their French counterparts, La Patrouille, performed a flypast above London to mark the occasion. Prince Charles to welcome Macron to London PM had to soothe concerns over virus strategy New momentum needed in trade talks, say UK and EU Churchill statue uncovered ahead of Macron visit During their meeting, Mr Johnson and Mr Macron discussed post-Brexit trade arrangements between the UK and EU, with No 10 saying the prime minister ""welcomed the agreement to intensify talks in July"". The air display flew directly over Westminster and the recently-uncovered Winston Churchill statue A spokesperson added that he had restated that the UK ""does not believe it makes sense for there to be prolonged negotiations into the autumn"". The ""transition period"" - during which the UK remains in the EU single market and customs union - is due to finish at the end of the year. The two leaders also talked about easing the 14-day coronavirus quarantine measures in place for visitors to - and UK citizens returning to - the UK. Mr Macron was exempt from the requirements, as a ""representative of a foreign country on business"". The Red Arrows and La Patrouille flew over Buckingham Palace It was earlier announced that four surviving French Resistance fighters are to be appointed honorary MBEs. Edgard Tupet-Thome, 100, Daniel Bouyjou-Cordier, 99, Hubert Germain, 99, and Pierre Simonet, 98, are already members of the Order of Liberation, an honour given by France to those who played an outstanding role in freeing the country from its four-year wartime occupation. Mr Macron's visit also comes after it was announced that Dame Vera Lynn, the singer dubbed the ""forces' sweetheart"" for her morale-boosting performances during World War Two,has died aged 103. Social distancing was maintained during the French president's visit to London The two leaders viewed artefacts and letters from General de Gaulle's time in London and from his partnership with the UK's wartime prime minister, Sir Winston Churchill. Mr Johnson presented Mr Macron with a framed montage of a telegram sent from General de Gaulle to Sir Winston on VE Day, in 1945, and Sir Winston's reply. He also gave him a model of Sir Winston's open-top Land Rover and a photograph of General de Gaulle in Paris, shortly after the city's liberation from German forces in 1944. By Gavin Stamp, BBC News It was 80 years ago that General Charles de Gaulle broadcast a historic message from London to his fellow countrymen imploring them not to give up the fight against Hitler. France was on its knees at the time, German troops having entered Paris four days earlier, and on the verge of agreeing an armistice confirming its formal military surrender. In the message, broadcast in French, De Gaulle said: ""Whatever happens, the flame of the French resistance must not be extinguished and will not be extinguished."" Transmitted on the BBC's French Service, the broadcast was not recorded and relatively few people in France heard it. But a similar broadcast four days later on the same network reached a wider audience and went a long way to establishing de Gaulle as his country's leader in-exile. The 18th June 1940 remains one of the most important dates in UK-French history and still has enormous resonance on both sides of the channel. After the fall of France, General de Gaulle made a speech from London 18 June 1940. Known as the ""Appel"", or appeal, it rallied the country in support of the Resistance. This video can not be played When she was 21, Olivia Jordan found herself driving French resistance leader Charles de Gaulle around London Mr Macron, speaking next to General de Gaulle's statue in Carlton Gardens, in central London, said: ""This is where de Gaulle was able to call on the French people to join the Resistance, the soldiers of the shadows. ""Because 80 years ago today, on June 18 1940, the United Kingdom gave Free France its first weapon, a BBC microphone."" Emmanuel Macron laid a wreath at the statue of Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother Mr Johnson said General de Gaulle had arrived in 1940 knowing that Britain and France's shared values of ""freedom, tolerance and democracy"" were under threat and pledging to defend them. ""The struggles we face today are different to those we confronted together 80 years ago. But I have no doubt that - working side by side - the UK and France will continue to rise to every new challenge and seize every opportunity that lies ahead,"" he said.

"Shopping centres like Friars Walk in Newport have been closed since March Non-essential retailers in Wales will be told they can reopen from Monday, the first minister is expected to announce. Mark Drakeford will set out further changes to the lockdown laws at a press conference on Friday. Businesses will be expected to ensure two-metre social distancing is observed. Other small changes may be announced, but the advice to stay local is likely to remain in place. Shops in England have been trading since the start of the week. But after that prompted queues outside retailers, Health Minister Vaughan Gething said he does not want to see large crowds outside reopened retailers. The Welsh Government is expected to keep its cautious approach, and says its priority continues to be ""keep Wales safe"". Earlier the Scottish Government announced that retailers there could reopen on29 June. This video can not be played Non-essential shops in England reopened on Monday At the daily Welsh Government press conference Mr Gething said he did not want to see a repeat ""of crowds bunched together outside shops in complete breach of what social-distancing guidance is supposed to deliver"". Earlier in the week Mr Drakeford said reopening retail was one of a ""package"" of measures being looked at. He said he was keen for the economy to reopen in Wales, but public health must come first ""as that is the best way for our economy"". Currently people in Wales are only allowed to travel locally - with five miles given as a guide. That is not expected to change on Friday. The rule has been criticised by Conservative politicians who say it unfairly harms people in rural areas. Reopening shops is a move that has been heavily trailed by ministers and they are keen to stress that caution remains their watchword. The approach from the Welsh Government has been to announce one big thing in each review and then monitor its effect on the reproduction rate of the virus. Recently though, they have started putting sectors ""on notice"" for reopening - shops next week, followed by schools the week after. Perhaps this time there will be something for the tourism sector to look forward to? Retailers have been given time to prepare to reopen Non-essential shops have been closed to the public in Wales since lockdown began in late March. Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Paul Davies claimed the Welsh Government had ""listened"" to its calls to begin to reopen the Welsh economy. ""But while we welcome this announcement, it frankly beggars belief as to why travel restrictions are not being lifted too,"" he said. ""Many retailers need custom from a wide area to survive and will go to the wall if they are forced to rely on local trade alone."" Plaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said the announcement did ""not come as a surprise"". ""Many people will be glad to see yet another element of easing restrictions,"" he said. ""However, we need to know not only which restrictions are being eased in the here and now but also which restrictions are expected to be lifted in the weeks and months ahead.""

"The Bank of England will pump an extra Â£100bn into the UK economy to help fight the ""unprecedented"" coronavirus-induced downturn. Bank policymakers voted 8-1 to increase the size of its bond-buying programme. However, they said there was growing evidence that the hit to the economy would be ""less severe"" than initially feared. The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) also kept interest rates at a record low of 0.1%. The move comes just days after Bank governor Andrew Bailey saidpolicymakers were ready to take actionafter the economy suffered its biggest monthly contraction on record. The UK economy shrank by 20.4% in April, while official jobs data showed the number of workers on UK payrollsfell by more than 600,000 between March and May. The Bank said more recent indicators suggested the economy was starting to bounce back. Minutes from the MPC's June meeting,externalsaid: ""Payments data are consistent with a recovery in consumer spending in May and June, and housing activity has started to pick up recently."" However, Mr Bailey warned that the outlook for the economy remained uncertain. He said: ""We don't want to get too carried away by this. Let's be clear, we're still living in very unusual times."" The minutes added: ""While recent demand and output data had not been quite as negative as expected, other indicators suggested greater risks around the potential for longer-lasting damage to the economy from the pandemic."" What is QE and how will it affect you? Job cuts warning as 600,000 roles go in lockdown Back in May, policymakers warned the economy washeading for its sharpest recession on record. Scenarios drawn up by the Bank suggested the economy could shrink by 25% in the three months to June. However, the MPC said more recent evidence suggested the contraction would be less severe. The extra monetary stimulus - known as quantitative easing (QE) - will raise the total size of the Bank's asset purchase programme to Â£745bn. Policymakers said the injection would help to support financial markets and underpin the recovery. However, Andy Haldane, the Bank's chief economist, voted against the increase. He said the recovery was happening ""sooner and materially faster"" than the Bank expected in May. Policymakers said the jobs market was likely to remain weak for some time, with a risk of ""higher and more persistent unemployment"". Millions of workers have already seen their pay packets shrink as a result oflower pay for furloughed employees. A survey by the Bank said other companies had postponed or cancelled pay rises this year. Mr Bailey said: ""Even with the relaxation of some Covid-related restrictions on economic activity, a degree of precautionary behaviour by households and businesses is likely to persist. The economy, and especially the labour market, will therefore take some time to recover towards its previous path."" Mr Bailey also addressed the recent fall in UK inflation in anopen letter to Chancellor Rishi Sunak,external. Inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI),fell to 0.5% in May, from 0.8% in April- well below the Bank of England's 2% target. Mr Bailey said weak inflation had been by driven by falling oil and energy prices, as well as a global drop in economic activity. The Bank expects inflation to return to target within two years. Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics expects the Bank to increase QE again later this year. ""Unemployment looks set to rise sharply in the second half of this year and to fall back slowly thereafter,"" he said. ""The resulting prolonged weakness in domestically generated inflation likely will necessitate the MPC doing more to stimulate the economy in the winter."" The Bank of England has increased its support for the economy, despite it assessing that the outlook is not quite as awful as its scenario last month. The economy is on course for a hit in the second quarter of about 20% compared with the final three months of 2019. That's still historic, and off the scale, but not quite as extreme as the 27% it predicted in May. The extra Â£100bn of purchases of government bonds also has the air of an insurance policy. Most of the MPC were concerned about a couple of factors, A less awful outlook does not mean the recovery will be quick. This is for two reasons stretching beyond economics. There is a fear that the ""prevalence of the virus"" in the UK will mean that Britons will continue to socially distance, voluntarily, holding back the recovery more than other nations (Germany would be an example). Related to that was the idea that more QE now could mitigate the economic impact of ""higher rates of Covid-19 infection going forward"" - a second wave. So the news is still bad, but less awful.

"Nearly 100 workers at food plants in Llangefni and Wrexham have tested positive for Covid-19 Non-essential shops in Wales are expected to be told tomorrow they can reopen from Monday Only one of the field hospitals set up in Wales to help ease demand during the coronavirus pandemic has treated any patients Firefighters help families after 200 properties in the south Wales valleys are flooded, some for the third time this year Matt Lloyd, Philip Marsh and Andy Roberts That's it for today's live page coverage of the flooding and coronavirus crisis in Wales. Here's a recap of the main developments today:  Click herefor continued coverage of coronavirus developments around the world. We'll be back tomorrow when First Minister Mark Drakeford will announce any changes to the lockdown regulations in Wales. Poor communications between the UK and Welsh governments are ""hampering"" efforts to tackle coronavirus, a senior Welsh Parliament committee has warned. The Finance Committee has been looking at the Â£2.4bn extra Welsh ministers are spending on dealing with the outbreak. The committee says London-Wales ""communication channels"" were""not as open as they could be""and co-ordination was being ""hampered"". UK ministers said the administrations had ""worked more closely than ever"" together. The committee'sreport,externalpraises the Welsh Government's ""swift action"" during the crisis, but says it is not clear what Welsh ministers are doing to prepare for life after lockdown is eased. First Minister Mark Drakeford said on Monday he had not spoken to the PM for over a fortnight Felicity EvansBBC Wales political editor Itâs expected that non-essential retailers will be told they can open from Monday, when the first minister reveals the latest changes to the coronavirus laws on Friday. Welsh retailers were told to prepare for a possible reopening three weeks ago, while shops in England have been trading since Monday. The Welsh Government will continue to emphasise caution and says its priority continues to be âkeep Wales safeâ. Businesses will be expected to ensure two-metre social distancing is observed in their premises, after Health Minister Vaughan Gething said he did not want to see large crowds gathering near shops. First Minister Mark Drakeford referred to a âpackageâ of measures in his last press briefing, and he may also announce some smaller easing of restrictions, although the controversial âstay localâ message is likely to remain in place. Reopening shops is a move thatâs been heavily trailed by ministers and theyâre keen to stress that caution remains their watchword. The approach from the Welsh Government has been to announce one big thing in each review and then monitor its effect on the reproduction rate of the virus. Recently though, theyâve started putting sectors âon noticeâ for reopening â shops next week, followed by schools the week after. Perhaps this time there will be something for the tourism sector to look forward to? Owain ClarkeBBC Wales Health Correspondent Some of the biggest outbreaks of Covid-19 worldwide have
been in meat processing factories and slaughterhouses. In Ireland, for example, a special National Outbreak Team has been put in place to deal with the large
number of clusters at meat plants. There are various theories about why meat plants are particularly

employs around 560 staff - 2 Sisters in Llangefni, Anglesey - will not only be a worry to the workers and their
families but also to the wider community. And
of course the number is very likely to rise with all staff now being tested and
their contacts traced. Children and young people have been invited to put their questions to Wales' education minister about the reopening of schools and colleges. Kirsty Williams will give her replies next Wednesday, with schools set to partially reopen from 29 June. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A coronavirus outbreak at a chicken processing plant on Anglesey has now affected 58 workers. Public Health Wales (PHW) said the number of confirmed cases at the2 Sisters factory in Llangefnihad risen from 51 to 58 with more than 200 people told to self-isolate for 14 days. All of the plant's 560-strong workforce are now to be tested, PHW said. Production at the plant has been suspended and the site closed for two weeks as the company said it wanted to show ""how seriously we take this issue"". Health Minister Vaughan Gething admitted the outbreak was a ""concern"". A factory in Wrexham which produces food ranges for supermarkets
across the UK has confirmed 38 staff have tested positive for Covid-19. Rowan Foods - owned by Oscar Meyer Quality
Foods - employs 1,500 people. It makes prepared foods for UK supermarket chains including Aldi, Asda and Sainsburyâs. The company said there was ""no clear evidence"" the virus had spread within the factory but was a ""reflection"" of an increase in the number of cases across the Wrexham area. It said: âThe site
has 38 staff absent due to testing positive for Covid-19, this is across our
direct and agency workforce which totals 1,500. ""We are very thankful that none
of our colleagues are seriously ill or hospitalised from this virus. âFollowing notification of a positive Covid case we have
worked with Public Health Wales and had already implemented a track-and-trace
process to highlight any close contacts. ""These colleagues are required to
isolate for a 14-day period of isolation. Any member of staff who has tested
positive for Covid-19 is asked to isolate for at least seven days. âThe safety of our colleagues remains our priority and
our focus is remaining Covid-19 secure as a site. âWe are aware through discussions with Public Health
Wales that the Wrexham area is seeing significantly high numbers of positive
cases. It is concerning but not surprising that we are seeing a number of our
staff affected by this local trend. ""Similarly, we are experiencing a high
number of staff required to isolate.  A large proportion of our teams are from
the same household/family and interact outside of work as well as being work
colleagues."" It follows news that more than 50 staff at the2 Sisters chicken processing plant in Llangefni, Anglesey, have tested positive for coronavirus. Rowan Foods management said there was ""no clear evidence"" the virus had spread within the factory The Pro14 rugby tournament will returnafter a five-month Covid-19 pandemic hiatus from 22 August with Welsh derbies. Teams from the same nation will play against each other home and away before the season is concluded by semi-finals and a final. Those finishing in the top two places in Conference A and B will contest the semi-finals. The final is scheduled to take place on Saturday, 12 September with the venue to be confirmed. Bethan LewisBBC Wales Family & Education Correspondent Schools and councils will have the final say on whether the summer term is extended for an extra week, the Welsh Government has said. Discussions are believed to be continuing between government officials, unions and councils. There are union concerns that extending the term to 27 July causes major problems relating to staff contracts. Education Minister Kirsty Williams wants all pupils to get a taste of school from 29 June before the summer break. But some unions have questioned the safety and practicality of the proposal and have warned there may not be sufficient numbers of cleaners and teaching assistants to enable schools to open for an extra week. Anglesey has the highest number of new coronavirus cases for the second day running. According to data from Public Health Wales, 11 of the 48 new cases were on the island. They were among the 25 new cases reported within the Betsi Cadwaladr health board region, which covers north Wales. There were 13 new cases in Cardiff and Vale, three in the Aneurin Bevan health board area, two in Cwm Taf, two in Hywel Dda (both in Ceredigion), none in Powys and none in the Swansea Bay health board region. The news comes as the2 Sisters chicken processing plant at Llangefni on Anglesey suspends productionand closes due to a coronavirus outbreak. Public Health Wales said there were 51 confirmed cases at the plant, with more than 200 people said to be self-isolating. The 2 Sisters chicken processing plant at Llangefni has closed after a coronavirus outbreak Handling the coronavirus pandemic in Wales has been ""responsible"", Health Minister Vaughan Gething has insisted. It comes after Sir David King, who chairs an independent panel of scientific experts, told the Senedd it had been âdisastrousâ and âirresponsibleâ to launch a test and trace scheme so late into the pandemic. Giving the Welsh Government's daily briefing, Mr Gething said: âI think we've been responsible throughout the course of the pandemic. âThat doesn't mean that with the benefit of hindsight, we wouldn't make different choices with the knowledge we have today. âAnd what we have done is we have built up our capacity. ""We weren't able to simply flick a switch to turn on the significant capacity that we now have, itâs taken time to get there.â Mr Gething added he was âvery proudâ of the work that the NHS and local government have done to create the test, trace and protect service. To date 1,471 people are known to have died with coronavirus in Wales. The number of new deaths being declared is less than at the peak of the pandemic. Public Health Wales publishes a daily total of the number of people who have died with Covid-19, with figures provided by health boards. Here is how the deaths have been tracked, allocated to the day they occurred rather than the day they were announced. Public Health Wales says 1,471 people are now known to have died with coronavirus in Wales. Today a further five deaths were confirmed by local authorities. The area with the highest number of total deaths is the Betsi Cadwaladr health board area in north Wales. Health Minister Vaughan Gething says the Welsh Government is committed to âproviding reassurancesâ to teaching staff and parents who may have concerns about the reopening of schools in Wales on 29 June. A survey by the trade union Unison shows over 70 percent of school support staff across Wales believe opening schools before September is too soon. Speaking during the Welsh Government coronavirus press conference today, Mr Gething said it was âreally importantâ to listen to concerns of those already in work and those who may be returning. âWe are certainly doing nothing to have unacceptable risk, weâre not asking staff to go and put themselves at risk,"" he said. âIn the conversations with education unions, I think there is an understanding that there is harm being caused to childrenâs future prospects by not being able to see more education activity restart.â Mr Gething added: âIâm committed to providing reassurance for the understandable concerns that some of our staff have, to make sure we have all our systems in place working with the education minister and local governments and indeed employers."" Five further people have died with coronavirus in Wales, taking the total to 1,471. A further 48 new cases were declared by health boards on Thursday, taking the total to 14,970. But Public Health Wales, who publish the figures, have repeatedly warned the figure could be much higher, as not everyone with symptoms is tested. ""Localised action"" may be needed to tackle Covid-19 hotspots, said the health minster Vaughan Gething. He was being quizzed following the outbreak at an Anglesey chicken processing plant, where 51 workers have contracted coronavirus. The 2 Sisters site at Llangenfi has been closed in a bid to control the virus spread. He said the Welsh Government had been clear that it did not want to take a ""regional approach to easing out of lockdown"". ""We've not ruled out the prospect or the possibility that there could be very localised measures put in place that go beyond individual households being asked to isolate,"" the minister said at the daily briefing. ""But as and when those choices need to be made, we will of course need to communicate those with the public."" Vaughan Gething The Secretary of State for Walesâ intervention on behalf of tourism businesses was ""clumsy and ill-judged"", Mr Gething has told the briefing. ""Weâre all learning and Iâm sure the secretary of state for Wales recognises that he has learning to take from the coronavirus pandemic too,â he said. Simon Hart MP, the Secretary of State for Wales, wrote to members of the Senedd and council leaders urging them to put pressure on Mark Drakeford to re-open the tourism industry in Wales. At todayâs coronavirus briefing, Mr Gething said Mr Hart had âthe luxury of not being a decision makerâ and it would be âmuch better for all of us if the Secretary of State engaged in a more constructive discussion with usâ. âWe are making very difficult decisions about balancing the risks in public health with the harms lockdown cause,"" he said. âI think it was a clumsy and ill-judged intervention for the secretary of state to make,â he added. Tourism intervention 'clumsy and ill-judged', said health minister Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething says he does not want to see ""crowds bunched together outside shops"" if non-essential retailers are allowed to open next week. First Minister Mark Drakeford, is due to announce the outcome of the latest lockdown review in Wales on Friday. Answering questions on Thursday, Mr Gething said a Covid-19 outbreak at a chicken processing plant in Llangefni, Anglesey, showed the importance of maintaining social distancing. Mr Gething told the Welsh Government's daily coronavirus news conference he did not want to see shop workers or shoppers ""put at risk"". ""People really do need to take a step back and realise the seriousness of the position we're in, and to recognise that the release from lockdown comes with responsibilities for all of us in the way that we choose to behave,"" he said. Shoppers queued outside a Nike store in London after lockdown was eased in England The outbreak of Covid-19 at at a chicken factory on Anglesey âreiterates the importance of social distancing and hand hygieneâ, Wales' health minister says. Public Health Wales has announced it has identified51 confirmed cases of the virus at the 2 Sisters plant in Llangefni. Speaking at the Welsh Governmentâs daily press briefing, Vaughan Gething also said he was âconcernedâ there may be more confirmed cases to come. âObviously this reiterates a number of points: it reiterates the fact that even with a low prevalence of coronavirus it hasn't gone, it reiterates the importance of social distancing and appropriate hygiene measures, it also reiterates the importance of our test trace protect system,"" he said. ""People really do need to follow the advice that they're given on getting a test, and on self isolating. âGiven that this is a closed setting in which these people would have been working, I'm obviously concerned that we may well see more confirmed cases of coronavirus,â he added. All residential care homes in Wales have been offered coronavirus testing, the health minister says. By the start of this week, more than 22,800 care home residents and 28,780 staff had been tested, Vaughan Gething told the daily coronavirus briefing. ""Of these,1,212 residents and 1,206 care workers have tested positive for coronavirus."" There are more than 1,200 residential care homes in Wales. However, Mr Gething added: ""There are about 30 care homes across Wales, that have not yet agreed and completed how testing will take place. ""These are care homes where there has not been an outbreak of coronavirus. ""Understandably they have been reluctant to allow testing to take place because they are worried about the risk of coronavirus entering their homes, however small that risk may be. ""Health boards, Care Forum Wales and Care Inspectorate Wales are working with these homes to understand their reasons for not accepting the offer of testing and to encourage take up."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"2 Sisters produces a third of all poultry products consumed in the UK from a number of sites Nearly 100 workers at two factories which supply food to hospitals, shops and restaurants have tested positive for coronavirus. Public Health Wales confirmed 58 cases at the 2 Sisters chicken factory in Llangefni on Anglesey, with all staff now being told to self-isolate. In Wrexham, 38 staff have tested positive at Rowan Foods, which makes food for supermarkets across the UK. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said the Anglesey outbreak was a ""concern"". Wales TUC, who campaign for workers' rights, said it was ""alarmed to see a pattern of workplace outbreaks in food manufacturing"", but the companies said they had put staff safety first during the pandemic. Other countries have also recorded outbreaks in meat processing plants, including inFrance and the US, where workers in at least two food factories have died amid outbreaks. The untold story of America's biggest outbreak Five ways coronavirus is disrupting the food industry Concerns over Covid-19 cases in NI meat plants 2 Sisters has suspended production and closed the Anglesey chicken factory, which supplies local authorities, hospitals, restaurants and small businesses, following the outbreak. The company supplies food to KFC and supermarkets including Marks & Spencer, Aldi, Asda, Co-op, Morrisons, Sainsbury's, Tesco and Waitrose. Public Health Wales (PHW) said staff and contractors working at the processing plant, which has 560 workers, had been asked to self-isolate for 14 days. It said staff at the factory would be tested, with all workers being contacted by the company to arrange the tests. A testing site has been set up Llangefni, while an existing facility in Bangor is also being used.Â  A further site is also being set up in Holyhead. Rowan Foods in Wrexham has said there is no clear evidence to suggest that there is a spread of the virus within the site Meanwhile Rowan Foods, which employs 1,500 people, said 38 staff were ""absent due to testing positive for Covid-19"", but said there was ""no clear evidence to suggest that there is a spread of the virus within the site"". The company, owned by Oscar Meyer Quality Foods, makes ready meals for companies across the UK, including Aldi, Asda, and Sainsbury's. In a statement, it said none of the staff were ""seriously ill or had been hospitalised"" and contact tracing was taking place. 2 Sisters said ""the health, safety and well-being of our colleagues is ultimately the thing that matters most at our business"". ""In light of the current Covid-19 cases at our Llangefni site, we have decided to take the necessary action to clearly demonstrate how seriously we take this issue by doing the right thing,"" a statement said. ""Doing the right thing means from today [18 June] we will temporarily suspend production at our Llangefni site with immediate effect for a period of 14 days. ""We will not tolerate any unnecessary risks - however small - for our existing loyal workforce at the facility."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Oscar Meyer Quality Foods said its priority had been the safety of staff at the Wrexham plant and it had made ""significant operational changes at the site"" to maintain social distancing, including putting in screens and visors. ""Whilst we are seeing a number of cases on site, Public Health Wales support our view that there is no clear evidence to suggest that there is a spread of the virus within the site, we are seeing a reflection on site of the increases in cases within the locality,"" it said. ""We will continue to do all we can to remain vigilant and to keep our colleagues and families safe."" 2 Sisters Food Group is one of the largest food producers in the UK, and produces about a third of all the poultry products eaten each day in the UK. According to PHW figures, there were 11 confirmed new Covid-19 cases in Anglesey on Wednesday and 11 more on Thursday - the most in any Welsh county on both days. The health minister said he was ""concerned"" the outbreak would lead to more cases. ""Given that this is a closed setting in which these people would have been working, I'm obviously concerned that we may well see more confirmed cases of coronavirus,"" Mr Gething told the Welsh government's daily briefing. Wales' health minister says the outbreak ""reiterates the importance of social distancing and appropriate hygiene measures"" He added the outbreak showed ""that even with a low prevalence of coronavirus, it hasn't gone."" ""It also reiterates the importance of our test, trace, protect system - and that people really do need to follow the advice that they're given on getting a test, and on self isolating."" PHW said it was ""working in partnership"" with 2 Sisters, Anglesey council, Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, the Health and Safety Executive and the Food Standards Agency to ""manage the incident"". ""We are working in close collaboration with the employer and Anglesey council, and our priority is to bring this outbreak to a swift conclusion,"" said Christopher Johnson. The Food Standards Agency said there was no reason food would not be safe The Food Standards Agency said it was ""very unlikely you can catch coronavirus from food"" as the virus is a respiratory illness. The agency's Caroline Kitson said the virus was ""not known to be transmitted by exposure to food or food packaging"". More than 1,000 workers at the GÃ¼tersloh plant, in Germany, have been tested after an outbreak at the meat processing plant Paddy McNaught, the regional organiser for the union Unite, said the number of cases of coronavirus at the Anglesey factory had risen ""significantly"" in the past few days. ""In fairness, the company, they have tried to work with us to provide a safe working environment, where social distancing - as best as it can - takes place,"" he said. But he said production line work at the plant meant adhering to the distancing rule had been ""virtually impossible"" and there had been the ""usual"" concerns from staff about ""social distancing and face masks"". He added that the union would be working with the company to make sure the factory had a professional deep clean before workers were allowed back at the site. In Wales,employers are required by lawto do everything they can to make sure workers can socially distance while in the workplace, or face a fine of up to Â£120. Wales TUC general secretary Shavanah Taj said she was ""alarmed to see a pattern of workplace outbreaks in food manufacturing"". ""We've had long-held concerns about health and safety in this industry during the crisis and the risks posed to these key workers, who are employed in an industry with some of the lowest rates of average pay,"" she said. Some of the biggest outbreaks of Covid-19 worldwide have been in meat processing factories and slaughterhouses. In Ireland for example, a special national outbreak team has been put in place to deal with the large number of clusters at meat plants. On Wednesday, thousands of people in Germanywere told to quarantine after 650 workers tested positive for the virus at a meat processing plant. There are various theories about why meat plants are particularly susceptible. But a combination staff working in close proximity, doing very physical work, indoors in a cold environment where the virus is known to thrive are likely to be contributory factors. What is certain is that 58 confirmed cases in a factory that employs around 560 staff will not only be a worry to the workers and their families but also to the wider community. And of course the number is very likely to rise with all staff now being tested and their contacts traced.

"An image passed to the BBC by an Indian military official shows crude weapons purportedly used in the fight An image has emerged showing a crude weapon purportedly used by Chinese forces in the fatal brawl along China's disputed border with India on Monday. The fight in the Galwan Valley left at least 20 Indian soldiers dead and raised tensions between the two powers. China did not acknowledge any casualties among its forces. Both sides accused the other of an incursion. The border between the two nations in the region is poorly demarcated and can shift with topographical changes. The image that emerged on Thursday showed crude weapons that appeared to be made from iron rods studded with nails. It was passed to the BBC by a senior Indian military official on the India-China border, who said the weapons had been used by the Chinese. Defence analyst Ajai Shukla, who first tweeted the image, described the use of such weapons as ""barbarism"". The absence of firearms in the clash dates back to a 1996 agreement between the two sides that guns and explosives be prohibited along the disputed stretch of the border, to deter escalation. The image was widely shared on Twitter in India, prompting outrage from many social media users. Neither Chinese or Indian officials commented on it. Media reports said troops clashed on ridges at a height of nearly 4,300m (14,000 ft) in steep terrain, with some soldiers falling into the fast-flowing Galwan river in sub-zero temperatures. The two sides have brawled along the disputed border in recent weeks, but Monday's clash was the first to lead to fatalities in at least 45 years. Unconfirmed reports in Indian media said at least 40 Chinese soldiers died, but China is yet to issue any information about casualties. Indian officials said all of their soldiers involved in the clash have been accounted for, following reports some were missing. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said India had crossed the border twice, ""provoking and attacking Chinese personnel, resulting in serious physical confrontation between border forces on the two sides"", the AFP news agency reported. China on Wednesday claimed ""sovereignty over the Galwan Valley region"" - a claim rebutted by India as ""exaggerated and untenable"". Indian army trucks move along a highway leading to Ladakh on Wednesday Members of the public in both nations have since staged protests over the clashes in the disputed Himalayan border area, while officials have spoken cautiously and moved towards a diplomatic resolution. Indian foreign ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said the foreign ministers of both countries had a phone conversation on Wednesday on the developments and ""agreed that the overall situation should be handled in a responsible manner"". ""Making exaggerated and untenable claims is contrary to this understanding,"" Mr Srivastava was quoted as saying by Press Trust of India news agency. An Indian government statement after Subrahmanyam Jaishankar's conversation with China's Wang Yi said Chinese forces tried to erect a structure on the Indian side of the de facto border, the Line of Actual Control (LAC). The statement accused the Chinese of a ""premeditated and planned action that was directly responsible for the resulting violence and casualties"" and urged China to ""take corrective steps"". Meanwhile, a Chinese statement quoted Mr Wang as saying: ""China again expresses strong protest to India and demands the Indian side launches a thorough investigation... and stop all provocative actions to ensure the same things do not happen again."" The Galwan river valley in Ladakh, with its harsh climate and high-altitude terrain, is close to Aksai Chin, a disputed area claimed by India but controlled by China. This is not the first time the two nuclear-armed neighbours have fought without conventional firearms on the border. India and China have a history of face-offs and overlapping territorial claims along the more than 3,440km (2,100 mile), poorly drawn LAC separating the two sides. The last firing on the border happened in 1975 when four Indian soldiers were killed in a remote pass in the north-eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh. The clash was variously described by former diplomats as an ambush and an accident. But no bullets have been fired since. At the root of this is a 1996 bilateral agreement that says ""neither side shall open fire... conduct blast operations or hunt with guns or explosives within two kilometres of the Line of Actual Control"". But there have been other tense confrontations along the border in recent weeks. In May Indian and Chinese soldiers exchanged physical blows on the border at Pangong Lake, also in Ladakh, and in the north-eastern Indian state of Sikkim hundreds of miles to the east. India has accused China of sending thousands of troops into Ladakh's Galwan Valley and says China occupies 38,000 sq km (14,700 sq miles) of its territory. Several rounds of talks in the last three decades have failed to resolve the boundary disputes.

"This video can not be played Coronavirus: Extended households can now stay over Most shops in Scotland are to reopen from 29 June as part of a further easing of the country's lockdown rules. The changes will also see anyone who lives on their own - or only with children - to form an ""extended group"" with one other household from tomorrow. People will also be able meet outdoors with two other households at the same time rather than just one. Face coverings are to be made compulsory foreveryone using public transportfrom Monday. And people who have previously been told to shield during the lockdown because they are at high risk are now able to meet other people outside for the first time. No decision has yet been made on when pubs, restaurants or beer gardens will be able to reopen. Coronavirus in Scotland - latest developments Masks to be compulsory on public transport Shielding: What changes have been made? Shops expected to reopen in Wales from Monday The announcement by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon means the country has now moved to the second phase of its four-phase ""route map"" aimed at ending the lockdown while continuing to suppress the virus. But Scottish Conservative leader Jackson Carlaw called for ""much more ambition"", saying everything Ms Sturgeon had announced had already happened in England two weeks ago. And he claimed Ms Sturgeon ""simply doesn't understand or comprehend the depth of the economic crisis we're about to go through"". The Scottish government has generally been taking a more cautious approach to opening up the economy again than the UK government has in England, where shops were able to reopen earlier this month. Ms Sturgeon is concerned that moving too quickly will risk a resurgence of the virus that has already been linked to the deaths of more than 4,000 people in Scotland. She said she understood the desire of all businesses to reopen quickly, but it was vital that they do so ""safely and in a way that is consistent with continued suppression of the virus"". Non-essential shops in Scotland have been closed since the lockdown was imposed on 23 March Her announcement means that shops of all sizes will be able to open from 29 June long as they have outdoor entrances and exits - so indoor shopping centres will remain closed except for essential retailers such as supermarkets and pharmacists. Ms Sturgeon said retailers should now start to put plans in place to ensure that customers and staff are able to keep the required 2m apart. She added: ""Of course, all of us as customers have a role to play. When shops do re-open, I ask everyone to exercise patience, stick to the measures that are in place for your safety, and at all times please respect retail staff who will be asking you to shop in a different way."" David Lonsdale, chief executive Scottish Retail Consortium, said the announcement was a ""significant milestone"" and provided ""much needed clarity on the path ahead"". From today (Thursday), people in the shielding group can meet other people outside and take part in outdoor leisure activities such as golf From tomorrow (Friday), people living alone or with only children can meet one other household indoors Also from tomorrow, people can meet two other households outside in groups of no more than eight From Monday 22 June, facemasks will be compulsory on all public transport including taxis Also from Monday, dentists will be able to open, professional sport can resume behind closed doors and places of worship can reopen for individual prayer From 29 June, most shops and many other indoor businesses can reopen, but not shopping centres, pubs or restaurants Read more about what is changing in phase two Other changes outlined by the first minister include dentists being allowed to reopen for urgent care from Monday, while professional sport will be allowed to resume behind closed doors and places of worship will reopen for individual prayer. Many indoor workplaces such as factories, laboratories and warehouses will also start to reopen from 29 June, subject to strict physical distancing and hygiene rules. And outdoor outdoor markets, playgrounds and sports facilities will reopen on the same day, along with some visitor attractions such as zoos - although visitors should still not travel more than five miles from their homes and tickets should be bought in advance. The wider tourism industry has previously been told to prepare for the possibility of reopening on 15 July. Figures released this week showed that Scotland's economy shrank by 18.9% in April, slightly lower than the 20.4% recorded for the UK as a whole, while its unemployment rate is now the highest of any country in the UK at 4.6%. No decision has yet been made on when pubs and restaurants will be able to reopen People in Scotland have previously only been able to meet outdoors with residents of one other household, and only in groups of up to eight. The changes announced by Ms Sturgeon will see the restrictions relaxed slightly, with people now able to meet two other households at the same time - but again, only in groups of no more than eight. For the first time, these outdoor meetings can include people who in the shielding group who have previously been advised not to go outside. People will also be able to go inside to use the toilet when meeting in someone else's garden, the first minister added. The Scottish government is still considering whether to reduce the current 2m distance rule in some settings And anyone who lives on their own - or only with children under 18 - will be able to form an ""extended household group"" with one other household. These extended groups will be able to meet indoors, without physical distancing, and will also be able to stay overnight - but cannot include people who are part of the shielding group. Ms Sturgeon said: ""It will, from tomorrow, allow a grandparent who lives on their own to form a group with another household in their family. ""It will allow a single parent and their children to join with another household for support. And it will allow a non cohabiting couple, where at least one of them lives alone, to be reunited indoors without physical distancing. ""It will, I hope, help to ease some of the isolation which is one of the cruellest consequences of tackling this virus."" Phase 1 (already in place):Virus not yet contained but cases are falling. From 28 May you should be able to meet another household outside in small numbers. Sunbathing is allowed, along with some outdoor activities like golf and fishing. Garden centres and drive-through takeaways can reopen, some outdoor work can resume, and childminding services can begin. Phase 2 (now being implemented):Virus controlled. You can meet wider group of people outdoors, and some people can form extended household groups. Construction, factories, warehouses and laboratories can resume work, and most shops can reopen - but not indoor shopping centres. Playgrounds and sports courts can reopen, and professional sport can begin again. Phase 3:Virus suppressed.  You can meet people from more than one household indoors. Non-essential offices would reopen, along with gyms, museums, libraries, cinemas, larger shops, pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and dentists. Live events could take place with restricted numbers and physical distancing restrictions. Schools should reopen from 11 August. Phase 4:Virus no longer a significant threat. University and college campuses can reopen in full, mass gatherings are allowed. All workplaces open and public transport is back at full capacity. The Scottish government, like its UK counterpart, has been facing calls to reduce the current 2m social distancing rule to make it easier for the hospitality and tourism industries to reopen. But the first minister said the current guidance will not change ""without rigorous consideration and appropriate assurance"". She added: I have asked our advisers to consider whether there are particular settings and circumstances in which, with additional mitigations, it might be possible in future to recommend a distance of 1 or 1.5 metres. ""I hope to also have this advice within two weeks and will report on it then."" RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job? SCHOOLS:When will children be returning?

Rhondda Cynon Taf council said there had been significant flooding to almost 200 properties in the borough after storms swept across Wales on Wednesday. Pentreflooded twice during February's stormswith the cost of the damage estimated at up to Â£5m. Plaid Member of the Senedd (MS) for the Rhondda, Leanne Wood, said people were angry and called for an inquiry.

"One of two gravestones at the site has been smashed in two The headstone of an African man who was enslaved in the 18th Century has been smashed in two. The Grade II* listed grave of Scipio Africanus is in St Mary's Churchyard in Bristol. A local councillor said he believed it was a ""retaliation attack"" for the recenttoppling of the statue of slave trader Edward Colstonin the city. Avon and Somerset Police said it was investigating after receiving a report of criminal damage. The force said it believed the damage occurred between 12:00 BST on Tuesday and 08:00 on Wednesday. Scipio Africanus was an African servant of the 7th Earl of Suffolk. An inscription on the brightly painted gravestone - which is one of two at the site in Henbury - says he died in the city in 1720 aged 18. A message was scrawled on the ground nearby A message left in chalk on the flagstones near the grave said: ""Now look at what you made me do. ""Put Colston's statue back or things will really heat up."" Conservative councillor Mark Weston, who represents Henbury on Bristol City Council, said he was ""deeply saddened by what is happening"". ""We have seen war memorials defaced and statues vandalised and I have to wonder where this will end,"" he said. Bristol's elected mayor Marvin Rees appealed for people not to go down the route of ""tit-for-tat"" attacks. Speaking during a Facebook Live Q&A, he said the ""iconic piece of Bristol's history"" had been ""smashed in two"". ""The opportunity is to showcase to the country and the world we are a city that has the ability to live with difference,"" he said. The statue of Edward Colston was pushed into the harbour after being toppled by protesters Historians believe Scipio Africanus may have been born into the household of 7th Earl of Suffolk, Charles Howard, and was the son of an enslaved West African woman, according to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service. He was named by his ""owners"" after the Roman general Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus. Graffiti on Colston statue will be preserved How do you replace a fallen statue? Churchill statue uncovered ahead of Macron visit The Colston statue was torn down and dumped in Bristol's harbour during anti-racism protests earlier this month. It has since been pulled from the water and is expected to be given a new home in a city museum. There have been several other protests calling for statues and monuments celebrating controversial figures in the UK to be taken down or amended. This includes governors at Oxford's Oriel College voting on Wednesdayto remove a statue of colonialist Cecil Rhodes,and a statue ofslave trader Robert Milligan being removedfrom outside the Museum of London Docklands last week.

"Pub chain Greene King and insurance market Lloyd's of London have apologised for their historical links to the slave trade. One of Greene King's founders owned a number of plantations in the Caribbean. Meanwhile, maritime insurance - which was focused on Lloyd's - thrived on the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Both organisations have apologised and Lloyd's has said it will donate to charities representing black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) groups. Greene King said it would make a ""substantial investment to benefit the BAME community"", after consulting with its staff on how this money can best be used. Lloyd's and Greene King's moves werefirst reported by the Telegraph in the UK.,external Lloyd's, which was founded in 1688, insured slave ships. It is often lauded as the world's leading insurance market, focusing on specialist areas, such as marine, energy and political risk. In a statement, Lloyd's said: ""There are some aspects of our history that we are not proud of. ""In particular, we are sorry for the role played by the Lloyd's market in the 18th and 19th-Century slave trade."" ""This was an appalling and shameful period of English history, as well as our own, and we condemn the indefensible wrongdoing that occurred during this period."" This video can not be played What do we do with the UK's symbols of slavery? Lloyd's said it would provide financial support to charities and organisations promoting opportunity and inclusion for BAME groups. It has also launched a number of new initiatives aimed at developing black and minority ethnic talent within the organisation. ""In recent years, Lloyd's has driven ahead with a series of positive programmes designed to improve culture across the market. We have made progress, but not enough."" Pressure has been growing on companies around the world to address links to slavery and tackle racial inequality following the death of George Floyd in the US last month while in police custody. ""Racism - the ideology used to justify slavery - is a legacy that still shapes the life chances for people of African and Caribbean heritage in the UK,"" said Dr Katie Donington, a senior lecturer in history at the London South Bank University. ""It is an important step that firms with historical links to trans-Atlantic slavery are now beginning the process of acknowledging the past."" Oxford college wants to remove Rhodes statue Britain's Forgotten Slave Owners - The Secret Slave Owners British History in depth- Slavery and the Building of Britain Quaker Oats acknowledges 'racial stereotype' While she welcomed the commitment by Lloyd's, she added: ""The offer of investment in BAME charities and organisations needs further scrutiny - how much will be invested and who will receive the money? ""This is a history which is specific to the black community and directing forms of reparative justice towards descendent groups must be the priority."" While companies may have been reluctant to speak out in the past, the international outcry and huge demonstrations following Mr Floyd's death has made speaking up a ""business imperative"". Dwayna Haley, a senior vice president at Porter Novelli, a communications firm that has advised companies such as McDonald's and Pepsi,previously told the BBC: ""What is driving this is the understanding that if we don't cater to the people that we serve, we could lose market share,"" she says. ""It is a strategic business move."" Brewer and pub chain Greene King was originally founded in 1799 by Benjamin Greene, who owned highly-profitable plantations. His son Edward took over control of the brewery in 1836 and it was renamed Greene King in 1887 after merging with a local brewery. When slavery was abolished in 1833, the UK government raised huge amounts for compensation. However, that money was not paid to those who had been enslaved, but was given instead to slave-owners for their ""loss of human property"". Benjamin Greene was one of thousands who received payment. Details of the sums are listed in adatabase held by the University College London (UCL).,external Nick Mackenzie, Greene King's chief executive officer, said: ""It is inexcusable that one of our founders profited from slavery and argued against its abolition in the 1800s. While that is a part of our history, we are now focused on the present and the future."" To address the issue, the pub chain will ""make a substantial investment to benefit the BAME community and support our race diversity in the business"". Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays and HSBC were among a number of banks found by the Telegraph to be linked to the slave trade. Royal Bank of Scotland:In a 2009 report,external, the bank admitted that individuals who were partners or directors of RBSG (Royal Bank of Scotland Group) predecessors ""may have owned slaves themselves or been otherwise directly connected to slave enterprises in the British West Indies"". Founded in Edinburgh in 1727, it also found evidence that suggested other partners of its predecessors may have been part-owners of ""ships involved in slave trading voyages during the 18th and early 19th Centuries"". The UK government owns a 62% stake in the Royal Bank of Scotland today ""As an organisation with a history stretching back more than 300 years, these important and painful issues have a place in our history. We recognise our responsibility to engage with that"", RBS said in a statement. The bank, currently majority-owned by the UK government, added that it had ""looked into its past links with slavery very extensively and thoroughly"", and would look at ""what more we can do as a bank"", including making financial contributions to BAME groups. Lloyds Banking Group: John White Cater was the president of London and Brazilian Bank and received compensation for five claims for estates in Jamaica. Eight former companies associated with the group have links to claimants or beneficiaries in UCL's database. A Lloyds Banking Group spokesperson said: ""A lot has changed during the 300-year history of our brands and while we have much within our heritage to be proud of, we can't be proud of it all. Like any institution that is so interwoven with our country's history, we must acknowledge and learn from our past."" They added that the firm would ""deliver better results for our colleagues and customers. This is our aim. We can do more, we can do better and we will do it together."" Barclays: One manager, one founder subscriber and three directors of the Colonial Bank are listed as claimants or beneficiaries by UCL. It was merged with Barclays in 1917. The claims include nine by director John Bloxam Elin relating to estates in Jamaica. ""The history of Barclays, like other institutions, is being examined following recent events. We can't change what's gone before us, only how we go forward,"" a Barclays spokesperson said. ""We are committed as a bank to do more to further foster our culture of inclusiveness, equality and diversity, for our colleagues, and the customers and clients we serve."" HSBC: According to UCL's database, George Pollard was a trustee over a claim related to the Calhoun estate in Nevis. Mr Pollard was manager of the London Joint Stock Bank, which was eventually merged into HSBC, now the UK's largest bank. HSBC did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment.

"Protesters have been calling for an Oxford college's statue of Cecil Rhodes to be removed for several years Campaigners have said protests will continue while the controversial statue of colonialist Cecil Rhodes remains at Oxford's Oriel College, after governors voted on Wednesday to remove it. The college says there will need to be consultations over planning regulations before it can be taken down. Sizwe Mpofu-Walsh, a founder of the Rhodes Must Fall campaign, said they felt ""greatly vindicated"" by the vote. But he said it was crucial the college followed through on its plan. Rhodes played a key role in the expansion of the British Empire in Southern Africa, including South Africa and Zimbabwe, previously known as Rhodesia. Critics accuse the campaign of trying to ""rewrite history"", while campaigners for the statue's removal say it is a symbol of imperialism and racism. How many statues of black people does the UK have? Don't hide history, says Oxford vice-chancellor How do you replace a fallen statue? Why is Cecil Rhodes such a controversial character? Responding to Wednesday's vote, Rhodes Must Fall said that until the statue ""ceases to adorn the facade of Oriel College on Oxford's High Street"" there would still be protests over ""imperial and colonial iconography"" in university buildings. ""We have been down this route before, where Oriel College has committed to taking a certain action, but has not followed through,"" a statement read, referring to a commitment to engage in a ""six-month-long democratic listening exercise"" in 2015. ""Therefore, while we remain hopeful, our optimism is cautious. While the governing body of Oriel College have 'expressed their wish' to take down the statue, we continue to demand their commitment."" Protesters in Oxford said the statue was no longer acceptable Oriel College's governors said the decision had been reached ""after a thoughtful period of debate and reflection"" - and in ""full awareness of the impact these decisions are likely to have in Britain and around the world"". The college is to launch an ""independent commission of inquiry"" into the legacy of Cecil Rhodes, which also includes scholarships at the university. The commission, to be headed by Carole Souter, master of St Cross College and former National Lottery Heritage Fund chief, will also consider wider issues, such as support for black and ethnic minority students and a commitment to ""diversity"". It will consult with groups including students, local people, councillors and the Rhodes Must Fall campaigners. Cecil Rhodes was an imperialist, businessman and politician. Born in Hertfordshire in 1853, he first went to Africa aged 17 where he gradually became the dominant force in the diamond mining trade. He was a strong advocate for colonial power in Africa and played a dominant role in southern Africa in the late 19th Century, driving the annexation of vast swathes of land. He believed he was part of ""the first race in the world"", writing to a friend that ""the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race"". Some see him as one of the people who helped prepare the way for South Africa's apartheid by working to alter laws on voting and land ownership. Rhodes, who studied at Oriel College, left money to the college on his death in 1902. The Rhodes scholarships, created via his will, allow 83 students to come to Oxford each year. He said in life that he wanted to cheat the constraints of mortality by leaving a legacy. Read more about himhere. Former Oxford student and campaigner Mr Mpofu-Walsh said those who pushed for the removal of the Rhodes statue ""feel greatly vindicated that their position has been given a much fairer hearing this time around"". But he said it was ""crucially important, even at this moment of celebration"" to make sure Oriel College removed the statue. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said the objective of the college's commission was ""quite vague"" but he hoped it would focus on how the college can become more representative. When asked aboutthe Rhodes scholarships, Mr Mpofu-Walsh said: ""We need to be very careful here about suggesting that Rhodes could atone for his legacy through a handful of scholarships for people from Africa. The legacy of Rhodes extends wide and deep. ""Any number of scholarships cannot account for the full scale of the horror that many of those people have felt."" This video can not be played What do we do with the UK's symbols of slavery? The fate of the statue has divided opinion. Susan Brown, leader of Oxford City Council, backed the decision to take down the statue - and said the college's inquiry would be a chance to decide where the statue will ""best be curated in future"". Labour MP Bell Ribeiro-Addycalled it the ""right decision"" on Twitter,external, adding that it was ""time to take figures like Rhodes down off their pedestals"". Alan Rusbridger, principal of Lady Margaret Hall in Oxford, also welcomed the decision. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Earlier on Wednesday, the universities minister had spoken against calls to remove the statue. Michelle Donelan said: ""Racism is abhorrent and shouldn't be tolerated anywhere in our society, and that includes universities."" But she said it would be ""short sighted"" to try to ""rewrite our history"" - and rejected attempts to ""censor or edit"" the past. Last week the vice-chancellor of Oxford University, Louise Richardson, gave little support for removing the statue - and warned against ""hiding"" the past. ""My own view on this is that hiding our history is not the route to enlightenment,"" Prof Richardson told BBC News. ""We need to understand this history and understand the context in which it was made and why it was that people believed then as they did,"" she said. ""This university has been around for 900 years. For 800 of those years the people who ran the university didn't think women were worthy of an education. Should we denounce those people? ""Personally, no - I think they were wrong, but they have to be judged by the context of their time,"" said Prof Richardson.

"Dame Vera Lynn, who has died at the age of 103, was Britain's wartime Forces' Sweetheart, and remained one of the country's most potent symbols of resilience and hope. With songs such as We'll Meet Again and The White Cliffs of Dover, she inspired both troops abroad and civilians at home during World War Two. As Britain's cities came under attack, her wistful songs, with their messages of yearning and optimism, were heard in millions of British homes. And 75 years later, the country turned to her once again as it faced another stern test. She was born Vera Margaret Welch on 20 March 1917 in the London suburb of East Ham, the daughter of a plumber. She discovered her talent for singing at an early age and was performing in local clubs when she was seven. By the time she was 11, she had abandoned school for a full-time career as a dancer and singer in a touring music hall revue. She had also adopted a new stage name, Vera Lynn, borrowing her grandmother's maiden name. She regularly broadcast with Britain's biggest bands in the 1930s She was a soloist by the age of 16, fronting a number of bands. Lynn was self-effacing, unlike many of the singing stars of the day, and her gentle persona quickly endeared her to audiences. Her broadcasting debut came in 1935, singing with the Joe Loss Orchestra, which led to regular radio appearances and widened her circle of fans. But in 1939, war intervened. As families gathered around the wireless to listen to Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's announcement that Britain was at war with Germany, Lynn remembered thinking: ""Oh well, bang goes my career."" But when she volunteered for war work, she was told the best thing she could do was to keep on being an entertainer. This was reinforced when, in a 1939 poll by the Daily Express, she was voted by servicemen as their favourite entertainer, and gained her Forces' Sweetheart nickname. In the same year, she first sang We'll Meet Again, the song that more than any other came to be associated with World War Two. She thought it was vital to bring a touch of home to the troops Its underlying message of hope - that scattered families would eventually be reunited after the conflict - struck a chord with troops abroad and their relatives at home. Her down-to-earth style quickly established her as the public's favourite antidote to the misery of the blackout and the Blitz. With appearances at the London Palladium and Holborn Empire, Vera Lynn proved a national tonic in the anxious days at the beginning of the war. In 1941 she married musician Harry Lewis. ""I don't think I thought much of him at first,"" she later said. ""He wooed me with chewing gum."" But the union lasted six decades until his death. Lewis also became her manager. Dame Vera Lynn dies at age 103 We'll Meet Again: The story behind the song In pictures: Dame Vera Lynn's life and career 'An inspiration to us all' - tributes to Dame Vera She was given her own radio programme and, thanks to the BBC's shortwave transmitters, could be heard across the world. Lynn spent the war years entertaining the troops, performing in hospitals and army camps, and travelling as far as India and Burma. She stayed in tents and grass huts, and ""went goodness knows how long without a bath"". Of her journeys to such threatening territory, she explained: ""It was so important to get entertainment to the boys."" Bing Crosby was one of many stars who appeared on her BBC TV shows Vera Lynn's success continued well into peacetime and, in 1952, she became the first British artist to have a number one hit in America with the song Auf Wiedersehen, Sweetheart. And two years later, she had her only British number one single with My Son, My Son. She never retired and was always happy to move in new directions, notably with a cover of Abba's Thank You For The Music. However, it was plain that the public, including those born long after the war, wanted to hear her perform her classic songs. In 2009, at the age of 92, Lynn became the oldest living artist to top the British album chart, outselling both the Arctic Monkeys and the Beatles, with whom she shared the top 10. The singer had a realistic approach to her fame. ""I don't live in the past,"" she once said, ""even though I have never been allowed to forget it."" She appeared on stage during the 60th anniversary commemorations for VE Day in 2005 In 1976 Lynn was made a dame and in 2000 she was named as the Briton who best exemplified the spirit of the 20th Century. As well as making frequent appearances at veterans' reunions, Lynn was a tireless charity worker for hundreds of organisations. In 1992 she founded the Dame Vera Lynn School for Parents and Handicapped Children. She performed in front of thousands of people outside Buckingham Palace to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the end of the war in 1995, and put in an appearance at the next anniversary concert 10 years later. In a 2005 speech, she remarked: ""We should always remember, we should never forget, and we should teach the children to remember."" This photo was released on Dame Vera's 103rd birthday in March By the time the 75th anniversary of VE Day approached, the impression made by Dame Vera's songs and contribution was shown to be as deep as ever. The UK was facing another crisis - and a virus, rather than a foreign army, was the foe this time. In a televised address in April, the Queen evoked Dame Vera's wartime message, assuring families and friends who were separated during the coronavirus pandemic: ""We will meet again."" The Queen's coronavirus address: 'We will meet again' Dame Vera Lynn uses 103rd birthday to buoy Britain Dame Vera Lynn breaks her own chart record Just two weeks earlier, Dame Vera herself had sent a message on her 103rd birthday, calling on the British public to find ""moments of joy"" during these ""hard times"". Then in May, We'll Meet Again was used during the finale of the BBC's coverage of the VE Day anniversary. Dame Vera appeared in a virtual duet with Katherine Jenkins, while key workers also joined in with the song. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

That led an album that had been released for her 100th birthday - featuring contributions from younger singers including Alfie Boe, Alexander Armstrong and Cynthia Erivo -to re-enter the UK top 40.

"Pub chain Greene King and insurance market Lloyd's of London have apologised for their historical links to the slave trade. One of Greene King's founders owned a number of plantations in the Caribbean. Meanwhile, maritime insurance - which was focused on Lloyd's - thrived on the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Both organisations have apologised and Lloyd's has said it will donate to charities representing black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) groups. Greene King said it would make a ""substantial investment to benefit the BAME community"", after consulting with its staff on how this money can best be used. Lloyd's and Greene King's moves werefirst reported by the Telegraph in the UK.,external Lloyd's, which was founded in 1688, insured slave ships. It is often lauded as the world's leading insurance market, focusing on specialist areas, such as marine, energy and political risk. In a statement, Lloyd's said: ""There are some aspects of our history that we are not proud of. ""In particular, we are sorry for the role played by the Lloyd's market in the 18th and 19th-Century slave trade."" ""This was an appalling and shameful period of English history, as well as our own, and we condemn the indefensible wrongdoing that occurred during this period."" This video can not be played What do we do with the UK's symbols of slavery? Lloyd's said it would provide financial support to charities and organisations promoting opportunity and inclusion for BAME groups. It has also launched a number of new initiatives aimed at developing black and minority ethnic talent within the organisation. ""In recent years, Lloyd's has driven ahead with a series of positive programmes designed to improve culture across the market. We have made progress, but not enough."" Pressure has been growing on companies around the world to address links to slavery and tackle racial inequality following the death of George Floyd in the US last month while in police custody. ""Racism - the ideology used to justify slavery - is a legacy that still shapes the life chances for people of African and Caribbean heritage in the UK,"" said Dr Katie Donington, a senior lecturer in history at the London South Bank University. ""It is an important step that firms with historical links to trans-Atlantic slavery are now beginning the process of acknowledging the past."" Oxford college wants to remove Rhodes statue Britain's Forgotten Slave Owners - The Secret Slave Owners British History in depth- Slavery and the Building of Britain Quaker Oats acknowledges 'racial stereotype' While she welcomed the commitment by Lloyd's, she added: ""The offer of investment in BAME charities and organisations needs further scrutiny - how much will be invested and who will receive the money? ""This is a history which is specific to the black community and directing forms of reparative justice towards descendent groups must be the priority."" While companies may have been reluctant to speak out in the past, the international outcry and huge demonstrations following Mr Floyd's death has made speaking up a ""business imperative"". Dwayna Haley, a senior vice president at Porter Novelli, a communications firm that has advised companies such as McDonald's and Pepsi,previously told the BBC: ""What is driving this is the understanding that if we don't cater to the people that we serve, we could lose market share,"" she says. ""It is a strategic business move."" Brewer and pub chain Greene King was originally founded in 1799 by Benjamin Greene, who owned highly-profitable plantations. His son Edward took over control of the brewery in 1836 and it was renamed Greene King in 1887 after merging with a local brewery. When slavery was abolished in 1833, the UK government raised huge amounts for compensation. However, that money was not paid to those who had been enslaved, but was given instead to slave-owners for their ""loss of human property"". Benjamin Greene was one of thousands who received payment. Details of the sums are listed in adatabase held by the University College London (UCL).,external Nick Mackenzie, Greene King's chief executive officer, said: ""It is inexcusable that one of our founders profited from slavery and argued against its abolition in the 1800s. While that is a part of our history, we are now focused on the present and the future."" To address the issue, the pub chain will ""make a substantial investment to benefit the BAME community and support our race diversity in the business"". Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays and HSBC were among a number of banks found by the Telegraph to be linked to the slave trade. Royal Bank of Scotland:In a 2009 report,external, the bank admitted that individuals who were partners or directors of RBSG (Royal Bank of Scotland Group) predecessors ""may have owned slaves themselves or been otherwise directly connected to slave enterprises in the British West Indies"". Founded in Edinburgh in 1727, it also found evidence that suggested other partners of its predecessors may have been part-owners of ""ships involved in slave trading voyages during the 18th and early 19th Centuries"". The UK government owns a 62% stake in the Royal Bank of Scotland today ""As an organisation with a history stretching back more than 300 years, these important and painful issues have a place in our history. We recognise our responsibility to engage with that"", RBS said in a statement. The bank, currently majority-owned by the UK government, added that it had ""looked into its past links with slavery very extensively and thoroughly"", and would look at ""what more we can do as a bank"", including making financial contributions to BAME groups. Lloyds Banking Group: John White Cater was the president of London and Brazilian Bank and received compensation for five claims for estates in Jamaica. Eight former companies associated with the group have links to claimants or beneficiaries in UCL's database. A Lloyds Banking Group spokesperson said: ""A lot has changed during the 300-year history of our brands and while we have much within our heritage to be proud of, we can't be proud of it all. Like any institution that is so interwoven with our country's history, we must acknowledge and learn from our past."" They added that the firm would ""deliver better results for our colleagues and customers. This is our aim. We can do more, we can do better and we will do it together."" Barclays: One manager, one founder subscriber and three directors of the Colonial Bank are listed as claimants or beneficiaries by UCL. It was merged with Barclays in 1917. The claims include nine by director John Bloxam Elin relating to estates in Jamaica. ""The history of Barclays, like other institutions, is being examined following recent events. We can't change what's gone before us, only how we go forward,"" a Barclays spokesperson said. ""We are committed as a bank to do more to further foster our culture of inclusiveness, equality and diversity, for our colleagues, and the customers and clients we serve."" HSBC: According to UCL's database, George Pollard was a trustee over a claim related to the Calhoun estate in Nevis. Mr Pollard was manager of the London Joint Stock Bank, which was eventually merged into HSBC, now the UK's largest bank. HSBC did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment.

"Mr Bolton denies that the book contains classified information US President Donald Trump sought help from Chinese President Xi Jinping to win re-election, ex-National Security Adviser John Bolton's new book says. Mr Bolton says Mr Trump wanted China to buy agricultural produce from US farmers, according to details of the forthcoming book previewed by US media. He also says Mr Trump ""remained stunningly uninformed on how to run the White House"". The Trump administration is trying to block the book from going on sale. Speaking to Fox News, Mr Trump said of Mr Bolton: ""He broke the law. This is highly classified information and he did not have approval."" ""He was a washed-up guy,"" the president added. ""I gave him a chance."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

John Bolton joined the White House in April 2018 and left in September the following year, saying he had decided to quit.President Trump, however, said he had fired Mr Boltonbecause he disagreed ""strongly"" with him. He is known as a foreign policy hardliner and also served in the administration of President George W Bush. As national security adviser, he was the top counsellor to the US president on security matters at home and abroad. Mr Bolton's 577-page tome, The Room Where It Happened, is due to go on sale on 23 June. But on Wednesday night, the Department of Justice sought an emergency order from a judge to stop the book's release. Ten biggest claims in John Bolton's book John Bolton: Who is man behind Trump-Xi allegations? Why has Trump's niece written a damning memoir? The publisher, Simon & Schuster, said in a statement: ""Tonight's filing by the government is a frivolous, politically motivated exercise in futility."" It said hundreds of thousands of copies of the book had already been distributed around the world and the injunction would accomplish nothing. Mr Trump's Democratic challenger in this November's election, Joe Biden, said in a statement about the book: ""If these accounts are true, it's not only morally repugnant, it's a violation of Donald Trump's sacred duty to the American people."" The allegations refer to a meeting between President Trump and President Xi at the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan, in June last year. ""Trump, stunningly, turned the conversation to the coming US presidential election [in 2020], alluding to China's economic capability and pleading with Xi to ensure he'd win,"" Mr Bolton wrote. ""He stressed the importance of farmers and increased Chinese purchases of soybeans and wheat in the electoral outcome."" The two men met during a G20 meeting in Japan last year Farmers make up a key voting bloc and largely supported Mr Trump in the 2016 election. Speaking on Wednesday evening, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer disputed Mr Bolton's account, saying the request for help with re-election ""never happened"". Mr Bolton also mentions an earlier conversation at the summit's opening dinner, in which they discussed the building of camps in China's western Xinjiang region. Mr Trump said the construction should go ahead as it was ""exactly the right thing to do"". This video can not be played The BBC visits the camps where Chinaâs Muslims have their ""thoughts transformed"" China has detained about a million Uighurs and other ethnic minorities in the campsfor punishment and indoctrination. The Trump administration has been publicly critical of China's treatment of Uighurs, and on Wednesday the president signed legislation authorising US sanctions against Chinese officials responsible for the repression of Muslims in Xinjiang province. China denies mistreating Uighurs and attacked the US move, calling it malicious and threatening countermeasures. On one hand, the account John Bolton offers in his new book should seem somewhat familiar. This is hardly the first time a former adviser or anonymous current aide to Donald Trump has offered anecdotes about a president seemingly uninterested in the details of governing and uninformed on basic issues of foreign policy. For nearly three-and-a-half years, there have been plentiful stories about a White House rife with backbiting and internal power struggles. Mr Bolton's book goes beyond this well-trodden ground, however, in painting a broad portrait of a president willing to bend foreign policy to advance his domestic and personal political agenda. This was the heart of the impeachment case congressional Democrats made against Trump in January. Mr Bolton confirms their allegations that the president wanted the withholding of military aid to pressure Ukraine to provide damaging information about Democratic rival Joe Biden. Mr Bolton adds that Trump's dealings with China were also done with an eye on his re-election, and that he repeatedly intervened to assist friendly autocrats around the world. Republicans suggest this is all the work of a disgruntled employee trying to sell books, while Democrats are already growling that Bolton should have volunteered these bombshells during the impeachment proceedings. That ship has sailed, of course, but Bolton's book can still have a bite, distracting a presidential campaign struggling to find its footing less than five months before election day. Mr Bolton says the impeachment inquiry into the president might have had a different outcome this year if it had gone beyond Ukraine and investigated other instances of alleged political interference. In January, President Trump was impeached for withholding military aid to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into starting a corruption investigation into Mr Biden and his son Hunter. The president denied the wrongdoing andwas acquitted after a two-week trialin the Republican-controlled Senate in February, which did not include any witnesses. Mr Bolton - who was criticised by Democrats for declining to testify to the hearings - does not discuss in the book whether he thinks that Mr Trump's actions on Ukraine were impeachable. The publication contains a number of other damaging allegations: Among other things, Mr Trump is alleged to have been unaware that the UK was a nuclear power. Britain's atomic deterrent came up during a meeting with Theresa May in 2018, when it was mentioned by one of the then-prime minister's officials. According to the book, Mr Trump said: ""Oh, are you a nuclear power?"" Mr Bolton said he could tell it ""was not intended as a joke"". Trump unaware UK was nuclear power - former aide Mr Trump also once asked his former chief-of-staff John Kelly if Finland was part of Russia, writes Mr Bolton. Mr Trump said invading Venezuela would be ""cool"", according to the book, and that the South American nation was ""really part of the United States"". But he was less enthusiastic about another invasion. Of the Afghanistan conflict, Mr Trump is quoted in the book as saying: ""This was done by a stupid person named George Bush."" Mr Bolton writes that in a May 2019 phone call Russian President Vladimir Putin pulled off a ""brilliant display of Soviet-style propaganda"" by likening Venezuelan opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ to 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, which ""largely persuaded Trump"". Mr Putin's objective was to defend his ally, Venezuelan President NicolÃ¡s Maduro, Mr Bolton writes. In 2018, Mr Trump labelled the leftist Mr Maduro a dictator and imposed sanctions, but he clung to power. In an interview with ABC News to be broadcast in full this Sunday, Mr Bolton says of Mr Trump: ""I think Putin thinks he can play him like a fiddle."" Mr Bolton writes that many of the president's closest aides privately disparaged him. When he arrived at the White House, Mr Bolton said Mr Kelly warned him: ""You can't imagine how desperate I am to get out of here. This is a bad place to work, as you will find out."" During Mr Trump's 2018 meeting with North Korea's leader, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo passed Mr Bolton a note about the president that said: ""He is so full of shit."" He writes that Mr Pompeo, often described as a Trump loyalist, was among aides who considered resigning in disgust in frustration at working for the president. Mr Bolton writes that the president ""saw conspiracies behind rocks, and remained stunningly uninformed on how to run the White House, let alone the huge federal government.""

"Huawei poses challenges to national security and has engaged in unacceptable acts, Google's former boss Eric Schmidt has told the BBC. But he says the West should respond by competing with China and its technologies, rather than disengaging. Mr Schmidt now chairs the Pentagon's Defence Innovation Board. The UK is currently reviewing whether to continue letting Huawei help build its 5G mobile networks amid growing pressure to exclude the Chinese firm. ""There's no question that Huawei has engaged in some practices that are not acceptable in national security,"" Mr Schmidt told a BBC Radio 4 documentary. He said it was possible to think of the company as a means of ""signals intelligence"" - a reference to spy agencies like the UK's GCHQ or NSA in the US. ""There's no question that information from Huawei routers has ultimately ended up in hands that would appear to be the state,"" Mr Schmidt added. ""However that happened, we're sure it happened."" US-China row moves underwater in cable tangle Huawei has consistently denied accusations that it is an arm of the Chinese state, or passes on customer data to the authorities. ""The allegations made by Eric Schmidt, who now works for the US government, are simply not true and as with similar assertions in the past, are not backed by evidence,"" Victor Zhang, Huawei's UK chief told the BBC. ""Huawei is independent from any government, including the Chinese government. ""Where we do agree, and something we've always said, is that applying standards globally ensures innovation, fosters competition and benefits everyone."" Eric Schmidt says the real issue with Huawei lies in the challenge to US leadership it represents: a Chinese company operating on a global stage that is building a better product than its competitors. ""It's extremely important that we have choices,"" he told the BBC. ""The answer to Huawei... is to compete by having a product and product line that is as good."" The US has banned Huawei from using US chip technologies but is allowing American firms to work with the firm on 5G standards Eric Schmidt spent a decade and a half as chief executive and then executive chairman of Google and its parent company Alphabet. He acknowledges that over a long career in Silicon Valley, he had underestimated China's ability to innovate. ""I have carried the prejudices about China in my years working with them,"" he said. ""That they're very good at copying things, that they're very good at organising things, that they throw large numbers of people at it. But they're not going to do anything new. They're very, very good at stealing, if you will, our stuff. Those prejudices need to be thrown out. ""The Chinese are just as good, and maybe better, in key areas of research and innovation as the West. ""They're putting more money into it. They are putting it in a different way, it is state-directed in a way that is different from the West. We need to get our act together to compete."" He denies the Chinese model of state-directed investment in technology is intrinsically more successful than a free-market model. However, he believes the West needs to make the most of its strengths by: investing more in research funding ensuring greater collaboration between private sector, the state and academia remaining open to the best talent from around the world ""Most people would prefer to live and work in the West than work in China,"" he says. One of the problems in the US and particularly in Silicon Valley, Mr Schmidt believes, is a historical blindness to the role of the government in supporting research. ""Everything you see in Silicon Valley to the first order came from initial federal science grants of one kind or another."" Last year he chaired a US National Security Commission looking at artificial intelligence. China's advances in this field are a major concern. ""I would say they are a few years behind,"" he says. ""Not five years, and not 10 years. And there's evidence of China closing the gap in the next few years. ""So the question is: what happens then? Well obviously, artificial intelligence has military and national security applications."" China's work on quantum computing, he adds, is on a par with that of the West, and could even be ahead. Mr Schmidt joined Google in 2001 and gave up his final post as an advisor to the firm in February Mr Schmidt views the decoupling of the technology sectors in China and the US as ""undesirable"", believing it will lead to two distinct systems. ""Once you diverge these global platforms, you don't get them back,"" he says. ""We benefit from having a common platform of interchange... and I worry that by building these platforms separate, the countries will understand each other less. ""China's going to dominate whether we couple or decouple. They have the resources, they have the money, they have the technology. ""The question is do they operate on global platforms or do they operate on their own platforms? The more segregated the platforms are, the more dangerous it is. ""It is in the West's interest that every technology platform has Western values in them."" Huawei launches media blitz as UK weighs its role in 5G Senator tells MPs Huawei puts US troops at risk Huawei executive suffers US extradition blow Mr Schmidt is cautious about picking national champions and supporting them. But he says there are weaknesses in the West's own capacity, particularly in not having foundries that manufacture semiconductor chips. He says it would be better for China to use chips from Western companies rather than build its own. The rise of nationalism and protectionism around the world is of ""great concern"", he concludes, pointing to the fact that more than half of the start-ups in Silicon Valley have been founded by foreign-born nationals. Faced with a challenge from China, he draws on his own Silicon Valley experience. ""The best strategy is to think of it as a competition not unlike the tech companies, where there's brutal competition,"" he said. ""[It will be] as rough as it could be - largely unregulated between the various players - where we seek to win."" The New Tech Cold War will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 at 11:00 BST on Friday and again on Tuesday at 16:00 BST.

"Protesters have been calling for an Oxford college's statue of Cecil Rhodes to be removed for several years Campaigners have said protests will continue while the controversial statue of colonialist Cecil Rhodes remains at Oxford's Oriel College, after governors voted on Wednesday to remove it. The college says there will need to be consultations over planning regulations before it can be taken down. Sizwe Mpofu-Walsh, a founder of the Rhodes Must Fall campaign, said they felt ""greatly vindicated"" by the vote. But he said it was crucial the college followed through on its plan. Rhodes played a key role in the expansion of the British Empire in Southern Africa, including South Africa and Zimbabwe, previously known as Rhodesia. Critics accuse the campaign of trying to ""rewrite history"", while campaigners for the statue's removal say it is a symbol of imperialism and racism. How many statues of black people does the UK have? Don't hide history, says Oxford vice-chancellor How do you replace a fallen statue? Why is Cecil Rhodes such a controversial character? Responding to Wednesday's vote, Rhodes Must Fall said that until the statue ""ceases to adorn the facade of Oriel College on Oxford's High Street"" there would still be protests over ""imperial and colonial iconography"" in university buildings. ""We have been down this route before, where Oriel College has committed to taking a certain action, but has not followed through,"" a statement read, referring to a commitment to engage in a ""six-month-long democratic listening exercise"" in 2015. ""Therefore, while we remain hopeful, our optimism is cautious. While the governing body of Oriel College have 'expressed their wish' to take down the statue, we continue to demand their commitment."" Protesters in Oxford said the statue was no longer acceptable Oriel College's governors said the decision had been reached ""after a thoughtful period of debate and reflection"" - and in ""full awareness of the impact these decisions are likely to have in Britain and around the world"". The college is to launch an ""independent commission of inquiry"" into the legacy of Cecil Rhodes, which also includes scholarships at the university. The commission, to be headed by Carole Souter, master of St Cross College and former National Lottery Heritage Fund chief, will also consider wider issues, such as support for black and ethnic minority students and a commitment to ""diversity"". It will consult with groups including students, local people, councillors and the Rhodes Must Fall campaigners. Cecil Rhodes was an imperialist, businessman and politician. Born in Hertfordshire in 1853, he first went to Africa aged 17 where he gradually became the dominant force in the diamond mining trade. He was a strong advocate for colonial power in Africa and played a dominant role in southern Africa in the late 19th Century, driving the annexation of vast swathes of land. He believed he was part of ""the first race in the world"", writing to a friend that ""the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race"". Some see him as one of the people who helped prepare the way for South Africa's apartheid by working to alter laws on voting and land ownership. Rhodes, who studied at Oriel College, left money to the college on his death in 1902. The Rhodes scholarships, created via his will, allow 83 students to come to Oxford each year. He said in life that he wanted to cheat the constraints of mortality by leaving a legacy. Read more about himhere. Former Oxford student and campaigner Mr Mpofu-Walsh said those who pushed for the removal of the Rhodes statue ""feel greatly vindicated that their position has been given a much fairer hearing this time around"". But he said it was ""crucially important, even at this moment of celebration"" to make sure Oriel College removed the statue. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said the objective of the college's commission was ""quite vague"" but he hoped it would focus on how the college can become more representative. When asked aboutthe Rhodes scholarships, Mr Mpofu-Walsh said: ""We need to be very careful here about suggesting that Rhodes could atone for his legacy through a handful of scholarships for people from Africa. The legacy of Rhodes extends wide and deep. ""Any number of scholarships cannot account for the full scale of the horror that many of those people have felt."" This video can not be played What do we do with the UK's symbols of slavery? The fate of the statue has divided opinion. Susan Brown, leader of Oxford City Council, backed the decision to take down the statue - and said the college's inquiry would be a chance to decide where the statue will ""best be curated in future"". Labour MP Bell Ribeiro-Addycalled it the ""right decision"" on Twitter,external, adding that it was ""time to take figures like Rhodes down off their pedestals"". Alan Rusbridger, principal of Lady Margaret Hall in Oxford, also welcomed the decision. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Earlier on Wednesday, the universities minister had spoken against calls to remove the statue. Michelle Donelan said: ""Racism is abhorrent and shouldn't be tolerated anywhere in our society, and that includes universities."" But she said it would be ""short sighted"" to try to ""rewrite our history"" - and rejected attempts to ""censor or edit"" the past. Last week the vice-chancellor of Oxford University, Louise Richardson, gave little support for removing the statue - and warned against ""hiding"" the past. ""My own view on this is that hiding our history is not the route to enlightenment,"" Prof Richardson told BBC News. ""We need to understand this history and understand the context in which it was made and why it was that people believed then as they did,"" she said. ""This university has been around for 900 years. For 800 of those years the people who ran the university didn't think women were worthy of an education. Should we denounce those people? ""Personally, no - I think they were wrong, but they have to be judged by the context of their time,"" said Prof Richardson.

"Huawei poses challenges to national security and has engaged in unacceptable acts, Google's former boss Eric Schmidt has told the BBC. But he says the West should respond by competing with China and its technologies, rather than disengaging. Mr Schmidt now chairs the Pentagon's Defence Innovation Board. The UK is currently reviewing whether to continue letting Huawei help build its 5G mobile networks amid growing pressure to exclude the Chinese firm. ""There's no question that Huawei has engaged in some practices that are not acceptable in national security,"" Mr Schmidt told a BBC Radio 4 documentary. He said it was possible to think of the company as a means of ""signals intelligence"" - a reference to spy agencies like the UK's GCHQ or NSA in the US. ""There's no question that information from Huawei routers has ultimately ended up in hands that would appear to be the state,"" Mr Schmidt added. ""However that happened, we're sure it happened."" US-China row moves underwater in cable tangle Huawei has consistently denied accusations that it is an arm of the Chinese state, or passes on customer data to the authorities. ""The allegations made by Eric Schmidt, who now works for the US government, are simply not true and as with similar assertions in the past, are not backed by evidence,"" Victor Zhang, Huawei's UK chief told the BBC. ""Huawei is independent from any government, including the Chinese government. ""Where we do agree, and something we've always said, is that applying standards globally ensures innovation, fosters competition and benefits everyone."" Eric Schmidt says the real issue with Huawei lies in the challenge to US leadership it represents: a Chinese company operating on a global stage that is building a better product than its competitors. ""It's extremely important that we have choices,"" he told the BBC. ""The answer to Huawei... is to compete by having a product and product line that is as good."" The US has banned Huawei from using US chip technologies but is allowing American firms to work with the firm on 5G standards Eric Schmidt spent a decade and a half as chief executive and then executive chairman of Google and its parent company Alphabet. He acknowledges that over a long career in Silicon Valley, he had underestimated China's ability to innovate. ""I have carried the prejudices about China in my years working with them,"" he said. ""That they're very good at copying things, that they're very good at organising things, that they throw large numbers of people at it. But they're not going to do anything new. They're very, very good at stealing, if you will, our stuff. Those prejudices need to be thrown out. ""The Chinese are just as good, and maybe better, in key areas of research and innovation as the West. ""They're putting more money into it. They are putting it in a different way, it is state-directed in a way that is different from the West. We need to get our act together to compete."" He denies the Chinese model of state-directed investment in technology is intrinsically more successful than a free-market model. However, he believes the West needs to make the most of its strengths by: investing more in research funding ensuring greater collaboration between private sector, the state and academia remaining open to the best talent from around the world ""Most people would prefer to live and work in the West than work in China,"" he says. One of the problems in the US and particularly in Silicon Valley, Mr Schmidt believes, is a historical blindness to the role of the government in supporting research. ""Everything you see in Silicon Valley to the first order came from initial federal science grants of one kind or another."" Last year he chaired a US National Security Commission looking at artificial intelligence. China's advances in this field are a major concern. ""I would say they are a few years behind,"" he says. ""Not five years, and not 10 years. And there's evidence of China closing the gap in the next few years. ""So the question is: what happens then? Well obviously, artificial intelligence has military and national security applications."" China's work on quantum computing, he adds, is on a par with that of the West, and could even be ahead. Mr Schmidt joined Google in 2001 and gave up his final post as an advisor to the firm in February Mr Schmidt views the decoupling of the technology sectors in China and the US as ""undesirable"", believing it will lead to two distinct systems. ""Once you diverge these global platforms, you don't get them back,"" he says. ""We benefit from having a common platform of interchange... and I worry that by building these platforms separate, the countries will understand each other less. ""China's going to dominate whether we couple or decouple. They have the resources, they have the money, they have the technology. ""The question is do they operate on global platforms or do they operate on their own platforms? The more segregated the platforms are, the more dangerous it is. ""It is in the West's interest that every technology platform has Western values in them."" Huawei launches media blitz as UK weighs its role in 5G Senator tells MPs Huawei puts US troops at risk Huawei executive suffers US extradition blow Mr Schmidt is cautious about picking national champions and supporting them. But he says there are weaknesses in the West's own capacity, particularly in not having foundries that manufacture semiconductor chips. He says it would be better for China to use chips from Western companies rather than build its own. The rise of nationalism and protectionism around the world is of ""great concern"", he concludes, pointing to the fact that more than half of the start-ups in Silicon Valley have been founded by foreign-born nationals. Faced with a challenge from China, he draws on his own Silicon Valley experience. ""The best strategy is to think of it as a competition not unlike the tech companies, where there's brutal competition,"" he said. ""[It will be] as rough as it could be - largely unregulated between the various players - where we seek to win.""

"Dame Vera Lynn, who has died at the age of 103, was Britain's wartime Forces' Sweetheart, and remained one of the country's most potent symbols of resilience and hope. With songs such as We'll Meet Again and The White Cliffs of Dover, she inspired both troops abroad and civilians at home during World War Two. As Britain's cities came under attack, her wistful songs, with their messages of yearning and optimism, were heard in millions of British homes. And 75 years later, the country turned to her once again as it faced another stern test. She was born Vera Margaret Welch on 20 March 1917 in the London suburb of East Ham, the daughter of a plumber. She discovered her talent for singing at an early age and was performing in local clubs when she was seven. By the time she was 11, she had abandoned school for a full-time career as a dancer and singer in a touring music hall revue. She had also adopted a new stage name, Vera Lynn, borrowing her grandmother's maiden name. She regularly broadcast with Britain's biggest bands in the 1930s She was a soloist by the age of 16, fronting a number of bands. Lynn was self-effacing, unlike many of the singing stars of the day, and her gentle persona quickly endeared her to audiences. Her broadcasting debut came in 1935, singing with the Joe Loss Orchestra, which led to regular radio appearances and widened her circle of fans. But in 1939, war intervened. As families gathered around the wireless to listen to Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's announcement that Britain was at war with Germany, Lynn remembered thinking: ""Oh well, bang goes my career."" But when she volunteered for war work, she was told the best thing she could do was to keep on being an entertainer. This was reinforced when, in a 1939 poll by the Daily Express, she was voted by servicemen as their favourite entertainer, and gained her Forces' Sweetheart nickname. In the same year, she first sang We'll Meet Again, the song that more than any other came to be associated with World War Two. She thought it was vital to bring a touch of home to the troops Its underlying message of hope - that scattered families would eventually be reunited after the conflict - struck a chord with troops abroad and their relatives at home. Her down-to-earth style quickly established her as the public's favourite antidote to the misery of the blackout and the Blitz. With appearances at the London Palladium and Holborn Empire, Vera Lynn proved a national tonic in the anxious days at the beginning of the war. In 1941 she married musician Harry Lewis. ""I don't think I thought much of him at first,"" she later said. ""He wooed me with chewing gum."" But the union lasted six decades until his death. Lewis also became her manager. Dame Vera Lynn dies at age 103 We'll Meet Again: The story behind the song In pictures: Dame Vera Lynn's life and career 'An inspiration to us all' - tributes to Dame Vera She was given her own radio programme and, thanks to the BBC's shortwave transmitters, could be heard across the world. Lynn spent the war years entertaining the troops, performing in hospitals and army camps, and travelling as far as India and Burma. She stayed in tents and grass huts, and ""went goodness knows how long without a bath"". Of her journeys to such threatening territory, she explained: ""It was so important to get entertainment to the boys."" Bing Crosby was one of many stars who appeared on her BBC TV shows Vera Lynn's success continued well into peacetime and, in 1952, she became the first British artist to have a number one hit in America with the song Auf Wiedersehen, Sweetheart. And two years later, she had her only British number one single with My Son, My Son. She never retired and was always happy to move in new directions, notably with a cover of Abba's Thank You For The Music. However, it was plain that the public, including those born long after the war, wanted to hear her perform her classic songs. In 2009, at the age of 92, Lynn became the oldest living artist to top the British album chart, outselling both the Arctic Monkeys and the Beatles, with whom she shared the top 10. The singer had a realistic approach to her fame. ""I don't live in the past,"" she once said, ""even though I have never been allowed to forget it."" She appeared on stage during the 60th anniversary commemorations for VE Day in 2005 In 1976 Lynn was made a dame and in 2000 she was named as the Briton who best exemplified the spirit of the 20th Century. As well as making frequent appearances at veterans' reunions, Lynn was a tireless charity worker for hundreds of organisations. In 1992 she founded the Dame Vera Lynn School for Parents and Handicapped Children. She performed in front of thousands of people outside Buckingham Palace to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the end of the war in 1995, and put in an appearance at the next anniversary concert 10 years later. In a 2005 speech, she remarked: ""We should always remember, we should never forget, and we should teach the children to remember."" This photo was released on Dame Vera's 103rd birthday in March By the time the 75th anniversary of VE Day approached, the impression made by Dame Vera's songs and contribution was shown to be as deep as ever. The UK was facing another crisis - and a virus, rather than a foreign army, was the foe this time. In a televised address in April, the Queen evoked Dame Vera's wartime message, assuring families and friends who were separated during the coronavirus pandemic: ""We will meet again.""

"Dame Vera Lynn, who has died at the age of 103, was Britain's wartime Forces' Sweetheart, and remained one of the country's most potent symbols of resilience and hope. With songs such as We'll Meet Again and The White Cliffs of Dover, she inspired both troops abroad and civilians at home during World War Two. As Britain's cities came under attack, her wistful songs, with their messages of yearning and optimism, were heard in millions of British homes. And 75 years later, the country turned to her once again as it faced another stern test. She was born Vera Margaret Welch on 20 March 1917 in the London suburb of East Ham, the daughter of a plumber. She discovered her talent for singing at an early age and was performing in local clubs when she was seven. By the time she was 11, she had abandoned school for a full-time career as a dancer and singer in a touring music hall revue. She had also adopted a new stage name, Vera Lynn, borrowing her grandmother's maiden name. She regularly broadcast with Britain's biggest bands in the 1930s She was a soloist by the age of 16, fronting a number of bands. Lynn was self-effacing, unlike many of the singing stars of the day, and her gentle persona quickly endeared her to audiences. Her broadcasting debut came in 1935, singing with the Joe Loss Orchestra, which led to regular radio appearances and widened her circle of fans. But in 1939, war intervened. As families gathered around the wireless to listen to Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's announcement that Britain was at war with Germany, Lynn remembered thinking: ""Oh well, bang goes my career."" But when she volunteered for war work, she was told the best thing she could do was to keep on being an entertainer. This was reinforced when, in a 1939 poll by the Daily Express, she was voted by servicemen as their favourite entertainer, and gained her Forces' Sweetheart nickname. In the same year, she first sang We'll Meet Again, the song that more than any other came to be associated with World War Two. She thought it was vital to bring a touch of home to the troops Its underlying message of hope - that scattered families would eventually be reunited after the conflict - struck a chord with troops abroad and their relatives at home. Her down-to-earth style quickly established her as the public's favourite antidote to the misery of the blackout and the Blitz. With appearances at the London Palladium and Holborn Empire, Vera Lynn proved a national tonic in the anxious days at the beginning of the war. In 1941 she married musician Harry Lewis. ""I don't think I thought much of him at first,"" she later said. ""He wooed me with chewing gum."" But the union lasted six decades until his death. Lewis also became her manager. Dame Vera Lynn dies at age 103 We'll Meet Again: The story behind the song In pictures: Dame Vera Lynn's life and career 'An inspiration to us all' - tributes to Dame Vera She was given her own radio programme and, thanks to the BBC's shortwave transmitters, could be heard across the world. Lynn spent the war years entertaining the troops, performing in hospitals and army camps, and travelling as far as India and Burma. She stayed in tents and grass huts, and ""went goodness knows how long without a bath"". Of her journeys to such threatening territory, she explained: ""It was so important to get entertainment to the boys."" Bing Crosby was one of many stars who appeared on her BBC TV shows Vera Lynn's success continued well into peacetime and, in 1952, she became the first British artist to have a number one hit in America with the song Auf Wiedersehen, Sweetheart. And two years later, she had her only British number one single with My Son, My Son. She never retired and was always happy to move in new directions, notably with a cover of Abba's Thank You For The Music. However, it was plain that the public, including those born long after the war, wanted to hear her perform her classic songs. In 2009, at the age of 92, Lynn became the oldest living artist to top the British album chart, outselling both the Arctic Monkeys and the Beatles, with whom she shared the top 10. The singer had a realistic approach to her fame. ""I don't live in the past,"" she once said, ""even though I have never been allowed to forget it."" She appeared on stage during the 60th anniversary commemorations for VE Day in 2005 In 1976 Lynn was made a dame and in 2000 she was named as the Briton who best exemplified the spirit of the 20th Century. As well as making frequent appearances at veterans' reunions, Lynn was a tireless charity worker for hundreds of organisations. In 1992 she founded the Dame Vera Lynn School for Parents and Handicapped Children. She performed in front of thousands of people outside Buckingham Palace to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the end of the war in 1995, and put in an appearance at the next anniversary concert 10 years later. In a 2005 speech, she remarked: ""We should always remember, we should never forget, and we should teach the children to remember."" This photo was released on Dame Vera's 103rd birthday in March By the time the 75th anniversary of VE Day approached, the impression made by Dame Vera's songs and contribution was shown to be as deep as ever. The UK was facing another crisis - and a virus, rather than a foreign army, was the foe this time. In a televised address in April, the Queen evoked Dame Vera's wartime message, assuring families and friends who were separated during the coronavirus pandemic: ""We will meet again.""

"Nearly 100 workers at food plants in Llangefni and Wrexham have tested positive for Covid-19 Non-essential shops in Wales are expected to be told tomorrow they can reopen from Monday Only one of the field hospitals set up in Wales to help ease demand during the coronavirus pandemic has treated any patients Firefighters help families after 200 properties in the south Wales valleys are flooded, some for the third time this year Matt Lloyd, Philip Marsh and Andy Roberts That's it for today's live page coverage of the flooding and coronavirus crisis in Wales. Here's a recap of the main developments today:  Click herefor continued coverage of coronavirus developments around the world. We'll be back tomorrow when First Minister Mark Drakeford will announce any changes to the lockdown regulations in Wales. Poor communications between the UK and Welsh governments are ""hampering"" efforts to tackle coronavirus, a senior Welsh Parliament committee has warned. The Finance Committee has been looking at the Â£2.4bn extra Welsh ministers are spending on dealing with the outbreak. The committee says London-Wales ""communication channels"" were""not as open as they could be""and co-ordination was being ""hampered"". UK ministers said the administrations had ""worked more closely than ever"" together. The committee'sreport,externalpraises the Welsh Government's ""swift action"" during the crisis, but says it is not clear what Welsh ministers are doing to prepare for life after lockdown is eased. First Minister Mark Drakeford said on Monday he had not spoken to the PM for over a fortnight Felicity EvansBBC Wales political editor Itâs expected that non-essential retailers will be told they can open from Monday, when the first minister reveals the latest changes to the coronavirus laws on Friday. Welsh retailers were told to prepare for a possible reopening three weeks ago, while shops in England have been trading since Monday. The Welsh Government will continue to emphasise caution and says its priority continues to be âkeep Wales safeâ. Businesses will be expected to ensure two-metre social distancing is observed in their premises, after Health Minister Vaughan Gething said he did not want to see large crowds gathering near shops. First Minister Mark Drakeford referred to a âpackageâ of measures in his last press briefing, and he may also announce some smaller easing of restrictions, although the controversial âstay localâ message is likely to remain in place. Reopening shops is a move thatâs been heavily trailed by ministers and theyâre keen to stress that caution remains their watchword. The approach from the Welsh Government has been to announce one big thing in each review and then monitor its effect on the reproduction rate of the virus. Recently though, theyâve started putting sectors âon noticeâ for reopening â shops next week, followed by schools the week after. Perhaps this time there will be something for the tourism sector to look forward to? Owain ClarkeBBC Wales Health Correspondent Some of the biggest outbreaks of Covid-19 worldwide have
been in meat processing factories and slaughterhouses. In Ireland, for example, a special National Outbreak Team has been put in place to deal with the large
number of clusters at meat plants. There are various theories about why meat plants are particularly
susceptible. But a combination staff working in close proximity, doing very
physical work, indoors in a cold environment where the virus is known to thrive
-  are likely to be contributory factors. What's certain is that 58 confirmed Covid-19 cases in a factory that
employs around 560 staff - 2 Sisters in Llangefni, Anglesey - will not only be a worry to the workers and their
families but also to the wider community. And
of course the number is very likely to rise with all staff now being tested and
their contacts traced. Children and young people have been invited to put their questions to Wales' education minister about the reopening of schools and colleges. Kirsty Williams will give her replies next Wednesday, with schools set to partially reopen from 29 June. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A coronavirus outbreak at a chicken processing plant on Anglesey has now affected 58 workers. Public Health Wales (PHW) said the number of confirmed cases at the2 Sisters factory in Llangefnihad risen from 51 to 58 with more than 200 people told to self-isolate for 14 days. All of the plant's 560-strong workforce are now to be tested, PHW said. Production at the plant has been suspended and the site closed for two weeks as the company said it wanted to show ""how seriously we take this issue"". Health Minister Vaughan Gething admitted the outbreak was a ""concern"". A factory in Wrexham which produces food ranges for supermarkets
across the UK has confirmed 38 staff have tested positive for Covid-19. Rowan Foods - owned by Oscar Meyer Quality
Foods - employs 1,500 people. It makes prepared foods for UK supermarket chains including Aldi, Asda and Sainsburyâs. The company said there was ""no clear evidence"" the virus had spread within the factory but was a ""reflection"" of an increase in the number of cases across the Wrexham area. It said: âThe site
has 38 staff absent due to testing positive for Covid-19, this is across our
direct and agency workforce which totals 1,500. ""We are very thankful that none
of our colleagues are seriously ill or hospitalised from this virus. âFollowing notification of a positive Covid case we have
worked with Public Health Wales and had already implemented a track-and-trace
process to highlight any close contacts. ""These colleagues are required to
isolate for a 14-day period of isolation. Any member of staff who has tested
positive for Covid-19 is asked to isolate for at least seven days. âThe safety of our colleagues remains our priority and
our focus is remaining Covid-19 secure as a site. âWe are aware through discussions with Public Health
Wales that the Wrexham area is seeing significantly high numbers of positive
cases. It is concerning but not surprising that we are seeing a number of our
staff affected by this local trend. ""Similarly, we are experiencing a high
number of staff required to isolate.  A large proportion of our teams are from
the same household/family and interact outside of work as well as being work
colleagues."" It follows news that more than 50 staff at the2 Sisters chicken processing plant in Llangefni, Anglesey, have tested positive for coronavirus. Rowan Foods management said there was ""no clear evidence"" the virus had spread within the factory The Pro14 rugby tournament will returnafter a five-month Covid-19 pandemic hiatus from 22 August with Welsh derbies. Teams from the same nation will play against each other home and away before the season is concluded by semi-finals and a final. Those finishing in the top two places in Conference A and B will contest the semi-finals. The final is scheduled to take place on Saturday, 12 September with the venue to be confirmed. Bethan LewisBBC Wales Family & Education Correspondent Schools and councils will have the final say on whether the summer term is extended for an extra week, the Welsh Government has said. Discussions are believed to be continuing between government officials, unions and councils. There are union concerns that extending the term to 27 July causes major problems relating to staff contracts. Education Minister Kirsty Williams wants all pupils to get a taste of school from 29 June before the summer break. But some unions have questioned the safety and practicality of the proposal and have warned there may not be sufficient numbers of cleaners and teaching assistants to enable schools to open for an extra week. Anglesey has the highest number of new coronavirus cases for the second day running. According to data from Public Health Wales, 11 of the 48 new cases were on the island. They were among the 25 new cases reported within the Betsi Cadwaladr health board region, which covers north Wales. There were 13 new cases in Cardiff and Vale, three in the Aneurin Bevan health board area, two in Cwm Taf, two in Hywel Dda (both in Ceredigion), none in Powys and none in the Swansea Bay health board region. The news comes as the2 Sisters chicken processing plant at Llangefni on Anglesey suspends productionand closes due to a coronavirus outbreak. Public Health Wales said there were 51 confirmed cases at the plant, with more than 200 people said to be self-isolating. The 2 Sisters chicken processing plant at Llangefni has closed after a coronavirus outbreak Handling the coronavirus pandemic in Wales has been ""responsible"", Health Minister Vaughan Gething has insisted. It comes after Sir David King, who chairs an independent panel of scientific experts, told the Senedd it had been âdisastrousâ and âirresponsibleâ to launch a test and trace scheme so late into the pandemic. Giving the Welsh Government's daily briefing, Mr Gething said: âI think we've been responsible throughout the course of the pandemic. âThat doesn't mean that with the benefit of hindsight, we wouldn't make different choices with the knowledge we have today. âAnd what we have done is we have built up our capacity. ""We weren't able to simply flick a switch to turn on the significant capacity that we now have, itâs taken time to get there.â Mr Gething added he was âvery proudâ of the work that the NHS and local government have done to create the test, trace and protect service. To date 1,471 people are known to have died with coronavirus in Wales. The number of new deaths being declared is less than at the peak of the pandemic. Public Health Wales publishes a daily total of the number of people who have died with Covid-19, with figures provided by health boards. Here is how the deaths have been tracked, allocated to the day they occurred rather than the day they were announced. Public Health Wales says 1,471 people are now known to have died with coronavirus in Wales. Today a further five deaths were confirmed by local authorities. The area with the highest number of total deaths is the Betsi Cadwaladr health board area in north Wales. Health Minister Vaughan Gething says the Welsh Government is committed to âproviding reassurancesâ to teaching staff and parents who may have concerns about the reopening of schools in Wales on 29 June. A survey by the trade union Unison shows over 70 percent of school support staff across Wales believe opening schools before September is too soon. Speaking during the Welsh Government coronavirus press conference today, Mr Gething said it was âreally importantâ to listen to concerns of those already in work and those who may be returning. âWe are certainly doing nothing to have unacceptable risk, weâre not asking staff to go and put themselves at risk,"" he said. âIn the conversations with education unions, I think there is an understanding that there is harm being caused to childrenâs future prospects by not being able to see more education activity restart.â Mr Gething added: âIâm committed to providing reassurance for the understandable concerns that some of our staff have, to make sure we have all our systems in place working with the education minister and local governments and indeed employers."" Five further people have died with coronavirus in Wales, taking the total to 1,471. A further 48 new cases were declared by health boards on Thursday, taking the total to 14,970. But Public Health Wales, who publish the figures, have repeatedly warned the figure could be much higher, as not everyone with symptoms is tested. ""Localised action"" may be needed to tackle Covid-19 hotspots, said the health minster Vaughan Gething. He was being quizzed following the outbreak at an Anglesey chicken processing plant, where 51 workers have contracted coronavirus. The 2 Sisters site at Llangenfi has been closed in a bid to control the virus spread. He said the Welsh Government had been clear that it did not want to take a ""regional approach to easing out of lockdown"". ""We've not ruled out the prospect or the possibility that there could be very localised measures put in place that go beyond individual households being asked to isolate,"" the minister said at the daily briefing. ""But as and when those choices need to be made, we will of course need to communicate those with the public."" Vaughan Gething The Secretary of State for Walesâ intervention on behalf of tourism businesses was ""clumsy and ill-judged"", Mr Gething has told the briefing. ""Weâre all learning and Iâm sure the secretary of state for Wales recognises that he has learning to take from the coronavirus pandemic too,â he said. Simon Hart MP, the Secretary of State for Wales, wrote to members of the Senedd and council leaders urging them to put pressure on Mark Drakeford to re-open the tourism industry in Wales. At todayâs coronavirus briefing, Mr Gething said Mr Hart had âthe luxury of not being a decision makerâ and it would be âmuch better for all of us if the Secretary of State engaged in a more constructive discussion with usâ. âWe are making very difficult decisions about balancing the risks in public health with the harms lockdown cause,"" he said. âI think it was a clumsy and ill-judged intervention for the secretary of state to make,â he added. Tourism intervention 'clumsy and ill-judged', said health minister Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething says he does not want to see ""crowds bunched together outside shops"" if non-essential retailers are allowed to open next week. First Minister Mark Drakeford, is due to announce the outcome of the latest lockdown review in Wales on Friday. Answering questions on Thursday, Mr Gething said a Covid-19 outbreak at a chicken processing plant in Llangefni, Anglesey, showed the importance of maintaining social distancing. Mr Gething told the Welsh Government's daily coronavirus news conference he did not want to see shop workers or shoppers ""put at risk"". ""People really do need to take a step back and realise the seriousness of the position we're in, and to recognise that the release from lockdown comes with responsibilities for all of us in the way that we choose to behave,"" he said. Shoppers queued outside a Nike store in London after lockdown was eased in England The outbreak of Covid-19 at at a chicken factory on Anglesey âreiterates the importance of social distancing and hand hygieneâ, Wales' health minister says. Public Health Wales has announced it has identified51 confirmed cases of the virus at the 2 Sisters plant in Llangefni. Speaking at the Welsh Governmentâs daily press briefing, Vaughan Gething also said he was âconcernedâ there may be more confirmed cases to come. âObviously this reiterates a number of points: it reiterates the fact that even with a low prevalence of coronavirus it hasn't gone, it reiterates the importance of social distancing and appropriate hygiene measures, it also reiterates the importance of our test trace protect system,"" he said. ""People really do need to follow the advice that they're given on getting a test, and on self isolating. âGiven that this is a closed setting in which these people would have been working, I'm obviously concerned that we may well see more confirmed cases of coronavirus,â he added. All residential care homes in Wales have been offered coronavirus testing, the health minister says. By the start of this week, more than 22,800 care home residents and 28,780 staff had been tested, Vaughan Gething told the daily coronavirus briefing. ""Of these,1,212 residents and 1,206 care workers have tested positive for coronavirus."" There are more than 1,200 residential care homes in Wales. However, Mr Gething added: ""There are about 30 care homes across Wales, that have not yet agreed and completed how testing will take place. ""These are care homes where there has not been an outbreak of coronavirus. ""Understandably they have been reluctant to allow testing to take place because they are worried about the risk of coronavirus entering their homes, however small that risk may be. ""Health boards, Care Forum Wales and Care Inspectorate Wales are working with these homes to understand their reasons for not accepting the offer of testing and to encourage take up."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"Protesters have been calling for an Oxford college's statue of Cecil Rhodes to be removed for several years Campaigners have said protests will continue while the controversial statue of colonialist Cecil Rhodes remains at Oxford's Oriel College, after governors voted on Wednesday to remove it. The college says there will need to be consultations over planning regulations before it can be taken down. Sizwe Mpofu-Walsh, a founder of the Rhodes Must Fall campaign, said they felt ""greatly vindicated"" by the vote. But he said it was crucial the college followed through on its plan. Rhodes played a key role in the expansion of the British Empire in Southern Africa, including South Africa and Zimbabwe, previously known as Rhodesia. Critics accuse the campaign of trying to ""rewrite history"", while campaigners for the statue's removal say it is a symbol of imperialism and racism. How many statues of black people does the UK have? Don't hide history, says Oxford vice-chancellor How do you replace a fallen statue? Why is Cecil Rhodes such a controversial character? Responding to Wednesday's vote, Rhodes Must Fall said that until the statue ""ceases to adorn the facade of Oriel College on Oxford's High Street"" there would still be protests over ""imperial and colonial iconography"" in university buildings. ""We have been down this route before, where Oriel College has committed to taking a certain action, but has not followed through,"" a statement read, referring to a commitment to engage in a ""six-month-long democratic listening exercise"" in 2015. ""Therefore, while we remain hopeful, our optimism is cautious. While the governing body of Oriel College have 'expressed their wish' to take down the statue, we continue to demand their commitment."" Protesters in Oxford said the statue was no longer acceptable Oriel College's governors said the decision had been reached ""after a thoughtful period of debate and reflection"" - and in ""full awareness of the impact these decisions are likely to have in Britain and around the world"". The college is to launch an ""independent commission of inquiry"" into the legacy of Cecil Rhodes, which also includes scholarships at the university. The commission, to be headed by Carole Souter, master of St Cross College and former National Lottery Heritage Fund chief, will also consider wider issues, such as support for black and ethnic minority students and a commitment to ""diversity"". It will consult with groups including students, local people, councillors and the Rhodes Must Fall campaigners. Cecil Rhodes was an imperialist, businessman and politician. Born in Hertfordshire in 1853, he first went to Africa aged 17 where he gradually became the dominant force in the diamond mining trade. He was a strong advocate for colonial power in Africa and played a dominant role in southern Africa in the late 19th Century, driving the annexation of vast swathes of land. He believed he was part of ""the first race in the world"", writing to a friend that ""the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race"". Some see him as one of the people who helped prepare the way for South Africa's apartheid by working to alter laws on voting and land ownership. Rhodes, who studied at Oriel College, left money to the college on his death in 1902. The Rhodes scholarships, created via his will, allow 83 students to come to Oxford each year. He said in life that he wanted to cheat the constraints of mortality by leaving a legacy. Read more about himhere. Former Oxford student and campaigner Mr Mpofu-Walsh said those who pushed for the removal of the Rhodes statue ""feel greatly vindicated that their position has been given a much fairer hearing this time around"". But he said it was ""crucially important, even at this moment of celebration"" to make sure Oriel College removed the statue. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said the objective of the college's commission was ""quite vague"" but he hoped it would focus on how the college can become more representative. When asked aboutthe Rhodes scholarships, Mr Mpofu-Walsh said: ""We need to be very careful here about suggesting that Rhodes could atone for his legacy through a handful of scholarships for people from Africa. The legacy of Rhodes extends wide and deep. ""Any number of scholarships cannot account for the full scale of the horror that many of those people have felt."" This video can not be played What do we do with the UK's symbols of slavery? The fate of the statue has divided opinion. Susan Brown, leader of Oxford City Council, backed the decision to take down the statue - and said the college's inquiry would be a chance to decide where the statue will ""best be curated in future"". Labour MP Bell Ribeiro-Addycalled it the ""right decision"" on Twitter,external, adding that it was ""time to take figures like Rhodes down off their pedestals"". Alan Rusbridger, principal of Lady Margaret Hall in Oxford, also welcomed the decision. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Earlier on Wednesday, the universities minister had spoken against calls to remove the statue. Michelle Donelan said: ""Racism is abhorrent and shouldn't be tolerated anywhere in our society, and that includes universities."" But she said it would be ""short sighted"" to try to ""rewrite our history"" - and rejected attempts to ""censor or edit"" the past. Last week the vice-chancellor of Oxford University, Louise Richardson, gave little support for removing the statue - and warned against ""hiding"" the past. ""My own view on this is that hiding our history is not the route to enlightenment,"" Prof Richardson told BBC News. ""We need to understand this history and understand the context in which it was made and why it was that people believed then as they did,"" she said. ""This university has been around for 900 years. For 800 of those years the people who ran the university didn't think women were worthy of an education. Should we denounce those people? ""Personally, no - I think they were wrong, but they have to be judged by the context of their time,"" said Prof Richardson.

"The Principality Stadium, in Cardiff, was transformed into a field hospital to treat coronavirus patients Only one of the field hospitals set up to help ease demand during the coronavirus pandemic has treated any patients, despite costing Â£166m. Buildings, including sports stadiums and theatres, were rapidly turned into 17 hospitals at the peak of the crisis. But only the Dragon's Heart Hospital in Cardiff has received any patients. Health Minister Vaughan Gething defended the decision saying in hindsight he would have ""made different choices at the time"". ""If we had needed extra capacity, in much greater numbers, and I had not acted as I did, I think the public would have rightly said, 'Why on earth didn't that man in charge do something about it?',"" he said. In a bid to ease pressure on hospitals,17 field hospitals were rapidly built to provide 6,000 additional beds, doubling the Welsh NHS's capacity at the peak of the pandemic. It took just eight weeks to build those field hospitals, and two additional community step-down facilities for non-coronavirus patients. This video can not be played Cameras got a first look inside the field hospital at the Principality Stadium Since the Dragon's Heart Hospital at the Principality Stadium opened in April, 46 patients have been treated at the home of the Welsh Rugby Team, which is now empty and on standby in case of a second wave. No-one has been admitted to the other 16 locations around the country, including the 1,000-bed facility at Swansea Bay Studios and Venue Cymru in Llandudno, Conwy. A pre-recorded message from Prince Charles was played on a big screen during the opening ceremony at the Dragon's Heart field hospital Mr Gething said the Welsh Government had set up the hospitals after seeing how parts of the health service in Italy had been overwhelmed. A review is due later this month to decide how many field hospitals will be retained or repurposed. A health economist from Swansea University said that, in hindsight, spending Â£166m on 46 patients was ""not a good use of limited resources"". Prof Ceri Phillips said: ""Elective operations were cancelled, the level of demand was reduced, out-patients was reorganised so people weren't coming into hospital."" Wales' coronavirus field hospitals cost Â£166m Principality Stadium: Contract extended for coronavirus field hospital Mr Gething said it was possible ""fewer field hospitals"" would be needed in the coming months. ""It's also possible we can make more use of the current capacity we have as we restart more normal NHS activity,"" he added. Roy Thomas gave one of his buildings at Bay Studios to be used as a field hospital The owner of Swansea Bay Studios, Roy Thomas, signed a lease allowing the Welsh NHS to use the largest building on his site free of charge for a year to help tackle the virus. But Mr Thomas said the complex needed financial support to survive. He said: ""I see myself in next 12 months serving two masters. ""One is the health authority, to maintain whatever requirement they have 12 months in the future. and the other is to attempt to play my part in maintaining the filming industry for Neath Port Talbot, Swansea and west Wales."" Swansea Bay UHB's Chief Operating Officer, Chris White, said it was fortunate the beds at the two field hospitals had not been needed at the peak of the pandemic. But while cases have fallen, Mr White said it was important the field hospitals were ""ready in case we need them"". Wales' field hospitals doubled the capacity for the Welsh NHS during the pandemic Venue Cymru in Llandudno also faces financial challenges after giving over its building to create 350 extra beds for the Betsi Cadwaladr health board. The theatre and conference centre, which is owned by Conwy council, has a three-month contract to act as field hospital until 6 July. The deal, which is based on it having no financial impact on the local authority, will then be extended by agreement on a month-by-month basis. But Venue Cymru said it would need financial help to restart shows after the pandemic. Mark Wilkinson, from Betsi Cadwaladr health board, said the focus was now on how to ""resume services which had been put on hold to manage the initial wave of Covid-19 patients"". Bangor University agreed to a three-month minimum lease with the Welsh Government for the use of the Canolfan Brailsford sport centre at Bangor University, to be reviewed on a monthly basis after that. The Welsh Government review into field hospitals will look at how many extra beds the Welsh NHS might need if the transmission rate of coronavirus begins to rise towards a second peak. It will also examine whether the field hospitals can be used to help the resumption of medical services that were suspended while the NHS focussed on treating Covid-19 cases. The Dragon's Heart Hospital is the second biggest field hospital in the UK behind London's Nightingale hospital Cardiff and Vale The health board has said the Dragon's Heart Hospital site would be ""retained until the autumn and will be available to admit coronavirus patients should a surge in capacity be required"". The Welsh Rugby Union, who own the stadium, have said the contract for it to remain as a field hospital has been extended until early autumn. This video can not be played A sports centre in Bangor was turned into a field hospital - in just 16 days There are three field hospitals, Deeside Leisure Centre in Queensferry, Canolfan Brailsford sports hall at Bangor University and Venue Cymru in Llandudno. The three ""Rainbow hospitals"" are ""available and ready"" to accept patients but the health board said the focus is now to ""resume services that were put on hold to manage the initial wave of Covid-19 patients"". Parc y Scarlets in Llanelli is currently home to a makeshift hospital There are nine field hospitals here: Bluestone Wales resort in Pembrokeshire; the leisure centres in Cardigan, Carmarthen, Llanelli and Plas Crug (Aberystwyth); two at the Parc y Scarlets in Llanelli, one in the stadium and the other in the training 'barn'; the Selwyn Samuel Centre in Llanelli and Ysgol Penweddig in Aberystwyth. Hywel Dda health board said it was ""exploring many different options"" for the next 12 months including ""different uses of our facilities"" as part of national discussions. The WRU training facility at The Vale Resort, was turned into a field hospital to provide 290 extra beds Bridgend Industrial Estate is the only remaining field hospital in the region after it was announced the 290-bed hospital at the WRU's Centre of Excellence at Hensol was being decommissioned this week. The health board is also operating ""community step-down facilities"" Abergarw Manor in Bridgend and Marsh House in Merthyr Tydfil for non Covid-19 patients to move out of hospitals. Cwm Taf health board said field hospitals were ""essential to their planning"" so that extra capacity is in place ""should we need it to respond to the challenge of Covid-19"". The training base normally used by the Ospreys rugby squad was transformed into a hospital There are two field hospitals in the area, one at Llandarcy Academy of Sport (where the Ospreys rugby team usually train) and one at Swansea Bay Studios. Swansea Bay UHB's Chief Operating Officer Chris White said: ""Flexibility is an important factor in the management of the situation as we move into the next stages."" The new Grange Hospital as seen from the air last autumn - it could take its first patients a year early There are no official field hospitals here, although the health board has said the new Grange University Hospital in Cwmbran is ""ready if we need to use it.""

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson and Emmanuel Macron viewed documents and artefacts relating to General Charles de Gaulle Boris Johnson has met French President Emmanuel Macron in Downing Street to mark the 80th anniversary of a famous wartime broadcast. In 1940, French Resistance leader Charles de Gaulle used the BBC to send a radio message to Nazi-occupied France, urging people not to give up the struggle against Hitler. Mr Johnson praised the ""courage and sacrifice"" of those who fought on. The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall welcomed Mr Macron to the UK. And the Red Arrows and their French counterparts, La Patrouille, performed a flypast above London to mark the occasion. Prince Charles to welcome Macron to London PM had to soothe concerns over virus strategy New momentum needed in trade talks, say UK and EU Churchill statue uncovered ahead of Macron visit During their meeting, Mr Johnson and Mr Macron discussed post-Brexit trade arrangements between the UK and EU, with No 10 saying the prime minister ""welcomed the agreement to intensify talks in July"". The air display flew directly over Westminster and the recently-uncovered Winston Churchill statue A spokesperson added that he had restated that the UK ""does not believe it makes sense for there to be prolonged negotiations into the autumn"". The ""transition period"" - during which the UK remains in the EU single market and customs union - is due to finish at the end of the year. The two leaders also talked about easing the 14-day coronavirus quarantine measures in place for visitors to - and UK citizens returning to - the UK. Mr Macron was exempt from the requirements, as a ""representative of a foreign country on business"". The Red Arrows and La Patrouille flew over Buckingham Palace It was earlier announced that four surviving French Resistance fighters are to be appointed honorary MBEs. Edgard Tupet-Thome, 100, Daniel Bouyjou-Cordier, 99, Hubert Germain, 99, and Pierre Simonet, 98, are already members of the Order of Liberation, an honour given by France to those who played an outstanding role in freeing the country from its four-year wartime occupation. Mr Macron's visit also comes after it was announced that Dame Vera Lynn, the singer dubbed the ""forces' sweetheart"" for her morale-boosting performances during World War Two,has died aged 103. Social distancing was maintained during the French president's visit to London The two leaders viewed artefacts and letters from General de Gaulle's time in London and from his partnership with the UK's wartime prime minister, Sir Winston Churchill. Mr Johnson presented Mr Macron with a framed montage of a telegram sent from General de Gaulle to Sir Winston on VE Day, in 1945, and Sir Winston's reply. He also gave him a model of Sir Winston's open-top Land Rover and a photograph of General de Gaulle in Paris, shortly after the city's liberation from German forces in 1944. By Gavin Stamp, BBC News It was 80 years ago that General Charles de Gaulle broadcast a historic message from London to his fellow countrymen imploring them not to give up the fight against Hitler. France was on its knees at the time, German troops having entered Paris four days earlier, and on the verge of agreeing an armistice confirming its formal military surrender. In the message, broadcast in French, De Gaulle said: ""Whatever happens, the flame of the French resistance must not be extinguished and will not be extinguished."" Transmitted on the BBC's French Service, the broadcast was not recorded and relatively few people in France heard it. But a similar broadcast four days later on the same network reached a wider audience and went a long way to establishing de Gaulle as his country's leader in-exile. The 18th June 1940 remains one of the most important dates in UK-French history and still has enormous resonance on both sides of the channel. After the fall of France, General de Gaulle made a speech from London 18 June 1940. Known as the ""Appel"", or appeal, it rallied the country in support of the Resistance. This video can not be played When she was 21, Olivia Jordan found herself driving French resistance leader Charles de Gaulle around London Mr Macron, speaking next to General de Gaulle's statue in Carlton Gardens, in central London, said: ""This is where de Gaulle was able to call on the French people to join the Resistance, the soldiers of the shadows. ""Because 80 years ago today, on June 18 1940, the United Kingdom gave Free France its first weapon, a BBC microphone."" Emmanuel Macron laid a wreath at the statue of Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother Mr Johnson said General de Gaulle had arrived in 1940 knowing that Britain and France's shared values of ""freedom, tolerance and democracy"" were under threat and pledging to defend them. ""The struggles we face today are different to those we confronted together 80 years ago. But I have no doubt that - working side by side - the UK and France will continue to rise to every new challenge and seize every opportunity that lies ahead,"" he said.

Edgard Tupet-Thome, 100, Daniel Bouyjou-Cordier, 99, Hubert Germain, 99, and Pierre Simonet, 98, are already members of the Order of Liberation, an honour given by France to those who played an outstanding role in freeing the country from its four-year wartime occupation. Mr Macron's visit also comes after it was announced that Dame Vera Lynn, the singer dubbed the ""forces' sweetheart"" for her morale-boosting performances during World War Two,has died aged 103. Social distancing was maintained during the French president's visit to London The two leaders viewed artefacts and letters from General de Gaulle's time in London and from his partnership with the UK's wartime prime minister, Sir Winston Churchill. Mr Johnson presented Mr Macron with a framed montage of a telegram sent from General de Gaulle to Sir Winston on VE Day, in 1945, and Sir Winston's reply. He also gave him a model of Sir Winston's open-top Land Rover and a photograph of General de Gaulle in Paris, shortly after the city's liberation from German forces in 1944. By Gavin Stamp, BBC News It was 80 years ago that General Charles de Gaulle broadcast a historic message from London to his fellow countrymen imploring them not to give up the fight against Hitler. France was on its knees at the time, German troops having entered Paris four days earlier, and on the verge of agreeing an armistice confirming its formal military surrender. In the message, broadcast in French, De Gaulle said: ""Whatever happens, the flame of the French resistance must not be extinguished and will not be extinguished."" Transmitted on the BBC's French Service, the broadcast was not recorded and relatively few people in France heard it. But a similar broadcast four days later on the same network reached a wider audience and went a long way to establishing de Gaulle as his country's leader in-exile. The 18th June 1940 remains one of the most important dates in UK-French history and still has enormous resonance on both sides of the channel. After the fall of France, General de Gaulle made a speech from London 18 June 1940. Known as the ""Appel"", or appeal, it rallied the country in support of the Resistance. This video can not be played When she was 21, Olivia Jordan found herself driving French resistance leader Charles de Gaulle around London Mr Macron, speaking next to General de Gaulle's statue in Carlton Gardens, in central London, said: ""This is where de Gaulle was able to call on the French people to join the Resistance, the soldiers of the shadows. ""Because 80 years ago today, on June 18 1940, the United Kingdom gave Free France its first weapon, a BBC microphone."" Emmanuel Macron laid a wreath at the statue of Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother Mr Johnson said General de Gaulle had arrived in 1940 knowing that Britain and France's shared values of ""freedom, tolerance and democracy"" were under threat and pledging to defend them. ""The struggles we face today are different to those we confronted together 80 years ago. But I have no doubt that - working side by side - the UK and France will continue to rise to every new challenge and seize every opportunity that lies ahead,"" he said.

"Leaders of social services in England have said there will be ""catastrophic consequences"" without immediate investment in the sector. Councils could run out of cash and care providers could ""go to the wall"", a report by the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (ADASS) warns. It says increased costs due to Covid-19 have exacerbated an existing crisis. The government has given councils an extra Â£3.2bn to tackle the pandemic and Â£600m for care. The ADASS report warns that increased spending due to coronavirus - for example, on personal protective equipment (PPE), staffing costs and sickness cover - means some private care providers may go out of business. Virus costs add to residents' care home bills Coronavirus- Care home moves had 'tragic consequences' - BBC News Government sued over care home deaths 'disgrace' It haspreviously estimated that providers face potential additional costs of Â£6.6bnbetween April and September. Now the organisation is calling for a two-year ring-fenced funding settlement for adult social care and as well as reform of the sector, including better pay and conditions for care workers.

COMPARING COUNTRIES:The pitfalls of doing so R0, FURLOUGH:The language of the outbreak James Bullion, ADASS president, said the findings represent ""a wake-up call that requires a clear response"". ""Urgent action is needed to plug the financial black hole that has been blown in local government finances, to properly recognise and reward colleagues working in social care, stabilise providers of care and most importantly safeguard and ultimately enhance the care and support available to those of us who need it,"" he said. ""Without such action, local authorities will run out of money, care providers will go to the wall, many of us will not get the care and support we need, and the economy will take a further hit as more of us are forced to give up work to fill the caring gaps."" Local authorities have been given Â£3.2bn by the government to support their work during the pandemic, and there is a Â£600m infection-control fund for care homes. This month, the Department of Health and Social Care saidit would keep future funding needs under review, but would not confirm that it would provide more money to councils.

"Huawei poses challenges to national security and has engaged in unacceptable acts, Google's former boss Eric Schmidt has told the BBC. But he says the West should respond by competing with China and its technologies, rather than disengaging. Mr Schmidt now chairs the Pentagon's Defence Innovation Board. The UK is currently reviewing whether to continue letting Huawei help build its 5G mobile networks amid growing pressure to exclude the Chinese firm. ""There's no question that Huawei has engaged in some practices that are not acceptable in national security,"" Mr Schmidt told a BBC Radio 4 documentary. He said it was possible to think of the company as a means of ""signals intelligence"" - a reference to spy agencies like the UK's GCHQ or NSA in the US. ""There's no question that information from Huawei routers has ultimately ended up in hands that would appear to be the state,"" Mr Schmidt added. ""However that happened, we're sure it happened."" US-China row moves underwater in cable tangle Huawei has consistently denied accusations that it is an arm of the Chinese state, or passes on customer data to the authorities. ""The allegations made by Eric Schmidt, who now works for the US government, are simply not true and as with similar assertions in the past, are not backed by evidence,"" Victor Zhang, Huawei's UK chief told the BBC. ""Huawei is independent from any government, including the Chinese government. ""Where we do agree, and something we've always said, is that applying standards globally ensures innovation, fosters competition and benefits everyone."" Eric Schmidt says the real issue with Huawei lies in the challenge to US leadership it represents: a Chinese company operating on a global stage that is building a better product than its competitors. ""It's extremely important that we have choices,"" he told the BBC. ""The answer to Huawei... is to compete by having a product and product line that is as good."" The US has banned Huawei from using US chip technologies but is allowing American firms to work with the firm on 5G standards Eric Schmidt spent a decade and a half as chief executive and then executive chairman of Google and its parent company Alphabet. He acknowledges that over a long career in Silicon Valley, he had underestimated China's ability to innovate. ""I have carried the prejudices about China in my years working with them,"" he said. ""That they're very good at copying things, that they're very good at organising things, that they throw large numbers of people at it. But they're not going to do anything new. They're very, very good at stealing, if you will, our stuff. Those prejudices need to be thrown out. ""The Chinese are just as good, and maybe better, in key areas of research and innovation as the West. ""They're putting more money into it. They are putting it in a different way, it is state-directed in a way that is different from the West. We need to get our act together to compete."" He denies the Chinese model of state-directed investment in technology is intrinsically more successful than a free-market model. However, he believes the West needs to make the most of its strengths by: investing more in research funding ensuring greater collaboration between private sector, the state and academia remaining open to the best talent from around the world ""Most people would prefer to live and work in the West than work in China,"" he says. One of the problems in the US and particularly in Silicon Valley, Mr Schmidt believes, is a historical blindness to the role of the government in supporting research. ""Everything you see in Silicon Valley to the first order came from initial federal science grants of one kind or another."" Last year he chaired a US National Security Commission looking at artificial intelligence. China's advances in this field are a major concern. ""I would say they are a few years behind,"" he says. ""Not five years, and not 10 years. And there's evidence of China closing the gap in the next few years. ""So the question is: what happens then? Well obviously, artificial intelligence has military and national security applications."" China's work on quantum computing, he adds, is on a par with that of the West, and could even be ahead. Mr Schmidt joined Google in 2001 and gave up his final post as an advisor to the firm in February Mr Schmidt views the decoupling of the technology sectors in China and the US as ""undesirable"", believing it will lead to two distinct systems. ""Once you diverge these global platforms, you don't get them back,"" he says. ""We benefit from having a common platform of interchange... and I worry that by building these platforms separate, the countries will understand each other less. ""China's going to dominate whether we couple or decouple. They have the resources, they have the money, they have the technology. ""The question is do they operate on global platforms or do they operate on their own platforms? The more segregated the platforms are, the more dangerous it is. ""It is in the West's interest that every technology platform has Western values in them."" Huawei launches media blitz as UK weighs its role in 5G Senator tells MPs Huawei puts US troops at risk Huawei executive suffers US extradition blow Mr Schmidt is cautious about picking national champions and supporting them. But he says there are weaknesses in the West's own capacity, particularly in not having foundries that manufacture semiconductor chips. He says it would be better for China to use chips from Western companies rather than build its own. The rise of nationalism and protectionism around the world is of ""great concern"", he concludes, pointing to the fact that more than half of the start-ups in Silicon Valley have been founded by foreign-born nationals. Faced with a challenge from China, he draws on his own Silicon Valley experience. ""The best strategy is to think of it as a competition not unlike the tech companies, where there's brutal competition,"" he said. ""[It will be] as rough as it could be - largely unregulated between the various players - where we seek to win."" The New Tech Cold War will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 at 11:00 BST on Friday and again on Tuesday at 16:00 BST.

Six men have been arrested by police after two separate protest groups gathered in George Square. National Defence League supporters went to the square saying they wanted to ""make and stand"" and ""protect the Cenotaph"". Shortly afterwards activists from No Evictions Glasgow arrived for their planned demonstration. They chanted ""refugees are welcome here"" before leaving the square. Images on social media showed some protestors clashing with police. Both the first minister and Humza Yousaf, the Scottish justice secretary, used social media to condemn the scenes. The first minister tweeted,external: ""Disgraceful scenes in Glasgow tonight. Racist thugs shame Scotland. ""If they break the law, they should face the full force of it. And all of us should unite to say that welcoming refugees and asylum seekers is part of who we are."" Mr Yousaf said on Twitter thathe had been briefed on the incident by Police Scotland,external. ""Let's not mince our words, this has nothing to do with statues and everything to do with racist thuggery,"" he said. ""Police have made a number of arrests already and will continue to take all necessary action against those responsible."" Ahead of the protests, Ch Supt Mark Hargreaves urged people not to attend the events but follow government coronavirus lockdown guidelines. Afterwards, he said Police Scotland had an ""appropriate"" presence to ensure public safety. ""So far, six men have been arrested for minor public order offences and reports will be submitted to the procurator fiscal,"" he added. ""The majority of protesters have now left George Square and officers remain in the area for public reassurance.

Four of the protestors who were arrested said they were in the square to protect the statues, while the other two men said they were attending the protest calling for better housing for asylum seekers. Meanwhile, No Evictions Glasgow accused ""far-right groups"" of trying to ""hi-jack"" their peaceful protest.
