"A UK Covid vaccine booster scheme will take place and is likely to start next month, the health secretary has said. Sajid Javid said he was uncertain of the exact start date as the government was waiting for the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation's ""final advice"" before proceeding. Mr Javid added the ""most vulnerable"" would be offered the third jab first. However, it remains unclear whether the booster scheme will be for all adults, or just some, more vulnerable groups. Interim advice from the JCVI,released last month, suggested more than 30 million of the most vulnerable people - including all over-50s - should receive a third dose. Asked about the scheme on Thursday, Mr Javid said: ""We are going to have a booster scheme. It will start some time in September. ""I couldn't tell you exactly when because before we start it... we need to get the final advice from our group of experts, our independent scientific and medical advisers, the JCVI, and so we're waiting for their final opinion."" How many people have been vaccinated so far? Oxford-jab chief criticises UK's Covid booster plan Who still has to self-isolate? Earlier in the day, Prof Adam Finn told the BBC that the JCVI, of which he is a member, would be ""imminently deciding"" that some people ""will need a third dose, particularly people who we know are very unlikely to be well protected by those first two doses"". ""But I think we do need more evidence before we can make a firm decision on a much broader booster programme,"" he added. The health secretary says ""a"" booster campaign will take place, but the more important question is ""who"" will be boosted. We still don't know. There are scientific and ethical arguments about a booster campaign. For some there is a clear benefit - particularly those with weakened immune systems in whom it takes three doses to do the job of two. But for the rest of the population, the evidence so far shows two doses are providing lasting protection from becoming seriously ill and needing hospital treatment. Whether a mass vaccination campaign is necessary or should be far more targeted is the subject of intense debate. This comes at a time that rich countries are being accused of giving vaccines to people at little risk from Covid and that would save far more lives if they were shared with the world. About 70% of the entire UK population has had at least one jab. In the poorest countries that figure is about 1%. The announcement comes after it was revealed more than 125,000 16 and 17-year-olds in England have had the vaccine in the two weeks since the NHS was given approval to offer that age group a jab. In total, 47,460,526 first doses have now been given across the UK, while 41,157,069 people have had two doses. But the decision to offer people in the UK a third jab is not without controversy. Immunologist Prof Peter Openshaw, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), which advises the government, said the ""question about boosters is a contentious one"". He said studies into the effectiveness of booster schemes were still ongoing and ""everyone is very keen that if we do have surplus vaccines, that they're not necessarily used in this country, but might be sent overseas"". This video can not be played Immunologist Prof Peter Openshaw: ""The question of boosters is a contentious one"" And, earlier this month, the head of the Oxford Vaccine Group said doses needed to ""go where they can have the greatest impact"" - to protect unvaccinated people abroad. Prof Sir Andrew Pollard, who led the team that created the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, said decisions on whether to give boosters ""should be scientifically driven"". Asked whether the JCVI had concerns about plans for the booster scheme, Mr Javid said: ""It's only with their expert advice that government would want to continue with their plans. ""I don't want to prejudge what they're going to say but, based on their interim advice, I think we can be confident that we will start a booster scheme next month.""

"The subscription site OnlyFans, known for its adult content, has announced it will block sexually explicit photos and videos from 1 October. People will still be able to post nude content on the site. But this will need to be consistentwith OnlyFans' policies.,external The announcement comes after BBC News had approached the company for a response toleaked documents concerning accounts which posted illegal content. OnlyFans said the change had come after pressure from banking partners. The site has grown during the pandemic and says it has 130 million users. ""In order to ensure the long-term sustainability of our platform, and continue to host an inclusive community of creators and fans, we must evolve our content guidelines,"" OnlyFans said in a statement. The children selling explicit videos on OnlyFans Under the skin of OnlyFans Model Demi Rose: 'I'm finally taking control' The London-based social media site enables its creators to post nude videos and photos and charge subscribers for tips or a monthly fee. Creators can post a range of content from cooking to fitness videos, but it is best known for pornography. In return for hosting the material, OnlyFans takes a 20% share of all payments. The documents - described as ""compliance manuals"" - show that although illegal content itself is removed, OnlyFans lets moderators give creators multiple warnings before closing accounts. Moderation specialists and child protection experts say this shows OnlyFans has some ""tolerance"" for accounts posting illegal content. In response to the BBC's investigation, OnlyFans said the documents are not manuals or ""official guidance"", it does not tolerate violations of its terms of service, and its systems and age verification go far beyond ""all relevant global safety standards and regulations"". The site, founded in 2016 by Essex businessman Tim Stokely, has come under fire in the pastafter a BBC News investigationfound under-18s had used fake identification to set up accounts on the site. In June, BBC News found that under-18s sold explicit videos on the site, despite it being illegal for people to share indecent images of children. After the BBC investigation, the children's commissioner for England said OnlyFans needed to do more to stop underage users. In response to the investigation, OnlyFans said it had closed the accounts flagged and refunded all active subscriptions.

"Supermarket group Morrisons has accepted an improved Â£7bn takeover bid from US private equity group Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R). Morrisons had previously recommended investors accept a Â£6.7bn offer from a consortium led by another US-based investment group, Fortress. Fortress said it was ""considering its options"", amid signs shareholders think the battle is not over. Morrisons shares opened up on Friday, a signal investors expect another bid. The retailer, which has almost 500 shops and more than 110,000 staff, has been at the centre of a takeover battle for weeks. Fortress has urged Morrisons' shareholders to ""take no action"" on CD&R's agreed bid, which will require their approval at a meeting in October. In July Morrisons turned down an offer worth Â£5.5bn from CD&R, saying it significantly undervalued the business. Morrisons bid rival to make property sale pledge Morrisons to give workers Boxing Day off But the grocer's board unanimously accepted the new offer, which represents a 60% premium to Morrisons' share price before takeover interest emerged in mid June. Morrison shares rose 4.4% following the announcement to 291.4p per share. Nicholas Hyett, Equity Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that although the new offer has the backing of Morrisions' management, ""this might not be the end of the story"". He said: Rival bidder Fortress has urged investors to hold fire on accepting the deal and are expected to make a further statement in due course. With the shares currently trading above the new and improved offer price, the market clearly thinks a better offer is a distinct possibility."" Morrisons was founded in Bradford in 1899 - where it still has its headquarters. The founder William Morrison's son, the late Sir Ken Morrison, ran the business for fifty years. CD&R said it recognises the ""legacy of Sir Ken Morrison, Morrisons' history and culture, and considers that this strong heritage is core to Morrisons and its approach to grocery retailing"". The private equity firm said it would help Morrisons to build on its strengths, including its close relationships with suppliers and property portfolio. Morrisons chairman Andrew Higginson said the offer ""represents good value for shareholders while at the same time protecting the fundamental character of Morrisons for all stakeholders"". Over the last 10 years, CD&R has been advised by Sir Terry Leahy, who was the boss of Tesco at the time when Mr Higginson worked for him as chief financial officer. Morrisons' chief operating officer, Trevor Strain, also previously worked with Sir Terry at Tesco. Sir Terry also advised CD&R on its acquisition of discount retailer B&M, which netted the private equity firm an estimated profit of Â£1bn when it sold it on. The future of the UK's fourth largest supermarket has taken a new twist. Morrisons is one of a slew of UK companies that have been targeted by overseas investors. Defence contractors Meggit and Ultra are also the subject of bidding wars. The numbers are startling. Even before you count Morrisons, Meggit and Ultra - foreign, private buyers have spent more buying UK listed companies in the last eight months than they have in the last five years combined. UK companies look cheap to foreign buyers. The UK economy was one of the hardest hit by the pandemic - and the value of the pound has never quite recovered its pre-Brexit value which reduces the price of UK businesses for non-UK investors. Some say that these bids highlight the value of - and confidence in - UK plc. But others are concerned that private buyouts increase debt levels, reduce transparency and mean that key decisions about the future of UK companies like Morrisons could be taken in New York rather than Bradford. The UK government has already asked the Competition and Markets Authority to review the bid for submarine technology specialist Ultra on grounds of National Security andit may yet intervene in the takeover bid for aerospace specialist Meggitt. There is also legislation planned to expand its powers to intervene and increase the scrutiny of privately held companies but for now there is a rush to the checkout for important chunks of UK PLC.

"This video can not be played Ben Wallace: ""Every hour counts"" of Kabul evacuation No plane carrying Britons and Afghans from Kabul has left empty, the UK defence secretary has said. Ben Wallace rejected reports that some flights from Kabul contained only a few people, saying the UK was ""absolutely ploughing through the numbers"". He told BBC Breakfast ""every hour counts"" and confirmed ""the Taliban are letting our people through"". But Taliban checkpoints ring the perimeter of the airport and chaotic scenes have been unfolding outside. About 4,500 US troops are in temporary control of Karzai International Airport,with about 900 British soldiers also on patrol at the siteas part of efforts to secure the evacuation flights. The Taliban are blocking Afghans without travel documents from entering. Twelve people have been killed in and around Kabul airport since Sunday, according to a Taliban official quoted by the Reuters news agency. But even those with valid papers have struggled to get to the airport, with reports that some have been beaten by Taliban guards. An Afghan interpreter who worked for the British army said he received permission to come to the UK last week, butwas now in hidingand would ""face death"" if the Taliban found him. Biden says no American will be left behind in Kabul Interpreter who worked for UK begs PM for help How many Afghan asylum seekers has the UK taken in? Chaos at Kabul airport amid scramble to evacuate Gharghasht Hidai, a British Afghan, said there was shooting at the airport as he and his family prepared to leave. ""The situation was chaotic"", he said, with one of his children having to sit on the floor of the packed RAF plane. ""We are the lucky ones, we made it."" Gharghasht Hidai and his family have fled Afghanistan and are quarantining in Manchester Peymana Assad, a London councillor who was visiting relatives in Kabul, saidshe joined hundreds of people walking along the traffic-jammed road to the airportto escape - only to find she reached the UK meeting point too late. Ms Assad, who had previously left Afghanistan as a three-year-old refugee, said a local family allowed her to wait at their home until she could contact the Foreign Office and arrange to join a later RAF evacuation flight. A British medical student, another former refugee who returned to Kabul in July to get married, spoke to the PA news agency on Thursday as he tried for a fourth time to get to the airport. On a previous attempt, he said he waited for 10 hours but could not get past the crowds to reach the airport gate. This time, he said there were gunshots being fired and people trying to flee. The defence secretary said the UK would continue to stay in Afghanistan as long as the US ran the airport, but said the government was also already investing in ""third country hubs"" for processing people ""if they get out to other countries in the region"". It's now a race against the clock to get as many people out of Kabul as possible. The BBC has been told there are several thousand UK nationals and dual passport holders who still need to get out of the country. Eight RAF flights went in and out of Kabul yesterday with a similar number expected today. They have the capacity to fly more than 1,000 people a day. But the BBC understands that not all flights have been full. The airport is operating to a strict schedule. That means aircraft can't just wait around until all their seats are filled. Most are being flown to a Middle East hub. Commercial charters are being used to make the onward journey. The greatest challenge at present appears to be processing the people who qualify to be flown out. One person who's trying to get people out told the BBC the ""system is working, but it's slow"". Those wishing to fly out are being told to wait for a phone call before setting out for the airport - not least to avoid the risks of travelling through a city under Taliban control. At some stage someone will have to make the decision to leave. That will once again be the decision of the US, which is providing the bulk of the security at the airport as well as overseeing Air Traffic Control. They too need to be flown out. Mr Wallace said seven to 10 RAF planes were taking off every day, with at least 138 due on the next flight out. He said the passengers on the flights out of Afghanistan this week had included British government personnel, British citizens, media and human rights staff and Afghans who had worked for the UK. Downing Street said military flights took about 1,200 people out of Kabul between Saturday and 08:00 BST on Wednesday, about 900 of whom were Afghan nationals and the remainder British citizens. Since late June, 2,000 Afghans who worked for the UK have been resettled with their families under the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (ARAP), according to the Home Office, with a target of 5,000 by the end of 2021. This video can not be played This plane from Kabul, carrying Afghans and British nationals, landed at a Midlands Airport on Wednesday The UK has also committed to take in up to 20,000 Afghan refugees over the next few years under a separate resettlement scheme - including 5,000 this year. Two evacuation flights came into the UK on Wednesday, the Ministry of Defence said - a military plane into RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire and a passenger plane into an unnamed civilian airport. On board were Afghans being relocated under the ARAP scheme for those who worked with the British military, British citizens and some other foreign nationals. The MoD did not provide exact numbers but said each flight could hold about 250 passengers. Mr Wallace said a plane left Kabul on Thursday morning carrying ""115 people and their families - those are the Afghans on there as opposed to other personnel"". He added: ""None of our planes are leaving empty... our planes never leave empty. If we have spaces on them, we offer them up to other nations."" Downing Street said the UK helped to fly 76 Australians out of Afghanistan on an RAF plane on Wednesday. British nationals and Afghan evacuees depart a flight from Afghanistan at RAF Brize Norton on 17 August 2021 He said: ""We have a full programme today of many more people coming out - trying to reach our... capability towards the end of the month. And that is so far on track.... we are doing it as fast as we can."" Mr Wallace said many of the flights were at full capacity. ""You and I wouldn't be allowed to fly some of the way those planes are flying in safety, so we are taking considerable risk"", he said, adding: ""Alongside those people will be troops or others coming in and out."" The defence secretary said additional UK troops would be deployed to Afghanistan to help manage public order on the ground at Kabul airport. Meanwhile, Labour has accused Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab of putting interpreters' lives at risk after he declined to phone the Afghan foreign minister to get help for the evacuation. The BBC has been told the call was made by a junior minister instead. ButMr Wallace said ""the only thing that mattered""was whether Kabul airport would continue to allow people to get out, telling BBC Breakfast: ""No amount of phone calls to an Afghan government at that time would have made any difference.""

"As thousands of citizens and foreign nationals attempt to flee Afghanistan, scenes outside Kabul airport have become increasingly desperate. Since the Taliban took control of the country at the weekend and closed land border crossings, the capital's airport has become the only way out of the country for many. But the militants have said they don't want Afghans to leave the country. They have set up checkpoints on Airport Road - shown in yellow, below - the main route to Hamid Karzai International Airport, and have attacked people. The violence has left 12 people in the area, dead - killed by gunshots or in stampedes - since Sunday, an anonymous Taliban official told Reuters news agency, meaning the journey to the airport is an increasingly treacherous one. Inside the walls of the airport compound, more than 4,000 US troops are in temporary control. Outside, heavily-armed Taliban fighters now ring the perimeter, generating an atmosphere of fear. Taliban fighters have control of the exterior of the airport The militants are reportedly preventing Afghans - including some of those with visas - from getting to the tarmac. But even before people fleeing reach the edge of the airport, they are being attacked en route, witnesses say. A correspondent for the LA Times newspaper saw dozens of Taliban firing into the air, aiming weapons at crowds and using sticks and rope to lash civilians as they tried to make their escape.Graphic images,externalcaptured by Marcus Yam show at least one woman hurt and a young child left bloodied with what appears to be a head injury. A woman was injured on her way to the airport Photos published by SBS showed an Afghan interpreter, who appeared to have been attacked, being treated for a gunshot wound. Crowds have also been gathering along the airport's perimeter to the north of the city - seen in the map above - over the past few days, with reports of a stampede injuring 17 people on Wednesday. Many have been trying to climb over barbed wire fences and there are reports of shots being fired. People have been scaling the boundary wall of Hamid Karzai International Airport Among the crowds are families with children, many of whom have not had access to food and drink for days, reporters on the ground say. Footage shared on social media showed children being passed over a wall to foreign soldiers in the hope they might be able to escape. This video can not be played A child is handed over the wall at Kabul airport, as the chaos continues One girl in a pink jacket was hoisted aloft to a soldier on a ladder. A number of children have been seen being helped over walls at Kabul airport The chaotic conditions emerged as European governments rushed to bring home their citizens - as well as Afghan colleagues. Afghan families have been seeking sanctuary with foreign troops Although the Taliban have said Afghans should stay in the country they have also claimed they are facilitating a safe exit for both foreigners and locals. ""We are preventing any form of violent, verbal clash at the airport among Afghans, foreigners and Taliban members,"" an official said. The latest reports of Taliban violence and harassment come asa confidential UN document, seen by the BBC, says the militants are intensifying their hunt for people who worked for and collaborated with Nato and US forces. The crush of people heading for the airport can be seen in satellite images of the area, with thousands converging in vehicles as they desperately tried to escape.

"Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhundzada is a political and religious leader who is the third Supreme Commander of the Taliban The Taliban took many by surprise as they swept across Afghanistan in just 10 days in August, quickly taking control of towns and cities. The militant group has announced an interim government, declaring the country an ""Islamic Emirate"". The cabinet will be led by Mullah Mohammad Hassan Akhund, one of the movement's founders. So, here's what is known about who is leading the Taliban today. PROFILE: Who are the Taliban? EXPLAINER: Ten days that shook Afghanistan VOICES: Uncertain times ahead for Afghan women Hibatullah Akhundzada became the supreme commander of the Taliban in May 2016, and is now leader of the so-called Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. In the 1980s, he participated in the Islamist resistance against the Soviet military campaign in Afghanistan, but his reputation is more that of a religious leader than a military commander. Akhundzada worked as head of the Sharia Courts in the 1990s. After first seizing power in the 1990s, the Taliban introduced and supported punishments according to their strict interpretation of Islamic law: they publicly executed murderers and adulterers and amputated thieves' limbs. Under the leadership of the reclusive Mullah Mohammed Omar (who is thought to have died in 2013), the Taliban also banned television, music, movies, make-up, and stopped girls aged 10 and over from attending school. Very few images exist of former Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar, who died in 2013 Akhundzada is believed to be in his 60s and has lived most of his life in Afghanistan. However, according to experts, he maintains close ties with the so-called ""Quetta Shura"" - the Afghan Taliban leaders said to be based in the Pakistani city of Quetta. As the group's supreme commander, Akhundzada is in charge of political, military and religious affairs. Mullah Mohammad Hassan Akhund is one of the four men who founded the Taliban in Afghanistan in 1994. He is a longtime head the Taliban's powerful leadership council, or Rehbari Shura. He served as foreign minister and deputy prime minister during the Taliban's rule in Afghanistan in 1996-2001. He is under UN sanctions for his role in the government during that period. Sirajuddin Haqqani is another of the group's top figures, who is on an FBI most wanted list. After the death of his father, Jalaluddin Haqqani, he became the new leader of the Haqqani network, which has been credited with some of the most violent attacks that have occurred in Afghanistan against Afghan forces and their Western allies in recent years. The Haqqani network is currently one of the region's most powerful and feared militant groups. Some say it is even more influential than the Islamic State group in Afghanistan. The Haqqani network is currently one of the most powerful and feared militant groups in the country The group, designated by the US as a terrorist organisation, oversees the Taliban's financial and military assets along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Haqqani is believed to be around 45. Inan opinion piece in the New York Times,externallast year before the signing of the Doha agreement, Haqqani wrote: ""For more than four decades, precious Afghan lives have been lost every day. Everyone has lost somebody they loved. Everyone is tired of war. I am convinced that the killing and the maiming must stop."" Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar is a Taliban co-founder. He became a lynchpin of the insurgency after the militants were toppled by the US-led invasion in 2001. But he was captured in a joint US-Pakistani operation in the southern Pakistani city of Karachi in February 2010. He remained in prison for eight years, until he was released as part of a plan to facilitate the peace process. He has been the head of their political office in Qatar since January 2019. In 2020, Baradar became the first Taliban leader to communicate directly with a US president after having a telephone conversation with Donald Trump. Before that,Baradar signed the Doha agreementon the withdrawal of US troops on behalf of the Taliban. Then US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Abdul Ghani Baradar met in September 2020 in Doha Mohammad Yaqoob is the son of the founder of the Taliban, Mullah Mohammed Omar. He is believed to be little more than 30 years old and is currently the leader of the group's military operations. Following the death of former Taliban leader Akhtar Mansour in 2016, some militants wanted to appoint Yaqoob as the group's new supreme commander, but others felt that he was young and lacking in experience. As the Taliban advanced through the country, Yaqoob urged Taliban fighters not to harm members of the Afghan military or government and tostay out of abandoned homes of government and security officials who had fled,external, according to the Associated Press news agency.

"Multiple Capitol Hill office buildings have reportedly been evacuated A man has been arrested after making a bomb threat near the Congress building in Washington DC. The man, identified as Floyd Ray Roseberry, 49, surrendered hours after the threat was made. US Capitol Police had been negotiating with the driver who had parked a pick-up truck near the Library of Congress, across the street from the Capitol building and Supreme Court. His motives remain unknown. Police are still searching the vehicle. Congress is currently in recess, but some staff are working in the Capitol. Several office buildings were evacuated. Videos purporting to be the man livestreaming from the vehicle have been shared on social media.  Facebook has deactivated the livestream and removed the profile. In the video, the man addressed US President Joe Biden directly and spoke of revolution. Mr Roseberry had parked the vehicle on a pavement and told an officer who approached him that he had a bomb, while holding what appeared to be a detonator, Capitol Police Chief J Thomas Manger told a news conference. Police communicated with Mr Roseberry via a white board and used a robot to deliver him a telephone, which he did not use, Chief Manger said. Mr Roseberry then stepped out of the vehicle and surrendered. ""He gave up and did not resist and our folks were able to take him into custody without incident,"" Chief Manger said. Police said they discovered possible bomb-making materials in the vehicle, but no bomb. Two law enforcement sources, who requested anonymity, told the Reuters news agency that it appeared Mr Roseberry had acted alone. Federal agents raided Mr Roseberry's home in Grover, North Carolina, during the standoff. Neighbours told Reuters that Mr Roseberry is a Republican who had been seen wearing a ""MAGA"" cap to show his support for former President Donald Trump.

"Emergency services were called to the OYO Sheffield Metropolitan Hotel on Wednesday afternoon A five-year-old Afghan refugee who fell to his death from a Sheffield hotel window has been identified by police. It is reported Mohammed Munib Majeedi fell from a ninth-floor room where he was staying with his mother. Emergency services were called to the OYO Metropolitan Hotel in Blonk Street, Sheffield, at about 14:30 BST on Wednesday. A fellow Afghan staying in the hotel said Mohammed's family arrived in the UK 15 days ago. It is understood they were relocated to the UK as part of the Afghan Relocation and Assistance Policy (ARAP) scheme. The man, who worked as an interpreter for the British Army in Afghanistan, said one of his children alerted him to the boy falling and he went outside to help. More stories from Yorkshire He was later asked to accompany Mohammed's mother to hospital to translate. He said everyone in the hotel had been left shocked by the incident. ""They are so upset, they are so unhappy,"" he said. ""Everybody, if you want to talk to them, they have no time because they are so bad, in a bad condition."" South Yorkshire Police said it was not treating the death as suspicious Another Afghan resident said he was in his room when he heard the boy fall. ""His mother was in the room with him,"" he said. ""She was screaming, 'my son, my son'. When I came here [outside] I saw the ambulance and police here."" He added: ""They came here to save their lives, they came for a new life here, but unfortunately..."" The man said the eight to 10 Afghan families staying at the hotel were being moved to another hotel on Thursday afternoon. This is a tragic case. A five-year-old boy, only just been evacuated from Afghanistan with his four siblings and parents, has died after falling from a hotel window. We understand Mohammed's father worked for the British Embassy in Afghanistan and had travelled to the UK under the government's scheme to resettle interpreters and support staff whose lives may be at risk from the Taliban. Once in the UK however, the Home Office is struggling to find accommodation for refugees - many of whom are large families. It's understood the Home Office was directly managing the now empty hotel at the time of the incident. There had been concerns raised about the safety of the windows. I'm told some people had been moved out, but the Home Office denies this. The housing group Mears was looking after the hotel until a few months ago, but safety concerns saw it withdraw to another nearby hotel. What has happened here, therefore, raises some serious questions about what steps were taken to ensure the hotel was safe for vulnerable families and young children and about the state of accommodation being provided to asylum seekers. The Home Office said: ""We are extremely saddened by the tragic death of a child at a hotel in Sheffield. ""The police are providing support to the family while the investigation continues and we cannot comment further at this time."" South Yorkshire Police said: ""We can confirm that the five-year-old boy who sadly lost his life is from Afghanistan."" It said Mohammed's death was not being treated as suspicious and his family was being supported by officers. The force has appealed for anyone who witnessed the incident to contact them. Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: ""This a terrible tragedy and our thoughts are with the family who have gone through so much trauma and suffering to reach the UK. ""It is vital the Home Office carry out an urgent investigation into what has happened so steps can be taken to quickly learn lessons. ""We don't know the details of the incident but it is imperative that families who come from Afghanistan are given all the support they need and housed in appropriate accommodation. They are vulnerable and often very traumatised."" Sheffield City Council leader Terry Fox said: ""This is absolutely devastating, just so incredibly sad. ""As a council we are in close contact with the police and will provide any support that we can to the family - my heart goes out to them.""

"Jared O'Mara served as MP for Sheffield Hallam from June 2017 to November 2019 Former Sheffield Hallam MP Jared O'Mara has been charged with seven counts of fraud. South Yorkshire Police said the charges related to a number of alleged fraudulent expenses claims. Mr O'Mara, 39, is charged alongside former aide Gareth Arnold, who faces six counts of fraud, and a third man, John Woodliff, who faces a single charge under the Proceeds of Crime Act. They will appear before magistrates in Sheffield on 24 September. The offences are said to have occurred between October 2018 and February 2020. The force said the charges brought against Mr O'Mara, of Walker Close, Sheffield, related to expenses claims submitted to the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority. In total he faces seven counts of fraud and one count of entering into an arrangement which facilitates the acquisition, retention, use or control of criminal property by another, the force said. Mr Arnold, 28, of Hunter House Road, Sheffield, faces six counts of fraud while Mr Woodliff, 42, of Dunninc Terrace, Sheffield, faces one count of entering into an arrangement which facilitates the acquisition, retention, use or control of criminal property by another.

"This video can not be played Afghan interpreter who worked for UK begs PM for ""pathway to safety"" An Afghan interpreter who worked for the British army has begged the UK government to evacuate him and his family from Afghanistan. Ahmed - not his real name - said he received permission to come to the UK last week, but a day later the Taliban seized control of the capital, Kabul. He said he was now in hiding and would ""face death"" if the Taliban found him. UK troops are continuing to evacuate British nationals and Afghans who are eligible to resettle in the UK. Afghan interpreters and others who worked for the UK government can come to the UK as part of the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (ARAP). However,chaotic scenes have been reported outside Kabul international airportwith access to it being controlled by Taliban militants, who are reportedly not permitting Afghans without documents or passports to enter. How many Afghan asylum seekers has the UK taken in? Johnson attacked from all sides over Afghanistan Patel: I don't believe Taliban on women's rights Ahmed, who worked with British troops for three years, told the BBC he was initially rejected for the ARAP scheme in April. He appealed against the decision and last week received an email saying he was eligible for relocation. He woke the next morning to find Kabul was under the Taliban flag. He said that he had been left stuck in a ""horrible"" situation. ""Life has ended for us when Kabul collapsed, we are just left behind in a dark room,"" he said. Ahmed worked for three years with British troops - who he describes as ""his brothers"" There are fears that Afghans who worked with Western authorities or groups could be at higher risk of reprisals from the Taliban.The group has denied this,but Ahmed said he did not believe them. ""Taliban are not trustableâ¦ if they find me, there will be no mercy,"" he said. ""I have done a lot of patrols, missions, shoulder to shoulder with British armies, like a family, like a brother. ""It's a major threat for me if I go out, they know me. There will be no mercy and I will face death."" Ahmed said that when he worked with UK soldiers, the Taliban used to target interpreters as they were the ""eyes and ears"" of the forces. Asked what he would say to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson about his family's situation, he said: ""I just want him to provide a pathway to safety for me and my family. I beg him."" British nationals and Afghan evacuees have been arriving on RAF planes at Brize Norton Half a dozen flights are due to arrive in the UK from Afghanistan in the next day or so, according to the Ministry of Defence. One landed at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire in the early hours of Thursday morning. No details were given about how many people were on board, or who they were. Downing Street however did not deny a report that one plane had taken off ""almost empty"" on Wednesday morning because people could not get through the airport. The British ambassador to Afghanistan, Sir Laurie Bristow, said Foreign Office personnel were hoping to get ""at least"" 1,000 people out of the country every day - but warned there were ""days, not weeks"" left to complete the mission. About 2,000 Afghan former staff and their families have come to the UK via ARAP this year, according to the Home Office, with a target of 5,000 by the end of 2021. The UK government has alsocommitted to take in up to 20,000 Afghan refugees over the next few yearsunder a new resettlement scheme - including 5,000 this year. Downing Street said the government would be encouraging international partners to emulate ""one of the most generous asylum schemes in British history"". However, shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy was critical of the new scheme, telling BBC's Question Time it was ""absolutely clear that 5,000 is too small a number over the next 12 months"" and called for a ""more generous offer"" to be made. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab is due to speak on Thursday with fellow G7 ministers - which includes the US, Canada, Japan, Germany, France and Italy, along with the UK - to discuss international co-operation. The G7 leaders are also set to hold a virtual meeting next week. On Wednesday,Mr Johnson faced a barrage of criticism from MPsacross the political spectrum over the UK's role in Afghanistan, in an emergency House of Commons debate on the crisis. The prime minister also spoke with his Italian counterpart Mario Draghi as he continued his efforts to bring the G7 together on its Afghanistan position.

"After being accused of spreading right-wing content, Facebook has revealed that its most-viewed posts include asking if sugar goes with spaghetti. Its first-ever report on the contents of people's news feeds in the United States focuses on how many people see a post rather than any other measurement. It shows a word search promising to reveal ""your reality"" was the most popular post for three months in 2021. Similarly frivolous question posts with giant text formed most of the top 20. ""Please settle this debate, does sugar go in spaghetti?"" placed fourth, with 58.6 million views - and 3.8 million arguments in the comments. The most-seen Facebook post in the US between April and June was this ""personality"" word search ""I'm old but I look young challenge. Drop a pic 30 and up"" rose to a lofty second. Nearly five million people obliged. But arguably the Facebook page ""The typical mom"" came out on top, as the only one with two posts in the top 20: ""Date yourself by naming one concert you have attended"" and ""what happens in your head when you add 28 plus 47?"" Facebook noted that ""some of the posts in the top 20 may contain lower-quality content"". The report attempts to draw a distinction between what is seen most, detailed in this report,,externaland what is engaged with most through likes, comments, and shares. It serves as a counterpoint to data gathered with Crowdtangle, Facebook's engagement-measuring tool, whichsuggests that right-leaning political content is dominant on Facebook,,externalan allegation which was widely reported last year. Facebook has fiercely pushed back against that idea, saying that only 6% of content seen by users is political. Facebook and academics row over data access Facebook to stop recommending political groups In its November post on the issue,,externalit focused on the ""reach"" of links and posts, instead of engagement, which dramatically changes what is ""most popular"". The new report similarly focuses on most-viewed content rather than any other metric, and the resulting list is made up of harmless posts. It looked at content between April and June, and only examined the US. It also discarded views from paid ads to ""boost"" a post, Facebook said. So much content is posted to Facebook that, added together, the top 20 posts still only accounted for ""for less than one-tenth of a per cent of all US content views"", the social network said. Two posts were notable for being substantially different from the rest of the top 20 - a post by Joe Biden, 100 days into his presidency, in which he wrote that ""America is getting back on track"" (number six), and a video from 5-Minute Crafts on how to build a small paddling pool (number 10). While most of the top posts seemed to be engagement-chasing question posts, not everything in the report pointed in that direction. Facebook has, for example, long argued that it drives substantial traffic to news organisations,despite a sometimes frosty relationship between publishers and the tech giantin recent years. While YouTube, Amazon, and children's charity Unicef were the top three most-seen sites though links, five major organisations - ABC News, the Daily Mail, NBC News, CNN, and CBS News - made it into the top 20 domains. The most-seen links are more varied. The single most-viewed one was for an obscure Green Bay Packers American football team site. Next down the list was a seller of CBD - a cannabis extract, while a Christian clothing firm and a local Virginia radio station also featured.

"More than 125,000 16 and 17-year-olds in England have had a Covid vaccine in the two weeks since the NHS was given the green light to offer them a jab One of the scientists advising the government on fighting the Covid pandemic says a decision on a booster jab programme is imminent It has yet to be decided who would be the first to get a third jab but a meeting is being held this morning Having two Covid vaccine doses remains the best way to protect against the Delta variant, a large study concludes The number of patients in hospital with Covid is at its highest level in five months, with 6,321 in the latest count taken earlier this week A first Covid case has been detected in the Tokyo Paralympics village, just days before the Games are due to start Edited by Chris Clayton Today's live page is coming to a close now. Thank you for
joining us. It was brought to you by John Hand, Chris Clayton, Alex Therrien,
Jo Couzens and James Clarke. Weâll be ending our live coverage for today shortly but,
before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main coronavirus headlines from the
UK and around the world: The World Health Organization (WHO) has called on countries to ensure that health services across Afghanistan are maintained, as it warned of increasing cases of Covid-19 across the country. The organisation's regional director, Dr Ahmed Al-Mandhari, said that WHO teams in areas which had seen large influxes of people fleeing the Taliban advance are now reporting increasing cases of people with Covid-like symptoms. According to the WHO, there have been 152,365 cases of coronavirus in the country and 7,043 deaths. However, Afghanistan has limited testing capacity and reporting of cases across the country is sketchy. A survey conducted by the Ministry of Health last year estimated that as many as 10 million Afghans - or 31.5% of the population - may have contracted the virus. WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic also warned that the chaos at Kabul airport, where thousands of people are trying to flee the Taliban, is slowing deliveries of crucial medical supplies. Refugees at the airport are being tested for the virus before boarding evacuation flights. The UK is to get a vaccine booster scheme from September, the health secretary says. Sajid Javid made the comment after the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) met earlier today to discuss a potential Covid-19 booster campaign for people who need a third dose. He said: ""We are going to have a booster scheme. It will start some time in September. ""I couldn't tell you exactly when because before we start it... we need to get the final advice from our group of experts, our independent scientific and medical advisers, the JCVI, and so we're waiting for their final opinion."" But the health secretary says he is ""confident we can start in September"" offering a third jab to the most vulnerable people. He adds that the government will only want to continue with their plans on the expert advice of the JCVI. ""I don't want to prejudge what they're going to say but, based on their interim advice, I think we can be confident that we will start a booster scheme next month."" Read morehere. The number of pregnant women in England taking
up the Covid vaccine rose in the last two weeks
of July. More than 10,000 women who are pregnant, or believe they could be, have come forward to receive their first dose, according
to the latest data from Public Health England. It means 62,311 pregnant women have
now had a jab, including 43,737 who have had two doses. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisations at PHE, said:âIt
is encouraging that thousands of women have now benefited from the vital
protection of a Covid-19 vaccine. However, many more may remain unvaccinated and we
urge them to take up the offer.â PHE says Covid vaccines
are safe for pregnant women, and they should get the jab to protect themselves and their babies.
Covid-19 can cause serious complications in the later stages of pregnancies. Hajrah Aslam went through 11 weeks of rehabilitation at a specialist centre A Covid patient who gave birth before going into an induced coma
for six weeks has made an ""incredible"" recovery, a specialist rehab
facility says. Hajrah Aslam, from Peterborough, caught coronavirus when she was
35 weeks pregnant. She was put into a coma after her oxygen levels dropped
dangerously low. The 28-year-old is now recovering with her son after going
through 11 weeks of rehabilitation at Askham Rehab in Cambridgeshire. Sara Neaves, clinical lead at the rehab centre, said: ""Considering
the condition she was in when she arrived, an 11-week discharge is an
incredible feat."" Here are some of the latest graphics explaining the
coronavirus situation in the UK. The Covid-19 vaccine rollout in England is estimated to have directly averted between 91,700 and 98,700 deaths, according to figures from Public Health England (PHE). Previous estimates had put the figures between 81,300 and 87,800 deaths. The latest numbers from PHE also indicate the vaccination programme has directly averted more than 82,100 hospital admissions - up from a previous estimate of more than 66,900. Between 23.6 million and 24.4 million infections are estimated to have prevented - up from between 22.9 million and 23.8 million.

from the previous week, with 214,736 recorded between 13
and 19 August, a rise of 15,530. Another 47,284 people in the UK have had a first dose
of a coronavirus vaccine, the government figures show. In total, 87.3% of the adult population has now had at least one jab. And a further 169,223 have had a second
vaccine dose now. As of today, 75.7% of the adult
population has now had both jabs. There have been a further 36,572 cases of coronavirus reported in the UK today, according to thelatest government figures,external. And there have been another 113 deaths, of people who had tested positive for the virus within the previous 28 days. Toyota is to slash worldwide vehicle production by 40% in September because of a global microchip shortage. The world's biggest carmaker had planned to make almost 900,000 cars next month, but has now reduced that to 540,000 vehicles. Volkswagen, the world's second-biggest car producer, has warned it may also be forced to cut output further. The Covid pandemic boosted demand for appliances that use chips, such as phones, TVs and games consoles. New cars often include dozens of microchips and Toyota benefited from having built a larger stockpile of chips - also called semiconductors - as part of a revamp to its business continuity plan, developed in the wake of the Fukushima earthquake and tsunami a decade ago. The decision to cut production now has been precipitated by the resurgence of coronavirus cases across Asia hitting supplies. Read morehere. A six-day nationwide lockdown began on Monday to combat the coronavirus Iranâs official death toll from Covid-19 has passed
100,000, as the Middle Eastâs worst-hit country struggles with a fifth wave of infections. The health ministry reported 564 deaths over the previous
24 hours on Thursday, bringing the overall total to 100,255, state media said. The
number of confirmed cases meanwhile rose by 31,266 to 4,587,683. However,
experts believe the real figures are far higher. Iran has seen a surge of infections driven by the Delta
variant since late June and has reported 12,000 deaths in the past month. On Monday, a six-day lockdown was imposed, with private travel
between provinces banned and government buildings and non-essential businesses shut. The government has also promised to step up its
vaccination programme, which has seen just under 20% of the 83 million population
given at least one dose. Iran has so far relied mostly on vaccines from China and Russia. But officials said last week that the importing of Pfizer and
Moderna vaccines would be permitted, so long as they were not produced in the US
or UK. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had forbidden the use of vaccines made
in the two countries in January. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China is today celebrating that it has carried
out more than 1.9 billion vaccinations. This equates to about two thirds of
its 1.4 billion population having received two doses. The country has hopes that 80% of its population will
be vaccinated by early next year. And there has been a notable trend in recent
weeks of areas moving to impose restrictions that prohibit the movements of
unvaccinated people. The national Global Times newspaper reports that
some will be recognised as vaccine-exempt. However, it says the governments ofEcheng,externalandShiyan,external, in central Hubei province, have said that if you do not have a valid reason for
remaining unvaccinated, this could impact your personal credit record. The authorities in Guigang and Laibin, in southern
Guangxi, say that unvaccinated individuals can no longer enter schools, medical
institutes, or nursing homes. In the central city of Nanchang, unvaccinated
people are no longer allowed to go on business trips. While there is fresh support for such measures
helping to keep people Covid-safe, earlier attempts to impose restrictions on the
unvaccinated were fiercely criticised. Back in April, a town in Hainan issued an apology
and made a U-turn, after ittried to ban unvaccinated people,externalfrom using public
transport, and visiting restaurants and supermarkets. Being double-vaccinated offers the best protection against the Delta variant, first identified in India and now dominant in the UK, according to a new study. But people who have had both doses can still catch and transmit the disease, so researchers say it is essential as many people as possible get the jab. Everyone aged 16 and over in the UK can now receive the Covid vaccine, and a third jab for the most vulnerable is being considered. Those who are 16 and 17 are currently being offered a first vaccine dose and, as we've been reporting, more than 125,000 of them have done so in the past two weeks. But there is currently no timescale for when they could be given a second one. The vaccine has already beenapproved for over-12s with underlying conditions or those who live with others at high risk, but there are no plans to give it routinely to this age group. Millions of people most vulnerable to Covid-19may be offered a third vaccination- along with the annual flu jab -from September, though the JCVI has not yet offered final guidance.

Nicole Kidman (pictured last year) is in Hong Kong to film a new television series Nicole Kidman has come under fire for apparently circumventing strict quarantine rules for international travellers. The Australian actress's arrival in Hong Kong has sparked widespread anger after she was reportedly spotted out and about two days after touching down. This is despite the region having some of the strictest rules in place, with up to 21 days' quarantine required. There has been no direct, official comment on a possible exemption. However, Hong Kong's Commerce and Economic Development Bureau sent out a statement on Thursday in response to questions about ""overseas film personnel"" and quarantine, explaining restrictions are waived ""to carry out designated professional work"". Kidman is in Hong Kong to film a new show about the lives of wealthy, glamorous ex-pats - already a source of tension as locals contend with increasing restrictions under the new national security law. Reports of the waiver have only stoked outrage further, with comments on both Twitter and Chinese social media platform Sina Weibo overwhelmingly critical. Read morehere. Tom BatemanBBC Middle East correspondent About 5% of the Gaza's population has received at least one dose of a vaccine The Grand Mufti of Gaza has called on Palestinians to get
vaccinated as soon as possible. In a video message, Sheikh Hassan al-Lahhan says whoever
delays doing so is a âsinnerâ and describes anyone who transmits the virus
unintentionally as a âmistaken killerâ. As Gazaâs top Islamic cleric, he oversees the religious
affairs ministry in the Hamas-run territory. The attempt to encourage vaccine take-up comes as
Covid-19 rates start to surge again in Gaza, where the health system is
crippled amid Israelâs blockade and after years of conflict. Vaccine delivery to the occupied Palestinian territories
has been painfully slow, but aid groups say misinformation and vaccine
hesitancy is also hindering levels of protection. In Gaza a little more than 120,000 people have received
at least one dose - only about 5% of the Stripâs population. The manager of a hotel at the centre of a school prom Covid spike says he was assured everyone had passed a lateral flow test before attending the event. More than 50 positive cases have been linked to the party at the Cwrt Bleddyn hotel near Usk in Monmouthshire. Manager Simon Daniel says: ""We thought this was an official school prom - we thought we were dealing with the school. ""On the actual day of the prom, I met up at the hotel with the main organiser that we'd dealt with, who assured me she had 120-odd negative lateral flow tests."" He says he now believes a parent on the prom committee organised the party. Read the full story. Northern Ireland is facing the prospect of ""a very difficult winter"" due to rising Covid-19 cases and a return of other respiratory viruses, the chief medical officer has warned. Sir Michael McBride said people had not been exposed to many viruses other than Covid-19, contributing to a ""perfect storm"" of additional pressures. He said hospitals were already under pressures normally seen in mid-winter. Hospital staff were ""physically tired and exhausted"", he added. On Wednesday11 further Covid-related deaths were recorded, the highest number since mid-February. All over-16s in the UK are now being offered a single dose of Covid vaccine, as well as some younger vulnerable teenagers. InEngland they will be offered their jab by 23 August, the government has said. There are an estimated 1.4 million people in this age group and they don't need parental consent, as they are considered capable of making their own medical treatment decisions. Children aged 12 to 15 who are at higher risk of Covid due to underlying health conditions will also be offered the jab, but there are currently no plans to vaccinate healthy children of this age. Being double vaccinated still offers the best protection against the Delta variant, first identified in India and now dominant in the UK, according to a new study. But people who have had both doses can still catch and transmit the disease, so researchers say it is essential that as many people are possible get the jab. BBC health reporter Philippa Roxby looks at everything the under-30s need to know about the vaccine. More than 125,000 16 and 17-year-olds in England have received a Covid vaccine in the two weeks since the NHS was given the green light to offer them a jab. It means more than 360,000 people aged 16 and 17 have now had their jab - including those previously eligible due to an underlying health condition, according to the NHS. The health service said it is sending out one million letters inviting this age group to get vaccinated. GPs are also inviting at-risk children aged between 12 and 15, who are clinically vulnerable to Covid or live with adults who are at increased risk of serious illness from the virus, to take up the jab. The NHS said 30,000 children in this age group are already protected. Â© 2025 BBC.

"A UK Covid vaccine booster scheme will take place and is likely to start next month, the health secretary has said. Sajid Javid said he was uncertain of the exact start date as the government was waiting for the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation's ""final advice"" before proceeding. Mr Javid added the ""most vulnerable"" would be offered the third jab first. However, it remains unclear whether the booster scheme will be for all adults, or just some, more vulnerable groups. Interim advice from the JCVI,released last month, suggested more than 30 million of the most vulnerable people - including all over-50s - should receive a third dose. Asked about the scheme on Thursday, Mr Javid said: ""We are going to have a booster scheme. It will start some time in September. ""I couldn't tell you exactly when because before we start it... we need to get the final advice from our group of experts, our independent scientific and medical advisers, the JCVI, and so we're waiting for their final opinion."" How many people have been vaccinated so far? Oxford-jab chief criticises UK's Covid booster plan Who still has to self-isolate? Earlier in the day, Prof Adam Finn told the BBC that the JCVI, of which he is a member, would be ""imminently deciding"" that some people ""will need a third dose, particularly people who we know are very unlikely to be well protected by those first two doses"". ""But I think we do need more evidence before we can make a firm decision on a much broader booster programme,"" he added. The health secretary says ""a"" booster campaign will take place, but the more important question is ""who"" will be boosted. We still don't know. There are scientific and ethical arguments about a booster campaign. For some there is a clear benefit - particularly those with weakened immune systems in whom it takes three doses to do the job of two. But for the rest of the population, the evidence so far shows two doses are providing lasting protection from becoming seriously ill and needing hospital treatment. Whether a mass vaccination campaign is necessary or should be far more targeted is the subject of intense debate. This comes at a time that rich countries are being accused of giving vaccines to people at little risk from Covid and that would save far more lives if they were shared with the world. About 70% of the entire UK population has had at least one jab. In the poorest countries that figure is about 1%. The announcement comes after it was revealed more than 125,000 16 and 17-year-olds in England have had the vaccine in the two weeks since the NHS was given approval to offer that age group a jab. In total, 47,460,526 first doses have now been given across the UK, while 41,157,069 people have had two doses. But the decision to offer people in the UK a third jab is not without controversy. Immunologist Prof Peter Openshaw, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), which advises the government, said the ""question about boosters is a contentious one"". He said studies into the effectiveness of booster schemes were still ongoing and ""everyone is very keen that if we do have surplus vaccines, that they're not necessarily used in this country, but might be sent overseas"". This video can not be played Immunologist Prof Peter Openshaw: ""The question of boosters is a contentious one"" And, earlier this month, the head of the Oxford Vaccine Group said doses needed to ""go where they can have the greatest impact"" - to protect unvaccinated people abroad. Prof Sir Andrew Pollard, who led the team that created the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, said decisions on whether to give boosters ""should be scientifically driven"". Asked whether the JCVI had concerns about plans for the booster scheme, Mr Javid said: ""It's only with their expert advice that government would want to continue with their plans. ""I don't want to prejudge what they're going to say but, based on their interim advice, I think we can be confident that we will start a booster scheme next month.""

"David Whitfield abused his position of power, prosecutors told the court A prison officer has been jailed for six years and nine months after demanding sexual favours from 12 female inmates in return for cell privileges. David Whitfield, 36, of Colman Avenue in South Shields, took advantage of the women between 2011 and 2016 at HMP Low Newton in Durham. Following a trial at Teesside Crown Court, he was convicted of committing misconduct in a public office. He was cleared of sexual assault on one woman. The court heard he abused his position of power to ""extract or encourage"" the inmates to carry out sex acts. Prosecutor Anne Richardson said Whitfield would enter one prisoner's cell while she was naked and brush against her. The pair regularly engaged in sex acts although it did not progress to intercourse, the jury was told. In return, she was given advance warning of cell searches and any confiscated items would be given back to her. Whitfield would also watch the inmates through their cell hatch and indicate he wanted them to undress and touch themselves. On visits to one woman he told her he ""wanted a little show"", Ms Richardson said. He also asked whether he could have sex with her on her birthday, but the woman was moved to a different wing. ""Flirtatious banter"" with another inmate progressed to Whitfield watching her getting dressed and undressed, and rubbing cream into her body, the prosecution said. On other occasions she would ""dance provocatively"" for him as he watched. In return for cell search warnings, she also allowed Whitfield to slap her bottom and fondle her in a cleaning cupboard, prosecutors added. Sentencing him, Recorder David Gordon described many of the inmates as vulnerable after having previously suffered abuse. He said Whitfield ""methodically, routinely and cynically took advantage"" of them when they were under his control. He added: ""You actually undermined prison discipline by tipping the inmates off about any cell searches so they could hide drugs or tobacco. ""You have brought shame on your family, betrayed your hard-working colleagues and betrayed the trust of the public.""

"Jared O'Mara served as MP for Sheffield Hallam from June 2017 to November 2019 Former Sheffield Hallam MP Jared O'Mara has been charged with seven counts of fraud. South Yorkshire Police said the charges related to a number of alleged fraudulent expenses claims. Mr O'Mara, 39, is charged alongside former aide Gareth Arnold, who faces six counts of fraud, and a third man, John Woodliff, who faces a single charge under the Proceeds of Crime Act. They will appear before magistrates in Sheffield on 24 September. The offences are said to have occurred between October 2018 and February 2020. The force said the charges brought against Mr O'Mara, of Walker Close, Sheffield, related to expenses claims submitted to the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority. In total he faces seven counts of fraud and one count of entering into an arrangement which facilitates the acquisition, retention, use or control of criminal property by another, the force said. Mr Arnold, 28, of Hunter House Road, Sheffield, faces six counts of fraud while Mr Woodliff, 42, of Dunninc Terrace, Sheffield, faces one count of entering into an arrangement which facilitates the acquisition, retention, use or control of criminal property by another.

"Schools have been told to space seating in classes as widely as possible and have children seated facing forward when the new term begins Schools in Northern Ireland can continue to teach some children in class bubbles when the new term begins. That is despite the executive deciding on 12 August that schools no longer had to teach children in bubbles. But new Department of Education (DE) guidance said schools could ""retain the use or partial use of bubbles"". In a separate letter to school heads, the education minister said the guidance allowed schools ""flexibility"". Michelle McIlveen also said that the requirement for post-primary pupils to wear facemasks in class would be reviewed by the executive on 8 October. ""What we've tried to achieve here is a flexible system to allow school leaders who know their school environment better than us to adapt accordingly,"" she told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""We have been clear. This is about keeping our young people safe."" The revised guidance from the department comes just days before many staff and pupils are due to return to school. Many pupilshave been taught in small group bubbles since September 2020. As much as possible, children remained in the same class groups every day to reduce mixing with others. The new guidance said it would be ""for each school to determine if they wish to continue to use some/all of the principles of bubbles that they will have used during the 2020-21 year"". ""Without the use of formal bubbles, schools should still seek to reduce contacts,"" the guidance said, as this would ""support the PHA's (Public Health Agency's) contact tracing by encouraging pupils to remain within a consistent group of pupils wherever possible"". Schools have also been told to space seating in classes as widely as possible and have children seated facing the front of the classroom. They have also been asked to hold activities outdoors if they can. Education Minister Michelle McIlveen said schools could now plan for a return to the academic year Graham Gault, of the National Association of Headteachers, said there was an ""air of disbelief"" among school leaders at the guidance. ""Only a week ago it was all over the media that bubbles would no longer be required,"" he said, adding that the guidance ""has the potential to confuse"". Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Ulster Programme, Mr Gault said the guidance would not require any significant changes to Covid-19 mitigation measures already in place in schools. ""The advice that we are giving to school leaders across the country is the routines and mitigations that you have already set up, that your school community is already familiar with, that your teachers are already implementing are still appropriate. If it's working for you, don't change it."" Chris Logan, principal of Comber Primary School, said the changes have come too late for schools to make ""sweeping changes"" before term begins next week. ""Schools need time to prepare the curriculum and we may see time before schools are enable to enact some of the changes. It just takes time to plan and prepare,"" he told BBC News NI. The executive had also decided that if a child was identified as a close contact of a positive Covid case, they would no longer have to self-isolate for 10 days. Instead, they should self-isolate and book a PCR test. New Covid rules for England schools to be set out Education minister calls for end to masks in class What will school be like in the new term? If the PCR test is positive they should isolate for 10 days, but if the result is negative they can end their self-isolation. However, the new department guidance does not provide detailed advice for schools on the new arrangements. Instead, Ms McIlveen said that the PHA was currently ""preparing guidance"" for schools on the new self-isolation arrangements. She said that was to ensure they ""applied equally to all pupils in each year group"". However, she did not state when schools would receive the new PHA guidance. All indoor and outdoor extra-curricular activities can also resume in schools when the new term begins. According to the department guidance, that includes ""music or singing"". Singinghad been prohibited indoors in schools in the 2020/21 school year. However, children can sing in class and school choirs can now sing again indoors though mitigations should be in place like doors or windows being kept open. Childrenare considered extremely low risk for becoming ill or dying from Covid-19. Researchalso suggests that long-lasting symptoms in children are rare. Ms McIlveen thanked school leaders and staff for their support and wished all pupils, teachers and staff a ""safe return to all our educational settings"". The guidance was developed with the Department of Health and in consultation with school leaders and trade unions. How are Covid rules changing across UK schools?

"Emergency services were called to the OYO Sheffield Metropolitan Hotel on Wednesday afternoon A five-year-old Afghan refugee who fell to his death from a Sheffield hotel window has been identified by police. It is reported Mohammed Munib Majeedi fell from a ninth-floor room where he was staying with his mother. Emergency services were called to the OYO Metropolitan Hotel in Blonk Street, Sheffield, at about 14:30 BST on Wednesday. A fellow Afghan staying in the hotel said Mohammed's family arrived in the UK 15 days ago. It is understood they were relocated to the UK as part of the Afghan Relocation and Assistance Policy (ARAP) scheme. The man, who worked as an interpreter for the British Army in Afghanistan, said one of his children alerted him to the boy falling and he went outside to help. More stories from Yorkshire He was later asked to accompany Mohammed's mother to hospital to translate. He said everyone in the hotel had been left shocked by the incident. ""They are so upset, they are so unhappy,"" he said. ""Everybody, if you want to talk to them, they have no time because they are so bad, in a bad condition."" South Yorkshire Police said it was not treating the death as suspicious Another Afghan resident said he was in his room when he heard the boy fall. ""His mother was in the room with him,"" he said. ""She was screaming, 'my son, my son'. When I came here [outside] I saw the ambulance and police here."" He added: ""They came here to save their lives, they came for a new life here, but unfortunately..."" The man said the eight to 10 Afghan families staying at the hotel were being moved to another hotel on Thursday afternoon. This is a tragic case. A five-year-old boy, only just been evacuated from Afghanistan with his four siblings and parents, has died after falling from a hotel window. We understand Mohammed's father worked for the British Embassy in Afghanistan and had travelled to the UK under the government's scheme to resettle interpreters and support staff whose lives may be at risk from the Taliban. Once in the UK however, the Home Office is struggling to find accommodation for refugees - many of whom are large families. It's understood the Home Office was directly managing the now empty hotel at the time of the incident. There had been concerns raised about the safety of the windows. I'm told some people had been moved out, but the Home Office denies this. The housing group Mears was looking after the hotel until a few months ago, but safety concerns saw it withdraw to another nearby hotel. What has happened here, therefore, raises some serious questions about what steps were taken to ensure the hotel was safe for vulnerable families and young children and about the state of accommodation being provided to asylum seekers. The Home Office said: ""We are extremely saddened by the tragic death of a child at a hotel in Sheffield. ""The police are providing support to the family while the investigation continues and we cannot comment further at this time."" South Yorkshire Police said: ""We can confirm that the five-year-old boy who sadly lost his life is from Afghanistan."" It said Mohammed's death was not being treated as suspicious and his family was being supported by officers. The force has appealed for anyone who witnessed the incident to contact them. Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: ""This a terrible tragedy and our thoughts are with the family who have gone through so much trauma and suffering to reach the UK. ""It is vital the Home Office carry out an urgent investigation into what has happened so steps can be taken to quickly learn lessons. ""We don't know the details of the incident but it is imperative that families who come from Afghanistan are given all the support they need and housed in appropriate accommodation. They are vulnerable and often very traumatised."" Sheffield City Council leader Terry Fox said: ""This is absolutely devastating, just so incredibly sad. ""As a council we are in close contact with the police and will provide any support that we can to the family - my heart goes out to them.""

"More than 125,000 16 and 17-year-olds in England have had a Covid vaccine in the two weeks since the NHS was given the green light to offer them a jab One of the scientists advising the government on fighting the Covid pandemic says a decision on a booster jab programme is imminent It has yet to be decided who would be the first to get a third jab but a meeting is being held this morning Having two Covid vaccine doses remains the best way to protect against the Delta variant, a large study concludes The number of patients in hospital with Covid is at its highest level in five months, with 6,321 in the latest count taken earlier this week A first Covid case has been detected in the Tokyo Paralympics village, just days before the Games are due to start Edited by Chris Clayton Today's live page is coming to a close now. Thank you for
joining us. It was brought to you by John Hand, Chris Clayton, Alex Therrien,
Jo Couzens and James Clarke. Weâll be ending our live coverage for today shortly but,
before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main coronavirus headlines from the
UK and around the world: The World Health Organization (WHO) has called on countries to ensure that health services across Afghanistan are maintained, as it warned of increasing cases of Covid-19 across the country. The organisation's regional director, Dr Ahmed Al-Mandhari, said that WHO teams in areas which had seen large influxes of people fleeing the Taliban advance are now reporting increasing cases of people with Covid-like symptoms. According to the WHO, there have been 152,365 cases of coronavirus in the country and 7,043 deaths. However, Afghanistan has limited testing capacity and reporting of cases across the country is sketchy. A survey conducted by the Ministry of Health last year estimated that as many as 10 million Afghans - or 31.5% of the population - may have contracted the virus. WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic also warned that the chaos at Kabul airport, where thousands of people are trying to flee the Taliban, is slowing deliveries of crucial medical supplies. Refugees at the airport are being tested for the virus before boarding evacuation flights. The UK is to get a vaccine booster scheme from September, the health secretary says. Sajid Javid made the comment after the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) met earlier today to discuss a potential Covid-19 booster campaign for people who need a third dose. He said: ""We are going to have a booster scheme. It will start some time in September. ""I couldn't tell you exactly when because before we start it... we need to get the final advice from our group of experts, our independent scientific and medical advisers, the JCVI, and so we're waiting for their final opinion."" But the health secretary says he is ""confident we can start in September"" offering a third jab to the most vulnerable people. He adds that the government will only want to continue with their plans on the expert advice of the JCVI. ""I don't want to prejudge what they're going to say but, based on their interim advice, I think we can be confident that we will start a booster scheme next month."" Read morehere. The number of pregnant women in England taking
up the Covid vaccine rose in the last two weeks
of July. More than 10,000 women who are pregnant, or believe they could be, have come forward to receive their first dose, according
to the latest data from Public Health England. It means 62,311 pregnant women have
now had a jab, including 43,737 who have had two doses. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisations at PHE, said:âIt
is encouraging that thousands of women have now benefited from the vital
protection of a Covid-19 vaccine. However, many more may remain unvaccinated and we
urge them to take up the offer.â PHE says Covid vaccines
are safe for pregnant women, and they should get the jab to protect themselves and their babies.
Covid-19 can cause serious complications in the later stages of pregnancies. Hajrah Aslam went through 11 weeks of rehabilitation at a specialist centre A Covid patient who gave birth before going into an induced coma
for six weeks has made an ""incredible"" recovery, a specialist rehab
facility says. Hajrah Aslam, from Peterborough, caught coronavirus when she was
35 weeks pregnant. She was put into a coma after her oxygen levels dropped
dangerously low. The 28-year-old is now recovering with her son after going
through 11 weeks of rehabilitation at Askham Rehab in Cambridgeshire. Sara Neaves, clinical lead at the rehab centre, said: ""Considering
the condition she was in when she arrived, an 11-week discharge is an
incredible feat."" Here are some of the latest graphics explaining the
coronavirus situation in the UK. The Covid-19 vaccine rollout in England is estimated to have directly averted between 91,700 and 98,700 deaths, according to figures from Public Health England (PHE). Previous estimates had put the figures between 81,300 and 87,800 deaths. The latest numbers from PHE also indicate the vaccination programme has directly averted more than 82,100 hospital admissions - up from a previous estimate of more than 66,900. Between 23.6 million and 24.4 million infections are estimated to have prevented - up from between 22.9 million and 23.8 million. Thelatest figures,externalshow that deaths have increased by 9.6% per 100,000 people
from the previous week (6 to 12 August), with 674 recorded in the last
seven days, a rise of 59. Cases have risen 7.8% per 100,000 people
from the previous week, with 214,736 recorded between 13
and 19 August, a rise of 15,530. Another 47,284 people in the UK have had a first dose
of a coronavirus vaccine, the government figures show. In total, 87.3% of the adult population has now had at least one jab. And a further 169,223 have had a second
vaccine dose now. As of today, 75.7% of the adult
population has now had both jabs. There have been a further 36,572 cases of coronavirus reported in the UK today, according to thelatest government figures,external. And there have been another 113 deaths, of people who had tested positive for the virus within the previous 28 days. Toyota is to slash worldwide vehicle production by 40% in September because of a global microchip shortage. The world's biggest carmaker had planned to make almost 900,000 cars next month, but has now reduced that to 540,000 vehicles. Volkswagen, the world's second-biggest car producer, has warned it may also be forced to cut output further. The Covid pandemic boosted demand for appliances that use chips, such as phones, TVs and games consoles. New cars often include dozens of microchips and Toyota benefited from having built a larger stockpile of chips - also called semiconductors - as part of a revamp to its business continuity plan, developed in the wake of the Fukushima earthquake and tsunami a decade ago. The decision to cut production now has been precipitated by the resurgence of coronavirus cases across Asia hitting supplies. Read morehere. A six-day nationwide lockdown began on Monday to combat the coronavirus Iranâs official death toll from Covid-19 has passed
100,000, as the Middle Eastâs worst-hit country struggles with a fifth wave of infections. The health ministry reported 564 deaths over the previous
24 hours on Thursday, bringing the overall total to 100,255, state media said. The
number of confirmed cases meanwhile rose by 31,266 to 4,587,683. However,
experts believe the real figures are far higher. Iran has seen a surge of infections driven by the Delta
variant since late June and has reported 12,000 deaths in the past month. On Monday, a six-day lockdown was imposed, with private travel
between provinces banned and government buildings and non-essential businesses shut. The government has also promised to step up its
vaccination programme, which has seen just under 20% of the 83 million population
given at least one dose. Iran has so far relied mostly on vaccines from China and Russia. But officials said last week that the importing of Pfizer and
Moderna vaccines would be permitted, so long as they were not produced in the US
or UK. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had forbidden the use of vaccines made
in the two countries in January. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China is today celebrating that it has carried
out more than 1.9 billion vaccinations. This equates to about two thirds of
its 1.4 billion population having received two doses. The country has hopes that 80% of its population will
be vaccinated by early next year. And there has been a notable trend in recent
weeks of areas moving to impose restrictions that prohibit the movements of
unvaccinated people. The national Global Times newspaper reports that
some will be recognised as vaccine-exempt. However, it says the governments ofEcheng,externalandShiyan,external, in central Hubei province, have said that if you do not have a valid reason for
remaining unvaccinated, this could impact your personal credit record. The authorities in Guigang and Laibin, in southern
Guangxi, say that unvaccinated individuals can no longer enter schools, medical
institutes, or nursing homes. In the central city of Nanchang, unvaccinated
people are no longer allowed to go on business trips. While there is fresh support for such measures
helping to keep people Covid-safe, earlier attempts to impose restrictions on the
unvaccinated were fiercely criticised. Back in April, a town in Hainan issued an apology
and made a U-turn, after ittried to ban unvaccinated people,externalfrom using public
transport, and visiting restaurants and supermarkets. Being double-vaccinated offers the best protection against the Delta variant, first identified in India and now dominant in the UK, according to a new study. But people who have had both doses can still catch and transmit the disease, so researchers say it is essential as many people as possible get the jab. Everyone aged 16 and over in the UK can now receive the Covid vaccine, and a third jab for the most vulnerable is being considered. Those who are 16 and 17 are currently being offered a first vaccine dose and, as we've been reporting, more than 125,000 of them have done so in the past two weeks. But there is currently no timescale for when they could be given a second one. The vaccine has already beenapproved for over-12s with underlying conditions or those who live with others at high risk, but there are no plans to give it routinely to this age group. Millions of people most vulnerable to Covid-19may be offered a third vaccination- along with the annual flu jab -from September, though the JCVI has not yet offered final guidance.

Nicole Kidman (pictured last year) is in Hong Kong to film a new television series Nicole Kidman has come under fire for apparently circumventing strict quarantine rules for international travellers. The Australian actress's arrival in Hong Kong has sparked widespread anger after she was reportedly spotted out and about two days after touching down. This is despite the region having some of the strictest rules in place, with up to 21 days' quarantine required. There has been no direct, official comment on a possible exemption. However, Hong Kong's Commerce and Economic Development Bureau sent out a statement on Thursday in response to questions about ""overseas film personnel"" and quarantine, explaining restrictions are waived ""to carry out designated professional work"". Kidman is in Hong Kong to film a new show about the lives of wealthy, glamorous ex-pats - already a source of tension as locals contend with increasing restrictions under the new national security law. Reports of the waiver have only stoked outrage further, with comments on both Twitter and Chinese social media platform Sina Weibo overwhelmingly critical. Read morehere. Tom BatemanBBC Middle East correspondent About 5% of the Gaza's population has received at least one dose of a vaccine The Grand Mufti of Gaza has called on Palestinians to get
vaccinated as soon as possible. In a video message, Sheikh Hassan al-Lahhan says whoever
delays doing so is a âsinnerâ and describes anyone who transmits the virus
unintentionally as a âmistaken killerâ. As Gazaâs top Islamic cleric, he oversees the religious
affairs ministry in the Hamas-run territory. The attempt to encourage vaccine take-up comes as
Covid-19 rates start to surge again in Gaza, where the health system is
crippled amid Israelâs blockade and after years of conflict. Vaccine delivery to the occupied Palestinian territories
has been painfully slow, but aid groups say misinformation and vaccine
hesitancy is also hindering levels of protection. In Gaza a little more than 120,000 people have received
at least one dose - only about 5% of the Stripâs population. The manager of a hotel at the centre of a school prom Covid spike says he was assured everyone had passed a lateral flow test before attending the event. More than 50 positive cases have been linked to the party at the Cwrt Bleddyn hotel near Usk in Monmouthshire. Manager Simon Daniel says: ""We thought this was an official school prom - we thought we were dealing with the school. ""On the actual day of the prom, I met up at the hotel with the main organiser that we'd dealt with, who assured me she had 120-odd negative lateral flow tests."" He says he now believes a parent on the prom committee organised the party. Read the full story. Northern Ireland is facing the prospect of ""a very difficult winter"" due to rising Covid-19 cases and a return of other respiratory viruses, the chief medical officer has warned. Sir Michael McBride said people had not been exposed to many viruses other than Covid-19, contributing to a ""perfect storm"" of additional pressures. He said hospitals were already under pressures normally seen in mid-winter. Hospital staff were ""physically tired and exhausted"", he added. On Wednesday11 further Covid-related deaths were recorded, the highest number since mid-February. All over-16s in the UK are now being offered a single dose of Covid vaccine, as well as some younger vulnerable teenagers. InEngland they will be offered their jab by 23 August, the government has said. There are an estimated 1.4 million people in this age group and they don't need parental consent, as they are considered capable of making their own medical treatment decisions. Children aged 12 to 15 who are at higher risk of Covid due to underlying health conditions will also be offered the jab, but there are currently no plans to vaccinate healthy children of this age. Being double vaccinated still offers the best protection against the Delta variant, first identified in India and now dominant in the UK, according to a new study. But people who have had both doses can still catch and transmit the disease, so researchers say it is essential that as many people are possible get the jab. BBC health reporter Philippa Roxby looks at everything the under-30s need to know about the vaccine. More than 125,000 16 and 17-year-olds in England have received a Covid vaccine in the two weeks since the NHS was given the green light to offer them a jab. It means more than 360,000 people aged 16 and 17 have now had their jab - including those previously eligible due to an underlying health condition, according to the NHS. The health service said it is sending out one million letters inviting this age group to get vaccinated. GPs are also inviting at-risk children aged between 12 and 15, who are clinically vulnerable to Covid or live with adults who are at increased risk of serious illness from the virus, to take up the jab. The NHS said 30,000 children in this age group are already protected. Â© 2025 BBC.

The Home Office said: ""We are extremely saddened by the tragic death of a child at a hotel in Sheffield. ""The police are providing support to the family while the investigation continues and we cannot comment further at this time."" South Yorkshire Police said: ""We can confirm that the five-year-old boy who sadly lost his life is from Afghanistan."" It said Mohammed's death was not being treated as suspicious and his family was being supported by officers. The force has appealed for anyone who witnessed the incident to contact them. Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: ""This a terrible tragedy and our thoughts are with the family who have gone through so much trauma and suffering to reach the UK. ""It is vital the Home Office carry out an urgent investigation into what has happened so steps can be taken to quickly learn lessons. ""We don't know the details of the incident but it is imperative that families who come from Afghanistan are given all the support they need and housed in appropriate accommodation. They are vulnerable and often very traumatised."" Sheffield City Council leader Terry Fox said: ""This is absolutely devastating, just so incredibly sad. ""As a council we are in close contact with the police and will provide any support that we can to the family - my heart goes out to them.""

"More than 125,000 16 and 17-year-olds in England have had a Covid vaccine in the two weeks since the NHS was given the green light to offer them a jab One of the scientists advising the government on fighting the Covid pandemic says a decision on a booster jab programme is imminent It has yet to be decided who would be the first to get a third jab but a meeting is being held this morning Having two Covid vaccine doses remains the best way to protect against the Delta variant, a large study concludes The number of patients in hospital with Covid is at its highest level in five months, with 6,321 in the latest count taken earlier this week A first Covid case has been detected in the Tokyo Paralympics village, just days before the Games are due to start Edited by Chris Clayton Today's live page is coming to a close now. Thank you for
joining us. It was brought to you by John Hand, Chris Clayton, Alex Therrien,
Jo Couzens and James Clarke. Weâll be ending our live coverage for today shortly but,
before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main coronavirus headlines from the
UK and around the world: The World Health Organization (WHO) has called on countries to ensure that health services across Afghanistan are maintained, as it warned of increasing cases of Covid-19 across the country. The organisation's regional director, Dr Ahmed Al-Mandhari, said that WHO teams in areas which had seen large influxes of people fleeing the Taliban advance are now reporting increasing cases of people with Covid-like symptoms. According to the WHO, there have been 152,365 cases of coronavirus in the country and 7,043 deaths. However, Afghanistan has limited testing capacity and reporting of cases across the country is sketchy. A survey conducted by the Ministry of Health last year estimated that as many as 10 million Afghans - or 31.5% of the population - may have contracted the virus. WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic also warned that the chaos at Kabul airport, where thousands of people are trying to flee the Taliban, is slowing deliveries of crucial medical supplies. Refugees at the airport are being tested for the virus before boarding evacuation flights. The UK is to get a vaccine booster scheme from September, the health secretary says. Sajid Javid made the comment after the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) met earlier today to discuss a potential Covid-19 booster campaign for people who need a third dose. He said: ""We are going to have a booster scheme. It will start some time in September. ""I couldn't tell you exactly when because before we start it... we need to get the final advice from our group of experts, our independent scientific and medical advisers, the JCVI, and so we're waiting for their final opinion."" But the health secretary says he is ""confident we can start in September"" offering a third jab to the most vulnerable people. He adds that the government will only want to continue with their plans on the expert advice of the JCVI. ""I don't want to prejudge what they're going to say but, based on their interim advice, I think we can be confident that we will start a booster scheme next month."" Read morehere. The number of pregnant women in England taking
up the Covid vaccine rose in the last two weeks
of July. More than 10,000 women who are pregnant, or believe they could be, have come forward to receive their first dose, according
to the latest data from Public Health England. It means 62,311 pregnant women have
now had a jab, including 43,737 who have had two doses. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisations at PHE, said:âIt
is encouraging that thousands of women have now benefited from the vital
protection of a Covid-19 vaccine. However, many more may remain unvaccinated and we
urge them to take up the offer.â PHE says Covid vaccines
are safe for pregnant women, and they should get the jab to protect themselves and their babies.
Covid-19 can cause serious complications in the later stages of pregnancies. Hajrah Aslam went through 11 weeks of rehabilitation at a specialist centre A Covid patient who gave birth before going into an induced coma
for six weeks has made an ""incredible"" recovery, a specialist rehab
facility says. Hajrah Aslam, from Peterborough, caught coronavirus when she was
35 weeks pregnant. She was put into a coma after her oxygen levels dropped
dangerously low. The 28-year-old is now recovering with her son after going
through 11 weeks of rehabilitation at Askham Rehab in Cambridgeshire. Sara Neaves, clinical lead at the rehab centre, said: ""Considering
the condition she was in when she arrived, an 11-week discharge is an
incredible feat."" Here are some of the latest graphics explaining the
coronavirus situation in the UK. The Covid-19 vaccine rollout in England is estimated to have directly averted between 91,700 and 98,700 deaths, according to figures from Public Health England (PHE). Previous estimates had put the figures between 81,300 and 87,800 deaths. The latest numbers from PHE also indicate the vaccination programme has directly averted more than 82,100 hospital admissions - up from a previous estimate of more than 66,900. Between 23.6 million and 24.4 million infections are estimated to have prevented - up from between 22.9 million and 23.8 million. Thelatest figures,externalshow that deaths have increased by 9.6% per 100,000 people
from the previous week (6 to 12 August), with 674 recorded in the last
seven days, a rise of 59. Cases have risen 7.8% per 100,000 people
from the previous week, with 214,736 recorded between 13
and 19 August, a rise of 15,530. Another 47,284 people in the UK have had a first dose
of a coronavirus vaccine, the government figures show. In total, 87.3% of the adult population has now had at least one jab. And a further 169,223 have had a second
vaccine dose now. As of today, 75.7% of the adult
population has now had both jabs. There have been a further 36,572 cases of coronavirus reported in the UK today, according to thelatest government figures,external. And there have been another 113 deaths, of people who had tested positive for the virus within the previous 28 days. Toyota is to slash worldwide vehicle production by 40% in September because of a global microchip shortage. The world's biggest carmaker had planned to make almost 900,000 cars next month, but has now reduced that to 540,000 vehicles. Volkswagen, the world's second-biggest car producer, has warned it may also be forced to cut output further. The Covid pandemic boosted demand for appliances that use chips, such as phones, TVs and games consoles. New cars often include dozens of microchips and Toyota benefited from having built a larger stockpile of chips - also called semiconductors - as part of a revamp to its business continuity plan, developed in the wake of the Fukushima earthquake and tsunami a decade ago. The decision to cut production now has been precipitated by the resurgence of coronavirus cases across Asia hitting supplies. Read morehere. A six-day nationwide lockdown began on Monday to combat the coronavirus Iranâs official death toll from Covid-19 has passed
100,000, as the Middle Eastâs worst-hit country struggles with a fifth wave of infections. The health ministry reported 564 deaths over the previous
24 hours on Thursday, bringing the overall total to 100,255, state media said. The
number of confirmed cases meanwhile rose by 31,266 to 4,587,683. However,
experts believe the real figures are far higher. Iran has seen a surge of infections driven by the Delta
variant since late June and has reported 12,000 deaths in the past month. On Monday, a six-day lockdown was imposed, with private travel
between provinces banned and government buildings and non-essential businesses shut. The government has also promised to step up its
vaccination programme, which has seen just under 20% of the 83 million population
given at least one dose. Iran has so far relied mostly on vaccines from China and Russia. But officials said last week that the importing of Pfizer and
Moderna vaccines would be permitted, so long as they were not produced in the US
or UK. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had forbidden the use of vaccines made
in the two countries in January. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China is today celebrating that it has carried
out more than 1.9 billion vaccinations. This equates to about two thirds of
its 1.4 billion population having received two doses. The country has hopes that 80% of its population will
be vaccinated by early next year. And there has been a notable trend in recent
weeks of areas moving to impose restrictions that prohibit the movements of
unvaccinated people. The national Global Times newspaper reports that
some will be recognised as vaccine-exempt. However, it says the governments ofEcheng,externalandShiyan,external, in central Hubei province, have said that if you do not have a valid reason for
remaining unvaccinated, this could impact your personal credit record. The authorities in Guigang and Laibin, in southern
Guangxi, say that unvaccinated individuals can no longer enter schools, medical
institutes, or nursing homes. In the central city of Nanchang, unvaccinated
people are no longer allowed to go on business trips. While there is fresh support for such measures
helping to keep people Covid-safe, earlier attempts to impose restrictions on the
unvaccinated were fiercely criticised. Back in April, a town in Hainan issued an apology
and made a U-turn, after ittried to ban unvaccinated people,externalfrom using public
transport, and visiting restaurants and supermarkets. Being double-vaccinated offers the best protection against the Delta variant, first identified in India and now dominant in the UK, according to a new study. But people who have had both doses can still catch and transmit the disease, so researchers say it is essential as many people as possible get the jab. Everyone aged 16 and over in the UK can now receive the Covid vaccine, and a third jab for the most vulnerable is being considered. Those who are 16 and 17 are currently being offered a first vaccine dose and, as we've been reporting, more than 125,000 of them have done so in the past two weeks. But there is currently no timescale for when they could be given a second one. The vaccine has already beenapproved for over-12s with underlying conditions or those who live with others at high risk, but there are no plans to give it routinely to this age group. Millions of people most vulnerable to Covid-19may be offered a third vaccination- along with the annual flu jab -from September, though the JCVI has not yet offered final guidance.

Nicole Kidman (pictured last year) is in Hong Kong to film a new television series Nicole Kidman has come under fire for apparently circumventing strict quarantine rules for international travellers. The Australian actress's arrival in Hong Kong has sparked widespread anger after she was reportedly spotted out and about two days after touching down. This is despite the region having some of the strictest rules in place, with up to 21 days' quarantine required. There has been no direct, official comment on a possible exemption. However, Hong Kong's Commerce and Economic Development Bureau sent out a statement on Thursday in response to questions about ""overseas film personnel"" and quarantine, explaining restrictions are waived ""to carry out designated professional work"". Kidman is in Hong Kong to film a new show about the lives of wealthy, glamorous ex-pats - already a source of tension as locals contend with increasing restrictions under the new national security law. Reports of the waiver have only stoked outrage further, with comments on both Twitter and Chinese social media platform Sina Weibo overwhelmingly critical. Read morehere. Tom BatemanBBC Middle East correspondent About 5% of the Gaza's population has received at least one dose of a vaccine The Grand Mufti of Gaza has called on Palestinians to get
vaccinated as soon as possible. In a video message, Sheikh Hassan al-Lahhan says whoever
delays doing so is a âsinnerâ and describes anyone who transmits the virus
unintentionally as a âmistaken killerâ. As Gazaâs top Islamic cleric, he oversees the religious
affairs ministry in the Hamas-run territory. The attempt to encourage vaccine take-up comes as
Covid-19 rates start to surge again in Gaza, where the health system is
crippled amid Israelâs blockade and after years of conflict. Vaccine delivery to the occupied Palestinian territories
has been painfully slow, but aid groups say misinformation and vaccine
hesitancy is also hindering levels of protection. In Gaza a little more than 120,000 people have received
at least one dose - only about 5% of the Stripâs population. The manager of a hotel at the centre of a school prom Covid spike says he was assured everyone had passed a lateral flow test before attending the event. More than 50 positive cases have been linked to the party at the Cwrt Bleddyn hotel near Usk in Monmouthshire. Manager Simon Daniel says: ""We thought this was an official school prom - we thought we were dealing with the school. ""On the actual day of the prom, I met up at the hotel with the main organiser that we'd dealt with, who assured me she had 120-odd negative lateral flow tests."" He says he now believes a parent on the prom committee organised the party. Read the full story. Northern Ireland is facing the prospect of ""a very difficult winter"" due to rising Covid-19 cases and a return of other respiratory viruses, the chief medical officer has warned. Sir Michael McBride said people had not been exposed to many viruses other than Covid-19, contributing to a ""perfect storm"" of additional pressures. He said hospitals were already under pressures normally seen in mid-winter. Hospital staff were ""physically tired and exhausted"", he added. On Wednesday11 further Covid-related deaths were recorded, the highest number since mid-February. All over-16s in the UK are now being offered a single dose of Covid vaccine, as well as some younger vulnerable teenagers. InEngland they will be offered their jab by 23 August, the government has said. There are an estimated 1.4 million people in this age group and they don't need parental consent, as they are considered capable of making their own medical treatment decisions. Children aged 12 to 15 who are at higher risk of Covid due to underlying health conditions will also be offered the jab, but there are currently no plans to vaccinate healthy children of this age. Being double vaccinated still offers the best protection against the Delta variant, first identified in India and now dominant in the UK, according to a new study. But people who have had both doses can still catch and transmit the disease, so researchers say it is essential that as many people are possible get the jab. BBC health reporter Philippa Roxby looks at everything the under-30s need to know about the vaccine. More than 125,000 16 and 17-year-olds in England have received a Covid vaccine in the two weeks since the NHS was given the green light to offer them a jab. It means more than 360,000 people aged 16 and 17 have now had their jab - including those previously eligible due to an underlying health condition, according to the NHS. The health service said it is sending out one million letters inviting this age group to get vaccinated. GPs are also inviting at-risk children aged between 12 and 15, who are clinically vulnerable to Covid or live with adults who are at increased risk of serious illness from the virus, to take up the jab. The NHS said 30,000 children in this age group are already protected. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Emergency services were called to the OYO Sheffield Metropolitan Hotel on Wednesday afternoon A five-year-old Afghan refugee who fell to his death from a Sheffield hotel window has been identified by police. It is reported Mohammed Munib Majeedi fell from a ninth-floor room where he was staying with his mother. Emergency services were called to the OYO Metropolitan Hotel in Blonk Street, Sheffield, at about 14:30 BST on Wednesday. A fellow Afghan staying in the hotel said Mohammed's family arrived in the UK 15 days ago.

South Yorkshire Police said it was not treating the death as suspicious Another Afghan resident said he was in his room when he heard the boy fall. ""His mother was in the room with him,"" he said. ""She was screaming, 'my son, my son'. When I came here [outside] I saw the ambulance and police here."" He added: ""They came here to save their lives, they came for a new life here, but unfortunately..."" The man said the eight to 10 Afghan families staying at the hotel were being moved to another hotel on Thursday afternoon. This is a tragic case. A five-year-old boy, only just been evacuated from Afghanistan with his four siblings and parents, has died after falling from a hotel window.

""It is vital the Home Office carry out an urgent investigation into what has happened so steps can be taken to quickly learn lessons. ""We don't know the details of the incident but it is imperative that families who come from Afghanistan are given all the support they need and housed in appropriate accommodation. They are vulnerable and often very traumatised."" Sheffield City Council leader Terry Fox said: ""This is absolutely devastating, just so incredibly sad.

"Schools have been told to space seating in classes as widely as possible and have children seated facing forward when the new term begins Schools in Northern Ireland can continue to teach some children in class bubbles when the new term begins. That is despite the executive deciding on 12 August that schools no longer had to teach children in bubbles. But new Department of Education (DE) guidance said schools could ""retain the use or partial use of bubbles"". In a separate letter to school heads, the education minister said the guidance allowed schools ""flexibility"". Michelle McIlveen also said that the requirement for post-primary pupils to wear facemasks in class would be reviewed by the executive on 8 October. ""What we've tried to achieve here is a flexible system to allow school leaders who know their school environment better than us to adapt accordingly,"" she told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""We have been clear. This is about keeping our young people safe."" The revised guidance from the department comes just days before many staff and pupils are due to return to school. Many pupilshave been taught in small group bubbles since September 2020. As much as possible, children remained in the same class groups every day to reduce mixing with others. The new guidance said it would be ""for each school to determine if they wish to continue to use some/all of the principles of bubbles that they will have used during the 2020-21 year"". ""Without the use of formal bubbles, schools should still seek to reduce contacts,"" the guidance said, as this would ""support the PHA's (Public Health Agency's) contact tracing by encouraging pupils to remain within a consistent group of pupils wherever possible"". Schools have also been told to space seating in classes as widely as possible and have children seated facing the front of the classroom. They have also been asked to hold activities outdoors if they can. Education Minister Michelle McIlveen said schools could now plan for a return to the academic year Graham Gault, of the National Association of Headteachers, said there was an ""air of disbelief"" among school leaders at the guidance. ""Only a week ago it was all over the media that bubbles would no longer be required,"" he said, adding that the guidance ""has the potential to confuse"". Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Ulster Programme, Mr Gault said the guidance would not require any significant changes to Covid-19 mitigation measures already in place in schools. ""The advice that we are giving to school leaders across the country is the routines and mitigations that you have already set up, that your school community is already familiar with, that your teachers are already implementing are still appropriate. If it's working for you, don't change it."" Chris Logan, principal of Comber Primary School, said the changes have come too late for schools to make ""sweeping changes"" before term begins next week. ""Schools need time to prepare the curriculum and we may see time before schools are enable to enact some of the changes. It just takes time to plan and prepare,"" he told BBC News NI.

"Emergency services were called to the OYO Sheffield Metropolitan Hotel on Wednesday afternoon A five-year-old Afghan refugee who fell to his death from a Sheffield hotel window has been identified by police. It is reported Mohammed Munib Majeedi fell from a ninth-floor room where he was staying with his mother. Emergency services were called to the OYO Metropolitan Hotel in Blonk Street, Sheffield, at about 14:30 BST on Wednesday. A fellow Afghan staying in the hotel said Mohammed's family arrived in the UK 15 days ago. It is understood they were relocated to the UK as part of the Afghan Relocation and Assistance Policy (ARAP) scheme. The man, who worked as an interpreter for the British Army in Afghanistan, said one of his children alerted him to the boy falling and he went outside to help. More stories from Yorkshire He was later asked to accompany Mohammed's mother to hospital to translate. He said everyone in the hotel had been left shocked by the incident. ""They are so upset, they are so unhappy,"" he said. ""Everybody, if you want to talk to them, they have no time because they are so bad, in a bad condition."" South Yorkshire Police said it was not treating the death as suspicious Another Afghan resident said he was in his room when he heard the boy fall. ""His mother was in the room with him,"" he said. ""She was screaming, 'my son, my son'. When I came here [outside] I saw the ambulance and police here."" He added: ""They came here to save their lives, they came for a new life here, but unfortunately..."" The man said the eight to 10 Afghan families staying at the hotel were being moved to another hotel on Thursday afternoon. This is a tragic case. A five-year-old boy, only just been evacuated from Afghanistan with his four siblings and parents, has died after falling from a hotel window. We understand Mohammed's father worked for the British Embassy in Afghanistan and had travelled to the UK under the government's scheme to resettle interpreters and support staff whose lives may be at risk from the Taliban. Once in the UK however, the Home Office is struggling to find accommodation for refugees - many of whom are large families. It's understood the Home Office was directly managing the now empty hotel at the time of the incident. There had been concerns raised about the safety of the windows. I'm told some people had been moved out, but the Home Office denies this. The housing group Mears was looking after the hotel until a few months ago, but safety concerns saw it withdraw to another nearby hotel. What has happened here, therefore, raises some serious questions about what steps were taken to ensure the hotel was safe for vulnerable families and young children and about the state of accommodation being provided to asylum seekers. The Home Office said: ""We are extremely saddened by the tragic death of a child at a hotel in Sheffield. ""The police are providing support to the family while the investigation continues and we cannot comment further at this time."" South Yorkshire Police said: ""We can confirm that the five-year-old boy who sadly lost his life is from Afghanistan."" It said Mohammed's death was not being treated as suspicious and his family was being supported by officers. The force has appealed for anyone who witnessed the incident to contact them. Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: ""This a terrible tragedy and our thoughts are with the family who have gone through so much trauma and suffering to reach the UK.

"An intelligence briefing for the UN says the Taliban are stepping up the search for ""collaborators"" More anti-Taliban protests have taken place in several cities At least 12 people have been killed at Kabul airport since Sunday, a Taliban official says Western countries continue evacuating nationals and Afghans who worked for them Asked in an ABC TV interview if he made any mistakes with the Afghan exit, US President Biden says: ""No"" The IMF says that Afghanistan will no longer have access to its funds Edited by Toby Luckhurst We're pausing our live page coverage of developments in Afghanistan. Thanks for joining us. Here's a round-up of the latest developments:  You can follow the latesthere  This video can not be played Afghanistan: Child handed over Kabul airport wall as chaos continues American soldiers stand guard as Afghan people wait to board a US military aircraft to leave Afghanistan Armed US fighter jets are making passes over Kabul and the international airport as it attempts secure the evacuation of American citizens and allies from Afghanistan, the Pentagon has said. The warplanes are not making âlow passesâ, said Pentagon press secretary, John F Kirby, but only providing âoverwatchâ. âWe will use all of the tools in our arsenal to achieve the goalâ of protecting Americans, Kirby said. Some 7,000 Americans and other evacuees, including Afghan allies, have been airlifted out of the airport since Sunday.. Most Americans doubt the war in Afghanistan was worthwhile, a recent poll from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research has found. Roughly two-thirds said they did not think the two-decade war was worth fighting, as the US conducts its hasty exit. And the war has divided Americans on President Joe Biden's handling of foreign policy, with 47% of those polled saying they approve of Biden's management of international affairs. The poll was conducted on 12-16 August, amid the Taliban's capture of Kabul. Biden, who prides himself on his foreign policy experience, has stood by the US exit, saying in an interview with ABC News on Wednesday that he would not acknowledge any mistakes. The Taliban is yet
to announce how it will lead Afghanistan, but a senior leader has given some
hints, according to Tolo News. Wahidullah Hashemi said a council might be formed,externalto govern the country under the authority of the Talibanâs top leader Mullah Hibatullah Akhundzada, the Afghan news site reports. âDiscussions havenât been conducted
on what it will be like - perhaps we will establish a council,â he says. Mullah Hibatullah
Akhundzada has led the Taliban since May 2016 and is in charge of its political, military and religious affairs. Another figure considered a
possible contender for Afghanistan's new leader is Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar. He co-founded the Taliban in
Afghanistan in 1994 and has been at the heart of political negotiations with the US in recent
years, heading the groupâs political office in Qatar. You can read more on the Taliban leadership here. The first Italian evacuation flight out of Kabul landed in Rome on Wednesday An Italian diplomat has spoken about the challenging conditions in which rescue operations are taking place at Kabul airport. ""We've unfortunately had to witness dramatic scenes but we have managed in conditions of absolute emergency to bring home our compatriots and some of our Afghan colleagues,"" Tommaso Claudi,told Ansa news agency,external. The first Italian evacuation flight carrying 86 people landed in Rome on Wednesday. Later two C130 planes carrying a total of 200 people lifted off from Kabul in the afternoon and evening, Italy's defence ministry said. Claudi remained in Kabul to manage the return operations on site. ""In Afghanistan we are witnessing a great humanitarian tragedy and we are all doing our utmost,"" he said. Italy's minister of defence thanked the ""more than 1,500 Italian soldiers who are carrying out, non-stop, an extraordinary job to ensure the transport of Afghan collaborators and their families"". Taliban militants have shot dead a relative of a journalist they were hunting and seriously injured another. The militants were carrying out a house-to-house search in the western city of Herat to try to find the journalist from Deutsche Welle, who now works in Germany. Other relatives managed to escape and are now on the run. ""The killing of a close relative of one of our editors by the Taliban in Herat yesterday is inconceivably tragic, and testifies to the acute danger in which all our employees and their families in Afghanistan find themselves,"" DW's director general, Peter Limbourg said. It is evident that the Taliban are already carrying out organised searches for journalists, both in Kabul and in the provinces. We are running out of time!"" The Taliban have raided the homes of at least three DW journalists in recent weeks. The news of the killing comes as a UN document said the Taliban are intensifying their hunt for people who worked for and collaborated with Nato and US forces.

Leader Keir Starmer had supported the deal between the US and the Taliban last
year. The deal â secured by Donald Trump and signed in Doha, Qatar in
February 2020 â committed to the withdrawal of US and allied (including
British) troops from Afghanistan by May 2021. After his election, US President Joe Biden continued the plan
for withdrawal but with an end date of 31 August. At the time, Mr Wallace praised Mr Trumpâs deal as a âsmall but
important step towards the chance for Afghans to live in peace, free from
terrorism"". But in the past week, Mr Wallace has described the deal as
ârottenâ. He has said that just after the deal he publicly expressed that it was a
âmistakeâ, but we have yet to find a reference to this in either Parliamentary
records or news cuttings from the time. Ben Wallace, the UK's defence secretary, initially said Donald Trump's deal with the Taliban was ""rotten"" Mr Wallace said today: âI never heard from a single Labour MP when that deal was done, 18 months agoâ¦ one single criticism. In fact, Keir Starmer supported it, as did all other parties in the House of Commons.â We have found no evidence that Mr Starmer publicly supported last yearâs deal in the period after it was announced. But it should be noted he was not Labour leader then, and nor was there any debate in the Commons over the terms of the deal. In yesterdayâs debate Mr Starmer focused on the lack of planning for the withdrawal rather than saying he had opposed it and said: âNobody believes that Britain and our allies could have remained in Afghanistan indefinitely, or that Britain could have fought alone.â Mr Wallace also said this morning that he had âfelt uncomfortableâ about the Doha deal and âmade representations to the US and others at the timeâ. The mother of a soldier killed while serving in Afghanistan has insisted British troops did make a positive difference in the war-torn country. Royal Marine Jason Mackie, who lived in Oxford, died in an explosion in Helmand province in 2009. Marine Mackie's mother said the US-led intervention in the country had provided Afghans with respite from an oppressive regime. ""There was a certain amount of normality, women's rights and education was progressing"" she said. In recent days some veterans and relatives of deceased soldiers have question whether the return of the Taliban to the countrymeant 457 British soldiers had died in vain. Read more here. Vikas PandeyBBC News, Delhi The Taliban's blisteringly fast takeover of Afghanistan has stunned security and diplomacy experts worldwide. Days after the fall of Kabul, nations are hurriedly evacuating their diplomats and citizens, leaving behind two decades of work and investments. The Taliban's rout is likely to cause a significant shift in the geopolitics of South Asia, and it could be particularly testing for India, given the country's historically tense relations and borderdisputes with Pakistan and China- both are expected to play a crucial role in Afghanistan's future. Pakistan shares a porous border with Afghanistan and has long been an active player in its northern neighbour's affairs. Now China is showing an interest in playing a bigger role in Afghanistan. Foreign minister Wang Yi's meeting with senior Taliban leaders last month shows Beijing doesn't want to be a silent player anymore. This potential geopolitical realignment could ""change things upside down"", said Gautam Mukhopadhaya, India's former ambassador to Afghanistan and Syria. Read more from Vikas Many in India and Pakistan see the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan as Islamabad's win over India. But experts say that is too simplistic a view and Pakistan's hold over the Taliban has been exaggerated. Former Indian diplomat Jitendra Nath Misra told the BBC's Vikas Pandey that the Taliban did not recognise the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. ""Making the Taliban respect the border will be a top priority for Islamabad,"" he says. But there is no doubt that Pakistan now has better strategic reach in Afghanistan over India but they also have bigger issues to solve. And one of them is to ensure that the Tehrik-i-Taliban - the group responsible for launching attacks in Pakistan - do not get support from the Taliban in Afghanistan. Michael Kugelman, deputy director of the Wilson Center think-tank in Washington, says Pakistan shares a long and porous border with Afghanistan and that can cause all kinds of issues. The Taliban has released several known militants from jails and some of them could reenter Pakistan. ""So India is not likely to be the main factor for Pakistan at the moment,"" says Kugelman. Today ProgrammeBBC Radio 4 The former head of the US military has questioned President Biden's decision to withdraw American troops in the middle of Afghanistan's ""fighting season"". Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Admiral Mike Mullen also criticised Biden's failure to consult with US allies before withdrawing troops. ""We have had a real struggle here with respect to our relationships"" he said. ""I certainly understand how they would be both disappointed and raising questions about who we are and what we stand for"". Admiral Mullen, who oversaw the surge of US troops into Afghanistan under President Obama, noted that the US mission had some successes, including tackling the threat posed by al-Qaeda training camps, but accepted major mistakes had been made over the past 20 years. ""We got it wrong on the nation building side"" he said. ""We got it wrong with respect to the level of corruption under Karzaiâs government and Ghaniâs government, in the police and in the military and all the way up the chain and I think in great part that was the undoing of the mission.""

The Liberal leader is seeking a third term as prime minister in an autumn federal election. Canada now has massive transport aircraft on the ground in Kabul, Trudeau said, and has forces working with Afghans to get them out of the country. âThe limit, however, is not on Canadian capacity or Canadian airlifts; the limit on getting people out is the fact that the Taliban continue to block access for Afghans,â he said. This satellite image shows the traffic jams in Kabul as thousands of citizens and foreign nationals attempt to get to the airport - the last route out of Afghanistan for many. Scenes at the airport have become increasingly desperate with footage showing children being passed over walls to foreign soldiers and people trying to climb over barbed wire into the airport compound. Heavily-armed Taliban fighters now ring the airport's perimeter fence, and there are reports of shots being fired and injuries. One journalist reported seeing Taliban fighters also use sticks and rope to lash civilians. You can read more about the perilous journey to Kabul's airport here.  The government in Uganda says it is yet to decide whether it will take in 2,000 Afghan refugees, local media there is reporting. It comes after reports that the country would temporarily host them after a request made by the US. ""No decision has been made, whether they will come or not. It's a suggestion,  a proposal, discussions are going on... no substantive decision has been made,"" Daily Monitor reported Gen Jeje Odongo, from the foreign affairs committee, as saying on Thursday. He said that Uganda had been approached because it had a reputation internationally of helping people in distress. Uganda has a long history of welcoming refugees, and is currently home to around 1.3 million people. The East African nation has the largest number of refugees in any country in Africa - and the third largest in the world. President Joe Biden on Wednesday made a series of assertions about US policy in Afghanistan and the reasons behind his decision to withdraw forces from the country. But are they true? The BBC fact-checked some of his claims, comparing them with his earlier statements on Afghanistan and the situation on the ground. ""We trained and equipped an Afghan military force of some 300,000 strong"" This figure is contested, and considered by many experts to be a substantial overestimate. A recent investigation by BBC Newsnight has uncovered evidence suggesting thatthe size of the army could be low as 50,000- much lower even than the estimates of the US Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction. ""Are we gonna continue to lose thousands of Americans to injury and death to try to unite that country?"" Overall, since US forces invaded Afghanistan in October 2001, a total of1,897 US military personnel were killed in action in Afghanistan,externaland another 415 died from non-hostile causes, according to the US official monitoring body. From a peak at the height of the conflict a decade ago, the number of US casualties in Afghanistan has fallen in recent years. The last American combat deaths in Afghanistan were in February 2020. Read more of the BBC's analysis of Biden's Afghanistan claims.  Frank GardnerBBC Security Correspondent A recent UN report said there were still strong ethnic and marital ties between the Taliban and al-Qaeda Al-Qaeda has been relatively quiet these last few years but it hasnât gone away and now it is celebrating the return of the Taliban to power as a historic event and the start of forthcoming victories. Its branch in Yemen â Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula â once considered the most dangerous, has praised the Taliban as ""an honourable and loyal group"". This may not be what the Taliban leadership wants to hear publicly as they have promised to cut their ties to the proscribed terrorist organisation that used Afghanistan to plan the 9/11 attacks 20 years ago. There are currently estimated to be several hundred al-Qaeda militants in the country, some of whom have been reportedly sighted amidst the Talibanâs ranks. A recent UN report stated there were still strong ethnic and marital ties between the two groups. Without a Western military presence in Afghanistan, or a cooperative local intelligence service, it will now be much harder to identify and intercept al-Qaedaâs activities, especially in remote, rugged areas like Kunar province. Elsewhere in the world, al-Qaedaâs affiliates in East and West Africa have been steadily recruiting. They will have had a significant morale boost from what al-Qaeda sees as a humiliating defeat for the West. Read Frank Gardner's piece on foreign fighters in Afghanistan here BBC OS The BBC spoke with two interpreters who are still in the country Two interpreters who are still stuck in Afghanistan have explained how they fear for their lives under Taliban rule. Jay and Marwa have worked with foreign troops and government aid agencies, and spoke to BBC OS on World Service radio. ""I am still in shock, the shock of losing everything. I am not living anymore,"" Marwa said. ""I didn't have a plan to get a visa or get out. I had planned to stay here in my country to work for my people."" Marwa added that one of her former colleagues was killed two months ago and was warned by colleagues that things were getting worse. ""I had this passion to stay here and now I see how cruel people like the Taliban are,"" she added. ""The Taliban have searched my own house, they have messaged me, they have told me that I am the leader of the enemies of the Taliban,"" Jay said. ""They have seized my house, I'm not going to go there again, but it's not enough for them. They're looking for my life and the life of my family and that's exactly what they will be doing with every ally of the international forces.""

Turkey President Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday urged Europe's leaders to take responsibility for the migrants now fleeing Afghanistan. Turkey has no intention of becoming ""Europe's migrant storage unit"", in the face of the ongoing chaos, he said, according to Reuters news agency. Since the Taliban's takeover this past weekend, tens of thousands of Afghans have scrambled to evacuate. Many have crossed into Turkey, according to migrant aid groups and state media. Turkey is home to some 4 million refugees, the majority of them Syrians who fled their country's civil war.The UN estimates,externalTurkey currently hosts the most refugees of any country worldwide. Now, somewhere between 500 and 2,000 Afghans are estimated to arrive in Turkey every day. Speaking after a cabinet meeting, Erdogan also said that Turkey could engage in discussions with a Taliban-led government in Afghanistan regarding their ""common agendas"". Ned Price said the US is trying to process enough people as they possibly can Ned Price, spokesman for the US Department of State, is currently giving an update on the situation in Afghanistan. He said that the US is continuing to deploy additional consular officers to help evacuate people, including sending teams to Qatar and Kuwait. Price added that there are currently 6,000 people at Kabul airport that have been fully processed and are waiting to board planes out of the country. Some 20 flights are set to leave on Thursday evening. He said that the US has ""significantly expanded"" how many American citizens, locally employed staff and special immigrant visa applications are eligible to leave Afghanistan. Asked about those unable to reach the airport, Price said the state department had seen reports of ""congestion"" getting to the airport. ""We are doing everything we can,"" he said, adding that the US has made it clear to the Taliban that ""safe passage should be guaranteed for all of those who wish to transit to the airport"". Thursday marks the 102nd anniversary of Afghanistan's independence, and small numbers of Afghans took to the streets waving their national flag in protest against the Taliban. The militants have been replacing the black, red and green national flag with their own white one. There were reports of casualties at a similar protest in Asadabad in the east of the country on Thursday, and three people were reported killed after shots were fired at a protest in the city of Jalalabad on Wednesday.

"This video can not be played Ben Wallace: ""Every hour counts"" of Kabul evacuation No plane carrying Britons and Afghans from Kabul has left empty, the UK defence secretary has said. Ben Wallace rejected reports that some flights from Kabul contained only a few people, saying the UK was ""absolutely ploughing through the numbers"". He told BBC Breakfast ""every hour counts"" and confirmed ""the Taliban are letting our people through"". But Taliban checkpoints ring the perimeter of the airport and chaotic scenes have been unfolding outside. About 4,500 US troops are in temporary control of Karzai International Airport,with about 900 British soldiers also on patrol at the siteas part of efforts to secure the evacuation flights. The Taliban are blocking Afghans without travel documents from entering. Twelve people have been killed in and around Kabul airport since Sunday, according to a Taliban official quoted by the Reuters news agency. But even those with valid papers have struggled to get to the airport, with reports that some have been beaten by Taliban guards. An Afghan interpreter who worked for the British army said he received permission to come to the UK last week, butwas now in hidingand would ""face death"" if the Taliban found him. Biden says no American will be left behind in Kabul Interpreter who worked for UK begs PM for help How many Afghan asylum seekers has the UK taken in? Chaos at Kabul airport amid scramble to evacuate Gharghasht Hidai, a British Afghan, said there was shooting at the airport as he and his family prepared to leave. ""The situation was chaotic"", he said, with one of his children having to sit on the floor of the packed RAF plane. ""We are the lucky ones, we made it."" Gharghasht Hidai and his family have fled Afghanistan and are quarantining in Manchester Peymana Assad, a London councillor who was visiting relatives in Kabul, saidshe joined hundreds of people walking along the traffic-jammed road to the airportto escape - only to find she reached the UK meeting point too late. Ms Assad, who had previously left Afghanistan as a three-year-old refugee, said a local family allowed her to wait at their home until she could contact the Foreign Office and arrange to join a later RAF evacuation flight. A British medical student, another former refugee who returned to Kabul in July to get married, spoke to the PA news agency on Thursday as he tried for a fourth time to get to the airport. On a previous attempt, he said he waited for 10 hours but could not get past the crowds to reach the airport gate. This time, he said there were gunshots being fired and people trying to flee. The defence secretary said the UK would continue to stay in Afghanistan as long as the US ran the airport, but said the government was also already investing in ""third country hubs"" for processing people ""if they get out to other countries in the region"". It's now a race against the clock to get as many people out of Kabul as possible. The BBC has been told there are several thousand UK nationals and dual passport holders who still need to get out of the country. Eight RAF flights went in and out of Kabul yesterday with a similar number expected today. They have the capacity to fly more than 1,000 people a day. But the BBC understands that not all flights have been full. The airport is operating to a strict schedule. That means aircraft can't just wait around until all their seats are filled. Most are being flown to a Middle East hub. Commercial charters are being used to make the onward journey. The greatest challenge at present appears to be processing the people who qualify to be flown out. One person who's trying to get people out told the BBC the ""system is working, but it's slow"". Those wishing to fly out are being told to wait for a phone call before setting out for the airport - not least to avoid the risks of travelling through a city under Taliban control. At some stage someone will have to make the decision to leave. That will once again be the decision of the US, which is providing the bulk of the security at the airport as well as overseeing Air Traffic Control. They too need to be flown out. Mr Wallace said seven to 10 RAF planes were taking off every day, with at least 138 due on the next flight out. He said the passengers on the flights out of Afghanistan this week had included British government personnel, British citizens, media and human rights staff and Afghans who had worked for the UK. Downing Street said military flights took about 1,200 people out of Kabul between Saturday and 08:00 BST on Wednesday, about 900 of whom were Afghan nationals and the remainder British citizens. Since late June, 2,000 Afghans who worked for the UK have been resettled with their families under the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (ARAP), according to the Home Office, with a target of 5,000 by the end of 2021. This video can not be played This plane from Kabul, carrying Afghans and British nationals, landed at a Midlands Airport on Wednesday The UK has also committed to take in up to 20,000 Afghan refugees over the next few years under a separate resettlement scheme - including 5,000 this year. Two evacuation flights came into the UK on Wednesday, the Ministry of Defence said - a military plane into RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire and a passenger plane into an unnamed civilian airport. On board were Afghans being relocated under the ARAP scheme for those who worked with the British military, British citizens and some other foreign nationals. The MoD did not provide exact numbers but said each flight could hold about 250 passengers. Mr Wallace said a plane left Kabul on Thursday morning carrying ""115 people and their families - those are the Afghans on there as opposed to other personnel"". He added: ""None of our planes are leaving empty... our planes never leave empty. If we have spaces on them, we offer them up to other nations."" Downing Street said the UK helped to fly 76 Australians out of Afghanistan on an RAF plane on Wednesday. British nationals and Afghan evacuees depart a flight from Afghanistan at RAF Brize Norton on 17 August 2021 He said: ""We have a full programme today of many more people coming out - trying to reach our... capability towards the end of the month. And that is so far on track.... we are doing it as fast as we can."" Mr Wallace said many of the flights were at full capacity. ""You and I wouldn't be allowed to fly some of the way those planes are flying in safety, so we are taking considerable risk"", he said, adding: ""Alongside those people will be troops or others coming in and out."" The defence secretary said additional UK troops would be deployed to Afghanistan to help manage public order on the ground at Kabul airport. Meanwhile, Labour has accused Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab of putting interpreters' lives at risk after he declined to phone the Afghan foreign minister to get help for the evacuation. The BBC has been told the call was made by a junior minister instead. ButMr Wallace said ""the only thing that mattered""was whether Kabul airport would continue to allow people to get out, telling BBC Breakfast: ""No amount of phone calls to an Afghan government at that time would have made any difference.""

"More than 125,000 16 and 17-year-olds in England have had a Covid vaccine in the two weeks since the NHS was given the green light to offer them a jab One of the scientists advising the government on fighting the Covid pandemic says a decision on a booster jab programme is imminent It has yet to be decided who would be the first to get a third jab but a meeting is being held this morning Having two Covid vaccine doses remains the best way to protect against the Delta variant, a large study concludes The number of patients in hospital with Covid is at its highest level in five months, with 6,321 in the latest count taken earlier this week A first Covid case has been detected in the Tokyo Paralympics village, just days before the Games are due to start Edited by Chris Clayton Today's live page is coming to a close now. Thank you for
joining us. It was brought to you by John Hand, Chris Clayton, Alex Therrien,
Jo Couzens and James Clarke. Weâll be ending our live coverage for today shortly but,
before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main coronavirus headlines from the
UK and around the world: The World Health Organization (WHO) has called on countries to ensure that health services across Afghanistan are maintained, as it warned of increasing cases of Covid-19 across the country. The organisation's regional director, Dr Ahmed Al-Mandhari, said that WHO teams in areas which had seen large influxes of people fleeing the Taliban advance are now reporting increasing cases of people with Covid-like symptoms. According to the WHO, there have been 152,365 cases of coronavirus in the country and 7,043 deaths. However, Afghanistan has limited testing capacity and reporting of cases across the country is sketchy. A survey conducted by the Ministry of Health last year estimated that as many as 10 million Afghans - or 31.5% of the population - may have contracted the virus. WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic also warned that the chaos at Kabul airport, where thousands of people are trying to flee the Taliban, is slowing deliveries of crucial medical supplies. Refugees at the airport are being tested for the virus before boarding evacuation flights. The UK is to get a vaccine booster scheme from September, the health secretary says. Sajid Javid made the comment after the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) met earlier today to discuss a potential Covid-19 booster campaign for people who need a third dose. He said: ""We are going to have a booster scheme. It will start some time in September. ""I couldn't tell you exactly when because before we start it... we need to get the final advice from our group of experts, our independent scientific and medical advisers, the JCVI, and so we're waiting for their final opinion."" But the health secretary says he is ""confident we can start in September"" offering a third jab to the most vulnerable people. He adds that the government will only want to continue with their plans on the expert advice of the JCVI. ""I don't want to prejudge what they're going to say but, based on their interim advice, I think we can be confident that we will start a booster scheme next month."" Read morehere. The number of pregnant women in England taking
up the Covid vaccine rose in the last two weeks
of July. More than 10,000 women who are pregnant, or believe they could be, have come forward to receive their first dose, according
to the latest data from Public Health England. It means 62,311 pregnant women have
now had a jab, including 43,737 who have had two doses. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisations at PHE, said:âIt
is encouraging that thousands of women have now benefited from the vital
protection of a Covid-19 vaccine. However, many more may remain unvaccinated and we
urge them to take up the offer.â PHE says Covid vaccines
are safe for pregnant women, and they should get the jab to protect themselves and their babies.
Covid-19 can cause serious complications in the later stages of pregnancies. Hajrah Aslam went through 11 weeks of rehabilitation at a specialist centre A Covid patient who gave birth before going into an induced coma
for six weeks has made an ""incredible"" recovery, a specialist rehab
facility says. Hajrah Aslam, from Peterborough, caught coronavirus when she was
35 weeks pregnant. She was put into a coma after her oxygen levels dropped
dangerously low. The 28-year-old is now recovering with her son after going
through 11 weeks of rehabilitation at Askham Rehab in Cambridgeshire. Sara Neaves, clinical lead at the rehab centre, said: ""Considering
the condition she was in when she arrived, an 11-week discharge is an
incredible feat."" Here are some of the latest graphics explaining the
coronavirus situation in the UK. The Covid-19 vaccine rollout in England is estimated to have directly averted between 91,700 and 98,700 deaths, according to figures from Public Health England (PHE). Previous estimates had put the figures between 81,300 and 87,800 deaths. The latest numbers from PHE also indicate the vaccination programme has directly averted more than 82,100 hospital admissions - up from a previous estimate of more than 66,900. Between 23.6 million and 24.4 million infections are estimated to have prevented - up from between 22.9 million and 23.8 million. Thelatest figures,externalshow that deaths have increased by 9.6% per 100,000 people
from the previous week (6 to 12 August), with 674 recorded in the last
seven days, a rise of 59. Cases have risen 7.8% per 100,000 people
from the previous week, with 214,736 recorded between 13
and 19 August, a rise of 15,530. Another 47,284 people in the UK have had a first dose
of a coronavirus vaccine, the government figures show. In total, 87.3% of the adult population has now had at least one jab. And a further 169,223 have had a second
vaccine dose now. As of today, 75.7% of the adult
population has now had both jabs. There have been a further 36,572 cases of coronavirus reported in the UK today, according to thelatest government figures,external. And there have been another 113 deaths, of people who had tested positive for the virus within the previous 28 days. Toyota is to slash worldwide vehicle production by 40% in September because of a global microchip shortage. The world's biggest carmaker had planned to make almost 900,000 cars next month, but has now reduced that to 540,000 vehicles. Volkswagen, the world's second-biggest car producer, has warned it may also be forced to cut output further. The Covid pandemic boosted demand for appliances that use chips, such as phones, TVs and games consoles. New cars often include dozens of microchips and Toyota benefited from having built a larger stockpile of chips - also called semiconductors - as part of a revamp to its business continuity plan, developed in the wake of the Fukushima earthquake and tsunami a decade ago. The decision to cut production now has been precipitated by the resurgence of coronavirus cases across Asia hitting supplies. Read morehere. A six-day nationwide lockdown began on Monday to combat the coronavirus Iranâs official death toll from Covid-19 has passed
100,000, as the Middle Eastâs worst-hit country struggles with a fifth wave of infections. The health ministry reported 564 deaths over the previous
24 hours on Thursday, bringing the overall total to 100,255, state media said. The
number of confirmed cases meanwhile rose by 31,266 to 4,587,683. However,
experts believe the real figures are far higher. Iran has seen a surge of infections driven by the Delta
variant since late June and has reported 12,000 deaths in the past month. On Monday, a six-day lockdown was imposed, with private travel
between provinces banned and government buildings and non-essential businesses shut. The government has also promised to step up its
vaccination programme, which has seen just under 20% of the 83 million population
given at least one dose. Iran has so far relied mostly on vaccines from China and Russia. But officials said last week that the importing of Pfizer and
Moderna vaccines would be permitted, so long as they were not produced in the US
or UK. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had forbidden the use of vaccines made
in the two countries in January. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China is today celebrating that it has carried
out more than 1.9 billion vaccinations. This equates to about two thirds of
its 1.4 billion population having received two doses. The country has hopes that 80% of its population will
be vaccinated by early next year. And there has been a notable trend in recent
weeks of areas moving to impose restrictions that prohibit the movements of
unvaccinated people. The national Global Times newspaper reports that
some will be recognised as vaccine-exempt. However, it says the governments ofEcheng,externalandShiyan,external, in central Hubei province, have said that if you do not have a valid reason for
remaining unvaccinated, this could impact your personal credit record. The authorities in Guigang and Laibin, in southern
Guangxi, say that unvaccinated individuals can no longer enter schools, medical
institutes, or nursing homes. In the central city of Nanchang, unvaccinated
people are no longer allowed to go on business trips. While there is fresh support for such measures
helping to keep people Covid-safe, earlier attempts to impose restrictions on the
unvaccinated were fiercely criticised. Back in April, a town in Hainan issued an apology
and made a U-turn, after ittried to ban unvaccinated people,externalfrom using public
transport, and visiting restaurants and supermarkets. Being double-vaccinated offers the best protection against the Delta variant, first identified in India and now dominant in the UK, according to a new study. But people who have had both doses can still catch and transmit the disease, so researchers say it is essential as many people as possible get the jab. Everyone aged 16 and over in the UK can now receive the Covid vaccine, and a third jab for the most vulnerable is being considered. Those who are 16 and 17 are currently being offered a first vaccine dose and, as we've been reporting, more than 125,000 of them have done so in the past two weeks. But there is currently no timescale for when they could be given a second one. The vaccine has already beenapproved for over-12s with underlying conditions or those who live with others at high risk, but there are no plans to give it routinely to this age group. Millions of people most vulnerable to Covid-19may be offered a third vaccination- along with the annual flu jab -from September, though the JCVI has not yet offered final guidance.

Nicole Kidman (pictured last year) is in Hong Kong to film a new television series Nicole Kidman has come under fire for apparently circumventing strict quarantine rules for international travellers. The Australian actress's arrival in Hong Kong has sparked widespread anger after she was reportedly spotted out and about two days after touching down. This is despite the region having some of the strictest rules in place, with up to 21 days' quarantine required. There has been no direct, official comment on a possible exemption. However, Hong Kong's Commerce and Economic Development Bureau sent out a statement on Thursday in response to questions about ""overseas film personnel"" and quarantine, explaining restrictions are waived ""to carry out designated professional work"".

Tom BatemanBBC Middle East correspondent About 5% of the Gaza's population has received at least one dose of a vaccine The Grand Mufti of Gaza has called on Palestinians to get
vaccinated as soon as possible. In a video message, Sheikh Hassan al-Lahhan says whoever
delays doing so is a âsinnerâ and describes anyone who transmits the virus
unintentionally as a âmistaken killerâ. As Gazaâs top Islamic cleric, he oversees the religious
affairs ministry in the Hamas-run territory. The attempt to encourage vaccine take-up comes as
Covid-19 rates start to surge again in Gaza, where the health system is
crippled amid Israelâs blockade and after years of conflict. Vaccine delivery to the occupied Palestinian territories
has been painfully slow, but aid groups say misinformation and vaccine
hesitancy is also hindering levels of protection. In Gaza a little more than 120,000 people have received
at least one dose - only about 5% of the Stripâs population. The manager of a hotel at the centre of a school prom Covid spike says he was assured everyone had passed a lateral flow test before attending the event.

Northern Ireland is facing the prospect of ""a very difficult winter"" due to rising Covid-19 cases and a return of other respiratory viruses, the chief medical officer has warned. Sir Michael McBride said people had not been exposed to many viruses other than Covid-19, contributing to a ""perfect storm"" of additional pressures. He said hospitals were already under pressures normally seen in mid-winter. Hospital staff were ""physically tired and exhausted"", he added. On Wednesday11 further Covid-related deaths were recorded, the highest number since mid-February. All over-16s in the UK are now being offered a single dose of Covid vaccine, as well as some younger vulnerable teenagers. InEngland they will be offered their jab by 23 August, the government has said. There are an estimated 1.4 million people in this age group and they don't need parental consent, as they are considered capable of making their own medical treatment decisions. Children aged 12 to 15 who are at higher risk of Covid due to underlying health conditions will also be offered the jab, but there are currently no plans to vaccinate healthy children of this age. Being double vaccinated still offers the best protection against the Delta variant, first identified in India and now dominant in the UK, according to a new study. But people who have had both doses can still catch and transmit the disease, so researchers say it is essential that as many people are possible get the jab. BBC health reporter Philippa Roxby looks at everything the under-30s need to know about the vaccine. More than 125,000 16 and 17-year-olds in England have received a Covid vaccine in the two weeks since the NHS was given the green light to offer them a jab. It means more than 360,000 people aged 16 and 17 have now had their jab - including those previously eligible due to an underlying health condition, according to the NHS. The health service said it is sending out one million letters inviting this age group to get vaccinated. GPs are also inviting at-risk children aged between 12 and 15, who are clinically vulnerable to Covid or live with adults who are at increased risk of serious illness from the virus, to take up the jab. The NHS said 30,000 children in this age group are already protected. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Afghan interpreter who worked for UK begs PM for ""pathway to safety"" An Afghan interpreter who worked for the British army has begged the UK government to evacuate him and his family from Afghanistan. Ahmed - not his real name - said he received permission to come to the UK last week, but a day later the Taliban seized control of the capital, Kabul. He said he was now in hiding and would ""face death"" if the Taliban found him. UK troops are continuing to evacuate British nationals and Afghans who are eligible to resettle in the UK. Afghan interpreters and others who worked for the UK government can come to the UK as part of the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (ARAP). However,chaotic scenes have been reported outside Kabul international airportwith access to it being controlled by Taliban militants, who are reportedly not permitting Afghans without documents or passports to enter. How many Afghan asylum seekers has the UK taken in? Johnson attacked from all sides over Afghanistan Patel: I don't believe Taliban on women's rights Ahmed, who worked with British troops for three years, told the BBC he was initially rejected for the ARAP scheme in April. He appealed against the decision and last week received an email saying he was eligible for relocation. He woke the next morning to find Kabul was under the Taliban flag. He said that he had been left stuck in a ""horrible"" situation. ""Life has ended for us when Kabul collapsed, we are just left behind in a dark room,"" he said. Ahmed worked for three years with British troops - who he describes as ""his brothers"" There are fears that Afghans who worked with Western authorities or groups could be at higher risk of reprisals from the Taliban.The group has denied this,but Ahmed said he did not believe them. ""Taliban are not trustableâ¦ if they find me, there will be no mercy,"" he said. ""I have done a lot of patrols, missions, shoulder to shoulder with British armies, like a family, like a brother. ""It's a major threat for me if I go out, they know me. There will be no mercy and I will face death."" Ahmed said that when he worked with UK soldiers, the Taliban used to target interpreters as they were the ""eyes and ears"" of the forces. Asked what he would say to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson about his family's situation, he said: ""I just want him to provide a pathway to safety for me and my family. I beg him."" British nationals and Afghan evacuees have been arriving on RAF planes at Brize Norton Half a dozen flights are due to arrive in the UK from Afghanistan in the next day or so, according to the Ministry of Defence. One landed at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire in the early hours of Thursday morning. No details were given about how many people were on board, or who they were. Downing Street however did not deny a report that one plane had taken off ""almost empty"" on Wednesday morning because people could not get through the airport. The British ambassador to Afghanistan, Sir Laurie Bristow, said Foreign Office personnel were hoping to get ""at least"" 1,000 people out of the country every day - but warned there were ""days, not weeks"" left to complete the mission. About 2,000 Afghan former staff and their families have come to the UK via ARAP this year, according to the Home Office, with a target of 5,000 by the end of 2021. The UK government has alsocommitted to take in up to 20,000 Afghan refugees over the next few yearsunder a new resettlement scheme - including 5,000 this year. Downing Street said the government would be encouraging international partners to emulate ""one of the most generous asylum schemes in British history"". However, shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy was critical of the new scheme, telling BBC's Question Time it was ""absolutely clear that 5,000 is too small a number over the next 12 months"" and called for a ""more generous offer"" to be made. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab is due to speak on Thursday with fellow G7 ministers - which includes the US, Canada, Japan, Germany, France and Italy, along with the UK - to discuss international co-operation. The G7 leaders are also set to hold a virtual meeting next week. On Wednesday,Mr Johnson faced a barrage of criticism from MPsacross the political spectrum over the UK's role in Afghanistan, in an emergency House of Commons debate on the crisis. The prime minister also spoke with his Italian counterpart Mario Draghi as he continued his efforts to bring the G7 together on its Afghanistan position.

"The Competition and Markets Authority has told the BBC it warned government officials that consumers could face risks from the fast-growing Covid PCR testing industry in April and May. The business and competition regulator said it provided advice and market analysis to officials from the Department of Health and Social Care. It said the advice detailed potential market and consumer risks. It comes after the CMA was criticised by its former chairman this week. Lord Tyrietold the BBCthat the situation with PCR testing for travel was a 'predictable Covid rip-off', and that the competitions watchdog hadn't done enough. Cost of NHS Covid tests for UK arrivals reduced Watchdog will look at Covid test cost immediately Anger at overflowing Covid test drop boxes The government has said it was provided with some general market analysis from the CMA on the potential implications for the PCR testing market and that its advice informed the government's approach on the private provider list. The CMA said it cannot disclose this information. The revelation comes after a summer of complaints from travellers and holidaymakers who have taken a holiday or visited family who they've been cut off from because of the pandemic. The UK government has made it a condition of any international travel that tests before travel, and on your arrival in the UK are mandatory. The number of tests that are needed is dependent on your arrival from either a green or amber country or your vaccination status. Arrivals from red countries must still use quarantine hotel facilities. Some of the most common complaints from travellers mention tests listed on the government's list of providers that don't exist at the price advertised whilst others allege poor service. At the start of August, the Health Secretary asked the competition watchdog to investigate ""excessive"" pricing and ""exploitative practices"" among PCR Covid test firms. In a letter to the CMA, Sajid Javid said it was time for a ""rapid high-level"" review to protect consumers. The BBC understands that a full CMA market study or investigation would require a formal consultation before an investigation could be launched and these investigations typically last between 6 and 18 months. Therefore, a wholesale reform of the market could be difficult because of time constraints. It is understood that due to the time and process needed for a full review of the market, the Government was advised it is better placed to tackle immediate issues in this market. The travel industry has been demanding action, after complaining about the 'onerous' level of testing in place, which they believe is a barrier to passenger revival. But, given the lateness of any government intervention, and the impact on the travel sector, people in industry believe the damage has already been done. Julie Lo Bue Said, chief executive of Advantage Travel Partnership, the UK's largest group of independent leisure & business travel agent experts, said ""it feels like a PR exercise for the government to come out and say 'we're looking at this now'. ""It is far too late, when the public has had to pay for all these tests,"" she added. On Friday, Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary announced that the price of PCR Covid tests provided by NHS Test & Trace for travel would fall, by Â£20 for one test to Â£68, and by Â£35 for two tests to Â£138. The Government has consistently maintained that testing for travellers is in place to protect public health.

"More than 125,000 16 and 17-year-olds in England have had a Covid vaccine in the two weeks since the NHS was given the green light to offer them a jab One of the scientists advising the government on fighting the Covid pandemic says a decision on a booster jab programme is imminent It has yet to be decided who would be the first to get a third jab but a meeting is being held this morning Having two Covid vaccine doses remains the best way to protect against the Delta variant, a large study concludes The number of patients in hospital with Covid is at its highest level in five months, with 6,321 in the latest count taken earlier this week A first Covid case has been detected in the Tokyo Paralympics village, just days before the Games are due to start Edited by Chris Clayton Today's live page is coming to a close now. Thank you for
joining us. It was brought to you by John Hand, Chris Clayton, Alex Therrien,
Jo Couzens and James Clarke. Weâll be ending our live coverage for today shortly but,
before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main coronavirus headlines from the
UK and around the world: The World Health Organization (WHO) has called on countries to ensure that health services across Afghanistan are maintained, as it warned of increasing cases of Covid-19 across the country. The organisation's regional director, Dr Ahmed Al-Mandhari, said that WHO teams in areas which had seen large influxes of people fleeing the Taliban advance are now reporting increasing cases of people with Covid-like symptoms. According to the WHO, there have been 152,365 cases of coronavirus in the country and 7,043 deaths. However, Afghanistan has limited testing capacity and reporting of cases across the country is sketchy. A survey conducted by the Ministry of Health last year estimated that as many as 10 million Afghans - or 31.5% of the population - may have contracted the virus. WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic also warned that the chaos at Kabul airport, where thousands of people are trying to flee the Taliban, is slowing deliveries of crucial medical supplies. Refugees at the airport are being tested for the virus before boarding evacuation flights. The UK is to get a vaccine booster scheme from September, the health secretary says. Sajid Javid made the comment after the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) met earlier today to discuss a potential Covid-19 booster campaign for people who need a third dose. He said: ""We are going to have a booster scheme. It will start some time in September. ""I couldn't tell you exactly when because before we start it... we need to get the final advice from our group of experts, our independent scientific and medical advisers, the JCVI, and so we're waiting for their final opinion."" But the health secretary says he is ""confident we can start in September"" offering a third jab to the most vulnerable people. He adds that the government will only want to continue with their plans on the expert advice of the JCVI. ""I don't want to prejudge what they're going to say but, based on their interim advice, I think we can be confident that we will start a booster scheme next month."" Read morehere. The number of pregnant women in England taking
up the Covid vaccine rose in the last two weeks
of July. More than 10,000 women who are pregnant, or believe they could be, have come forward to receive their first dose, according
to the latest data from Public Health England. It means 62,311 pregnant women have
now had a jab, including 43,737 who have had two doses. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisations at PHE, said:âIt
is encouraging that thousands of women have now benefited from the vital
protection of a Covid-19 vaccine. However, many more may remain unvaccinated and we
urge them to take up the offer.â PHE says Covid vaccines
are safe for pregnant women, and they should get the jab to protect themselves and their babies.
Covid-19 can cause serious complications in the later stages of pregnancies. Hajrah Aslam went through 11 weeks of rehabilitation at a specialist centre A Covid patient who gave birth before going into an induced coma
for six weeks has made an ""incredible"" recovery, a specialist rehab
facility says. Hajrah Aslam, from Peterborough, caught coronavirus when she was
35 weeks pregnant. She was put into a coma after her oxygen levels dropped
dangerously low. The 28-year-old is now recovering with her son after going
through 11 weeks of rehabilitation at Askham Rehab in Cambridgeshire. Sara Neaves, clinical lead at the rehab centre, said: ""Considering
the condition she was in when she arrived, an 11-week discharge is an
incredible feat."" Here are some of the latest graphics explaining the
coronavirus situation in the UK. The Covid-19 vaccine rollout in England is estimated to have directly averted between 91,700 and 98,700 deaths, according to figures from Public Health England (PHE). Previous estimates had put the figures between 81,300 and 87,800 deaths. The latest numbers from PHE also indicate the vaccination programme has directly averted more than 82,100 hospital admissions - up from a previous estimate of more than 66,900. Between 23.6 million and 24.4 million infections are estimated to have prevented - up from between 22.9 million and 23.8 million. Thelatest figures,externalshow that deaths have increased by 9.6% per 100,000 people
from the previous week (6 to 12 August), with 674 recorded in the last
seven days, a rise of 59. Cases have risen 7.8% per 100,000 people
from the previous week, with 214,736 recorded between 13
and 19 August, a rise of 15,530. Another 47,284 people in the UK have had a first dose
of a coronavirus vaccine, the government figures show. In total, 87.3% of the adult population has now had at least one jab. And a further 169,223 have had a second
vaccine dose now. As of today, 75.7% of the adult
population has now had both jabs. There have been a further 36,572 cases of coronavirus reported in the UK today, according to thelatest government figures,external. And there have been another 113 deaths, of people who had tested positive for the virus within the previous 28 days. Toyota is to slash worldwide vehicle production by 40% in September because of a global microchip shortage. The world's biggest carmaker had planned to make almost 900,000 cars next month, but has now reduced that to 540,000 vehicles. Volkswagen, the world's second-biggest car producer, has warned it may also be forced to cut output further. The Covid pandemic boosted demand for appliances that use chips, such as phones, TVs and games consoles. New cars often include dozens of microchips and Toyota benefited from having built a larger stockpile of chips - also called semiconductors - as part of a revamp to its business continuity plan, developed in the wake of the Fukushima earthquake and tsunami a decade ago. The decision to cut production now has been precipitated by the resurgence of coronavirus cases across Asia hitting supplies. Read morehere. A six-day nationwide lockdown began on Monday to combat the coronavirus Iranâs official death toll from Covid-19 has passed
100,000, as the Middle Eastâs worst-hit country struggles with a fifth wave of infections. The health ministry reported 564 deaths over the previous
24 hours on Thursday, bringing the overall total to 100,255, state media said. The
number of confirmed cases meanwhile rose by 31,266 to 4,587,683. However,
experts believe the real figures are far higher. Iran has seen a surge of infections driven by the Delta
variant since late June and has reported 12,000 deaths in the past month. On Monday, a six-day lockdown was imposed, with private travel
between provinces banned and government buildings and non-essential businesses shut. The government has also promised to step up its
vaccination programme, which has seen just under 20% of the 83 million population
given at least one dose. Iran has so far relied mostly on vaccines from China and Russia. But officials said last week that the importing of Pfizer and
Moderna vaccines would be permitted, so long as they were not produced in the US
or UK. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had forbidden the use of vaccines made
in the two countries in January. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China is today celebrating that it has carried
out more than 1.9 billion vaccinations. This equates to about two thirds of
its 1.4 billion population having received two doses. The country has hopes that 80% of its population will
be vaccinated by early next year. And there has been a notable trend in recent
weeks of areas moving to impose restrictions that prohibit the movements of
unvaccinated people. The national Global Times newspaper reports that
some will be recognised as vaccine-exempt. However, it says the governments ofEcheng,externalandShiyan,external, in central Hubei province, have said that if you do not have a valid reason for
remaining unvaccinated, this could impact your personal credit record. The authorities in Guigang and Laibin, in southern
Guangxi, say that unvaccinated individuals can no longer enter schools, medical
institutes, or nursing homes. In the central city of Nanchang, unvaccinated
people are no longer allowed to go on business trips. While there is fresh support for such measures
helping to keep people Covid-safe, earlier attempts to impose restrictions on the
unvaccinated were fiercely criticised. Back in April, a town in Hainan issued an apology
and made a U-turn, after ittried to ban unvaccinated people,externalfrom using public
transport, and visiting restaurants and supermarkets. Being double-vaccinated offers the best protection against the Delta variant, first identified in India and now dominant in the UK, according to a new study. But people who have had both doses can still catch and transmit the disease, so researchers say it is essential as many people as possible get the jab. Everyone aged 16 and over in the UK can now receive the Covid vaccine, and a third jab for the most vulnerable is being considered. Those who are 16 and 17 are currently being offered a first vaccine dose and, as we've been reporting, more than 125,000 of them have done so in the past two weeks. But there is currently no timescale for when they could be given a second one. The vaccine has already beenapproved for over-12s with underlying conditions or those who live with others at high risk, but there are no plans to give it routinely to this age group. Millions of people most vulnerable to Covid-19may be offered a third vaccination- along with the annual flu jab -from September, though the JCVI has not yet offered final guidance.

Nicole Kidman (pictured last year) is in Hong Kong to film a new television series Nicole Kidman has come under fire for apparently circumventing strict quarantine rules for international travellers. The Australian actress's arrival in Hong Kong has sparked widespread anger after she was reportedly spotted out and about two days after touching down. This is despite the region having some of the strictest rules in place, with up to 21 days' quarantine required. There has been no direct, official comment on a possible exemption. However, Hong Kong's Commerce and Economic Development Bureau sent out a statement on Thursday in response to questions about ""overseas film personnel"" and quarantine, explaining restrictions are waived ""to carry out designated professional work"". Kidman is in Hong Kong to film a new show about the lives of wealthy, glamorous ex-pats - already a source of tension as locals contend with increasing restrictions under the new national security law. Reports of the waiver have only stoked outrage further, with comments on both Twitter and Chinese social media platform Sina Weibo overwhelmingly critical. Read morehere.

On Friday, Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary announced that the price of PCR Covid tests provided by NHS Test & Trace for travel would fall, by Â£20 for one test to Â£68, and by Â£35 for two tests to Â£138. The Government has consistently maintained that testing for travellers is in place to protect public health.

"This video can not be played Ben Wallace: ""Every hour counts"" of Kabul evacuation No plane carrying Britons and Afghans from Kabul has left empty, the UK defence secretary has said. Ben Wallace rejected reports that some flights from Kabul contained only a few people, saying the UK was ""absolutely ploughing through the numbers"". He told BBC Breakfast ""every hour counts"" and confirmed ""the Taliban are letting our people through"". But Taliban checkpoints ring the perimeter of the airport and chaotic scenes have been unfolding outside. About 4,500 US troops are in temporary control of Karzai International Airport,with about 900 British soldiers also on patrol at the siteas part of efforts to secure the evacuation flights. The Taliban are blocking Afghans without travel documents from entering. Twelve people have been killed in and around Kabul airport since Sunday, according to a Taliban official quoted by the Reuters news agency. But even those with valid papers have struggled to get to the airport, with reports that some have been beaten by Taliban guards. An Afghan interpreter who worked for the British army said he received permission to come to the UK last week, butwas now in hidingand would ""face death"" if the Taliban found him. Biden says no American will be left behind in Kabul Interpreter who worked for UK begs PM for help How many Afghan asylum seekers has the UK taken in? Chaos at Kabul airport amid scramble to evacuate Gharghasht Hidai, a British Afghan, said there was shooting at the airport as he and his family prepared to leave. ""The situation was chaotic"", he said, with one of his children having to sit on the floor of the packed RAF plane. ""We are the lucky ones, we made it."" Gharghasht Hidai and his family have fled Afghanistan and are quarantining in Manchester Peymana Assad, a London councillor who was visiting relatives in Kabul, saidshe joined hundreds of people walking along the traffic-jammed road to the airportto escape - only to find she reached the UK meeting point too late. Ms Assad, who had previously left Afghanistan as a three-year-old refugee, said a local family allowed her to wait at their home until she could contact the Foreign Office and arrange to join a later RAF evacuation flight. A British medical student, another former refugee who returned to Kabul in July to get married, spoke to the PA news agency on Thursday as he tried for a fourth time to get to the airport. On a previous attempt, he said he waited for 10 hours but could not get past the crowds to reach the airport gate. This time, he said there were gunshots being fired and people trying to flee. The defence secretary said the UK would continue to stay in Afghanistan as long as the US ran the airport, but said the government was also already investing in ""third country hubs"" for processing people ""if they get out to other countries in the region"". It's now a race against the clock to get as many people out of Kabul as possible. The BBC has been told there are several thousand UK nationals and dual passport holders who still need to get out of the country. Eight RAF flights went in and out of Kabul yesterday with a similar number expected today. They have the capacity to fly more than 1,000 people a day. But the BBC understands that not all flights have been full. The airport is operating to a strict schedule. That means aircraft can't just wait around until all their seats are filled. Most are being flown to a Middle East hub. Commercial charters are being used to make the onward journey. The greatest challenge at present appears to be processing the people who qualify to be flown out. One person who's trying to get people out told the BBC the ""system is working, but it's slow"". Those wishing to fly out are being told to wait for a phone call before setting out for the airport - not least to avoid the risks of travelling through a city under Taliban control. At some stage someone will have to make the decision to leave. That will once again be the decision of the US, which is providing the bulk of the security at the airport as well as overseeing Air Traffic Control. They too need to be flown out. Mr Wallace said seven to 10 RAF planes were taking off every day, with at least 138 due on the next flight out. He said the passengers on the flights out of Afghanistan this week had included British government personnel, British citizens, media and human rights staff and Afghans who had worked for the UK. Downing Street said military flights took about 1,200 people out of Kabul between Saturday and 08:00 BST on Wednesday, about 900 of whom were Afghan nationals and the remainder British citizens. Since late June, 2,000 Afghans who worked for the UK have been resettled with their families under the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (ARAP), according to the Home Office, with a target of 5,000 by the end of 2021. This video can not be played This plane from Kabul, carrying Afghans and British nationals, landed at a Midlands Airport on Wednesday The UK has also committed to take in up to 20,000 Afghan refugees over the next few years under a separate resettlement scheme - including 5,000 this year. Two evacuation flights came into the UK on Wednesday, the Ministry of Defence said - a military plane into RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire and a passenger plane into an unnamed civilian airport. On board were Afghans being relocated under the ARAP scheme for those who worked with the British military, British citizens and some other foreign nationals. The MoD did not provide exact numbers but said each flight could hold about 250 passengers. Mr Wallace said a plane left Kabul on Thursday morning carrying ""115 people and their families - those are the Afghans on there as opposed to other personnel"". He added: ""None of our planes are leaving empty... our planes never leave empty. If we have spaces on them, we offer them up to other nations."" Downing Street said the UK helped to fly 76 Australians out of Afghanistan on an RAF plane on Wednesday. British nationals and Afghan evacuees depart a flight from Afghanistan at RAF Brize Norton on 17 August 2021 He said: ""We have a full programme today of many more people coming out - trying to reach our... capability towards the end of the month. And that is so far on track.... we are doing it as fast as we can."" Mr Wallace said many of the flights were at full capacity. ""You and I wouldn't be allowed to fly some of the way those planes are flying in safety, so we are taking considerable risk"", he said, adding: ""Alongside those people will be troops or others coming in and out."" The defence secretary said additional UK troops would be deployed to Afghanistan to help manage public order on the ground at Kabul airport. Meanwhile, Labour has accused Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab of putting interpreters' lives at risk after he declined to phone the Afghan foreign minister to get help for the evacuation. The BBC has been told the call was made by a junior minister instead. ButMr Wallace said ""the only thing that mattered""was whether Kabul airport would continue to allow people to get out, telling BBC Breakfast: ""No amount of phone calls to an Afghan government at that time would have made any difference.""

Thank you for

Jo Couzens and James Clarke. Weâll be ending our live coverage for today shortly but,
before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main coronavirus headlines from the
UK and around the world: The World Health Organization (WHO) has called on countries to ensure that health services across Afghanistan are maintained, as it warned of increasing cases of Covid-19 across the country. The organisation's regional director, Dr Ahmed Al-Mandhari, said that WHO teams in areas which had seen large influxes of people fleeing the Taliban advance are now reporting increasing cases of people with Covid-like symptoms. According to the WHO, there have been 152,365 cases of coronavirus in the country and 7,043 deaths. However, Afghanistan has limited testing capacity and reporting of cases across the country is sketchy. A survey conducted by the Ministry of Health last year estimated that as many as 10 million Afghans - or 31.5% of the population - may have contracted the virus. WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic also warned that the chaos at Kabul airport, where thousands of people are trying to flee the Taliban, is slowing deliveries of crucial medical supplies. Refugees at the airport are being tested for the virus before boarding evacuation flights. The UK is to get a vaccine booster scheme from September, the health secretary says. Sajid Javid made the comment after the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) met earlier today to discuss a potential Covid-19 booster campaign for people who need a third dose. He said: ""We are going to have a booster scheme. It will start some time in September. ""I couldn't tell you exactly when because before we start it... we need to get the final advice from our group of experts, our independent scientific and medical advisers, the JCVI, and so we're waiting for their final opinion."" But the health secretary says he is ""confident we can start in September"" offering a third jab to the most vulnerable people. He adds that the government will only want to continue with their plans on the expert advice of the JCVI. ""I don't want to prejudge what they're going to say but, based on their interim advice, I think we can be confident that we will start a booster scheme next month."" Read morehere. The number of pregnant women in England taking
up the Covid vaccine rose in the last two weeks
of July. More than 10,000 women who are pregnant, or believe they could be, have come forward to receive their first dose, according
to the latest data from Public Health England. It means 62,311 pregnant women have
now had a jab, including 43,737 who have had two doses. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisations at PHE, said:âIt
is encouraging that thousands of women have now benefited from the vital
protection of a Covid-19 vaccine. However, many more may remain unvaccinated and we
urge them to take up the offer.â PHE says Covid vaccines
are safe for pregnant women, and they should get the jab to protect themselves and their babies.
Covid-19 can cause serious complications in the later stages of pregnancies. Hajrah Aslam went through 11 weeks of rehabilitation at a specialist centre A Covid patient who gave birth before going into an induced coma
for six weeks has made an ""incredible"" recovery, a specialist rehab
facility says. Hajrah Aslam, from Peterborough, caught coronavirus when she was
35 weeks pregnant. She was put into a coma after her oxygen levels dropped
dangerously low. The 28-year-old is now recovering with her son after going
through 11 weeks of rehabilitation at Askham Rehab in Cambridgeshire. Sara Neaves, clinical lead at the rehab centre, said: ""Considering
the condition she was in when she arrived, an 11-week discharge is an
incredible feat."" Here are some of the latest graphics explaining the
coronavirus situation in the UK. The Covid-19 vaccine rollout in England is estimated to have directly averted between 91,700 and 98,700 deaths, according to figures from Public Health England (PHE). Previous estimates had put the figures between 81,300 and 87,800 deaths. The latest numbers from PHE also indicate the vaccination programme has directly averted more than 82,100 hospital admissions - up from a previous estimate of more than 66,900. Between 23.6 million and 24.4 million infections are estimated to have prevented - up from between 22.9 million and 23.8 million. Thelatest figures,externalshow that deaths have increased by 9.6% per 100,000 people
from the previous week (6 to 12 August), with 674 recorded in the last
seven days, a rise of 59. Cases have risen 7.8% per 100,000 people
from the previous week, with 214,736 recorded between 13
and 19 August, a rise of 15,530. Another 47,284 people in the UK have had a first dose
of a coronavirus vaccine, the government figures show. In total, 87.3% of the adult population has now had at least one jab. And a further 169,223 have had a second
vaccine dose now. As of today, 75.7% of the adult
population has now had both jabs. There have been a further 36,572 cases of coronavirus reported in the UK today, according to thelatest government figures,external. And there have been another 113 deaths, of people who had tested positive for the virus within the previous 28 days. Toyota is to slash worldwide vehicle production by 40% in September because of a global microchip shortage. The world's biggest carmaker had planned to make almost 900,000 cars next month, but has now reduced that to 540,000 vehicles. Volkswagen, the world's second-biggest car producer, has warned it may also be forced to cut output further. The Covid pandemic boosted demand for appliances that use chips, such as phones, TVs and games consoles. New cars often include dozens of microchips and Toyota benefited from having built a larger stockpile of chips - also called semiconductors - as part of a revamp to its business continuity plan, developed in the wake of the Fukushima earthquake and tsunami a decade ago. The decision to cut production now has been precipitated by the resurgence of coronavirus cases across Asia hitting supplies. Read morehere. A six-day nationwide lockdown began on Monday to combat the coronavirus Iranâs official death toll from Covid-19 has passed
100,000, as the Middle Eastâs worst-hit country struggles with a fifth wave of infections. The health ministry reported 564 deaths over the previous
24 hours on Thursday, bringing the overall total to 100,255, state media said. The
number of confirmed cases meanwhile rose by 31,266 to 4,587,683. However,
experts believe the real figures are far higher. Iran has seen a surge of infections driven by the Delta
variant since late June and has reported 12,000 deaths in the past month. On Monday, a six-day lockdown was imposed, with private travel
between provinces banned and government buildings and non-essential businesses shut. The government has also promised to step up its
vaccination programme, which has seen just under 20% of the 83 million population
given at least one dose. Iran has so far relied mostly on vaccines from China and Russia. But officials said last week that the importing of Pfizer and
Moderna vaccines would be permitted, so long as they were not produced in the US
or UK. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had forbidden the use of vaccines made
in the two countries in January. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China is today celebrating that it has carried
out more than 1.9 billion vaccinations. This equates to about two thirds of
its 1.4 billion population having received two doses. The country has hopes that 80% of its population will
be vaccinated by early next year. And there has been a notable trend in recent
weeks of areas moving to impose restrictions that prohibit the movements of
unvaccinated people. The national Global Times newspaper reports that
some will be recognised as vaccine-exempt. However, it says the governments ofEcheng,externalandShiyan,external, in central Hubei province, have said that if you do not have a valid reason for
remaining unvaccinated, this could impact your personal credit record. The authorities in Guigang and Laibin, in southern
Guangxi, say that unvaccinated individuals can no longer enter schools, medical
institutes, or nursing homes. In the central city of Nanchang, unvaccinated
people are no longer allowed to go on business trips. While there is fresh support for such measures
helping to keep people Covid-safe, earlier attempts to impose restrictions on the
unvaccinated were fiercely criticised. Back in April, a town in Hainan issued an apology
and made a U-turn, after ittried to ban unvaccinated people,externalfrom using public
transport, and visiting restaurants and supermarkets. Being double-vaccinated offers the best protection against the Delta variant, first identified in India and now dominant in the UK, according to a new study. But people who have had both doses can still catch and transmit the disease, so researchers say it is essential as many people as possible get the jab. Everyone aged 16 and over in the UK can now receive the Covid vaccine, and a third jab for the most vulnerable is being considered. Those who are 16 and 17 are currently being offered a first vaccine dose and, as we've been reporting, more than 125,000 of them have done so in the past two weeks. But there is currently no timescale for when they could be given a second one. The vaccine has already beenapproved for over-12s with underlying conditions or those who live with others at high risk, but there are no plans to give it routinely to this age group. Millions of people most vulnerable to Covid-19may be offered a third vaccination- along with the annual flu jab -from September, though the JCVI has not yet offered final guidance.

Nicole Kidman (pictured last year) is in Hong Kong to film a new television series Nicole Kidman has come under fire for apparently circumventing strict quarantine rules for international travellers. The Australian actress's arrival in Hong Kong has sparked widespread anger after she was reportedly spotted out and about two days after touching down. This is despite the region having some of the strictest rules in place, with up to 21 days' quarantine required. There has been no direct, official comment on a possible exemption. However, Hong Kong's Commerce and Economic Development Bureau sent out a statement on Thursday in response to questions about ""overseas film personnel"" and quarantine, explaining restrictions are waived ""to carry out designated professional work"". Kidman is in Hong Kong to film a new show about the lives of wealthy, glamorous ex-pats - already a source of tension as locals contend with increasing restrictions under the new national security law. Reports of the waiver have only stoked outrage further, with comments on both Twitter and Chinese social media platform Sina Weibo overwhelmingly critical. Read morehere. Tom BatemanBBC Middle East correspondent About 5% of the Gaza's population has received at least one dose of a vaccine The Grand Mufti of Gaza has called on Palestinians to get
vaccinated as soon as possible. In a video message, Sheikh Hassan al-Lahhan says whoever
delays doing so is a âsinnerâ and describes anyone who transmits the virus
unintentionally as a âmistaken killerâ. As Gazaâs top Islamic cleric, he oversees the religious
affairs ministry in the Hamas-run territory. The attempt to encourage vaccine take-up comes as
Covid-19 rates start to surge again in Gaza, where the health system is
crippled amid Israelâs blockade and after years of conflict. Vaccine delivery to the occupied Palestinian territories
has been painfully slow, but aid groups say misinformation and vaccine
hesitancy is also hindering levels of protection. In Gaza a little more than 120,000 people have received
at least one dose - only about 5% of the Stripâs population. The manager of a hotel at the centre of a school prom Covid spike says he was assured everyone had passed a lateral flow test before attending the event. More than 50 positive cases have been linked to the party at the Cwrt Bleddyn hotel near Usk in Monmouthshire. Manager Simon Daniel says: ""We thought this was an official school prom - we thought we were dealing with the school. ""On the actual day of the prom, I met up at the hotel with the main organiser that we'd dealt with, who assured me she had 120-odd negative lateral flow tests."" He says he now believes a parent on the prom committee organised the party. Read the full story. Northern Ireland is facing the prospect of ""a very difficult winter"" due to rising Covid-19 cases and a return of other respiratory viruses, the chief medical officer has warned. Sir Michael McBride said people had not been exposed to many viruses other than Covid-19, contributing to a ""perfect storm"" of additional pressures. He said hospitals were already under pressures normally seen in mid-winter. Hospital staff were ""physically tired and exhausted"", he added. On Wednesday11 further Covid-related deaths were recorded, the highest number since mid-February. All over-16s in the UK are now being offered a single dose of Covid vaccine, as well as some younger vulnerable teenagers. InEngland they will be offered their jab by 23 August, the government has said. There are an estimated 1.4 million people in this age group and they don't need parental consent, as they are considered capable of making their own medical treatment decisions. Children aged 12 to 15 who are at higher risk of Covid due to underlying health conditions will also be offered the jab, but there are currently no plans to vaccinate healthy children of this age. Being double vaccinated still offers the best protection against the Delta variant, first identified in India and now dominant in the UK, according to a new study. But people who have had both doses can still catch and transmit the disease, so researchers say it is essential that as many people are possible get the jab. BBC health reporter Philippa Roxby looks at everything the under-30s need to know about the vaccine. More than 125,000 16 and 17-year-olds in England have received a Covid vaccine in the two weeks since the NHS was given the green light to offer them a jab. It means more than 360,000 people aged 16 and 17 have now had their jab - including those previously eligible due to an underlying health condition, according to the NHS. The health service said it is sending out one million letters inviting this age group to get vaccinated. GPs are also inviting at-risk children aged between 12 and 15, who are clinically vulnerable to Covid or live with adults who are at increased risk of serious illness from the virus, to take up the jab. The NHS said 30,000 children in this age group are already protected. Â© 2025 BBC.

24 hours on Thursday, bringing the overall total to 100,255, state media said. The
number of confirmed cases meanwhile rose by 31,266 to 4,587,683. However,
experts believe the real figures are far higher. Iran has seen a surge of infections driven by the Delta
variant since late June and has reported 12,000 deaths in the past month. On Monday, a six-day lockdown was imposed, with private travel
between provinces banned and government buildings and non-essential businesses shut. The government has also promised to step up its
vaccination programme, which has seen just under 20% of the 83 million population
given at least one dose. Iran has so far relied mostly on vaccines from China and Russia. But officials said last week that the importing of Pfizer and
Moderna vaccines would be permitted, so long as they were not produced in the US
or UK. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had forbidden the use of vaccines made
in the two countries in January. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China is today celebrating that it has carried
out more than 1.9 billion vaccinations. This equates to about two thirds of
its 1.4 billion population having received two doses. The country has hopes that 80% of its population will
be vaccinated by early next year. And there has been a notable trend in recent
weeks of areas moving to impose restrictions that prohibit the movements of
unvaccinated people. The national Global Times newspaper reports that
some will be recognised as vaccine-exempt. However, it says the governments ofEcheng,externalandShiyan,external, in central Hubei province, have said that if you do not have a valid reason for
remaining unvaccinated, this could impact your personal credit record. The authorities in Guigang and Laibin, in southern
Guangxi, say that unvaccinated individuals can no longer enter schools, medical
institutes, or nursing homes. In the central city of Nanchang, unvaccinated
people are no longer allowed to go on business trips. While there is fresh support for such measures
helping to keep people Covid-safe, earlier attempts to impose restrictions on the
unvaccinated were fiercely criticised. Back in April, a town in Hainan issued an apology
and made a U-turn, after ittried to ban unvaccinated people,externalfrom using public
transport, and visiting restaurants and supermarkets. Being double-vaccinated offers the best protection against the Delta variant, first identified in India and now dominant in the UK, according to a new study. But people who have had both doses can still catch and transmit the disease, so researchers say it is essential as many people as possible get the jab. Everyone aged 16 and over in the UK can now receive the Covid vaccine, and a third jab for the most vulnerable is being considered. Those who are 16 and 17 are currently being offered a first vaccine dose and, as we've been reporting, more than 125,000 of them have done so in the past two weeks. But there is currently no timescale for when they could be given a second one. The vaccine has already beenapproved for over-12s with underlying conditions or those who live with others at high risk, but there are no plans to give it routinely to this age group. Millions of people most vulnerable to Covid-19may be offered a third vaccination- along with the annual flu jab -from September, though the JCVI has not yet offered final guidance.

Nicole Kidman (pictured last year) is in Hong Kong to film a new television series Nicole Kidman has come under fire for apparently circumventing strict quarantine rules for international travellers. The Australian actress's arrival in Hong Kong has sparked widespread anger after she was reportedly spotted out and about two days after touching down. This is despite the region having some of the strictest rules in place, with up to 21 days' quarantine required. There has been no direct, official comment on a possible exemption. However, Hong Kong's Commerce and Economic Development Bureau sent out a statement on Thursday in response to questions about ""overseas film personnel"" and quarantine, explaining restrictions are waived ""to carry out designated professional work"". Kidman is in Hong Kong to film a new show about the lives of wealthy, glamorous ex-pats - already a source of tension as locals contend with increasing restrictions under the new national security law. Reports of the waiver have only stoked outrage further, with comments on both Twitter and Chinese social media platform Sina Weibo overwhelmingly critical. Read morehere. Tom BatemanBBC Middle East correspondent About 5% of the Gaza's population has received at least one dose of a vaccine The Grand Mufti of Gaza has called on Palestinians to get
vaccinated as soon as possible. In a video message, Sheikh Hassan al-Lahhan says whoever
delays doing so is a âsinnerâ and describes anyone who transmits the virus
unintentionally as a âmistaken killerâ. As Gazaâs top Islamic cleric, he oversees the religious
affairs ministry in the Hamas-run territory. The attempt to encourage vaccine take-up comes as
Covid-19 rates start to surge again in Gaza, where the health system is
crippled amid Israelâs blockade and after years of conflict. Vaccine delivery to the occupied Palestinian territories
has been painfully slow, but aid groups say misinformation and vaccine
hesitancy is also hindering levels of protection. In Gaza a little more than 120,000 people have received
at least one dose - only about 5% of the Stripâs population. The manager of a hotel at the centre of a school prom Covid spike says he was assured everyone had passed a lateral flow test before attending the event. More than 50 positive cases have been linked to the party at the Cwrt Bleddyn hotel near Usk in Monmouthshire. Manager Simon Daniel says: ""We thought this was an official school prom - we thought we were dealing with the school. ""On the actual day of the prom, I met up at the hotel with the main organiser that we'd dealt with, who assured me she had 120-odd negative lateral flow tests."" He says he now believes a parent on the prom committee organised the party. Read the full story. Northern Ireland is facing the prospect of ""a very difficult winter"" due to rising Covid-19 cases and a return of other respiratory viruses, the chief medical officer has warned. Sir Michael McBride said people had not been exposed to many viruses other than Covid-19, contributing to a ""perfect storm"" of additional pressures. He said hospitals were already under pressures normally seen in mid-winter. Hospital staff were ""physically tired and exhausted"", he added. On Wednesday11 further Covid-related deaths were recorded, the highest number since mid-February. All over-16s in the UK are now being offered a single dose of Covid vaccine, as well as some younger vulnerable teenagers. InEngland they will be offered their jab by 23 August, the government has said. There are an estimated 1.4 million people in this age group and they don't need parental consent, as they are considered capable of making their own medical treatment decisions. Children aged 12 to 15 who are at higher risk of Covid due to underlying health conditions will also be offered the jab, but there are currently no plans to vaccinate healthy children of this age. Being double vaccinated still offers the best protection against the Delta variant, first identified in India and now dominant in the UK, according to a new study. But people who have had both doses can still catch and transmit the disease, so researchers say it is essential that as many people are possible get the jab. BBC health reporter Philippa Roxby looks at everything the under-30s need to know about the vaccine. More than 125,000 16 and 17-year-olds in England have received a Covid vaccine in the two weeks since the NHS was given the green light to offer them a jab. It means more than 360,000 people aged 16 and 17 have now had their jab - including those previously eligible due to an underlying health condition, according to the NHS. The health service said it is sending out one million letters inviting this age group to get vaccinated. GPs are also inviting at-risk children aged between 12 and 15, who are clinically vulnerable to Covid or live with adults who are at increased risk of serious illness from the virus, to take up the jab. The NHS said 30,000 children in this age group are already protected. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Taliban fighters and Pakistani soldiers are now guarding the Torkham crossing side-by-side On the surface, it almost looks normal on this part of the Pakistani-Afghan border. But a closer look would show how much things have changed. The tricolour flag of the Republic of Afghanistan has been replaced with the white flag of the Islamic Emirates of Afghanistan, and in place of Afghan border security forces now stand gun-holding bearded Taliban militants. They are now in control of Torkham - the busiest crossing with Pakistan. A few days back, hundreds of panicked Afghan civilians gathered here for days, desperate for a way out. Then what seemed inevitable happened: outnumbered Afghan police forces surrendered to the Taliban. Pakistan, worried about a fighting spillover, had shut its side of the border prior to the Taliban's takeover. But after brief closure it was reopened for trade and restricted pedestrian movement. Normally, about 6,000-7,000 people would travel between the two countries daily - but today there are hardly 50 people standing on the Afghanistan side to enter Pakistan. It's taking longer than usual. Pakistani security officials say that they don't want any militants to enter disguised as civilians. That's why they have made the vetting process at the border more strict. Torkham has been the main point of refugees' influx into Pakistan for decades. An Afghan man with a baby crosses into Pakistan at Torkham Now the number of Afghans seeking refuge is much lower. The Taliban are not letting anyone out. Only traders or those with valid travel documents are allowed to cross. EXPLAINER:Ten days that shook Afghanistan ANALYSIS:Taliban's victory will test India, and peace in South Asia VOICES:Uncertain times ahead for Afghan women But it's not the only thing keeping Afghan refugees away. Amid increasing violence across the border in recent years, Pakistan has been fencing itself off from Afghanistan. All border crossings are now heavily manned, making it impossible for Afghan refugees to enter without government consent. Just a few metres away from the border, Ahsan Khan, 56, was busy taking out his luggage from a taxi. He was off to the Afghan city of Jalalabad. ""I have been travelling from this border since I was in school. There was a time when my father would take us directly to Jalalabad without any checks,"" Mr Khan says. Some of the few Afghans waiting to enter Pakistan, at the usually busy Torkham crossing Since June 2016, the Pakistani government has made a valid passport and visa mandatory for all Afghans wanting to cross into Pakistan. ""How can you expect Afghan refugees to come to this border when the people they are trying to flee are standing right here. And where would poor uneducated Afghans get passport and a visa in these circumstances?"" Mr Khan asks. A small market just a few kilometres away from Torkham is frequented by Afghans who had fled to Pakistan. Owaid Ali owns a small food stall. He says he hasn't seen any Afghan refugees in the market since the Taliban took over the border. ""A few days ago when the Taliban were rapidly taking control of cities, Afghans who came here told me how worried they are at the prospect of living under Taliban rule. But I don't know how will they escape that life now,"" Mr Ali says. Almost three million Afghan refugees, half of them unregistered, have been living in Pakistan for decades. But now the government in Islamabad says it has reached its limit and cannot accept more people from the war-torn country, despite pleas from the UN refugees' agency.
