"This video can not be played Video shows black smoke coming from the roof of the building in Cape Town A man has been arrested after a large fire severely damaged the Houses of Parliament in the South African city of Cape Town. The suspect, who is not a parliamentary employee, will appear in court on Tuesday, facing charges of arson, housebreaking and theft, police said. Firefighters worked for hours to extinguish the blaze. President Cyril Ramaphosa called it a ""terrible and devastating event"", as he vowed parliament's work would continue. Footage from the scene on Sunday showed a plume of black smoke filling the sky, with huge flames coming out from the roof of the building. Officials say the fire started on the third floor offices and quickly spread to the National Assembly (the parliament's lower house) chamber, reports the BBC's Nomsa Maseko in Cape Town. The parliament is not currently in session because of the holidays, and no-one was injured. However the building is home to thousands of treasures including historic books, photographs and important works of art. There is particular concern that the valuableKeiskamma Tapestry,external, which is 120m (394ft) long and documents South Africa's history, may have been damaged or destroyed. Police say the suspect, who reportedly entered the building through a back window, is expected to be charged under the National Key Points Act, which protects sites of strategic importance. It appears that private security used by the parliament in addition to police were not being paid overtime and were not on duty, Jean-Pierre Smith, a member of the Cape Town mayoral committee for safety and security, told the BBC World Service. Parliament said some offices had been ""severely gutted"", and confirmed ""significant damage"" to the New Assembly Wing of the building, which includes the National Assembly chamber where lawmakers sit. The fire, which began shortly after 06:00 local time (04:00 GMT), camethe day after Archbishop Desmond Tutu's state funeral at St George's Cathedral, near parliament. Mr Ramaphosa, who visited the scene, said news of the fire was a ""terrible setback to what we were basking in yesterday"". He said the building's sprinkler system had not functioned properly, and praised firefighters for responding to the fire in minutes. Mr Smith told reporters the roof above the old assembly hall was ""completely gone"" and further damage inside the old chamber had not yet been evaluated. ""It is not possible to see whether it's damaged. We hope it is not because it has so many historical artefacts, but you can't gain access to it without breaking the doors down and we don't want to do that,"" he said. He also said that parliament's fire alarm had only sounded when firefighters were already on site. President Ramaphosa (left) visited parliament to inspect the damage City officials released photos of the effort to put out the fire Fire and rescue service officials earlier said it would take hours to put the fire out completely because of the carpets and wooden floors in the building. The damage from the fire can be seen in this image made available by the city of Cape Town: The Houses of Parliament in Cape Town are made up of three sections, with the oldest dating back to 1884. The newer sections built in the 1920s and 1980s house the National Assembly. Meanwhile, the government is based in Pretoria. Mr Ramaphosa on Sunday spoke of his sadness at ""this destruction of the home of our democracy"". Parliament said ""all efforts"" would be made to limit any disruption to its work. Cape Town's Mayor Geordin Hill-Lewis said the city's Council Chamber would be made available as an alternative place for parliament to meet. It was the second fire at the parliament in under a year. In March there was a fire caused by an electrical fault. Last year,a fire ravaged part of the University of Cape Town's library, which was home to a unique collection of African archives.

"Emily in Paris follows a young American who travels to Paris to work for a marketing firm Ukraine's culture minister says he has complained to Netflix over the portrayal of a character from Kyiv in Emily in Paris. The Netflix show follows a young American, played by Lily Collins, who travels to the French capital for work. In the latest series, Petra, a Ukrainian, shoplifts during a trip with the main character Emily. Oleksandr Tkachenko described the caricature image of Petra as ""insulting"". Petra, who is played by Ukrainian actress Daria Panchenko, is also portrayed to have a poor fashion sense and is afraid of being deported. ""In Emily in Paris, we have a caricature image of a Ukrainian woman that is unacceptable. It is also insulting,"" Mr Tkachenko wrote on Telegram. ""Is that how Ukrainians are seen abroad?"" he added. Emily in Paris: Are any of the cliches real? Emily in Paris creator 'not sorry' for 'clichÃ©s' According to Ukrainian media, Mr Tkachenko has sent a letter to the streaming service complaining about the portrayal of Petra. One Ukrainian resident in Paris agreed with his criticism. ""The way you treated the image of Ukrainians in your second season, 4th episode is such a low cost trick, absolute scandal and a shame,"" Yevheniya Havrylko wrote in an Instagram post, which has had more than 75,000 likes. Others have chosen to defend the show, like Ukrainian film producer Natalka Yakymovych who said: ""So in a TV series, negative characters can be anything but Ukrainian? Obviously, we all would like her to be from Moscow, but you don't always get what you want."" It is not the first time Emily in Paris has been criticised for its portrayal of different nationalities. When the first season was released, it was criticised, particularly in France, for promoting stereotypical images of the city and its residents. It portrays the French as rude people who wear berets and frequently cheat on their partners. The new series of the show features Alfie, a stereotypical Brit who spends his time drinking in pubs and watching football. Darren Star, creator of the show, previously defended the first series, saying he was ""not sorry for looking at Paris through a glamorous lens"". Mr Star said he had drawn on his own experiences of visiting the city. ""I wanted to showcase Paris in a really wonderful way that would encourage peopleto fall in love with the city in a way that I have,"" he told the New York Times.

"Pro-democracy protesters faced another violent crackdown from the military Sudan's Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok has resigned after another day of mass protests rocked the capital Khartoum. Thousands marched against a recent deal he had done to share power with the army, who staged a coup in October. Chanting ""power to the people"", protesters called for a return to full civilian rule. But military forces again responded with force, leaving two people dead. Mr Hamdok's decision to quit leaves the army in full control. It is another blow to Sudan's fragile attempts at a transition to democratic rule after a popular uprising led to the overthrow of Sudan's long-term authoritarian President Omar al-Bashir in 2019. In a televised address, Mr Hamdok said the country was at a ""dangerous turning point that threatens its whole survival"". He said he had tried his best to stop the country from ""sliding towards disaster"", but that ""despite everything that has been done to reach a consensus... it has not happened"". Sudan coup: A simple guide How Sudan's generals betrayed my generation Defying Sudan's generals: 'They cannot kill us all' Civilian and military leaders had made an uneasy power-sharing agreement after the army staged a coup on 25 October and initially placed Prime Minister Hamdok under house arrest. The country was just one month away from transition to a civilian head of state when the army seized power. Mr Hamdok, an economist by training, is widely respected in the international community having previously worked as an official with the United Nations. He helped negotiate a deal to forgive some of Sudan's debts but this involved removing fuel subsidies, leading the prices of many basic goods to rise, and to anti-government protests. Under the agreement reached with Mr Hamdok in November, the reinstated prime minister was supposed to lead a cabinet of technocrats until elections were held. But it was unclear how much power the new civilian government would have, and protests against the military resumed, which were often violently suppressed. Protests continued even after Mr Hamdok had returned to office, with some demonstrators saying that his reinstatement was helping to legitimatise the military takeover. The United Nations' special representative in Sudan has expressed regret over Mr Hamdok's resignation. It puts at risk progress made since the December revolution when Mr Bashir was toppled, Volker Perthes warned. The resignation of Mr Hamdok showed the military was losing their leverage to get international recognition and popular support, according to a spokesman for the opposition Sudanese Congress Party. Further protests against the military are planned for Tuesday. Activists have told people to march to the presidential palace in the capital city, ""until victory is achieved"", according to the AFP news agency. Thousands of people were on the streets of the capital Khartoum and the city of Omdurman on Sunday, chanting and calling on the military to leave politics. More than 50 people have been killed during protests since the coup, including at least two on Sunday, according to the pro-democracy Sudan Central Doctors' Committee. Coup leader Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan has defended last October's coup, saying the army had acted to prevent a civil war. He says Sudan is still committed to the transition to civilian rule, with elections planned for July 2023. January 1 marked Sudan's Independence Day but there's little to celebrate in the country at the moment. The resignation of PM Abdalla Hamdok is a big blow to the military leaders who had thought an agreement with Mr Hamdok would appease protesters and legitimize their stay in power. Clearly those calculations were wrong. But it means the army are now firmly in power, reversing gains made as the country attempted to return to civilian rule. The current political crisis now threatens to return Sudan to the authoritarian years of former ousted leader Omar al-Bashir. And there's also the risk that the country could go back to being a pariah state with the likes of the US already indicating that they would sanction those impeding a return to civilian rule. Given Sudan's economic struggles, that could have an even worse effect on the lives of Sudanese people. This video can not be played Why are protesters back on the streets in Sudan?

"Face masks are to be worn in classrooms in England's secondary schools to reduce the spread of the Omicron variant, the government has announced. The temporary reintroduction of face coverings aims to address concerns about schools remaining open for face-to-face learning this coming term. Meanwhile, six school staff unions have issued a demand for urgent action to limit the spread of the virus. They warned national exams would be put at risk without further measures. They also called for air-cleaning units, financial support for absence cover, help with on-site testing and a relaxation of the Ofsted inspection regime. Doubts that ex-teachers will return by January Teaching union calls for school reopening delay Will schools be open in January? Schools across the UK are re-opening after the Christmas break over the next week, with pupils being asked to take part in onsite Covid testing. Until now, England was the only one of the four UK nations where face masks were not recommended for pupils in classrooms. Teachers will not have to wear them under the new guidelines. Some individual schools and local authorities in England had already required masks in classrooms, and face coverings were recommended in schools in England between 8 March and 17 May last year. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said face coverings would be required until 26 January. This is when the current national Plan B Covid measures run out, although they will be reviewed on or close to 4 January. He said education was the ""number one priority"" for him and the prime minister, and that they would do ""everything in our power"" to minimise disruption. The government also said it would be making 7,000 air cleaning units available to early years settings, schools and colleges. There are more than 24,400 schools in England,according to the latest government figures,external, but the Department for Education said the units would only be required in some areas of schools where opening doors and windows was not effective. Staff absences and rising Covid rates at the end of last term - caused by the rapid spread of the Omicron variant - have led to fears of further disruption to education. The four main teaching unions covering England, Wales and Northern Ireland - ASCL, NAHT, NEU and NASUWT - plus the GMB and Unison, have issued a joint statement calling for urgent steps to help schools. It said schools needed to avoid exam disruption for a third successive year, and remove uncertainty and additional workloads for students and teachers. More specifically, it said: Masks in secondary school classrooms are ""overdue"" and, while there are drawbacks, it is clear the Omicron variant poses a ""very significant additional risk"" Spring term will be ""extremely challenging"" with the biggest problem likely to be high levels of absence The additional air cleaning units are welcome but ""adequate ventilation in classrooms should not be limited to first come, first served"". Cabinet Office minister Steve Barclay said schools would be prioritised in terms of testing to ensure they reopened as planned. Ministers recognised that face masks were ""not something that many children will want to wear"" but said the introduction of them in classrooms was to ensure face-to-face education was available, he said. When someone who has Covid coughs, sneezes or exhales they release droplets of infected fluid. Evidence certainly shows wearing a face-covering reduces the release of these into the environment. But what's not clear is what impact this has on transmission in the real world of schools. People wear different types of masks. Some work better than others. Ill-fitting masks or fidgeting with them will also naturally reduce their effectiveness. Studies that have been done have been pretty inconclusive at least in terms of proving they have a significant impact when used in school when the virus is spreading quickly in the community. One of the problems is it is difficult to disentangle the impact of one measure with others steps that are being taken to reduce spread of the virus. What's more, any benefit has to be weighed against the costs in terms of harm to education. It's the nature of a pandemic that decisions have to be taken without perfect evidence. But this far in, plenty of experts are wondering why better research has not been done to work out what measures like this achieve. This seems to be a policy which is being introduced more in the hope it will help significantly, rather than based on strong evidence it actually will. Labour's shadow health secretary Wes Streeting said that while he did not think anyone would be ""over the moon"" about masks being worn in schools, it was better than children missing out on learning. Mr Streeting said the supply issues around lateral flow tests was causing challenges and called for the government to ""get a grip"" on testing. But Conservative MP Robert Halfon, chair of the Commons education select committee, said he had worries about the mask policy, telling the BBC that the children's minister had told his committee ""there was no evidence of the efficacy of mask wearing"". He said he wanted the education secretary to set out the evidence behind the policy and what the government was doing to assess the impact of it on children's mental health, wellbeing, anxiety and education. Sir Daniel Moynihan, who runs the Harris Federation which educates 36,000 children, said his schools would probably return to pupil bubbles and that he disagreed with Mr Halfon on face masks. ""If we've got a thousand kids in a school all breathing all over each other, it is more likely they and their staff will be off sick and that will affect their mental health,"" he said. Beth Collins, assistant head teacher at Laurels Primary in Worthing, said she felt that ""once again primaries have been forgotten"", saying that as primary pupils were unvaccinated ""it has left us open to every danger going"". The process by which schools can obtain the new air cleaning units is due to be set out by the DfE shortly. Mr Streeting said that the government's announcement did not go far enough - suggesting that 7,000 was enough for about one in four schools in England to get one - and looked ""very much like appearing to be busy days before the start of school term"". Freelance piano and voice teacher Megan Skinner, who is based in East Sussex, said she was ""frankly terrified about returning to school"" as she had nearly died from blood clots in her lungs six years ago and her GP had told her she could develop them again if she caught Covid. She said she was worried about the lack of adequate ventilation for some of her classes, adding: ""I am exposed to five times the number of pupils that most teachers will be, and apart from the risk to me, were I to contract Covid, I could certainly be a super spreader.""

"This video can not be played Wales' coal tips: People living nearby ""worry"" when it rains Every time it rains, Phil Thomas is beset with worry and anxiety after finding out his young family are living below a potentially dangerous coal tip. He has even thought about which way to run ""if something starts pouring down the hill"" behind their home. ""We've got no chance in reality,"" the 39-year-old father of two admits. Concerns about coal tips in Wales were put into stark focus when heavy storms caused 60,000 tonnes of spoil to run down a hillside in 2020. No-one was injured in theslip down the empty valley at Tylorstownin Rhondda Cynon Taf, but the Welsh government has since revealed there are still almost 2,500 disused tips. Most have been concealed by nature and largely forgotten about but327 are still classed as ""higher risk"", meaning they need to be regularly inspected for signs of movement, although do not necessarily pose an ""imminent"" threat. The images Aberfan survivors can never forget The disaster that cost a village its children Why Wales is prone to landslides The Welsh government is yet to say publicly where the most dangerous tips are or how many people live beneath them. The collapse of a coal tip at Aberfan took 144 lives in 1966, including 116 children It was in February last year that Phil, who runs a microbrewery, sat down at his local archives as a last resort after months of failing to get answers about a potential coal tip near his village of Ynyshir in Rhondda Cynon Taf. He hoped the dusty old document in front of him could finally put his mind at rest. Instead, the report, written in the wake of theAberfan disaster that killed 144 peoplein 1966, showed that his house - along with 20 others - had been described as ""at risk"" by engineers investigating the safety of the local tip. Phil's young family live under a tip in the south Wales valleys ""It made me sick to the core of my stomach,"" he said. ""I've got a family, that's our house. We've been there for eight years. This hasn't ever been mentioned, even when we purchased the house."" Such was the concern in the report done half a century ago, there was even a sentence about how much it might cost to buy the residents out of their homes. In his community, the tip had been largely forgotten about over the decades - grass now covers the open black scars that once made them so easy to spot on the hillside. This video can not be played Some 60,000 tonnes of spoil slipped down the hillside at Tylorstown in 2020 ""I thought, perhaps naively, that most of the coal tips were made safe,"" said Phil. ""It makes you worried every time that it rains that something could happen, not just for me but for the 327 other high-risk tips out there in Wales. ""What do we do if something starts pouring down the hill? We've got no chance. ""If we could get the information today, I'm certain that people would be safer than they are without the information."" At the same time that Phil started his own quest for answers, both the Welsh and UK governments set up a coal tip safety taskforce. Ynyshir is a small village near Porth in Rhondda Cynon Taf The Welsh government quickly concluded that climate change and increased rainfall meant ""hundreds of millions of pounds"" were needed to make ""legacy"" coal tips safe for good. Wales' climate change minister has since said plans were in place for amobile phone alert systemwhich could warn residents ""if there is a problem"". The Welsh government said it would not reveal the precise locations of coal tips until later this year because of extra checks with ""accuracy"" and potential ""data protection issues"". Areas with most higher-risk coal tips revealed The former coal villages turning green The Welsh government has already admitted that insurance and housing will likely be among the things affected when people find out they live underneath these tips. As many as 70% of Wales' coal tips are believed to be on private land, including the one overshadowing Phil's family home. Rhondda Cynon Taf is the area in Wales with the most higher risk coal tips However, the law means that councils have little ability to force an intervention unless they can prove a private tip is a ""clear and imminent threat"". It is a system described as ""unfit for purpose"" by some local authorities - and the Welsh government has asked the Law Commission to review the current setup. The Welsh government said it was ""trialling different methods to understand the best technology that could be used to inform of any changes in the stability of the tips"" as it was ""vital"" they made the right choice. ""In time, we would like to be able to share this information directly with people in local communities but need to do this in a way that we do not create false alarm or concern,"" a spokesman said.

"St David is depicted in a stained glass window at the Chapel of Our Lady and St Non in Pembrokeshire The shared religious and cultural history of Wales and Ireland is being celebrated with two pilgrimage routes in each nation. The Ancient Connections project will see two routes in St Davids, Pembrokeshire, and Ferns, County Wexford, linked via a ferry service. It is hoped the routes will boost green tourism after the Covid-19 pandemic. The aim is to attract about 5,000 people a year, whether they are keen walkers or making a pilgrimage. The two routes will be Wales and Ireland and will be linked with a ferry service The five-year project is being sponsored by Pembrokeshire and Wexford councils, and is also backed by European funding. The nations are linked by the close bond that grew between St David, the patron saint of Wales, and St Aidan of Ferns during the early medieval period. Pembrokeshire is also littered with sites which are notable for their importance to early Christianity and in medieval times it was said that two pilgrimages to St Davids was equivalent to one pilgrimage to Rome. It is believed that St David was born at the site of St Non's Chapel, Pembrokeshire, named after his mother, in the 6th Century. There is a holy well at the site which reputedly has healing powers. St Aidan is said to have travelled from Wexford to Pembrokeshire to study under St David. According to academics, there is clear evidence they were close. Christine Smith says being outside has a healing effect for everyone ""Welsh and Irish sources agree that was a close relationship between them and Aidan was a disciple of St David,"" said Dr Simon Rodway, who lectures in Welsh and Celtic Studies at Aberystwyth University. ""It's clear that Aidan did spend some time in Wales with St David, and then he returned to Ireland where he was gifted lands at Ferns in County Wexford, where he founded a monastery."" The new routes will recreate the journeys followed by St Aidan and St David. Omicron uncertainty hitting tourism businesses Overseas travellers to Wales to require PCR tests Archbishop of Wales thanks NHS in Christmas message John G O'Dwyer, chairman of Pilgrim Paths Ireland and author of Irish Pilgrim Paths, said the potential of the trails was ""absolutely huge"". ""We have quite a few pilgrim paths in Ireland but this is the first one that will recognise the fact that for the Irish, in the early medieval period, pilgrimage overseas was a very important thing,"" he said. ""It will have the added appeal of walking in two countries and at the same time, not having a particularly long walk. ""It's a Celtic nation and I think the more and more we look at our own identity, the Irish recognise a special affinity with the Scots, with the Welsh, the Cornish and the Bretons. ""I see a huge potential, particularly now as countries like Wales are, in the way we have 100 years ago, expressing their own independence and getting closer to a much more independent Welsh state, I think there will be a lot of interest."" Iain Tweedale hopes the paths will attract up to 5,000 walkers a year Holiday firm Journeying specialises in running pilgrimages and is a partner in the scheme, and its director Iain Tweedale said: ""It'll probably be called the Way of St Aidan and David. ""St Aidan was a protÃ©gÃ© of St David... and St David would visit Ireland. ""They used the Irish Sea as the M4 of their day. We're setting up a new pilgrimage route that goes from Ferns in County Wexford, which is the ancient capital of that part of the world, it then heads down the coast to Rosslare. ""People can then jump on the ferry and come over to Fishguard. ""We then walk from Fishguard down to St Davids. It's about 130km (about 81 miles) in total."" It is hoped the extra visitors will boost local businesses during quieter times of the year. ""We've got a five-year plan to make this quite a significant path,"" added Mr Tweedale. ""We expect within five years there's going to around 4,000-5,000 on the path every year. On the Camino in Spain, there are 250,000 every year. Named after St David - the Pembrokeshire city of St Davids has cultural and religious links to Wexford in Ireland He added that they did not wish to reach those numbers in St Davids but it was a form of green tourism as people arrived on foot and would use public transport from start to finish. According to the British Pilgrimage Trust, pilgrimages have become increasingly popular, even for those who are not religious. Guy Hayward, director of the trust, said: ""Before Covid hit, I was talking to travel journalists who write for the top end travel and fashion magazines and they were saying that no-fly travel was coming. ""Covid brought that forward. It's tourism without the cars. Even before Covid, there was a move towards finding new meaning and that got sped up."" He said the new route could provide a welcome boost for tourism businesses in Wexford and Pembrokeshire. ""The average daily spend by a pilgrim is 42 euros, which is 2.3 times more than what the average tourist gives to the local community."" The original St Non's Chapel is one of many holy sites in Pembrokeshire Not-for-profit travel company Guided Pilgrimage shares the view that the new routes will also attract a wider demographic. Director Christine Smith said: ""It attracts people from all walks of life. Particularly people who are questioning or they are at a crossroads in their life. ""Maybe they're coming out of a marriage, and during their time on pilgrimage they have time away from their normal lives to relax, see life from a different perspective. ""It's the healing power of being outside.""

"Pro-democracy protesters faced another violent crackdown from the military Sudan's Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok has resigned after another day of mass protests rocked the capital Khartoum. Thousands marched against a recent deal he had done to share power with the army, who staged a coup in October. Chanting ""power to the people"", protesters called for a return to full civilian rule. But military forces again responded with force, leaving two people dead. Mr Hamdok's decision to quit leaves the army in full control. It is another blow to Sudan's fragile attempts at a transition to democratic rule after a popular uprising led to the overthrow of Sudan's long-term authoritarian President Omar al-Bashir in 2019. In a televised address, Mr Hamdok said the country was at a ""dangerous turning point that threatens its whole survival"". He said he had tried his best to stop the country from ""sliding towards disaster"", but that ""despite everything that has been done to reach a consensus... it has not happened"". Sudan coup: A simple guide How Sudan's generals betrayed my generation Defying Sudan's generals: 'They cannot kill us all' Civilian and military leaders had made an uneasy power-sharing agreement after the army staged a coup on 25 October and initially placed Prime Minister Hamdok under house arrest. The country was just one month away from transition to a civilian head of state when the army seized power. Mr Hamdok, an economist by training, is widely respected in the international community having previously worked as an official with the United Nations. He helped negotiate a deal to forgive some of Sudan's debts but this involved removing fuel subsidies, leading the prices of many basic goods to rise, and to anti-government protests. Under the agreement reached with Mr Hamdok in November, the reinstated prime minister was supposed to lead a cabinet of technocrats until elections were held. But it was unclear how much power the new civilian government would have, and protests against the military resumed, which were often violently suppressed. Protests continued even after Mr Hamdok had returned to office, with some demonstrators saying that his reinstatement was helping to legitimatise the military takeover. The United Nations' special representative in Sudan has expressed regret over Mr Hamdok's resignation. It puts at risk progress made since the December revolution when Mr Bashir was toppled, Volker Perthes warned. The resignation of Mr Hamdok showed the military was losing their leverage to get international recognition and popular support, according to a spokesman for the opposition Sudanese Congress Party. Further protests against the military are planned for Tuesday. Activists have told people to march to the presidential palace in the capital city, ""until victory is achieved"", according to the AFP news agency. Thousands of people were on the streets of the capital Khartoum and the city of Omdurman on Sunday, chanting and calling on the military to leave politics. More than 50 people have been killed during protests since the coup, including at least two on Sunday, according to the pro-democracy Sudan Central Doctors' Committee. Coup leader Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan has defended last October's coup, saying the army had acted to prevent a civil war. He says Sudan is still committed to the transition to civilian rule, with elections planned for July 2023. January 1 marked Sudan's Independence Day but there's little to celebrate in the country at the moment. The resignation of PM Abdalla Hamdok is a big blow to the military leaders who had thought an agreement with Mr Hamdok would appease protesters and legitimize their stay in power. Clearly those calculations were wrong. But it means the army are now firmly in power, reversing gains made as the country attempted to return to civilian rule. The current political crisis now threatens to return Sudan to the authoritarian years of former ousted leader Omar al-Bashir. And there's also the risk that the country could go back to being a pariah state with the likes of the US already indicating that they would sanction those impeding a return to civilian rule. Given Sudan's economic struggles, that could have an even worse effect on the lives of Sudanese people. This video can not be played Why are protesters back on the streets in Sudan?

"Strong winds are hitting parts of south east England - with a storm warning in place until 18:00 GMT on Sunday A Yellow weather alert for thunderstorms, which brought heavy showers and high winds to the south and east of England, has come to an end. ""A band of thunderstorms"" moved across England on Sunday, with the Met Office warning of ""localised disruption"" and difficult driving conditions. It follows unseasonably warm weather over the new year. Saturday marked the warmest New Year's Day on record, reaching 16.3C (61.3F) in London's St James's Park. The original yellow warning, issued mid-morning on Sunday, encompassed a wide swathe of south and south west England, as well Cardiff, Monmouthshire and Newport in Wales - but the warning was later updated to focus on a smaller affected area in the south and east of England only. There had been fears about damage to trees and buildings, or disruption to train and road travel but they appear to have come to nothing - although several flood warnings remain in place due to the significant rainfall causing some rivers to overflow. A Met Office tweet,externalsaid it would be ""another mild evening"" but with ""some blustery winds at times"". Showers are expected to work their way eastwards ""perhaps with hail and the odd thunderstorm in places"". New Year's Day sees new UK record temperature New Year's Day sees new UK record temperature Thunderstorm warning for parts of Wales On Friday, Britain saw its warmest ever recorded New Year's Eve with temperatures reaching 15.8C (60.4F) in Merryfield, Somerset. The Met Office said the extremely mild spell was driven by a flow of warm, moist air from the Canary Islands. Recent temperatures in England have topped 16C where they more typically reach 7C But climate change is also a factor: warm weather records are being broken nine times more frequently, according to the Met Office - a clear sign of an over-heating planet, according to BBC environment analyst Roger Harrabin. Globally, climate change has driven temperatures up by 1.1C. In recent days, the US reporteddramatic winter wildfires in Colorado- halted by sudden, heavy snowfall - while the state ofAlaska recorded its hottest-ever December day at the end of last month. The Met Office said the weather across the UK was forecast to get cooler from Tuesday, potentially bringing wintry showers and frosts. BBC Weather's Tomasz Schafernaker said, following the ""extraordinarily mild weather"", it is set to turn colder and temperatures would be ""closer to the norm for the time of year"" - with temperatures expected to be below freezing in Scotland and Northern Ireland by early Tuesday.

"Twenty Conservative parliamentarians have called on the prime minister to tackle the spiralling cost of living. Five ex-ministers are among those who have written to the Sunday Telegraph arguing for a cut in environmental levies and the removal of energy taxes. Their call follows big increases in wholesale gas prices.Experts say average bills could hit Â£2,000 in 2022. The government says it is meeting suppliers and the regulator regularly to work out how to help consumers. Health minister Edward Argar told Times Radio there were a range of measures to help those who ""feel the squeeze with particular house bills"", adding that the economy was ""bouncing back"". The letter to the Telegraph has been organised by the Net Zero Scrutiny Group of Conservatives, which keeps an eye on the potential consequences of the government's environmental commitments. The group's chairman Craig Mackinlay is one of the letter's signatories, along with former Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey and senior MPs Robert Halfon and Steve Baker. ""We hardly need to point out that high energy prices, whether for domestic heating or for domestic transport, are felt most painfully by the lowest paid,"" the letter states. UK cost of living squeeze in 2022, says think tank Why are gas prices so high? What will the new Health and Social Care tax cost me? It argues that by scrapping the 5% VAT rate on energy bills and suspending environmental levies which fund renewable energy schemes, the average household could save Â£200 on their energy bill. Cabinet Office minister Stephen Barclay said: ""It is a matter for the Chancellor in terms of tax policy but the key issue for us all is to get the economy re-opened, to get businesses firing up again."" But Mr Halfon said he had ""huge worries"" about the rising energy costs for people across the country. With the energy price cap going up in the spring, he said the government should look at other measures, including suspending green levies which he said were ""actually 25% of everybody's energy bill"". He added that he was not suggesting to ""get rid of them forever"" but to pause them at a time when people could really struggle. Labour has also called for the lifting of VAT on fuel bills for the winter to help households, while Ovo Energy firm boss Stephen Fitzpatrick last week suggested that some ""environmental social policy costs"" should be removed by the government. Other suppliers including Good Energy, EDF and trade body Energy UK have called for government intervention, after the cost of gas in wholesale markets rose by more than 500% in less than a year. The charity National Energy Action (NEA) has warned that a record six million UK households will be in fuel poverty when the next increase in the energy price cap comes into force in April. Prior to the most recent rise in the price cap in October, around four million homes in the UK were classed as being in fuel poverty. That number increased by 500,000 after prices rose and NEA estimates it will increase again by 1.5 million this year. More than 20 energy suppliers have gone out of business since the start of September, with their customers shifted to new providers. But many will find themselves on a different - and potentially more expensive - tariff than their previous energy deal. Last week the Resolution Foundation think tank warned that millions of UK families face a ""year of squeeze"" in 2022 thanks to rising energy bills, stagnant wages and tax rises. The Bank of England has said it expects inflation to reach 6% by the spring. The Resolution Foundation says that an increase in National Insurance contributions from April, along with an expected rise in energy bills in the same month could amount to a Â£1,200 hit to household finances. And the foundation warned that poorer families will bear the brunt of these rises as they spend a greater proportion of their income on electricity and gas. The government says it has taken steps to help, including reducing the Universal Credit taper, providing cold weather payments and freezing alcohol and fuel duty.

"This video can not be played Video shows black smoke coming from the roof of the building in Cape Town A man has been arrested after a large fire severely damaged the Houses of Parliament in the South African city of Cape Town. The suspect, who is not a parliamentary employee, will appear in court on Tuesday, facing charges of arson, housebreaking and theft, police said. Firefighters worked for hours to extinguish the blaze. President Cyril Ramaphosa called it a ""terrible and devastating event"", as he vowed parliament's work would continue. Footage from the scene on Sunday showed a plume of black smoke filling the sky, with huge flames coming out from the roof of the building. Officials say the fire started on the third floor offices and quickly spread to the National Assembly (the parliament's lower house) chamber, reports the BBC's Nomsa Maseko in Cape Town. The parliament is not currently in session because of the holidays, and no-one was injured. However the building is home to thousands of treasures including historic books, photographs and important works of art. There is particular concern that the valuableKeiskamma Tapestry,external, which is 120m (394ft) long and documents South Africa's history, may have been damaged or destroyed. Police say the suspect, who reportedly entered the building through a back window, is expected to be charged under the National Key Points Act, which protects sites of strategic importance. It appears that private security used by the parliament in addition to police were not being paid overtime and were not on duty, Jean-Pierre Smith, a member of the Cape Town mayoral committee for safety and security, told the BBC World Service. Parliament said some offices had been ""severely gutted"", and confirmed ""significant damage"" to the New Assembly Wing of the building, which includes the National Assembly chamber where lawmakers sit. The fire, which began shortly after 06:00 local time (04:00 GMT), camethe day after Archbishop Desmond Tutu's state funeral at St George's Cathedral, near parliament. Mr Ramaphosa, who visited the scene, said news of the fire was a ""terrible setback to what we were basking in yesterday"". He said the building's sprinkler system had not functioned properly, and praised firefighters for responding to the fire in minutes. Mr Smith told reporters the roof above the old assembly hall was ""completely gone"" and further damage inside the old chamber had not yet been evaluated. ""It is not possible to see whether it's damaged. We hope it is not because it has so many historical artefacts, but you can't gain access to it without breaking the doors down and we don't want to do that,"" he said. He also said that parliament's fire alarm had only sounded when firefighters were already on site. President Ramaphosa (left) visited parliament to inspect the damage City officials released photos of the effort to put out the fire Fire and rescue service officials earlier said it would take hours to put the fire out completely because of the carpets and wooden floors in the building. The damage from the fire can be seen in this image made available by the city of Cape Town: The Houses of Parliament in Cape Town are made up of three sections, with the oldest dating back to 1884. The newer sections built in the 1920s and 1980s house the National Assembly. Meanwhile, the government is based in Pretoria. Mr Ramaphosa on Sunday spoke of his sadness at ""this destruction of the home of our democracy"". Parliament said ""all efforts"" would be made to limit any disruption to its work. Cape Town's Mayor Geordin Hill-Lewis said the city's Council Chamber would be made available as an alternative place for parliament to meet. It was the second fire at the parliament in under a year. In March there was a fire caused by an electrical fault. Last year,a fire ravaged part of the University of Cape Town's library, which was home to a unique collection of African archives. The smoke from the blaze could be seen from several miles away Are you in the area? If it's safe to do so, please share your experience via email -Haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"Strong winds are hitting parts of south east England - with a storm warning in place until 18:00 GMT on Sunday A Yellow weather alert for thunderstorms, which brought heavy showers and high winds to the south and east of England, has come to an end. ""A band of thunderstorms"" moved across England on Sunday, with the Met Office warning of ""localised disruption"" and difficult driving conditions. It follows unseasonably warm weather over the new year. Saturday marked the warmest New Year's Day on record, reaching 16.3C (61.3F) in London's St James's Park. The original yellow warning, issued mid-morning on Sunday, encompassed a wide swathe of south and south west England, as well Cardiff, Monmouthshire and Newport in Wales - but the warning was later updated to focus on a smaller affected area in the south and east of England only. There had been fears about damage to trees and buildings, or disruption to train and road travel but they appear to have come to nothing - although several flood warnings remain in place due to the significant rainfall causing some rivers to overflow. A Met Office tweet,externalsaid it would be ""another mild evening"" but with ""some blustery winds at times"". Showers are expected to work their way eastwards ""perhaps with hail and the odd thunderstorm in places"". New Year's Day sees new UK record temperature New Year's Day sees new UK record temperature Thunderstorm warning for parts of Wales On Friday, Britain saw its warmest ever recorded New Year's Eve with temperatures reaching 15.8C (60.4F) in Merryfield, Somerset. The Met Office said the extremely mild spell was driven by a flow of warm, moist air from the Canary Islands. Recent temperatures in England have topped 16C where they more typically reach 7C But climate change is also a factor: warm weather records are being broken nine times more frequently, according to the Met Office - a clear sign of an over-heating planet, according to BBC environment analyst Roger Harrabin. Globally, climate change has driven temperatures up by 1.1C. In recent days, the US reporteddramatic winter wildfires in Colorado- halted by sudden, heavy snowfall - while the state ofAlaska recorded its hottest-ever December day at the end of last month. The Met Office said the weather across the UK was forecast to get cooler from Tuesday, potentially bringing wintry showers and frosts. BBC Weather's Tomasz Schafernaker said, following the ""extraordinarily mild weather"", it is set to turn colder and temperatures would be ""closer to the norm for the time of year"" - with temperatures expected to be below freezing in Scotland and Northern Ireland by early Tuesday. Most of the UK would continue to have above average temperatures, he said, warning of low pressure and an approaching weather front bringing ""a little bit of sleet and snow"" to some northern parts of the UK by Monday.

"One of the fastest-rising stars of UK rap, Central Cee has won fifth place in BBC Radio 1's Sound Of 2022. Hailing from west London, his melodic take on drill has already earned him two Mobo Awards, and he's nominated for three Brits - including best newcomer - in February. He burst on to the scene in 2020 with the straight-talking Day In The Life, in which he taunted his peers: ""Turn off the auto-tune, let's hear how you really rap."" Freestyled while driving his car, the track was the culmination of 15 years of hard work. Born Oakley Caesar-Su in London's Shepherd's Bush in 1998, he's been cultivating his lyrical style since writing his first verse at the age of eight. ""I recorded my first song when I was 13 - recorded and released it,"" he told the BBC. ""I'm 22 now, so it's coming up to 10 years. But I wasn't really in the game. I was still in school, balancing things and just going through life. It was only literally last year, 2020, where I got to take this stuff serious."" Wet Leg and Central Cee make BBC Sound of 2022 list BBC Sound of 2022: Official website. Rapper Pa Salieu wins the BBC's Sound of 2021 Day In The Life and its follow-ups, Molly and Loading, framed him as a playful, mischievous character, eschewing the austere beats of drill for a more colourful sound - full of jazz samples and witty wordplay. Amassing tens of millions of streams, the music quickly attracted the attention of record companies - but the rapper knocked them all back. ""Take that risk and go independent,"" he explained on the 2021 single Pinging. ""Ijust turned down six figures."" The risk paid off, though. February's Commitment Issues secured Cee a number nine spot on the UK chart, and his first mixtape, Wild West, debuted at number two in March. He celebrated the release by riding on horseback through Shepherd's Bush Market, and installing a giant mural on the nearby Goldhawk Road. When Cee turned up to have his photo taken in front of it, ""50 to 60 school kids turned up after, like, five minutes,"" he recalls. ""There's a lot of love, man."" He ended the year with a guest verse on Ed Sheeran's Bad Habits remix, and another top 10 single, Obsessed With You - a street love song that samples fellow Sound Of 2022 nominee PinkPantheress. Central Cee is the first act to be announced for the BBC's Sound Of 2022, which aims to predict the biggest new stars of the coming year. The rest of the top five will be revealed daily on BBC Radio 1 and BBC News. Now in its 20th year, previous winners of the prize include Adele, Celeste, Haim, Sam Smith and Ellie Goulding. Hey there - how has your 2021 been? It's been an eventful one, to say the least! You sold out the Shepherd's Bush Empire in October. Did you ever walk past it as a kid and think, ""I'll play there one day""? Every time I passed Shepherd's Bush Empire - which was two to three times a day for 10 to 15 years, I would look at it and I would just look and see who was on the bill, taking it in subconsciously. We could have sold a lot more tickets than that -  but it was a conscious decision to make sure I did that one. It's important to me that I did that venue no matter how many tickets I could sell. At the Mobos, you said you weren't sure how you felt about winning awards. Has your opinion changed now it's had time to sink in? I still feel the same way but if I could reiterate it, what I meant is that I don't think people should feel like they need award shows to make them feel validated. We're all winners if we're in that room or releasing music, regardless of who gets the actual award. When you started making music, you'd record with just a MacBook and a pair of iPhone headphones. How did you teach yourself those skills? I'm just quite observant, I'd say. So when I've downloaded the software I kinda just messed around with it. I didn't even watch no tutorials or nothing. Because I've been in the studio so many times, when I'm in the sessions I'm just watching what they do. I'm a fast learner - it was pretty straightforward. Where did the names Cench and Central Cee come from? Central Cee just came. There's no interesting story behind it. And then Cench is just short for Central. Loading became your first chart hit in the middle of the pandemic. What was it like to see your numbers soaring while you were stuck at home? It was strange. I couldn't get out there and interact with the fans, or perform, so I felt quite detached - just looking and experiencing everything through my phone, being at home. Allow YouTube content?

You recorded Six For Six the same day that Loading hit the charts. How significant is that line, ""this ain't no coincidence""? It's just the truth. Was there ever a time when you thought it might not happen? Yeah - a couple times but I've been doing it for many years. For around 10 years. Within those 10 years there's obviously been bumps in the road and whatever but I was determined for the most part. A lot of your songs feel rooted in real situationsâ¦ What's your writing technique? My writing technique has changed since Day in A Life.  Day In A Life, I wrote outside of the studio and them times, studio time wasn't as accessible.  I was selective with it. The money was obviously coming out of my pocket - and it still is - but studio wasn't on tap the same way. So them times I'd write outside the studio and just go and record and then cut. Since Day In A Life I haven't written a song outside of the studio. I just write in the studio basically. The Wild West mixtape doesn't have any collaborations or features. Was that important to you? It wasn't really premeditated, as such. By the time I had all the songs laid out, they just happened to be all on my own. I haven't linked up to much people yet. I'm only just coming into the industry. I'm not in a rush to jump in the studio and work with everyone and this and that. Commitment Issues and Obsessed With You are more emotional than a lot of UK rap. You could almost call them love songs. How important is it not to be boxed in by convention? I don't try to not be boxed in by convention. It's not something I think about, but I have different emotions. I'm just a human being. So sometimes I might feel a bit more emotional or a bit more ""whatever"". Obsessed With You samples another Sound Of 2022 nominee, PinkPantheress... What do you think makes her special? There's a whole list of things, which would take ages to run through, but she's one of my favourite artists though - no cap. I love everything about her. That song is the first track from your 23 mixtape. What can we expect when that comes out next year? Expect big things. If you thought 'Wild West' was hard... And finally, what's your grand plan for 2022? Stay alive and get richer! Central Cee was speaking to BBC Music Correspondent Mark Savage and BBC 1Xtra's DJ Target.

"The next few days are crucial in understanding the impact of Omicron on the NHS, a health boss has said. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents health trusts, said hospital admissions are rising across the country but what could happen next is unclear. He warned ministers ""must be ready to introduce new restrictions at pace if they're needed"". But the health secretary said any extra measures must be a ""last resort"". Writing on Twitter,external, Mr Hopson said staff were working ""flat out"" and the NHS was now under ""different, arguably more"" pressure compared to last January because more planned treatments were being carried out, the booster vaccination campaign was using up significant resources and staff absences were having a greater impact. England has reported 162,572 new cases - a record number for the fifth day in a row - as well as 154 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland did not report figures on Saturday. How can I tell I have Omicron? Who needs to self-isolate now and for how long? The number of hospital admissions in England are at their highest level since January 2021, according to the latest figures, while NHS hospital staff absences due to Covid have nearly doubled in a month. Mr Hopson said there was evidence infections peaked in London before Christmas and had plateaued since but the future trajectory ""remains very unclear"", ranging from hospital admissions plateauing and then dropping to numbers rapidly increasing. ""If the evidence shows that we are getting very significant numbers of people coming into hospital with Covid, then the government needs to be ready to introduce further restrictions at pace,"" he told the BBC. He said there were currently not the large numbers of severely ill older people that were seen in previous peaks and intensive care occupancy was broadly stable. However, he said there were worries about the possible impact of intergenerational mixing over Christmas. University Hospital of North Tees in Stocktonhas become the latest of more than a dozen hospitals to temporarily suspend routine visits because of rising infections. The doctors' union, the British Medical Association, has said further public health measures should be introduced as a matter or urgency. The association's council chairman, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, said it was ""wholly erroneous to talk about the risk of the NHS becoming overwhelmed"". The new year began with the health service ""already overwhelmed, in a parlous state, and with patient care suffering"", he said. Writing in the Daily Mail,external, Sajid Javid warned it was ""inevitable"" there would be a big increase in people needing NHS care over the next month due to the time lag between infections and hospital admissions. ""This will likely test the limits of finite NHS capacity even more than a typical winter,"" he added. The problem facing the government is that the window to suppress the peak with restrictions may already have passed. Modelling produced for government by Warwick University suggests even a return to lockdown with only schools open has virtually no impact on hospital admissions now. To have had a significant impact, measures would need to have been introduced on Boxing Day or a week earlier. But even then the argument for them was unclear - in both scenarios infections and hospital admissions rebound once restrictions are lifted. Largely all it achieves is delaying and spreading out illness. That could have been of benefit by evening out the pressure on the NHS. But there is, of course, the wider costs of restrictions to society, the economy and mental health to factor in. Some say it would also have bought you time to carry out more vaccinations, but with nine in 10 of the most vulnerable boosted and evidence protection wanes over time this may actually be the point in time when we have the most immunity across the population. There are no simple solutions to this Omicron wave - and the options that the government did have may well have gone. England is currently under Plan B restrictions, which includes mandatory masks in most indoor public places, Covid passes for nightclubs and other large venues and guidance to work from home if possible. The measures are set to expire six weeks after implementation, with a review after three weeks, which is expected on or close to 4 January. There are already tougher restrictionsfor hospitality venues in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. THE GREATEST JOURNEY OF THEM ALL:Can they really make it around the world in 80 days?
