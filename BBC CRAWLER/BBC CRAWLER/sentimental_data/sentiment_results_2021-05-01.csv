"The withdrawal will be completed by 11 September The US has started formally withdrawing troops from Afghanistan, beginning the end of what President Joe Biden called ""the forever war"". The US and Nato have had a presence in Afghanistan for almost 20 years. But the withdrawal, which runs until 11 September, comes amid escalating violence, with Afghan security forces on high alert for reprisal attacks. The Taliban have warned they are no longer bound by an agreement not to target international troops. Under a deal signed last year between the militants and then-President Donald Trump, foreign forces were to have left by 1 May while the Taliban held off attacking international troops. Officials told Reuters during this time the Taliban has been protecting western military bases from rival Islamist groups.,externalThat has not stopped Taliban attacks on Afghan forces and civilians. US General Scott Miller warned against attacks on foreign troops as they start to withdraw. ""Make no mistake, we have the military means to respond forcefully to any type of attacks against the coalition and the military means to support the Afghan security forces,"" he said in a video posted on Twitter.

US President Joe Biden last month pushed back the 1 May pullout, saying some troops would stay on until 11 September this year, the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, citing the security situation. A Taliban spokesman said ""this violation in principle has opened the way for [Taliban fighters] to take every counter-action it deems appropriate against the occupying forces"". What do US veterans think of Afghan War? 20 years in Afghanistan: Was it worth it? 'We have won the war, America has lost' But he also said Taliban fighters would await instructions from leaders before mounting attacks. Some analysts suggested with a US deadline for withdrawal in place large-scale attacks could be averted. Meanwhile the US faces the logistical challenge of packing up and leaving.The AP report the military has been taking inventory,external, deciding what will be shipped back and what will be sold as junk on Afghanistan's markets. On 11 September 2001, attacks in America killed nearly 3,000 people. Osama Bin Laden, the head of Islamist terror group al-Qaeda, was quickly identified as the man responsible. The Taliban, radical Islamists who ran Afghanistan and protected Bin Laden, refused to hand him over. So, a month after 9/11, the US launched air strikes against Afghanistan. As other countries joined the war, the Taliban were quickly removed from power. But they didn't just disappear - their influence grew back and they dug in. Since then, the US and its allies have struggled to stop Afghanistan's government collapsing, and to end deadly attacks by the Taliban. The withdrawal of US troops begins against a backdrop of fierce clashes between the Taliban and government forces, in the absence of a peace deal. A flare up of violence in Ghazni province overnight left an unknown number of people dead. And on Friday, a car bombing in Pul-e-Alam, Logar province,killed up to 30 peopleand wounded 110 - mostly school pupils. The bombing in Pul-e-Alam on Friday killed at least 24 people US President Joe Biden says the US pull-out is justified as US forces have made sure the country cannot again become a base for foreign jihadists to plot against the West. And Afghan President Ashraf Ghani says government forces are fully capable of keeping insurgents at bay. He has argued that withdrawing US and Nato forces will remove the Taliban's reason for fighting, saying to the Taliban: ""Who are you killing? What are you destroying? Your pretext of fighting the foreigners is now over."" But many do not share the optimism. ""Everyone is scared that we might go back to the dark days of the Taliban era,"" Mena Nowrozi, who works at a private radio station in Kabul told news agency AFP. ""The Taliban are still the same; they have not changed. The US should have extended their presence by at least a year or two."" BBC Pakistan and Afghanistan correspondent Secunder Kermani says that with peace talks between the militants and Afghan government stalled, despite the drawing down of international involvement, it seems inevitable the conflict will continue.

"Dirty Vegan star Matt Pritchard has been rowing the Atlantic as part of a four-man crew While most of us have spent months locked down, Dirty Vegan Matt Pritchard has completed a row of the Atlantic. TheBBC TV chefwas in a team of four crossing the ocean to raise awareness about mental health - and they reached the finish line in Antigua on Sunday. Initially setting off on the 3,200 mile trip from Lanzarote on 6 March, they had to restart from Fuerteventura a week later. They could undertake the voyage as Covid rules allow charity events. After they completed the journey, Matt posted on his Instagram account: ""I'm thirsty, hungry, tired and adopted bingo wings on my arms and calf's [sic]. ""Walking on land is very weird, it doesn't move. I'll be a cheap date tonight, one whiff of champagne and I'll be on my back mun."" Allow Instagram content?

The trip, named Atlantic Dash, was initially halted because of seat problems, before their craft was holed during a tow to Fuerteventura. After Matt and crewmates Billy Taylor, Johnny Ward and Martin Heseltine had repaired the vessel they set off again. Dirty Sanchez star Matt Pritchard to host BBC vegan cookery show Farmers hit out at meat production 'propaganda' Oldest man to complete 'toughest Atlantic row' raises Â£1m Matt earlier said progress in the trip had been ""absolutely fantastic"" and had also been ""nice to be at sea during all the craziness"" of Covid. The sailors have enjoyed seeing dolphins, turtles and marlins and, for three weeks, they did not see another boat. But disaster struck for Matt, who celebrated his birthday at sea, as the end of the trip neared. The ex-pro skateboarder, from Cardiff, injured his back while rowing. The 48-year-old said: ""I pulled my right lateral muscle rowing and, as you do, I just ignored it. ""Because at the end of the day you have no other option other than to keep rowing and get on with it."" The men last saw land when the left Fuerteventura in March But after two days the pain got much worse. ""All of a sudden something went, and I was in absolute agony, and there was nothing else I could do,"" the former Dirty Sanchez star said. ""Billy said: 'You're going to have to get into the forecabin'."" Getting in the forecabin - at the front of a boat - was also ""absolute agony."" After speaking to a doctor he was advised to take painkillers they had with them. ""I'm absolutely gutted,"" Matt said. ""I've sat here, and there's loads of stuff going through my mind. ""I just feel helpless being here listening to the boys rowing. ""I want to be out there rowing with them, but I can't because I don't want to do any more damage to my lateral muscle."" He had hoped to be back as an oarsman within a day or two but he is still not in the best shape. As they neared their destination of Antigua, Matt injured a muscle in his back ""I've not come all this way to lay on my arse,"" he said. ""But at the same time I have got to be sensible, because I do not want to do longer lasting damage to myself."" By Friday, Matt was still not rowing but was making food and doing other duties. Billy said it was ""so nice"" to see him on the mend. He was laid up for a number of days but is now on the mend ""Matt's been up and about,"" he said. ""He's been cooking for everyone and making sure everyone has water. ""It's a real team, crew effort."" The four are aiming to raise Â£20,000 to be split between Dean Farm Trust and men's mental health charity Humen.

"The performance took place shortly after 05:00 BST A group of Morris dancers have changed their face paint from black to blue following concerns over racism. Members of the Hook Eagle Morris Men showcased their new look at a performance near Hook, Hampshire, to mark the May Day dawn earlier. A statement was issued last year calling for dancing groups to eliminate the use of full-face black makeup. Dancer John Ellis, 70, said it was ""by far and away the biggest change"" in the group's 30-year history. The call to stop the use of black makeup on the face was issued by cross-county group the Joint Morris Organisations in June in response to the Black Lives matter movement. In a statement, it said its traditions do not operate in a vacuum. ""While no morris dancer wants to cause offence, we must recognise that full-face black or other skin tone makeup is a practice that has the potential to cause deep hurt,"" it said. Mr Ellis said other Morris troupes had adapted their face paints to different colours too, with some going green and a group in Kent opting for yellow and black stripes. The Joint Morris Organisations issued a statement in June last year calling for dancing groups to eliminate the use of full-face black makeup The group was happy to be back performing after a 16-month absence caused by the pandemic He said the tradition of covering faces with soot derived from poor farm workers in the 1400s who would use it to disguise themselves so they could beg - which was illegal at the time. That historical tradition ""died out"", he said, but was revived in the 1970s by Border Morris dancers - a dance type which originated in villages along the border of England and Wales. ""We adopted this idea because the dancing is really easy, good fun and we quite like the idea of dancing in disguise,"" Mr Ellis added. He said there were only three people in the audience on Saturday morning, including a photographer and cafe owner, but felt this was ""pretty good"" given the performance took place shortly after 05:00 BST. Mr Ellis said it was ""fantastic"" to be back performing after a 16-month absence caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Follow BBC South onFacebook,external,Twitter,external, orInstagram,external.

"The truth matters, doesn't it? In what's meant to be a grown-up Western democracy surely we'd all like to think so. It doesn't pay to be naÃ¯ve. Politicians, even really honest ones, regularly say things they don't quite believe. The public knows this. We don't expect our politicians to be angels. But outright lying, in my experience, is relatively rare. It is too easily found out. Only one senior politician still in the game has ever privately told me something that was utterly, entirely, and completely untrue. It was proved publicly to be a lie a few days later. It's also rare for opposition parties to accuse a prime minister, on the record, of lying. Which brings us to Boris Johnson. The prime minister's relationship with the truth is under intense scrutiny at the moment. He is refusing to give full explanations on some issues. There are questions about how the refurbishment of his Downing Street flat was initially funded, and about incendiary comments he made last autumn as England was about to enter a second lockdown. Downing Street is repeatedly denying that he has done anything wrong. It is not the first time in Boris Johnson's long career that he has faced questions about his conduct and character. But the stakes are so much higher now. His unique way of running things - and sometimes chaotic approach to decision-making - has, sources tell me, led exasperated colleagues in No 10 to nickname him ""Trolley"". ""You think you are pushing it along a path towards your goal then suddenly it veers off disastrously,"" says one insider. If anyone wanted to submit accurate Freedom of Information requests on government WhatsApp messages, ""you'd have to include the trolley emoji"", adds my source. No 10 declined to comment on the name. It was Mr Johnson himself who may have coined the analogy, telling friends he was ""veering all over the place like a shopping trolley,"" over whether to back Leave or Remain, ahead of the Brexit referendum, according to the Sunday Times. He famously wrote two versions of his newspaper column, one backing Leave, the other Remain, arguing through all the options to be completely sure. Some of his allies cite this desire to argue things backwards and forwards before reaching a decision as a strength, saying: ""He challenges organisations and conventional wisdom."" Others have a more straightforward explanation. ""He is just sometimes unable to face the truth because he doesn't like making hard decisions,"" says one insider. Another says: ""You are never sure what the real truth of a situation is."" Others say it is hard to get clarity and a sense of purpose, or that it is ""hard to work out where his motives begin and end"". So what does this tell us about the prime minister's relationship with the truth? First, the benign interpretation of how the PM operates. One insider who knows him well says it is simply ""unfair and easy to cry 'liar', as the opposition has done"". ""He's far more complex and strategic and people don't give him credit for how calculating and clever he is."" Another source told me Mr Johnson has a ""genuinely selective memory"" and that ""'I choose to remember certain things or not remember others'"" is his default way of dealing with the pressures of life at No 10. For years, it's been the case that when things get sticky, particularly with Boris Johnson's personal life or financial affairs, he refuses to engage in those conversations at all, even in private with his close aides. The message to staffers is, effectively: ""Don't ask, because I won't tell."" One source told me that is why, right now, life in No 10 is bound to be tense and difficult. ""Part of the problem is that these two things, his personal relationships and his financial situation are colliding. He'll be finding it very difficult, and people trying to advise him will also find that hard."" But is he not telling the truth? This particular source believes that the PM may try to evade questions about matters of the home and heart, but not on political issues. ""To a degree every politician has to go out and say things they don't always agree with. He is a professional and he does that."" There's another layer when it comes to Mr Johnson though. And discussing his habits with many of those who have worked alongside him, his former life as a journalist is often mentioned. Even his worst enemy would acknowledge that he is a skilled wordsmith, and he regularly uses his vast range of sometimes nonsensical vocabulary to deflect, to entertain, or even ridicule. It's certainly not unusual for politicians to try to avoid answering questions that would cast them or their parties in a less than flattering light. One of the PM's strategies, however, seems to be to bamboozle the listener with a blizzard of verbiage, suggesting agreement, but not committing to anything. Former colleagues suggest that by the time they have decoded what he actually meant, the conversation's over. An insider told me: ""He frequently leaves people with the belief that he has told them one thing, but he has given himself room for manoeuvre,"" believing that, ""the fewer cast iron positions you hold the better, because you can always change political direction."" The verbal flourishes and rhetorical tricks are part of the reason why he has prospered. ""A lot of his magic has been those off-the-cuff comments, that's why a lot of the public like him,"" says an ally. He was like an ""untamed political animal"" when he first developed his political style says another, playing with phrases as he would in his byzantine and flamboyant newspaper columns, teasing with words, presenting a character like no other politician. But another told me it has developed into a way of shrouding what's really going on. ""I think he is an extremely shrewd and calculating character that hides it all under the costume of a performer,"" says this source. What is the row over Boris Johnson's flat about? PM: I didn't make 'bodies pile high' remark One Brexiteer even suggests his mannerisms encourage others to be complicit: ""It's like a comedian, you are willing him on, you want it to be plausible"" - even if, according to them, it simply isn't. That's where his personal style, according to others, tips into something much less appealing. A former minister, once close to him, told me: ""The problem is that it's becoming clearer that the PM treats facts like he treats all his relationships - utterly disposable once inconvenient. ""It's all about power. Facts, policies, people - they all get ditched if they get in the way. Whatever is necessary."" Yet what's suggested time and again is that the prime minister's attitude to the truth and facts is not based on what is real and what is not, but is driven by what he wants to achieve in that moment - what he desires, rather than what he believes. And there is no question, that approach, coupled with an intense force of personality can be enormously effective. In his political career, Boris Johnson has time and again overturned the odds, and that's a huge part of the reason why. One former colleague compares him to the late Steve Jobs, the hard-driving founder of tech giant Apple. Jobs was said to have a ""reality distortion field"", described by his biographer as a ""confounding melange of a charismatic rhetorical style, indomitable will, and eagerness to bend any fact to fit the purpose at hand"". In other words, ordering the truth to suit his ambitions, refusing to take no for an answer, relishing proving that the impossible could be done. Sound familiar? Mr Johnson's former colleague told me: ""Is there wilful lying? I would struggle to point to a direct example. Does he recreate the truth to suit him? Yes."" This source, and several others, told me the prime minister has a ""deep dislike of being accused of lying"". Several sources have even suggested that during the 2016 Brexit campaign he was nervous about the now infamous promise, plastered on the side of his battle bus, to spend the Â£350m a week the UK sends to the EU ""to fund the NHS instead"". Mr Johnson was nervous about the claim plastered across the Vote Leave battle bus, several sources say Mr Johnson was conscious that every time he used this claim, it could be challenged by the fact that the Â£350m did not take into account the budget rebate the UK got from the EU. Mr Johnson was all about ""images, emotions, he didn't want to be pinned down to a number"", says my source. He was also understood to be unhappy about the campaign's claims about Turkey's proposed entry to the EU, and the potential impact on immigration. If you're reading this, you probably don't need a reminder of how controversial those claims were at the time. Just in case, you canread about them hereandhere. But private doubts about whether the claims were convincing did not stop Mr Johnson from becoming the biggest cheerleader for leaving the EU. The rest, of course, is history. Some of those with him on the Brexit journey don't think that he was ever a true believer. A veteran Brexiteer told me: ""Boris is not one of us, but we put him there - and that is a truth he is never going to want to confront."" Forgetting the recent history, does any of this actually matter politically now? Voters don't generally consider politicians to be particularly trustworthy. Boris Johnson's reputation and popularity is certainly not based on a view that he tells the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but. He has what pollsters call ""authenticity"" - what you see is what you get. He's not super smooth and he doesn't pretend to be perfect. The current allegations about his conduct, which he characteristically describes as a ""farrago of nonsense"" do not seem to be shifting public opinion much, if at all. But just because the Conservatives can shout loudly that no one cares about this stuff, that doesn't mean that the prime minister's complicated relationship with truth can be easily dismissed. Most straightforwardly, there are several investigations now into exactly what has happened with the Downing Street flat that could trip up him and the Conservative Party. Sources who told the BBC and other news organisations that Mr Johnson did say he would rather see ""bodies pile high"" than take the country into a third lockdown have said they would be prepared to testify under oath if they have to. Depending how and when those two issues unwind, there could be big trouble for Downing Street. Politics is an extremely tough business, as Mr Johnson has been discovering of late. Huge parliamentary majorities do not protect you from personal criticism. And many of the government's current woes can, arguably, be traced back to the PM's relationship with the truth. I've been told on more occasions than I can count that Boris Johnson trusts hardly anyone, and suspects almost everyone. As one source describes it, he ""behaves in such a way that people eventually tire of him, feel let down, and behave in the way he feared they would"". The breakdown in his relationship with his former adviser Dominic Cummings is spectacular evidence of that. But people who work alongside Mr Johnson are often kept guessing, unsure of what he really thinks. It leaves him all powerful. His whim rules. But it also can make it harder to achieve what he says he wants - the priorities he was elected to deliver. Yet popularity matters in politics too. Despite the horrors of coronavirus, hard realities have never been part of the PM's desired script. To use one of his tactics, quoting the classics, the Greek philosopher Plato said: ""No one is more hated than he who speaks the truth."" But as one of the few people who genuinely knows Boris Johnson once told me, he is a politician who above all, wants to be loved.

"People may not need to self-isolate if they have been in close contact with someone with Covid, if a new trial is successful. The government-backed research will trial giving people daily lateral flow tests for seven days - instead of quarantining for 10 days. So long as they test negative all week, they can carry on with their lives. It comes as the foreign secretary said the country was ""in a good position"" to end almost all restrictions on 21 June. But Dominic Raab told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show ""we need to keep tracking the variants and tracking the evidence"" as the UK gradually reopens. He said ""some safeguards"" may need to remain beyond the end of June, which could involve some use of masks or social distancing, but the goal was to ""get life back as close to normal as possible"". From 9 May, about 40,000 close contacts of people with Covid in England will be invited to take part in the study replacing quarantine with daily testing. Self-isolating means staying at home and not leaving it - not even to buy food or medicines, or for exercise. As part of this major new study, people will have to test themselves every morning for seven days and will be exempt from thelegal requirement to quarantine,externalat home every day they test negative, as long as they do not show anysymptoms of Covid. Lateral flow tests give results in about 30 minutes but are considered less sensitive than PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests, which are processed in a laboratory with results returned in 24 hours or so. This video can not be played Laura Foster explains how lateral flow tests work and how to do one You usually have to self-isolate for 10 days if you've tested positive orbeen in close contact,externalwith someone who has Close contact includes beingwithin two metres of someone for more than 15 minutes,external, or within one metre for a minute You might need to self-isolate for longer if you get symptoms People told to self-isolate are not allowed visitors, and are not allowed to leave their home Between May 2020 and April 2021 in England, more than 6.7 million close contacts were reached and told to self-isolate,NHS Test and Trace data shows.,external A large study of the test-and-trace system, published last month, foundlow numbers of people had followed the self-isolation rules in full. Men, younger people and parents with young children were less likely to self-isolate - as were those from more working-class backgrounds, people in financial hardship and key workers. Common reasons for not fully self-isolating included going to the shops or work, for a medical need, to care for a vulnerable person, to exercise or meet others - or because symptoms were only mild or getting better. The UK regulator has always cautioned against the use of lateral flow tests in this way. The concern is that they are not accurate enough, certainly not when used at home to correctly identify enough positive cases. So while they were given the green light for mass testing, which they are currently being used for on the basis they would pick up some cases that would not have been identified previously, deploying them to allow close contacts to avoid isolation was deemed a step too far. But the vaccination programme has changed the equation by reducing the risk from Covid. It means what is proportionate needs to be reassessed. Asking people who come into close contact to isolate has a significant cost to that individual. Is that right when the risk of Covid is lower than it once was? And will people continue to isolate given the changing landscape? Accepting some cases will slip through the net could be a price worth paying. This trial will help understand what that price is. Prof Isabel Oliver, Public Health England's national infection service director, said the study would be key to informing how ""the approach to testing might evolve"". ""Self-isolation is very challenging for some people, particularly those who aren't able to work form home or don't have access to readily available support or help from others,"" she told BBC Breakfast. ""If this allows us to return to greater normality, it would be a great step forward."" She said the study needs to recruit such a large number of people, who will be invited as part of the contact tracing process, because infection rates are relatively low at the moment. As well as the daily lateral flow test, study participants will take a more accurate PCR test at the beginning and end of the trial period. They will also take a PCR test if any of the daily tests gives a positive result. And anyone testing positive will be required to self-isolate as normal during the trial. LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? VACCINE:When will I get the jab? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? NEW VARIANTS:How worried should we be? Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""This new pilot could help shift the dial in our favour by offering a viable alternative to self-isolation for people who are contacts of positive Covid-19 cases, and one that would allow people to carry on going to work and living their lives."" GP Dr Ellie Cannon told BBC Breakfast it was ""a really positive step because we haven't been good at self-isolation"", often because people could not afford to take time off work. She said many people also had to self-isolate unnecessarily, ""which has really stopped life in the UK over the past year"". This video can not be played Professor Peter Openshaw: ""It's too early to declare victory and to drop our guard"" While lateral flow tests are not as accurate as the PCR swabs used at testing centres, their use by schools to safely reopen has shown they can be effective, Dr Cannon said. Prof Peter Openshaw, an immunologist who advises the government, said the tests were ""contentious"" but used daily, were likely to catch the people ""most prone to spreading disease"". Despite the progress in vaccination, he said ""it is too early to declare victory and to drop our guard"". ""We do know that this infection has a tendency to come back again and we need to use this time to be absolutely sure we have got every precaution in place to stop further outbreaks,"" he said. Meanwhile, Mr Raab said he would ""always look very carefully at any request"" to help as India deals with its record surge of Covid cases, which is overwhelming hospitals. But asked if the UK should pause the vaccination of younger, less vulnerable people to send doses abroad, the foreign secretary said he has not received any request from India ""on that specific issue"". He said the government was supporting vaccination worldwide with the billion doses that the UK is contributing to the World Health Organization's Covax programme.

""We haven't defeated this virus in Britain yet,"" she said. She said we should not ""pit the people of Britain against the people of India"" but should instead ""dramatically ramp up vaccination and supply"" worldwide.

"India started its vaccine drive in January, amid plummeting cases and a fair bit of optimism. The country's very own Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's largest vaccine maker, was meant to supply most of the jabs as the country headed towards an ambitious target - covering 250 million people by July. As part of a World Health Organization (WHO)-led scheme, India even exported vaccines to countries that needed them. But three months on, Covid cases and deaths are spiking across the country. Only about 26 million people have been fully vaccinated out of a population of 1.4 billion, and about 124 million have received a single dose. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has cancelled exports, reneging on international commitments. Worse, vaccine stocks in the country have nearly dried up, and no-one is sure when more will arrive. How did India get here? On Wednesday afternoon local time - just as millions of Indians were trying to register online for a Covid jab - the vaccine portal and its accompanying apps crashed. Starting 1 May, India is opening up vaccination for roughly 600 million more people, to cover 18-44 year olds. But CoWin, as the platform is known, couldn't handle it. ""I am stuck in an OTP loop of horrors,"" said one 33-year-old while trying to register for her jab. OTPs, or one-time passwords sent to mobile numbers, are a favoured Indian way of verifying identity online. She had a string of messages with OTPs, but nowhere to put them. Others didn't even get that far - #WaitingForOTP was soon trending on Twitter, and the memes and jokes followed. Eventually the site was back up - but, to the disappointment of more than 13 million people who did finally register, not a single vaccine centre had slots for booking. Allow Twitter content?

These are just a fraction of the 600 million people newly eligible for a jab. There's also another 200 million or so, 45 and above, who are yet to get their second jab. Experts say the government should have finished vaccinating people above 45 before opening it up further, especially when supply was low. In fact, this appeared to be the plan until as recently as 6 April, when the health ministry said the drive could not simply be ""accelerated"" and that it was not yet considering expanding it to all adults. It's likely the rapid, unrelenting surge in cases and reports that younger people were increasingly being admitted to hospital with severe symptoms led to the decision. Those above the age of 45 have been rushing to vaccine centres to get their jabs quickly ""They should have held their nerve and focused on the vulnerable,"" says economist Partha Mukhopadhyay. ""Now they [the 45 and above] have to compete with 600 million new demanders."" Since the announcement, those who have received no doses or a single dose so far have been queuing up at centres before supply runs out, raising the risk of infection. But that's not the only factor that has thrown India's vaccine drive into chaos. Until now, India's federal government had been the sole purchaser of the two approved vaccines - Covishield, developed by AstraZeneca with Oxford University and manufactured by SII; and Covaxin, made by a local firm Bharat Biotech. But it's now thrown open the market to not just 28 state governments, but also private hospitals, all of whom can directly negotiate and buy from the two vaccine makers. And they have to pay far more. The federal government still gets 50% of stocks for 150 rupees ($2; Â£1.40) per dose, but states have to pay double that, and private hospitals eight times as much - all while competing for the remaining half. The sudden transfer of responsibility - it was announced just 10 days ago - left officials with little time to negotiate prices or stockpile vaccines. Especially since vaccine makers still have orders pending from the federal government. This video can not be played India coronavirus: ""A Covid tsunami we had never seen before"" ""We are the only country in the world that is allowing sub-national governments to directly buy from vaccine makers. This is not at all well thought-out,"" says Mr Mukhopadhyay. The different prices are concerning, says Srinath Reddy, a public health expert who advises federal and state governments on tackling Covid-19. ""All vaccination should be free, it's for public good,"" he says. ""And why should states pay a higher price? They are also using tax payer money."" He fears that it's now a ""seller's market"", where the poorest Indians are likely to be last in line. Two private hospital chains have already announced that they will roll out the vaccine for 18-44 year olds from tomorrow, but it's unclear how they managed to secure supply when states are struggling.  Some have even said they are putting the expansion on hold until more vaccines arrive. No-one really seems to know. Even if some stocks do trickle in, the crunch will likely continue because the maths simply does not add up. The federal government still needs another 615 million doses to finish vaccinating everyone above the age of 45 - about 440 million people. State governments are expected to pick up the tab for 18-44 year olds - there are 622 million of them and they would need more than 1.2 billion doses. Even vaccinating 70% - to achieve herd immunity - would require some 870 million doses. This does not account for wastage, which means more stocks are needed. To be able to administer all of these doses in the next year, India needs to be giving 3.5 million doses a day - it's behind by more than a million doses right now. And supply is nowhere close to what is needed. SII is expected to produce about 70 million doses in May, and Bharat Biotech an additional 20 million. That's a total of 90 million doses a month. They are expected to ramp up further but that will take time. Other vaccines are now in the mix, including Russian-made Sputnik V,which is yet to be approved in Europe. The makers have already signed manufacturing deals with a host of Indian companies but the infrastructure and approvals for making a vaccine take time. So for now, India is importing the vaccine from Russia and it's expected to be rolled out in June. All of this means there will be a supply crunch at least for the next few months. Of course, there was a lot the federal government or even states could have done to ramp up vaccine manufacturing ahead of time. ""If plan A doesn't work, you should be ready with plan B,"" says Mahesh Zagade, former health secretary of Maharashtra, one of India's worst-hit states. It's a question many have asked - and the answer seems to be that no-one was preparing for a second wave. ""Our numbers were low and there was this constant narrative that India had beaten Covid,"" says virologist Shahid Jameel. If vaccination had kept pace through February and March, he adds, the second wave would have been far less intense. Experts also recommend a localised drive - that is, targeting the most vulnerable - the elderly or those with co-morbidities - in places where infections are growing fast. But to do that requires deep district and village-level surveillance and response, which virologists have said has been lacking since the start of the pandemic. Mr Zagade says breaking up populations into administrative units as small as 25,000 makes it easier to enforce social distancing and enrol people for vaccination by going door-to-door if needed. Instead, the government relied on people registering online or walking in to get their jabs. So the vaccine drive began to lag even as cases rose, driven up by lax safety protocols and massive public events, from elections to festivals. And there was no plan B because plan A was based on an assumption that has been proved wrong - that there would be no second wave at all.

"Indians are waiting for hours to cremate the deceased as cases surge Rajeshwari Devi, 58, died on Sunday after waiting for two days to get uninterrupted oxygen, an ambulance and a bed in a Covid-19 hospital. She kept waiting and gasping but it was too late by the time help arrived. She was taken to a hospital emergency room on 16 April after her oxygen saturation level dropped. Her CT scan showed that she had developed severe pneumonia. But without her Covid report the hospital refused to admit her. She spent around 36 hours in the emergency room on oxygen support in the northern Indian district of Robertsganj. The staff there told her family they were running out of oxygen and she needed to be moved to a bigger hospital but there was no ambulance or any promise of a bed. The desperate family took her in their car to a hospital where a bed had become available after the intervention of a politician. She had no oxygen support in the car - she died minutes before she could be admitted to hospital. This video can not be played What went wrong for India? Ashish Agrahari, her son, says his mother ""would have had a chance at survival if treatment was given in time"". Heartbreaking stories such as this are coming in from across India as a second Covid wave wreaks havoc. Data suggests that this wave is proving to be more infectious and deadlier in some states, although India's death rate from the virus is still relatively low. But the county's healthcare system is crumbling amid the surge in cases - doctors say it's hard for them to""see the light at the end of the tunnel this time"". The rise in case numbers has been exponential in the second wave. On 18 June last year, India recorded 11,000 cases and in the next 60 days, it added 35,000 new cases on average every day. On 10 February, at the start of the second wave, India confirmed 11,000 cases - and in the next 50 days, the daily average was around 22,000 cases. But in the following 10 days, cases rose sharply with the daily average reaching 89,800. Experts say this rapid increase shows that the second wave is spreading much faster across the country. Dr A Fathahudeen, who is part of Kerala state's Covid taskforce, said the rise was not entirely unexpected given that India let its guard down when daily infections in January fell to fewer than 20,000 from a peak of over 90,000 in September. Big religious gatherings, the reopening of most public places and crowded election ralliesare being blamed for the uptick. Dr Fathahudeen said there were warning signs in February but ""we did not get our act together"". ""I said in February that Covid had not gone anywhere and a tsunami would hit us if urgent actions were not taken. Sadly, a tsunami has indeed hit us now,"" he added. ""A false sense of normalcy crept in and everybody, including people and officials, did not take measures to stop the second wave."" Many Indian cities are reporting a chronic shortage of hospital beds. It's also evident in the desperate cries for help on social media platforms.Disturbing reports of people dying without getting timely treatmentare coming from all over the country. Several state governments say they are creating new facilities but experts say it's going to be hard to keep up with the pace of the rising number of infections. India has been consistently reporting more than 150,000 cases for days now. It reported 273,810 cases on Monday - the biggest daily spike since the pandemic began. Badly-affected cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Ahmedabad have almost run out of hospital beds. The situation is not very different in other cities, such as Lucknow, Bhopal, Kolkata, Allahabad and Surat. Public health expert Anant Bhan says officials did not use the lean period to boost facilities. ""We didn't learn any lesson from the first wave. We had reports of some cities running out of beds even in the first wave and that should have been a good enough reason to be prepared for the second wave,"" he said. He adds that there appears to be a lack of co-ordination between states and the federal government over the supply of oxygen and essential drugs. ""We need a consolidated response and resources should be shared between states."" The situation is much more dire when it comes to ICU beds. Several cities have just a few dozen ICU beds left and they are now frantically trying to build extra capacity in hotels and stadiums. But getting ICU beds up and running quickly is not easy. Dr Fathahudeen says adding beds alone is not enough. ""We need to ensure that most of these beds have oxygen facility. We need more doctors and nurses to manage extra ICU beds,"" he adds. He says it's going to be a ""daunting task"" for the government to get such facilities up and running and ensure good quality of care in a short span of time. The number of daily deaths has risen sharply in the second wave. India reported 1,761 deaths on Monday, taking the toll to over 180,000 since the pandemic began. Crematoriums have been running day and night in several cities, and people have to wait for hours to get the deceased cremated or buried. Experts say this shows that the actual number of deaths could be much higher. Sanjeev Gupta, a photojournalist based in the central Indian city of Bhopal, reached one of the city's crematoriums for what he thought was a usual assignment last week. Bhopal had reported only four Covid-related deaths on that day. But Mr Gupta was surprised to see dozens of funeral pyres burning. Additionally, several bodies were lined up to be cremated in the electric furnace. Mr Gupta says he was moved when a young man asked him to photograph the smoke coming out from the chimney of the electric crematorium. ""He said the smoke represented his mother. It's the most heartbreaking thing I have ever heard."" Another photojournalist in Lucknow, which is the capital of Uttar Pradesh state, told the BBC that he counted nearly 100 funeral pyres burning at one of the city's crematoriums in the city on 14 April. The official death data for the whole state on that day was 85. ""The sky had turned orange near the crematorium. I still get chills thinking about it. We are definitely not getting the right death data from the government,"" he said. This is the picture Mr Gupta took after the young man's request Another photojournalist the BBC spoke to in Varanasi city in Uttar Pradesh state also talked about similar discrepancies in how deaths were being reported. Experts say there are several reasons for this. One of them is that many people are dying at home because they are not getting hospital beds or they are not being able to get tested for Covid. So, they don't find a place as a Covid patient in the database managed by different states. Mr Bhan says testing facilities are still poor in smaller towns and even in some cities and ""it's possible we are missing many Covid-related deaths in these areas"". He adds that there seems to be an issue with recording Covid deaths in some states.There have been reports about administrative oversight as well,externalbut officials deny the allegation. ""We need more transparency in numbers as it helps in managing the situation and also clearly tells you how severe the situation is,"" Mr Bhan adds. India on 25 March announced that a new variant of the coronavirus had been detected from samples collected from different states. Virologist Shahid Jameel explained that a ""double mutation in key areas of the virus's spike protein may make the virus more infectious and allow it to escape the immune system"". He says the change in the virus is the only ""logical explanation"" behind the surge.Health officials in the UK are now investigatingwhether a double mutant spreads more easily and evades vaccines. As things stand there is still not enough evidence to determine any causal relationship with India's deadly second wave, and the variant is not currently listed by Public Health England as a ""variant of concern"" - a term used to describe the UK, Brazilian and South African variants. Crematoriums have been running day and night Dr Jameel adds that India started looking at mutations ""fairly late"". ""By December, India had done genome sequencing of only 5,000 samples. It wasn't a concentrated effort."" In January, India put together a group of labs to speed up sequencing and these labs started functioning in February. ""But unfortunately, the second wave started and the vision of sequencing roughly 5% of the total samples did not come through."" Sequencing becomes important in a pandemic as it allows scientists to monitor changes in the virus. ""If you can catch a more infectious variant early on in a region, you can quickly put in public health measures to stop it from spreading wider in the community,"" he explains. But it's ""never too late"" to take measures. ""We need to strengthen safety protocols and rapidly vaccinate people, and also keep an eye on mutations. If we do all this, we could reduce numbers significantly.""

"Vaccinating a billion people will be a huge challenge When it comes to vaccine making, India is a powerhouse. It runs a massive immunisation programme, makes 60% of the world's vaccines and is home to half a dozen major manufacturers, including Serum Institute of India - the largest in the world. Not surprisingly, there's no lack of ambition when it comes to vaccinating a billion people against Covid-19. India plans to receive and utilise some 500 million doses of vaccines against the disease and immunise up to 250 million people by July next year. This video can not be played Covid-19: Why mass vaccination will be a challenge for India This confidence is bolstered by its track record of immunising large numbers of people every year. India's 42-year-old immunisation programme, one of the world's largest health programmes, targets 55 million people - mainly newborns and pregnant women who receive some 390 million free doses of vaccines against a dozen diseases every year. The country also has a well-oiled electronic system to stock and track these vaccines. Yet vaccinating a billion people, including hundreds of millions of adults for the first time, against Covid-19 is going to be a daunting and unprecedented challenge, say experts. Five of the 30 vaccine candidates being developed in India are in clinical trials. They include the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine which is being tested by Serum and a home-grown one being developed by Bharat BioTech. ""Having a home-grown vaccine is a top priority,"" Dr Renu Swarup, secretary of India's Department of Biotechnology, told me. The AstraZeneca vaccine is being tested in India From choosing a bouquet of vaccines to grappling with distribution to identifying groups for the early jabs, ""everything is a challenge"", says Dr Gagandeep Kang, a microbiologist and the first Indian woman to be elected Fellow of the Royal Society of London. ""We are underestimating the complexity of the exercise. It will take at least a couple of years to get half of Indians vaccinated."" Here are some of the main challenges: India has some 27,000 ""cold chain"" stores from where stocked vaccines can reach more than eight million locations. (Nearly all vaccines need to be transported and distributed between 2C and 8C in what comprises the so-called cold chain.) Will that be enough? India will also need enough auto-disabled syringes that will prevent reuse and possible reinfection. The country's biggest syringe maker says it will bemaking a billion such syringes,externalby next year to meet rising demand. Then there are questions about smooth supplies of medical glass vials. And what about the disposal of the huge amount of medical waste that will be generated by this mass vaccination drive? India immunisation programmes is one of the largest in the world Nearly four million doctors and nurses power India's immunisation programme, but India will need more to carry out Covid vaccinations. ""I worry about how we can [extend all the resources] to rural India,"" Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, founder of Biocon, the country's leading biotechnology enterprise, told me. Vaccine supplies will be tight next year, and deciding who will get the jabs first is going to be tricky. Health Minister Harsh Vardhan says private and government health care workers and frontline workers ""of other departments"" will receive the early doses. Experts believe it's not going to be easy. ""We will never have sufficient supply of vaccines. The prioritisation of recipients is going to be a considerable challenge,"" says  epidemiologist Dr Chandrakant Lahariya. Pune-based Serum Institute of India is the world's biggest vaccine maker Consider this. In a country where the majority of healthcare is private, will a private health worker get priority over a public one? Will permanent workers get priority over people working on contracts? If elderly people with underlying conditions are eligible for early shots, how will different co-morbidities be prioritised? India, for example, has more than 70 million diabetics, the second highest in the world. Will all of them be given a blanket preference? Rolling out the vaccine in all the 30 states will not be possible. So will early supplies go to states worst-hit by the pandemic? Questions about equity and non-partisanship are inevitable. Stitching up manufacturing contracts with vaccine makers with a ""reasonably good portfolio"" of vaccines should help India give sufficient doses to people relatively quickly, according to Prashant Yadav, who studies health care supply chains at the Washington-based Centre for Global Development. But the success at routine immunisation doesn't guarantee success with Covid-19 vaccines, he says. ""The routine immunisation infrastructure has a huge footprint, but is mostly for government-run clinics. There is no large-scale adult vaccination programme and adults don't routinely seek primary care in government public health care centres,"" says Dr Yadav. A well-regulated public-private partnership is the only way out this time, he adds. People like Ms Shaw and Nandan Nilekani, a co-founder of Infosys, one of India's biggest information technology services companies, suggest that India should useAadhaar, the unique 12-digit identification number that over a billion Indians use to access welfare and pay taxes, to record and track each dose. Hindustan Syringes is planning to produce a billion syringes ""We need to design a system than can do 10 million vaccinations a day across the length and breadth of the country but allunified by a digital backbone,external,"" Mr Nilekani told a newspaper. Some of the concerns are about corruption over access to vaccines. How do authorities prevent fraud such as people getting fake papers to include themselves in lists of people who are selected for early shots?  And how do you preventfake vaccines,externalbeing sold in remote markets? How a 'warm vaccine' could help India Are Indians more immune to Covid-19? Has the pandemic really peaked in India? Why Indiaâs Covid problem could be bigger than we think Vaccines come with side effects for some people. India has a 34-year-old surveillance programme for monitoring such ""adverse events"" following immunisation. But researchers have found that benchmarks for reporting side effects still remain weak andthe number of serious adverse events are still far less than the expected numbers.,external A failure to transparently report adverse effects could easily lead to fear-mongering around vaccines. This is possibly the biggest question. Will the government acquire all the doses and roll out a state-run free or subsidised vaccination programme? Or will the affluent pay for their doses at market prices through private distribution and sale? Experts like Dr Lahariya believe that the government should be footing the bill for vaccinating every Indian until the pandemic is over. Others like Dr Shaw say that private firms could pay to vaccinate their employees. Mr Nilekani reckons that with vaccines costing between $3 and $5 (Â£2.24 and Â£3.74) in the beginning, a dual dose vaccine could cost up to $10 for each Indian and $13bn for India. That would be very expensive. That's why, says Gagandeep Kang, a good vaccine for India should cost below 50 cents a shot, be plentifully available and delivered as a single dose.

"The UK government is to cut 60% of its funding to Unicef, the United Nation's children's fund, as part of its move to reduce spending on foreign aid. It means the UN agency, which distributes humanitarian aid to children around the world, will get Â£16m this year, down from Â£40m. Unicef warned of ""serious consequences"" for children, particularly those affected by Covid-19. The Foreign Office said the pandemic has forced it to make tough decisions. The government announced last year it would cut UK aid spending from 0.7% of national income to 0.5% - which amounts to a reduction of more than Â£4bn. Some MPs defended the cuts at the time as being backed by the public, with some politicians arguing that domestic spending should come first during the pandemic. This cut is the latest to be announced as aid charities and agencies begin to reveal the impact of the government's reduced overseas development budget. What's behind the PM's aid department decision? UK cuts its pledge to UN family planning by 85% In a statement, the UK committee for Unicef said it was ""deeply concerned"" by the decision. It said the agency had been able to respond to the most pressing education, protection and health needs of children affected by Covid in 2020 thanks to the UK government funding. It went on to say it was too soon to know the full impact of this and future cuts on the Unicef programme but there was concern children living in some of the world's worst crises and conflicts would suffer the consequences. Unicef acknowledged the ""challenging"" financial situation facing governments, but called on the UK government to return to spending 0.7% of the national income on foreign aid from 2022 ""at the latest"". A spokesperson for the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said: ""The seismic impact of the pandemic on the UK economy has forced us to take tough but necessary decisions, including temporarily reducing the overall amount we spend on aid. ""We will still spend more than Â£10bn this year to fight poverty, tackle climate change and improve global health."" Earlier this week, the BBC obtained an internal Foreign Office memo which said funding for global water, sanitation and hygiene bilateral projects would becut by more than 80%, prompting criticismfrom leading charity WaterAid. It also emerged that the United Nations global family planning programmewould not receive Â£154m for its projects, as pledged by the UK, and would instead get about Â£23m this year. Asked about the cuts, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the government had always been clear it intended to return to spending 0.7% of national income on aid when it was ""fiscally prudent to do so"". Separately, the UK government has given the BBC World Service Â£8m to help tackle disinformation and inaccurate news reporting around the world. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said it would allow the BBC to ""take impartial journalism to many more people around the world, by countering those who distort the truth to mislead the public"". The money comes on top of previous funding for the BBC's World2020 programme, which was launched in 2016 and aims to expand the BBC's global reach. BBC director-general Tim Davie said through the programme the World Service has achieved an all-time record audience of 351 million, in 42 languages, with the BBC's global news services now reaching 438 million every week.

"Protesters skirmished with riot police during a May Day protest in Istanbul, Turkey Turkish police have arrested more than 200 people for holding unauthorised protests on May Day, which has seen rallies across the world despite the continued spread of Covid-19. The protesters in Turkey's largest city, Istanbul, were caught breaching restrictions imposed to curb a third wave of coronavirus. Marches led by workers and unions are held on 1 May every year as part of International Labour Day celebrations in many countries. This year, the rallies took place once again against the backdrop of a pandemic that has destroyed livelihoods and upended economies worldwide. German riot police stepped in to break up rallies in Berlin that were deemed to be in breach of Covid-19 restrictions Labour unions traditionally lead rallies worldwide on 1 May, such as this one in Turin In many countries, police were deployed in large numbers to deal with possible disorder and ensure coronavirus restrictions were observed. Scaled-back rallies were held in Germany, Russia, Spain, Sweden, the UK, Cuba, Colombia, the Philippines, Indonesia and many other countries. Most demonstrations were peaceful. Swedish police officers take a protester into custody in Stockholm Tensions were high in many cities, such as Paris, as the effects of the pandemic continue to be felt But Turkey was among several countries where police were embroiled in May Day protests that turned violent on Saturday. The office of Istanbul's governor said 212 people had been arrested after they broke away from marches and tried to enter Taksim Square, a symbolic area of protest. Pictures showed chaotic scenes in which police used their shields to push back crowds and dragged some protesters away from the square. The country went intoits first full pandemic lockdown earlier this week, in a bid to curb a surge in infections and deaths. Riot police detained demonstrators as they attempted to march on Taksim Square in Istanbul Scuffles between riot police and demonstrators broke out in the Turkish city In France, at least 46 people were arrested in the capital, Paris, after some marchers clashed with riot police, threw stones, smashed windows and set fire to rubbish bins. French government agencies condemned one protester who was pictured assaulting a firefighter as they attempted to extinguish a blaze in the capital. The Interior Ministry said more than 106,000 people marched at almost 300 rallies organised in Paris and other cities, including Lyon, Nantes, Lille and Toulouse. The protesters voiced their opposition to government plans to change unemployment benefits and demanded economic justice. Riot police were out in force in the French capital Barricades were set alight in the streets of Paris Similar demands were heard in Germany, where May Day protests were held nationwide despite the introduction of tougher Covid-19 rules last week. In the capital, Berlin, thousands of police were deployed to monitor multiple demonstrations, including one organised by a group that opposes the government's coronavirus strategy. An estimated 10,000 cyclists staged a peaceful anti-capitalist protest in the city. But as darkness fell, the mood grew more tense as protesters set barricades alight and confronted police who were trying to enforce Covid-19 regulations at a left-wing demonstration. Workers of the wheels united for an anti-capitalist protest in Berlin Large crowds were seen in Berlin, where protests were held in defiance of Covid-19 restrictions German police were pictured dragging some protesters away in the capital Berlin police broke up a left-wing demonstration, prompting a reaction from some protesters Coronavirus was on the agenda in Indonesia as well. At one rally, protesters in the capital of Jakarta laid mock graves on the street to symbolise the human toll of the pandemic. Mock graves were laid in the street at one May Day rally in Indonesia Rallies were held in multiple cities across Indonesia Labour Day celebrations were unusually muted in Cuba, where workers gather for large events to commemorate the communist revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power in 1959. But for the second year running, Cuba called off its May Day march though Havana's Plaza de la Revolution Square, as the country battles Covid-19 and an economic crisis. Instead, a small number of national leaders gathered at largely empty public spaces, while citizens were urged to celebrate at home. Cuba's May Day celebrations had little of the usual pomp and circumstance Labour Day is one of the biggest events of the year in Cuba In Brussels, Belgium's capital, officers trying to clear a dance rave from a park used water cannon, pepper spray and batons as some of the partygoers pelted them with eggs. During the commotion, one demonstrator was knocked unconscious after they were struck by a water cannon truck, local media said.

"Not quite a butterfly: Colin the deep fried caterpillar cake Britain's most famous birthday cake has been given the full Scottish chippy treatment. The concept of the deep fried chocolate bar was taken to a new level when a full Colin the Caterpillar cake was battered and dropped into the deep fat fryer in a Lanarkshire chip shop. The deep-fried Colin stunned customers on Friday as he posed on the hot plate. The culinary experiment follows a legal row between M&S and Aldi over use of the caterpillar cake idea. Ricky Brandon, who owns Emanuel's chip shop in East Kilbride was asked to batter the cake by local food delivery app East Kilbride Eats after the cake hit the headlines. M&S sues Aldi over Colin the Caterpillar cake M&S hits back at Aldi's Cuthbert the Caterpillar cake revival He said he had fried a few Mars bars in his time, several creme eggs and the odd Twix. But never a caterpillar. The process became heated when he realised he would need an extra-thick batter to hold the body together. Colin emerged from the deep fat fryer not as a butterfly but as a crispy chocolate log. Trust the process: Colin the caterpillar gets battered Mr Brandon told BBC Scotland: ""For my first attempt, I am not dissatisfied. ""The customers who came in and saw it were surprised,  saying 'What is that?'."" Controversially, he said: ""I think Cuthbert might fry a little better."" A row broke out last month when Marks & Spencer launched legal action against Aldi, arguing the supermarket's Cuthbert the Caterpillar cake infringed its Colin the Caterpillar trademark. M&S claimed that their similarity led consumers to believe they were of the same standard and that the Aldi cake ""rides on the coat-tails"" of M&S's reputation. Colin the caterpillar and Cuthbert It lodged an intellectual property claim with the High Court. The news prompted taste tests across the country, and social media was awash with ""free Cuthbert"" memes. A Twitter exchange between the two supermarket brands followed. Aldi, who had stopped selling the cake in February, announced a limited edition version of Cuthbert to benefit the Teenage Cancer Trust and Macmillan Cancer Support. M&S said it loved a charity idea, but Aldi should use its own character. Unveiling the idea on social media, Aldi said: ""Let's raise money for charity, not lawyers."" M&S replied that a cake based on Aldi's Kevin the Carrot commercials would be better, adding: ""That idea's on us."".

"India has expanded its coronavirus vaccination drive as it grapples with huge numbers of Covid cases All people aged over 18 are now eligible for a first jab, but the drive's being hampered by a supply shortage The nation has become the first country to report more than 400,000 new coronavirus cases in a single day Some 3,523 deaths were officially recorded in the past 24 hours - but the real figure is thought to be far higher as many fatalities go unreported In England, care home residents will be able to make low-risk trips without having to self-isolate for two weeks on their return, from Tuesday A campaign is launched to raise money to build a memorial in St Paul's Cathedral to those who've died as a result of the pandemic South Asian communities in England were more at risk of infection, severe illness and death during the second wave of the pandemic, compared with other ethnic groups, a study says Surge testing is launched in the Tower Hamlets area of London after the discovery of several cases of the Brazilian and South African variants Edited by Holly Wallis That's all from the live page team. You updates were brought to you by Chris Clayton, Holly Wallis, Jennifer Meierhans and Victoria Lindrea. We will be back with more coronavirus news tomorrow, have a good evening. We're going to be drawing our live page updates to a close soon so here's a recap of the main coronavirus news from the UK and beyond. Lockdown is being extended for another week in Delhi. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal asked people not to queue up for injections as the city had not yet received fresh vaccine stocks. ""As soon as vaccines arrive we will let you know, then you can come for shots. We appeal to you not to crowd vaccine centres in the next few days,"" Kejriwal said. About 150 million shots have been given so far in India, equivalent to 11.5% of its 1.3 billion strong population. But despite being the world's biggest producer of vaccines, the country is suffering an internal shortage and has placeda temporary hold on all exports of AstraZenecato meet domestic demand. More than 13 million people aged 18-45 have registered for the jab, but states including central Madhya Pradesh and hard-hit Maharashtra have said they will not start vaccinating this age group on 1 May as planned due to supply problems. We've got more on the Covid situation in Indiahere. Surge testing is to be carried out in Tower Hamlets, east London after a small number of the coronavirus variants first detected in Brazil and South Africa were identified there. These strains,externalof Covid-19 may be more contagious and dodge immunity to some extent. All the confirmed cases are self-isolating and there are no links between these cases and the cluster of cases recently
identified in the South London area. The variants have been identified in the area around E1 4 and E1 3 and some of E1 0, E1 1, E1 2, E1 5, E14 7, E2 0, E2 6, E3 4. Everyone over the age of 11 in these areas is being advised to take a PCR test, even if they donât have symptoms. You can find out more about the variants of concernhere. International travel is expected to be allowed again from 17 May at the earliest Monday 17 May marks the next stage of the government's lifting of lockdown restrictions across England. So what is expected to change in mid-May?  How and when restrictions change will ultimately depend on key data improving - and the easing differs between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.You can find out all you need to know about the relaxation of rules here. Restaurateur Hugh Osmond has called for a faster reopening of hospitality than 17 May - the date which marks the next stage for relaxing restrictions in England. Changes in the road map on 17 May are expected to include allowing pubs, cafes and restaurants to serve customers indoors - they can currently only serve outdoors. Osmond, the founder of Punch Taverns, said ""hard data"" suggested restrictions could be eased more quickly, since infections, hospital admissions and deaths were falling faster than previously predicted. He said the current data was ""significantly ahead of the assumptions in the model"" used to draw up the road map out of lockdown. There was now ""zero chance of the NHS being overwhelmed"", he added. Osmond, who brought a legal case against the government challenging Covid restrictions on hospitality, highlighted a recent study from Sage which had concluded that eating out had not led to an increased risk of becoming ill with coronavirus. Meanwhile, every day of closure was costing the industry Â£200m, he said, and ""every day places are closed and more go bust"". It comes asgovernment scientific adviser Prof Sir Mark Walport cautioned that many people were still not vaccinated,adding the public needed to be ""patient for a short period"" while lockdown was gradually eased. He told the BBC there was still a ""potential for that spark to reignite"" and cause infections to rise. A total of 49,287,257 coronavirus vaccinations have been given in the UK,according to today's government data.,external That's 34,346,273 first doses and 14,940,984 second doses. You can find out when you'll get your jabhere. A further seven people have died with coronavirus in the UK,according to the government's daily figures.,external This brings the total number of people to die within 28 days of a positive test to 127,524. There were also another 1,907 new infections reported in the last 24 hours. As we've been reporting, India has become the first country to report more than 400,000 new coronavirus cases in a single day, as its nationwide vaccine drive launches amid a supply crisis. There are also acute shortages of oxygen and hospital beds. Members of the diaspora - with family and friends in India - have responded by raising funds, sending life-saving equipment and offering their own expertise. Mehez Warsi is an Indian-born physiotherapist who has lived in the UK for the past seven years but is now back in Mumbai. She told the BBC's Newshour she had lost ""at least 36 people in the last two weeks"" including her father and her aunt. This video can not be played Devina GuptaBBC News India continues to struggle. In the past 48 hours the situation has worsened. Twelve people died when a private hospital in Delhi  ran out of Oxygen. Some hospitals are now turning away critically ill patients. To fight the pandemic, India's prime minister Narendra Modi has lowered the age limit for vaccination from 45 to 18. This will make an estimated 600 million more people eligible for the jab starting today. But only six states will be rolling out this initiative, others have put it on hold, saying their vaccine reserves have dried up. So far, the central government has denied there are vaccine shortages in the country. India is one of the world's largest vaccine manufacturers and produces nearly 80 million doses every month, but experts say this needs to be ramped up fast. The government has so far opposed a national lockdown. With an aim to give doses to nearly every adult around the world, this is the largest vaccination programme in history. More than one billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in 179 countries worldwide. China and the US have administered the highest number of doses, 255 million and 237 million respectively. India ranks third, with nearly 150 million. But while nearly all of Europe and the Americas have begun vaccination campaigns,a few countries in Africa are still to get started. Our Visual and Data Journalism team has been looking at the stats -read on to find out which vaccines are going where, and why.  We told you earlier about changes to care home regulations, which mean residents will be allowed to leave their home to see loved ones without having to quarantine for 14 days on their return. So what are the key changes taking place next week? From Tuesday, the government has said residents can take day trips, such as walks or visits to parks or gardens, providing they remain outside. Residents must be accompanied by either a member of staff or one of their two nominated visitors, and they must follow social distancing throughout. They cannot meet in groups or go indoors, except for the use of toilets, and public transport should be avoided where possible. An exemption is in place for those who wish to vote in person in the local elections on 6 May, the government says. Only trips deemed ""low risk"" are exempt from the self-isolation rule, so this does not include activities such as overnight visits. The Department of Health and Social Care said updated guidance would be published in due course. There remain different rules in the UK's devolved nations, with residents inWales,externalable to leave homes - where there is no Covid outbreak - without isolating on their return. Scotland'sguidance for care homes,externalallows for residents to see loved ones outside of the care home, while rules for care homes in Northern Irelandvary by region,external.   Michael BristowBBC World Service Asia Pacific editor Hong Kong officials have been accused of discrimination after ordering all foreign domestic workers to have coronavirus tests. Nearly 400,000 domestic employees - mostly women from the Philippines and Indonesia - will have to be tested.
They have one week to comply. The order came after two foreign workers were infected - but the order doesn't extend to the families they work for, or local people working in similar environments. In future, overseas domestic helpers employed in Hong Kong will also have to be vaccinated against the virus. Rights groups say this low-paid group is being unfairly targeted.
But officials said they're simply protecting the public. Meanwhile, several people have died at a hospital in Delhi today when critically ill patients were left without oxygen for about 80 minutes before re-supply tankers arrived, according to local media reports. And a fire in a Covid-19 hospital ward in the western city of Bharuch killed 18 people - the latest in a number of deadly hospital fires across the country this week. Vijay Gupta, 62, was gasping for air outside a hospital in the south-east of India's capital because all of its beds were full. ""We have been roaming around since 06:00 looking for a bed,"" a friend told Reuters news agency. ""Where shall we go?"" In Srinagar, the main city of Indian-administered Kashmir, one man said he had been waiting for vaccines to become available at a health centre, only to be told to come back another time. He said two relatives were with him who had health conditions. ""I'm very worried about them but we're still waiting,"" he told the BBC. We've got more on the Covid situation in Indiahere. Aamir PeerzadBBC News, Srinagar This video can not be played India Covid vaccination: 'Everybody should get jabs as cases are rising' According to the federal government's new vaccination policy, the state governments and the hospitals can purchase the vaccines directly from the manufacturers. But while India is the largest vaccine manufacturer, it seems there are not enough vaccines available. Many states have announced that they can't begin the vaccination drive as the manufacturers have not been able to keep up with demand. That has led to widespread disappointment. Experts say at the current rate, it may take India years to vaccinate its entire population. But can India's estimated 800 million eligible citizens, and indeed the world, afford to wait for so long? Border restrictions have been eased on the Isle of Man to allow non-resident family members to visit from today. The island's border has beenclosed to almost all non-residentssince the start of the pandemic, keeping some families apart for more than a year. Anyone who visits must isolate for seven days and pay Â£60 for two Covid-19 tests. Following a second negative test, people can leave isolation but will face further restrictions for the next three days, including a ban on using public transport or visiting pubs, restaurants and theatres. Anyone visiting from further afield must isolate for 14 days. Chief Minister Howard Quayle says the relaxation is possible because of the island's progress with its vaccination programme and the fall in infection rates in the UK. More than three quarters of adults living on the island have had at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine and there are only 10 active coronavirus cases. We've got more on this storyhere. Earlier we told you about criticism over the goverment's failure to reveal more details about the traffic light system that it has proposed to help regulate international travel after 17 May. Tory MP Huw Merriman, who chairs the Commons' Transport Select Committee, accused ministers of missing today's deadline to grade overseas destinations. But a spokeswoman for the Department for Transport insists the government ""has not missed a deadline"". ""We have always said we will confirm by early May if international travel can resume on 17 May and which countries will fall into which list. ""This will determine the requirements for travel for passengers."" She says the government's Global Travel Taskforce is working towards restarting international in a ""safe and sustainable way"". Mr Merriman earlier bemoaned the lack of information, which meant travellers and the travel industry were ""still in the dark"". ""Uncertainty has been prolonged. This uncertainty could cost people their jobs,"" he said. ""How can it be right that countries with slower vaccination roll-outs are safely reopening to international travellers while the UK stays static?"" As we've mentioned, social distancing is being eased at the Snooker World Championship to allow the final to be played in front of a capacity crowd at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield. The return of fans is being staggered throughout the event from 33% capacity for the first round to 100% for the final games on Sunday and Monday. World Snooker says face coverings are required but social distancing ""will not be expected"". The tournament ispart of the government's pilot schemeto ensure fans can safely return to sporting and cultural venues. Fans have to take a Covid-19 test before arriving and another five days afterwards. Revellers at the Circus Nightclub at Bramley-Moore Dock, Liverpool DJ Marea Stamper has described the ""incredible energy"" at a pilot event in a warehouse on Liverpool's waterfront which saw some 3,000 clubbers gathered together without masks or social distancing on Friday. The event was part of the government's test programme to evaluate how to hold mass gatherings safely as the country unlocks. ""Of course the whole thing sort of operated silently as a science experiment - they were studying ventilation and crowd patterns - but every precaution was taken to make sure we were safe,"" said the DJ, whose professional name is The Blessed Madonna. She told the BBC that those attending were ""incredibly emotional"". ""I think we felt excited but also proud to be a part of creating the protocols that would lead to the reopening of all kinds of things."" Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden has described the event as ""another huge moment in our journey back to normality"". The MP said he had attended the Snooker World Championship at Sheffield's Crucible Theatre on Friday - where initial social distancing requirements are being ""gradually eased"" to allow 100% capacity at the finals on Sunday and Monday. ""I have seen first hand just how important these research events are,"" said Mr Dowden. But he cautioned: ""We are making good progress but we have been clear that decisions on reopening will be led by the data.  A woman has shared how she paid for a private coronavirus vaccine in Pakistan as cases there hit a record high. Mahwish Bhatti is one of only 2% to have received a jab in the country. She paid 12,000 rupees ($78; Â£56) to a private lab - a price out of reach to many Pakistanis. Already Pakistan has seen active cases go from as low as 16,000 in the first week of March, to more than 140,000 new cases in April alone, as well as over 3,000 deaths - making it the worst month there since the pandemic began. Prime Minister Imran Khan has warned that Pakistan - with less than one doctor per 963 people - could be headed for disaster. For Bhatti, choosing a private laboratory to be vaccinated against the coronavirus was a last resort. ""I was desperate. I panicked,"" the 35-year-old from Lahore, Pakistan, told the BBC over the phone. ""My mother was still waiting for her second dose of the vaccine, so I thought my turn would never come. I thought to myself, I will just buy whatever vaccine is available."" Bhatti, who lost her job recently, used some of her savings to get the Russian-made Sputnik V jab. She says: ""I did get one jab of vaccines, but also one jab to my wallet."" We've got more on this storyhere. Â© 2025 BBC.

"India started its vaccine drive in January, amid plummeting cases and a fair bit of optimism. The country's very own Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's largest vaccine maker, was meant to supply most of the jabs as the country headed towards an ambitious target - covering 250 million people by July. As part of a World Health Organization (WHO)-led scheme, India even exported vaccines to countries that needed them. But three months on, Covid cases and deaths are spiking across the country. Only about 26 million people have been fully vaccinated out of a population of 1.4 billion, and about 124 million have received a single dose. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has cancelled exports, reneging on international commitments. Worse, vaccine stocks in the country have nearly dried up, and no-one is sure when more will arrive. How did India get here? On Wednesday afternoon local time - just as millions of Indians were trying to register online for a Covid jab - the vaccine portal and its accompanying apps crashed. Starting 1 May, India is opening up vaccination for roughly 600 million more people, to cover 18-44 year olds. But CoWin, as the platform is known, couldn't handle it. ""I am stuck in an OTP loop of horrors,"" said one 33-year-old while trying to register for her jab. OTPs, or one-time passwords sent to mobile numbers, are a favoured Indian way of verifying identity online. She had a string of messages with OTPs, but nowhere to put them. Others didn't even get that far - #WaitingForOTP was soon trending on Twitter, and the memes and jokes followed. Eventually the site was back up - but, to the disappointment of more than 13 million people who did finally register, not a single vaccine centre had slots for booking. Allow Twitter content?

These are just a fraction of the 600 million people newly eligible for a jab. There's also another 200 million or so, 45 and above, who are yet to get their second jab. Experts say the government should have finished vaccinating people above 45 before opening it up further, especially when supply was low. In fact, this appeared to be the plan until as recently as 6 April, when the health ministry said the drive could not simply be ""accelerated"" and that it was not yet considering expanding it to all adults. It's likely the rapid, unrelenting surge in cases and reports that younger people were increasingly being admitted to hospital with severe symptoms led to the decision. Those above the age of 45 have been rushing to vaccine centres to get their jabs quickly ""They should have held their nerve and focused on the vulnerable,"" says economist Partha Mukhopadhyay. ""Now they [the 45 and above] have to compete with 600 million new demanders."" Since the announcement, those who have received no doses or a single dose so far have been queuing up at centres before supply runs out, raising the risk of infection. But that's not the only factor that has thrown India's vaccine drive into chaos. Until now, India's federal government had been the sole purchaser of the two approved vaccines - Covishield, developed by AstraZeneca with Oxford University and manufactured by SII; and Covaxin, made by a local firm Bharat Biotech. But it's now thrown open the market to not just 28 state governments, but also private hospitals, all of whom can directly negotiate and buy from the two vaccine makers. And they have to pay far more. The federal government still gets 50% of stocks for 150 rupees ($2; Â£1.40) per dose, but states have to pay double that, and private hospitals eight times as much - all while competing for the remaining half. The sudden transfer of responsibility - it was announced just 10 days ago - left officials with little time to negotiate prices or stockpile vaccines. Especially since vaccine makers still have orders pending from the federal government. This video can not be played India coronavirus: ""A Covid tsunami we had never seen before"" ""We are the only country in the world that is allowing sub-national governments to directly buy from vaccine makers. This is not at all well thought-out,"" says Mr Mukhopadhyay. The different prices are concerning, says Srinath Reddy, a public health expert who advises federal and state governments on tackling Covid-19. ""All vaccination should be free, it's for public good,"" he says. ""And why should states pay a higher price? They are also using tax payer money."" He fears that it's now a ""seller's market"", where the poorest Indians are likely to be last in line. Two private hospital chains have already announced that they will roll out the vaccine for 18-44 year olds from tomorrow, but it's unclear how they managed to secure supply when states are struggling.  Some have even said they are putting the expansion on hold until more vaccines arrive. No-one really seems to know. Even if some stocks do trickle in, the crunch will likely continue because the maths simply does not add up. The federal government still needs another 615 million doses to finish vaccinating everyone above the age of 45 - about 440 million people. State governments are expected to pick up the tab for 18-44 year olds - there are 622 million of them and they would need more than 1.2 billion doses. Even vaccinating 70% - to achieve herd immunity - would require some 870 million doses. This does not account for wastage, which means more stocks are needed. To be able to administer all of these doses in the next year, India needs to be giving 3.5 million doses a day - it's behind by more than a million doses right now. And supply is nowhere close to what is needed. SII is expected to produce about 70 million doses in May, and Bharat Biotech an additional 20 million. That's a total of 90 million doses a month. They are expected to ramp up further but that will take time. Other vaccines are now in the mix, including Russian-made Sputnik V,which is yet to be approved in Europe. The makers have already signed manufacturing deals with a host of Indian companies but the infrastructure and approvals for making a vaccine take time. So for now, India is importing the vaccine from Russia and it's expected to be rolled out in June. All of this means there will be a supply crunch at least for the next few months. Of course, there was a lot the federal government or even states could have done to ramp up vaccine manufacturing ahead of time. ""If plan A doesn't work, you should be ready with plan B,"" says Mahesh Zagade, former health secretary of Maharashtra, one of India's worst-hit states. It's a question many have asked - and the answer seems to be that no-one was preparing for a second wave. ""Our numbers were low and there was this constant narrative that India had beaten Covid,"" says virologist Shahid Jameel. If vaccination had kept pace through February and March, he adds, the second wave would have been far less intense. Experts also recommend a localised drive - that is, targeting the most vulnerable - the elderly or those with co-morbidities - in places where infections are growing fast. But to do that requires deep district and village-level surveillance and response, which virologists have said has been lacking since the start of the pandemic. Mr Zagade says breaking up populations into administrative units as small as 25,000 makes it easier to enforce social distancing and enrol people for vaccination by going door-to-door if needed. Instead, the government relied on people registering online or walking in to get their jabs. So the vaccine drive began to lag even as cases rose, driven up by lax safety protocols and massive public events, from elections to festivals. And there was no plan B because plan A was based on an assumption that has been proved wrong - that there would be no second wave at all.

"India started its vaccine drive in January, amid plummeting cases and a fair bit of optimism. The country's very own Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's largest vaccine maker, was meant to supply most of the jabs as the country headed towards an ambitious target - covering 250 million people by July. As part of a World Health Organization (WHO)-led scheme, India even exported vaccines to countries that needed them. But three months on, Covid cases and deaths are spiking across the country. Only about 26 million people have been fully vaccinated out of a population of 1.4 billion, and about 124 million have received a single dose. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has cancelled exports, reneging on international commitments. Worse, vaccine stocks in the country have nearly dried up, and no-one is sure when more will arrive. How did India get here? On Wednesday afternoon local time - just as millions of Indians were trying to register online for a Covid jab - the vaccine portal and its accompanying apps crashed. Starting 1 May, India is opening up vaccination for roughly 600 million more people, to cover 18-44 year olds. But CoWin, as the platform is known, couldn't handle it. ""I am stuck in an OTP loop of horrors,"" said one 33-year-old while trying to register for her jab. OTPs, or one-time passwords sent to mobile numbers, are a favoured Indian way of verifying identity online. She had a string of messages with OTPs, but nowhere to put them. Others didn't even get that far - #WaitingForOTP was soon trending on Twitter, and the memes and jokes followed. Eventually the site was back up - but, to the disappointment of more than 13 million people who did finally register, not a single vaccine centre had slots for booking. Allow Twitter content?

These are just a fraction of the 600 million people newly eligible for a jab. There's also another 200 million or so, 45 and above, who are yet to get their second jab. Experts say the government should have finished vaccinating people above 45 before opening it up further, especially when supply was low. In fact, this appeared to be the plan until as recently as 6 April, when the health ministry said the drive could not simply be ""accelerated"" and that it was not yet considering expanding it to all adults. It's likely the rapid, unrelenting surge in cases and reports that younger people were increasingly being admitted to hospital with severe symptoms led to the decision. Those above the age of 45 have been rushing to vaccine centres to get their jabs quickly ""They should have held their nerve and focused on the vulnerable,"" says economist Partha Mukhopadhyay. ""Now they [the 45 and above] have to compete with 600 million new demanders."" Since the announcement, those who have received no doses or a single dose so far have been queuing up at centres before supply runs out, raising the risk of infection. But that's not the only factor that has thrown India's vaccine drive into chaos. Until now, India's federal government had been the sole purchaser of the two approved vaccines - Covishield, developed by AstraZeneca with Oxford University and manufactured by SII; and Covaxin, made by a local firm Bharat Biotech. But it's now thrown open the market to not just 28 state governments, but also private hospitals, all of whom can directly negotiate and buy from the two vaccine makers. And they have to pay far more. The federal government still gets 50% of stocks for 150 rupees ($2; Â£1.40) per dose, but states have to pay double that, and private hospitals eight times as much - all while competing for the remaining half. The sudden transfer of responsibility - it was announced just 10 days ago - left officials with little time to negotiate prices or stockpile vaccines. Especially since vaccine makers still have orders pending from the federal government. This video can not be played India coronavirus: ""A Covid tsunami we had never seen before"" ""We are the only country in the world that is allowing sub-national governments to directly buy from vaccine makers. This is not at all well thought-out,"" says Mr Mukhopadhyay. The different prices are concerning, says Srinath Reddy, a public health expert who advises federal and state governments on tackling Covid-19. ""All vaccination should be free, it's for public good,"" he says. ""And why should states pay a higher price? They are also using tax payer money."" He fears that it's now a ""seller's market"", where the poorest Indians are likely to be last in line. Two private hospital chains have already announced that they will roll out the vaccine for 18-44 year olds from tomorrow, but it's unclear how they managed to secure supply when states are struggling.  Some have even said they are putting the expansion on hold until more vaccines arrive. No-one really seems to know. Even if some stocks do trickle in, the crunch will likely continue because the maths simply does not add up. The federal government still needs another 615 million doses to finish vaccinating everyone above the age of 45 - about 440 million people. State governments are expected to pick up the tab for 18-44 year olds - there are 622 million of them and they would need more than 1.2 billion doses. Even vaccinating 70% - to achieve herd immunity - would require some 870 million doses. This does not account for wastage, which means more stocks are needed.

"Vaccinating a billion people will be a huge challenge When it comes to vaccine making, India is a powerhouse. It runs a massive immunisation programme, makes 60% of the world's vaccines and is home to half a dozen major manufacturers, including Serum Institute of India - the largest in the world. Not surprisingly, there's no lack of ambition when it comes to vaccinating a billion people against Covid-19. India plans to receive and utilise some 500 million doses of vaccines against the disease and immunise up to 250 million people by July next year. This video can not be played Covid-19: Why mass vaccination will be a challenge for India This confidence is bolstered by its track record of immunising large numbers of people every year. India's 42-year-old immunisation programme, one of the world's largest health programmes, targets 55 million people - mainly newborns and pregnant women who receive some 390 million free doses of vaccines against a dozen diseases every year. The country also has a well-oiled electronic system to stock and track these vaccines. Yet vaccinating a billion people, including hundreds of millions of adults for the first time, against Covid-19 is going to be a daunting and unprecedented challenge, say experts. Five of the 30 vaccine candidates being developed in India are in clinical trials. They include the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine which is being tested by Serum and a home-grown one being developed by Bharat BioTech. ""Having a home-grown vaccine is a top priority,"" Dr Renu Swarup, secretary of India's Department of Biotechnology, told me. The AstraZeneca vaccine is being tested in India From choosing a bouquet of vaccines to grappling with distribution to identifying groups for the early jabs, ""everything is a challenge"", says Dr Gagandeep Kang, a microbiologist and the first Indian woman to be elected Fellow of the Royal Society of London. ""We are underestimating the complexity of the exercise. It will take at least a couple of years to get half of Indians vaccinated."" Here are some of the main challenges: India has some 27,000 ""cold chain"" stores from where stocked vaccines can reach more than eight million locations. (Nearly all vaccines need to be transported and distributed between 2C and 8C in what comprises the so-called cold chain.) Will that be enough? India will also need enough auto-disabled syringes that will prevent reuse and possible reinfection. The country's biggest syringe maker says it will bemaking a billion such syringes,externalby next year to meet rising demand. Then there are questions about smooth supplies of medical glass vials. And what about the disposal of the huge amount of medical waste that will be generated by this mass vaccination drive? India immunisation programmes is one of the largest in the world Nearly four million doctors and nurses power India's immunisation programme, but India will need more to carry out Covid vaccinations. ""I worry about how we can [extend all the resources] to rural India,"" Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, founder of Biocon, the country's leading biotechnology enterprise, told me. Vaccine supplies will be tight next year, and deciding who will get the jabs first is going to be tricky. Health Minister Harsh Vardhan says private and government health care workers and frontline workers ""of other departments"" will receive the early doses. Experts believe it's not going to be easy. ""We will never have sufficient supply of vaccines. The prioritisation of recipients is going to be a considerable challenge,"" says  epidemiologist Dr Chandrakant Lahariya. Pune-based Serum Institute of India is the world's biggest vaccine maker Consider this. In a country where the majority of healthcare is private, will a private health worker get priority over a public one? Will permanent workers get priority over people working on contracts? If elderly people with underlying conditions are eligible for early shots, how will different co-morbidities be prioritised? India, for example, has more than 70 million diabetics, the second highest in the world. Will all of them be given a blanket preference? Rolling out the vaccine in all the 30 states will not be possible. So will early supplies go to states worst-hit by the pandemic? Questions about equity and non-partisanship are inevitable. Stitching up manufacturing contracts with vaccine makers with a ""reasonably good portfolio"" of vaccines should help India give sufficient doses to people relatively quickly, according to Prashant Yadav, who studies health care supply chains at the Washington-based Centre for Global Development. But the success at routine immunisation doesn't guarantee success with Covid-19 vaccines, he says. ""The routine immunisation infrastructure has a huge footprint, but is mostly for government-run clinics. There is no large-scale adult vaccination programme and adults don't routinely seek primary care in government public health care centres,"" says Dr Yadav. A well-regulated public-private partnership is the only way out this time, he adds. People like Ms Shaw and Nandan Nilekani, a co-founder of Infosys, one of India's biggest information technology services companies, suggest that India should useAadhaar, the unique 12-digit identification number that over a billion Indians use to access welfare and pay taxes, to record and track each dose. Hindustan Syringes is planning to produce a billion syringes ""We need to design a system than can do 10 million vaccinations a day across the length and breadth of the country but allunified by a digital backbone,external,"" Mr Nilekani told a newspaper. Some of the concerns are about corruption over access to vaccines. How do authorities prevent fraud such as people getting fake papers to include themselves in lists of people who are selected for early shots?  And how do you preventfake vaccines,externalbeing sold in remote markets? How a 'warm vaccine' could help India Are Indians more immune to Covid-19? Has the pandemic really peaked in India? Why Indiaâs Covid problem could be bigger than we think Vaccines come with side effects for some people. India has a 34-year-old surveillance programme for monitoring such ""adverse events"" following immunisation. But researchers have found that benchmarks for reporting side effects still remain weak andthe number of serious adverse events are still far less than the expected numbers.,external A failure to transparently report adverse effects could easily lead to fear-mongering around vaccines. This is possibly the biggest question. Will the government acquire all the doses and roll out a state-run free or subsidised vaccination programme? Or will the affluent pay for their doses at market prices through private distribution and sale? Experts like Dr Lahariya believe that the government should be footing the bill for vaccinating every Indian until the pandemic is over. Others like Dr Shaw say that private firms could pay to vaccinate their employees. Mr Nilekani reckons that with vaccines costing between $3 and $5 (Â£2.24 and Â£3.74) in the beginning, a dual dose vaccine could cost up to $10 for each Indian and $13bn for India. That would be very expensive. That's why, says Gagandeep Kang, a good vaccine for India should cost below 50 cents a shot, be plentifully available and delivered as a single dose.

"India has expanded its coronavirus vaccination drive as it grapples with huge numbers of Covid cases All people aged over 18 are now eligible for a first jab, but the drive's being hampered by a supply shortage The nation has become the first country to report more than 400,000 new coronavirus cases in a single day Some 3,523 deaths were officially recorded in the past 24 hours - but the real figure is thought to be far higher as many fatalities go unreported In England, care home residents will be able to make low-risk trips without having to self-isolate for two weeks on their return, from Tuesday A campaign is launched to raise money to build a memorial in St Paul's Cathedral to those who've died as a result of the pandemic South Asian communities in England were more at risk of infection, severe illness and death during the second wave of the pandemic, compared with other ethnic groups, a study says Surge testing is launched in the Tower Hamlets area of London after the discovery of several cases of the Brazilian and South African variants Edited by Holly Wallis That's all from the live page team. You updates were brought to you by Chris Clayton, Holly Wallis, Jennifer Meierhans and Victoria Lindrea. We will be back with more coronavirus news tomorrow, have a good evening. We're going to be drawing our live page updates to a close soon so here's a recap of the main coronavirus news from the UK and beyond. Lockdown is being extended for another week in Delhi. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal asked people not to queue up for injections as the city had not yet received fresh vaccine stocks. ""As soon as vaccines arrive we will let you know, then you can come for shots. We appeal to you not to crowd vaccine centres in the next few days,"" Kejriwal said. About 150 million shots have been given so far in India, equivalent to 11.5% of its 1.3 billion strong population. But despite being the world's biggest producer of vaccines, the country is suffering an internal shortage and has placeda temporary hold on all exports of AstraZenecato meet domestic demand. More than 13 million people aged 18-45 have registered for the jab, but states including central Madhya Pradesh and hard-hit Maharashtra have said they will not start vaccinating this age group on 1 May as planned due to supply problems. We've got more on the Covid situation in Indiahere. Surge testing is to be carried out in Tower Hamlets, east London after a small number of the coronavirus variants first detected in Brazil and South Africa were identified there. These strains,externalof Covid-19 may be more contagious and dodge immunity to some extent. All the confirmed cases are self-isolating and there are no links between these cases and the cluster of cases recently
identified in the South London area. The variants have been identified in the area around E1 4 and E1 3 and some of E1 0, E1 1, E1 2, E1 5, E14 7, E2 0, E2 6, E3 4. Everyone over the age of 11 in these areas is being advised to take a PCR test, even if they donât have symptoms. You can find out more about the variants of concernhere. International travel is expected to be allowed again from 17 May at the earliest Monday 17 May marks the next stage of the government's lifting of lockdown restrictions across England. So what is expected to change in mid-May?  How and when restrictions change will ultimately depend on key data improving - and the easing differs between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.You can find out all you need to know about the relaxation of rules here. Restaurateur Hugh Osmond has called for a faster reopening of hospitality than 17 May - the date which marks the next stage for relaxing restrictions in England. Changes in the road map on 17 May are expected to include allowing pubs, cafes and restaurants to serve customers indoors - they can currently only serve outdoors. Osmond, the founder of Punch Taverns, said ""hard data"" suggested restrictions could be eased more quickly, since infections, hospital admissions and deaths were falling faster than previously predicted. He said the current data was ""significantly ahead of the assumptions in the model"" used to draw up the road map out of lockdown. There was now ""zero chance of the NHS being overwhelmed"", he added. Osmond, who brought a legal case against the government challenging Covid restrictions on hospitality, highlighted a recent study from Sage which had concluded that eating out had not led to an increased risk of becoming ill with coronavirus. Meanwhile, every day of closure was costing the industry Â£200m, he said, and ""every day places are closed and more go bust"". It comes asgovernment scientific adviser Prof Sir Mark Walport cautioned that many people were still not vaccinated,adding the public needed to be ""patient for a short period"" while lockdown was gradually eased. He told the BBC there was still a ""potential for that spark to reignite"" and cause infections to rise. A total of 49,287,257 coronavirus vaccinations have been given in the UK,according to today's government data.,external That's 34,346,273 first doses and 14,940,984 second doses. You can find out when you'll get your jabhere. A further seven people have died with coronavirus in the UK,according to the government's daily figures.,external This brings the total number of people to die within 28 days of a positive test to 127,524. There were also another 1,907 new infections reported in the last 24 hours. As we've been reporting, India has become the first country to report more than 400,000 new coronavirus cases in a single day, as its nationwide vaccine drive launches amid a supply crisis. There are also acute shortages of oxygen and hospital beds. Members of the diaspora - with family and friends in India - have responded by raising funds, sending life-saving equipment and offering their own expertise. Mehez Warsi is an Indian-born physiotherapist who has lived in the UK for the past seven years but is now back in Mumbai. She told the BBC's Newshour she had lost ""at least 36 people in the last two weeks"" including her father and her aunt. This video can not be played Devina GuptaBBC News India continues to struggle. In the past 48 hours the situation has worsened. Twelve people died when a private hospital in Delhi  ran out of Oxygen. Some hospitals are now turning away critically ill patients. To fight the pandemic, India's prime minister Narendra Modi has lowered the age limit for vaccination from 45 to 18. This will make an estimated 600 million more people eligible for the jab starting today. But only six states will be rolling out this initiative, others have put it on hold, saying their vaccine reserves have dried up. So far, the central government has denied there are vaccine shortages in the country. India is one of the world's largest vaccine manufacturers and produces nearly 80 million doses every month, but experts say this needs to be ramped up fast. The government has so far opposed a national lockdown. With an aim to give doses to nearly every adult around the world, this is the largest vaccination programme in history. More than one billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in 179 countries worldwide. China and the US have administered the highest number of doses, 255 million and 237 million respectively. India ranks third, with nearly 150 million. But while nearly all of Europe and the Americas have begun vaccination campaigns,a few countries in Africa are still to get started. Our Visual and Data Journalism team has been looking at the stats -read on to find out which vaccines are going where, and why.  We told you earlier about changes to care home regulations, which mean residents will be allowed to leave their home to see loved ones without having to quarantine for 14 days on their return. So what are the key changes taking place next week? From Tuesday, the government has said residents can take day trips, such as walks or visits to parks or gardens, providing they remain outside. Residents must be accompanied by either a member of staff or one of their two nominated visitors, and they must follow social distancing throughout. They cannot meet in groups or go indoors, except for the use of toilets, and public transport should be avoided where possible. An exemption is in place for those who wish to vote in person in the local elections on 6 May, the government says. Only trips deemed ""low risk"" are exempt from the self-isolation rule, so this does not include activities such as overnight visits. The Department of Health and Social Care said updated guidance would be published in due course. There remain different rules in the UK's devolved nations, with residents inWales,externalable to leave homes - where there is no Covid outbreak - without isolating on their return. Scotland'sguidance for care homes,externalallows for residents to see loved ones outside of the care home, while rules for care homes in Northern Irelandvary by region,external.   Michael BristowBBC World Service Asia Pacific editor Hong Kong officials have been accused of discrimination after ordering all foreign domestic workers to have coronavirus tests. Nearly 400,000 domestic employees - mostly women from the Philippines and Indonesia - will have to be tested.
They have one week to comply. The order came after two foreign workers were infected - but the order doesn't extend to the families they work for, or local people working in similar environments. In future, overseas domestic helpers employed in Hong Kong will also have to be vaccinated against the virus. Rights groups say this low-paid group is being unfairly targeted.
But officials said they're simply protecting the public. Meanwhile, several people have died at a hospital in Delhi today when critically ill patients were left without oxygen for about 80 minutes before re-supply tankers arrived, according to local media reports. And a fire in a Covid-19 hospital ward in the western city of Bharuch killed 18 people - the latest in a number of deadly hospital fires across the country this week. Vijay Gupta, 62, was gasping for air outside a hospital in the south-east of India's capital because all of its beds were full. ""We have been roaming around since 06:00 looking for a bed,"" a friend told Reuters news agency. ""Where shall we go?"" In Srinagar, the main city of Indian-administered Kashmir, one man said he had been waiting for vaccines to become available at a health centre, only to be told to come back another time. He said two relatives were with him who had health conditions. ""I'm very worried about them but we're still waiting,"" he told the BBC. We've got more on the Covid situation in Indiahere. Aamir PeerzadBBC News, Srinagar This video can not be played India Covid vaccination: 'Everybody should get jabs as cases are rising' According to the federal government's new vaccination policy, the state governments and the hospitals can purchase the vaccines directly from the manufacturers. But while India is the largest vaccine manufacturer, it seems there are not enough vaccines available. Many states have announced that they can't begin the vaccination drive as the manufacturers have not been able to keep up with demand. That has led to widespread disappointment. Experts say at the current rate, it may take India years to vaccinate its entire population. But can India's estimated 800 million eligible citizens, and indeed the world, afford to wait for so long? Border restrictions have been eased on the Isle of Man to allow non-resident family members to visit from today. The island's border has beenclosed to almost all non-residentssince the start of the pandemic, keeping some families apart for more than a year. Anyone who visits must isolate for seven days and pay Â£60 for two Covid-19 tests. Following a second negative test, people can leave isolation but will face further restrictions for the next three days, including a ban on using public transport or visiting pubs, restaurants and theatres. Anyone visiting from further afield must isolate for 14 days. Chief Minister Howard Quayle says the relaxation is possible because of the island's progress with its vaccination programme and the fall in infection rates in the UK. More than three quarters of adults living on the island have had at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine and there are only 10 active coronavirus cases. We've got more on this storyhere. Earlier we told you about criticism over the goverment's failure to reveal more details about the traffic light system that it has proposed to help regulate international travel after 17 May. Tory MP Huw Merriman, who chairs the Commons' Transport Select Committee, accused ministers of missing today's deadline to grade overseas destinations. But a spokeswoman for the Department for Transport insists the government ""has not missed a deadline"". ""We have always said we will confirm by early May if international travel can resume on 17 May and which countries will fall into which list. ""This will determine the requirements for travel for passengers."" She says the government's Global Travel Taskforce is working towards restarting international in a ""safe and sustainable way"". Mr Merriman earlier bemoaned the lack of information, which meant travellers and the travel industry were ""still in the dark"". ""Uncertainty has been prolonged. This uncertainty could cost people their jobs,"" he said. ""How can it be right that countries with slower vaccination roll-outs are safely reopening to international travellers while the UK stays static?"" As we've mentioned, social distancing is being eased at the Snooker World Championship to allow the final to be played in front of a capacity crowd at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield. The return of fans is being staggered throughout the event from 33% capacity for the first round to 100% for the final games on Sunday and Monday. World Snooker says face coverings are required but social distancing ""will not be expected"". The tournament ispart of the government's pilot schemeto ensure fans can safely return to sporting and cultural venues. Fans have to take a Covid-19 test before arriving and another five days afterwards. Revellers at the Circus Nightclub at Bramley-Moore Dock, Liverpool DJ Marea Stamper has described the ""incredible energy"" at a pilot event in a warehouse on Liverpool's waterfront which saw some 3,000 clubbers gathered together without masks or social distancing on Friday. The event was part of the government's test programme to evaluate how to hold mass gatherings safely as the country unlocks. ""Of course the whole thing sort of operated silently as a science experiment - they were studying ventilation and crowd patterns - but every precaution was taken to make sure we were safe,"" said the DJ, whose professional name is The Blessed Madonna. She told the BBC that those attending were ""incredibly emotional"". ""I think we felt excited but also proud to be a part of creating the protocols that would lead to the reopening of all kinds of things."" Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden has described the event as ""another huge moment in our journey back to normality"". The MP said he had attended the Snooker World Championship at Sheffield's Crucible Theatre on Friday - where initial social distancing requirements are being ""gradually eased"" to allow 100% capacity at the finals on Sunday and Monday. ""I have seen first hand just how important these research events are,"" said Mr Dowden. But he cautioned: ""We are making good progress but we have been clear that decisions on reopening will be led by the data.  A woman has shared how she paid for a private coronavirus vaccine in Pakistan as cases there hit a record high. Mahwish Bhatti is one of only 2% to have received a jab in the country. She paid 12,000 rupees ($78; Â£56) to a private lab - a price out of reach to many Pakistanis. Already Pakistan has seen active cases go from as low as 16,000 in the first week of March, to more than 140,000 new cases in April alone, as well as over 3,000 deaths - making it the worst month there since the pandemic began. Prime Minister Imran Khan has warned that Pakistan - with less than one doctor per 963 people - could be headed for disaster. For Bhatti, choosing a private laboratory to be vaccinated against the coronavirus was a last resort. ""I was desperate. I panicked,"" the 35-year-old from Lahore, Pakistan, told the BBC over the phone. ""My mother was still waiting for her second dose of the vaccine, so I thought my turn would never come. I thought to myself, I will just buy whatever vaccine is available."" Bhatti, who lost her job recently, used some of her savings to get the Russian-made Sputnik V jab. She says: ""I did get one jab of vaccines, but also one jab to my wallet."" We've got more on this storyhere. Â© 2025 BBC.

"More isolated homes have become popular Evidence of urban flight - with workers moving out of cities to towns and villages - is among the reasons for house price rises in rural areas, a think tank has said. Property values in less densely-populated areas have risen almost twice as fast as in urban hubs, the Resolution Foundation has said. The pandemic has prompted a search for space, both inside and outside homes. But the think tank said many people were still living in overcrowded homes. Various surveys have shown increases in demand for properties in areas such as Cornwall, and rises in prices as a result. High demand from buyers has led to accelerating price growth in general across the UK. How Covid has changed where we want to live UK housing market 'on the boil' as prices rise The Resolution Foundation said that since February 2020, prices had gone up by more than 10% in the least densely populated 10th of local authorities in the UK, compared to rises of 6% for the most populous deciles. Its housing outlook report also suggested smaller, more limited properties - such as flats - had become less attractive to buyers when compared to more spacious homes. Temporarystamp duty holidayshad boosted the purchasing power of movers rather than first-time buyers, allowing them to look to buy larger properties. But the think-tank, which focusses on people on lower incomes, said it was too early to tell whether these trends seen during the pandemic would continue in the long-term. It warned that there were one-in-five children in low-income households who spent the first lockdown in an overcrowded home, and people of all age groups were more likely to live in overcrowded conditions now than they were 20 years ago. Cara Pacitti, economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: ""For many families, escaping to the country is no more than a pipe dream, and the overcrowding that they have faced during the pandemic must be addressed."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak has told MPs that the government's intervention in the housing market during the pandemic supported the wider UK economy. He said the extension to the stamp duty holiday announced in the Budget was ""to smooth the transition back to normal"".

"Last March as lockdown was announced across the UK people were told to stay at home apart from for essential reasons Urgent changes are needed to get people out of cars and back on trains after Covid travel restrictions are eased, campaigners have warned. Passenger numbers plummeted by about 95% as ""non-essential"" travel was banned at the height of the pandemic. Now there are fears people will switch back to cars unless action is taken to make rail more affordable, attractive and address safety fears. Transport for Wales (TfW) said trains were safe and changes were being made. Over the past 20 years, the number of people using trains to travel into, out of and across Wales increased by about 80%, with about 31.1 million journeys in 2019, compared to about 16.6 million in 1999-2020. Commuters have complained of packed carriages, delays and cancellations, while queues were seen outside stations as thousands used trains to get into Cardiff on match and concert days. Traffic on Welsh roads 60% higher than first lockdown Homeworking could ease M4 traffic, says minister In December, during the national ""stay at home"" lockdown, passenger numbers on services run by TfW dropped to 5-10% of pre-Covid levels and the hit to ticket income led toTfW being nationalised in February, in a bid to keep services running. In April, after travel bans were lifted,allowing people to travel anywhere in England and Wales, TfW reported a rise in passengers to 20-30% of pre-pandemic levels, with footfall in stations up to 39% by 12 April. It said had done all it could to keep services going during ""challenging times"", and the rail service was ""adapting"" to changes in demand and lifestyle due to Covid-19. Alexia Course, director of rail operations, said as many moved away from office based 9-5 working, it aimed to make rail a ""more attractive option"" for day-trips and holidays, and working on new fares and ticketing options. This video can not be played Pre-pandemic, many commuters had complained about ""packed"" trains But transport experts and green campaigners have warned safety messaging about avoiding public transport could have a ""lasting impact"" and it could take years for passengers to get back on board. Â£62m needed to keep Transport for Wales afloat Has the pandemic changed our behaviour for ever? With some of Wales major employersnow considering allowing employees to work from home full-time, campaigners fear the rail network will be unsustainable, unless it adapts to people's lifestyle changes, with a knock-on effect for the environment if more of us choose cars over public transport as restrictions are eased. Peter Kingsbury, of Rail Future Wales, warned getting people back on the trains and out of cars was essential for the ""wider good of society"". ""Future generations will potentially have a much lower quality of life if we are not able to change our habits over the next decade or two,"" he said. Cardiff saw one of the highest increases in south Wales in traffic on roads during lockdown The Welsh government wants 45% of journeys to be made by public transport, walking or cycling by 2040 and all political parties have made promises for more sustainable transport in the run-up to the election. Who should I vote for? Compare party's transport policies How our daily travel harms the planet However, Christine Boston, director of sustainable travel charity Sustrans Cymru, said the rail service must adapt quickly or there was a ""real danger"" people who previously used trains could switch back to cars. Figures obtained by BBC Walesshow traffic on Welsh roads increased by 62% in the last stay-at-home lockdown, compared with the first lockdown in March 2020, while public transport levels remained comparably low. With a surge in cycling in lockdown, the charity wants to see cycle routes and train stations joined up, with more space for bikes on trains, in a bid to help people ""travel green"". ""The fall in passenger numbers risks pushing the cost of travel far beyond the means of many,"" Ms Boston said. ""Car use has crept back up to pre-pandemic levels, with a real risk of a car-led recovery, which would be devastating for us all."" This video can not be played A cycling group says lockdown is ""a once in a lifetime opportunity"" Norman Baker, of Campaign for Better Transport, said the rise in traffic showed there was an ""urgent need"" for incentives to get people out of their cars. ""If you don't get people back on trains and buses there will be gridlock on the roads,"" he warned. Ms Course said people needed to be reminded of the benefits of travelling by rail, such as enjoying ""looking out of the window"", reading a book, getting work done and having a cup of coffee while travelling. ""There's a lot you can't get when you're sat behind the wheel of a car and driving to wherever you need to get to,"" she said. She said new trains were being built and TfW was looking at how to create more space for bikes. Working from home has become the norm for many over the past year Before the pandemic, many used rail services to commute to work, at times leading to issues with overcrowding on Valleys lines into Cardiff, and other major hubs, at peak times. Now, with some companies introducing more flexible ways of working, and some announcing home working will continue way into the future, campaigners say rail services must adapt to a very ""different working world"". Mr Baker said the days of 9-5 commuting patterns were over and the rail timetable and tickets needed to ""reflect a new reality"" where more people would travel for leisure. He said dates for engineering works needed to change, making sure timetables were not limited on a Sunday, when many people would be taking trips. ""Sunday is no longer a day where we can shut the service down, Sunday is a busy day, engineering works should take place on a different time, on a different day,"" he said. Some fares on a number of TfW servicesincreased by 2.6% from March, bringing it in line with a similar increaseannounced in England in December. An off-peak return trip from Cardiff Central to London Paddington, on a Monday, costs Â£113.70, while at peak commuting times, it would cost more than Â£200, according to one ticketing website. Mr Kingsbury said there was an urgent need for fare reform to reflect many people would not be commuting five days a week. He said traditional season tickets - aimed at people who commute at peak times to offices - needed to be replaced with flexible options and was ""urgent to bring people back over the next six months"". Ms Course said TfW already had more flexible ticketing, for people to save while working from different locations, but was ""looking at other ways we can encourage different types of ticketing"" and the UK rail industry to create a new flexible ticket. Train operators hope people will get on board to travel around the UK for their summer staycations With no timeframe for when people can start jetting off on holidays abroad again, many are predicting a staycation boom this year. Campaigners said it was vital rail services capitalised on increased tourism and encouraged people to use rail to travel for trips this summer. Mr Kingsbury said the current rail network was ""not financially sustainable"" and a scheme similar toEat Out to Help Outcould be introduced, with discount fares or even a free journey to get back on board. Ms Course said TfW was working to promote rail as a more attractive way of travelling across Wales for trips and was working with businesses to ""try and tap into customer bases that maybe haven't looked at the railway in the same light previously"". Passengers had complained of packed platforms and carriages on some services pre-pandemic However, there are also fears that people using trains for trips and holidays could lead to overcrowding. Jeff Smith, of the Shrewsbury to Aberystwyth Rail Passenger Group (SARPA) and a Plaid Cymru town councillor, said he feared the Cambrian line would struggle to cope. Some servicescontinued to see overcrowding, as people ignored travel rules to head to beacheslast summer. ""You are looking at a situation like in the 1970s where you're going to have everyone going to resorts in the UK, so we will have people from Birmingham going to Aberystwyth,"" said Mr Smith. Mr Smith said a lack of carriages on the line would mean little space for passengers to stay apart, if passenger numbers increased in the summer. ""If you have an overcrowded train then the social distancing goes out of the window,"" he said. Ms Course said new trains were currently being built which would help increase capacity and customer experience, and allow for more frequent services, including on the Cambrian line. She said dealing with overcrowding would be ""challenging"", but with fewer people commuting, things did not need to ""go back to how things were"", while extra support would be put on when major events resumed. This video can not be played Face masks have been mandatory on public transport since the end of July With few people using trains during repeated lockdowns, maintaining social-distancing was fairly easy, and people have been turned away for not wearing masks. However, campaigners said after months being told not to use public transport and to stay at home, there was a public misperception trains were ""unsafe"". Scientists have said the risk of transmissiondepends on how crowded a train is, and how far away you can stay away from people,external. British Transport Police patrolled railway stations to help maintain Covid rules last year So far this year, 9,348 people have been challenged by British Transport Police and rail staff for not wearing face masks - which are mandatory on trains - with 1,039 people refused travel. Ms Course said there was no evidence trains were unsafe, with enhanced cleaning and security measures in place, and urged people to use a capacity checker before travelling. She added that keeping people apart as demand increased would be ""challenging"", but social distancing was a priority and safety measures would continue. Mick Lynch, of the RMT trade union, told a recent Senedd committee inquiry there would come a point where social distancing could no longer be maintained on the network: ""You will get to your ceiling of 2m social distancing, and any answer to that is to restrict travel or to change the social distancing.""

"Boomtown Fair was postponed until next year because it could not get Covid cancellation insurance Most of the music festivals still due to take place this year could be scrapped without the safety net of government-backed cancellation insurance, organisers have warned. A quarter of UK festivals have already been called off, but 76% of the rest are at risk, according to the industry. The Association of Independent Festivals (AIF) has called for ""urgent intervention"" to save the season. The government said it was exploring what further support it could provide. The AIF said events had been scrapped because of ""government inaction on insurance"". It has been calling on the government to back cancellation insurance. That would allow organisers to go ahead with their plans without suffering financial losses if they were forced to cancel their events due to a new spike in Covid cases. Paul Reed said insurance is a ""Don't pass go"" issue for festival organisers ""For months now, we have been warning government that the UK's 2021 festival season would be quickly eroded if they failed to back their own roadmap out of lockdown and act on Covid related cancellation insurance,"" said Association of Independent Festivals (AIF) chief executive Paul Reed. ""It's now red alert for the UK's festival season. By the end of this month, 76% of the remaining festivals planned for 2021 could very quickly disappear from the calendar. ""Without a safety net, independent promoters cannot begin to confidently invest in their events. ""If government-backed insurance is off the table, festival organisers deserve to know what [the] government is proposing as an alternative to prevent the widespread collapse of the festival season."" The ""long-term survival of many of the businesses behind these events"", was also at stake, he added.

The government isrunning a live music test event at Sefton Park in Liverpool on Sundayto see how festivals can be reopened aspart of a programme of events in the city. However, people should be aware that there is a risk in booking festival tickets for the summer, vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi told the BBC on Thursday. ""People have to be careful,"" he said. ""If you are now booking [festival tickets], then you do carry some risk clearly, because we have to follow the [infection] data. ""The good news is the vaccinations are working. About 70% of the adult population of England now have antibodies... but we have to remain cautious."" Insurance really is a ""Don't pass go"" issue for many festival organizers, Mr Reed said. He added that festivals contribute Â£1.76bn to the UK economy and support 85,000 jobs. The Association of British Insurers said: ""We understand that this has been a difficult and uncertain time for the events industry. ""With the Covid-19 public health emergency continuing to present a significant risk of cancellation or disruption, commercial insurers remain unable to offer this type of cover, or only at a cost that is unaffordable for many."" Of UK festivals with a capacity of more than 5,000, 26% have already been abandoned, including Boomtown Fair and Deer Shed. That leaves 131 still due to go ahead, mostly in July and August. It is uncertain whether the Nozstock festival will go ahead this year ""Most of the festivals that are holding their position in July and August will need to commit to substantial, non-refundable costs by the end of May,"" said AIF. ""And 72% of AIF members have said that if they do not take place in 2021, they will require financial support to return in 2022."" Some festival organisers have already delayed their events. According to the AIF 22% of festivals it tracks are now taking place in September and October, up from 10% earlier in the year. Boomtown director of communications and strategy Anna Wade said Boomtown decided to postpone the event until next year as it could not get Covid cover. ""It basically means you're proceeding without the safety net of insurance, which no company or even individual would want to do, because the risks are just so high, with so many unknowns,"" she said. Ella Nosworthy, creative director at the Nozstock festival, said they would wait until the results of the government pilot in Liverpool to see whether they could get insurance so their festival could go ahead in July. Helen Kenny, a freelance stage and production manager, said that typically she would work on 25 to 30 festivals per year over a six-month period in the UK and Europe, including Boomtown. So far this summer she has only been booked for six, and she is unsure whether any of those will cancel. ""I wake up every day at the moment with a smile on my face, attending meetings, and finally back to doing what I love,"" she said. ""However, I'm totally aware that we are still in a pandemic and anything declared or planned could change at any time.""

"India has expanded its coronavirus vaccination drive as it grapples with huge numbers of Covid cases All people aged over 18 are now eligible for a first jab, but the drive's being hampered by a supply shortage The nation has become the first country to report more than 400,000 new coronavirus cases in a single day Some 3,523 deaths were officially recorded in the past 24 hours - but the real figure is thought to be far higher as many fatalities go unreported In England, care home residents will be able to make low-risk trips without having to self-isolate for two weeks on their return, from Tuesday A campaign is launched to raise money to build a memorial in St Paul's Cathedral to those who've died as a result of the pandemic South Asian communities in England were more at risk of infection, severe illness and death during the second wave of the pandemic, compared with other ethnic groups, a study says Surge testing is launched in the Tower Hamlets area of London after the discovery of several cases of the Brazilian and South African variants Edited by Holly Wallis That's all from the live page team. You updates were brought to you by Chris Clayton, Holly Wallis, Jennifer Meierhans and Victoria Lindrea. We will be back with more coronavirus news tomorrow, have a good evening. We're going to be drawing our live page updates to a close soon so here's a recap of the main coronavirus news from the UK and beyond. Lockdown is being extended for another week in Delhi. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal asked people not to queue up for injections as the city had not yet received fresh vaccine stocks. ""As soon as vaccines arrive we will let you know, then you can come for shots. We appeal to you not to crowd vaccine centres in the next few days,"" Kejriwal said. About 150 million shots have been given so far in India, equivalent to 11.5% of its 1.3 billion strong population. But despite being the world's biggest producer of vaccines, the country is suffering an internal shortage and has placeda temporary hold on all exports of AstraZenecato meet domestic demand. More than 13 million people aged 18-45 have registered for the jab, but states including central Madhya Pradesh and hard-hit Maharashtra have said they will not start vaccinating this age group on 1 May as planned due to supply problems. We've got more on the Covid situation in Indiahere. Surge testing is to be carried out in Tower Hamlets, east London after a small number of the coronavirus variants first detected in Brazil and South Africa were identified there. These strains,externalof Covid-19 may be more contagious and dodge immunity to some extent. All the confirmed cases are self-isolating and there are no links between these cases and the cluster of cases recently
identified in the South London area. The variants have been identified in the area around E1 4 and E1 3 and some of E1 0, E1 1, E1 2, E1 5, E14 7, E2 0, E2 6, E3 4. Everyone over the age of 11 in these areas is being advised to take a PCR test, even if they donât have symptoms. You can find out more about the variants of concernhere. International travel is expected to be allowed again from 17 May at the earliest Monday 17 May marks the next stage of the government's lifting of lockdown restrictions across England. So what is expected to change in mid-May?  How and when restrictions change will ultimately depend on key data improving - and the easing differs between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.You can find out all you need to know about the relaxation of rules here. Restaurateur Hugh Osmond has called for a faster reopening of hospitality than 17 May - the date which marks the next stage for relaxing restrictions in England. Changes in the road map on 17 May are expected to include allowing pubs, cafes and restaurants to serve customers indoors - they can currently only serve outdoors. Osmond, the founder of Punch Taverns, said ""hard data"" suggested restrictions could be eased more quickly, since infections, hospital admissions and deaths were falling faster than previously predicted. He said the current data was ""significantly ahead of the assumptions in the model"" used to draw up the road map out of lockdown. There was now ""zero chance of the NHS being overwhelmed"", he added. Osmond, who brought a legal case against the government challenging Covid restrictions on hospitality, highlighted a recent study from Sage which had concluded that eating out had not led to an increased risk of becoming ill with coronavirus. Meanwhile, every day of closure was costing the industry Â£200m, he said, and ""every day places are closed and more go bust"". It comes asgovernment scientific adviser Prof Sir Mark Walport cautioned that many people were still not vaccinated,adding the public needed to be ""patient for a short period"" while lockdown was gradually eased. He told the BBC there was still a ""potential for that spark to reignite"" and cause infections to rise. A total of 49,287,257 coronavirus vaccinations have been given in the UK,according to today's government data.,external That's 34,346,273 first doses and 14,940,984 second doses. You can find out when you'll get your jabhere. A further seven people have died with coronavirus in the UK,according to the government's daily figures.,external This brings the total number of people to die within 28 days of a positive test to 127,524. There were also another 1,907 new infections reported in the last 24 hours. As we've been reporting, India has become the first country to report more than 400,000 new coronavirus cases in a single day, as its nationwide vaccine drive launches amid a supply crisis. There are also acute shortages of oxygen and hospital beds. Members of the diaspora - with family and friends in India - have responded by raising funds, sending life-saving equipment and offering their own expertise. Mehez Warsi is an Indian-born physiotherapist who has lived in the UK for the past seven years but is now back in Mumbai. She told the BBC's Newshour she had lost ""at least 36 people in the last two weeks"" including her father and her aunt. This video can not be played Devina GuptaBBC News India continues to struggle. In the past 48 hours the situation has worsened. Twelve people died when a private hospital in Delhi  ran out of Oxygen. Some hospitals are now turning away critically ill patients. To fight the pandemic, India's prime minister Narendra Modi has lowered the age limit for vaccination from 45 to 18. This will make an estimated 600 million more people eligible for the jab starting today. But only six states will be rolling out this initiative, others have put it on hold, saying their vaccine reserves have dried up. So far, the central government has denied there are vaccine shortages in the country. India is one of the world's largest vaccine manufacturers and produces nearly 80 million doses every month, but experts say this needs to be ramped up fast. The government has so far opposed a national lockdown. With an aim to give doses to nearly every adult around the world, this is the largest vaccination programme in history. More than one billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in 179 countries worldwide. China and the US have administered the highest number of doses, 255 million and 237 million respectively. India ranks third, with nearly 150 million. But while nearly all of Europe and the Americas have begun vaccination campaigns,a few countries in Africa are still to get started. Our Visual and Data Journalism team has been looking at the stats -read on to find out which vaccines are going where, and why.  We told you earlier about changes to care home regulations, which mean residents will be allowed to leave their home to see loved ones without having to quarantine for 14 days on their return. So what are the key changes taking place next week? From Tuesday, the government has said residents can take day trips, such as walks or visits to parks or gardens, providing they remain outside. Residents must be accompanied by either a member of staff or one of their two nominated visitors, and they must follow social distancing throughout. They cannot meet in groups or go indoors, except for the use of toilets, and public transport should be avoided where possible. An exemption is in place for those who wish to vote in person in the local elections on 6 May, the government says. Only trips deemed ""low risk"" are exempt from the self-isolation rule, so this does not include activities such as overnight visits. The Department of Health and Social Care said updated guidance would be published in due course. There remain different rules in the UK's devolved nations, with residents inWales,externalable to leave homes - where there is no Covid outbreak - without isolating on their return. Scotland'sguidance for care homes,externalallows for residents to see loved ones outside of the care home, while rules for care homes in Northern Irelandvary by region,external.   Michael BristowBBC World Service Asia Pacific editor Hong Kong officials have been accused of discrimination after ordering all foreign domestic workers to have coronavirus tests. Nearly 400,000 domestic employees - mostly women from the Philippines and Indonesia - will have to be tested.
They have one week to comply. The order came after two foreign workers were infected - but the order doesn't extend to the families they work for, or local people working in similar environments. In future, overseas domestic helpers employed in Hong Kong will also have to be vaccinated against the virus. Rights groups say this low-paid group is being unfairly targeted.
But officials said they're simply protecting the public. Meanwhile, several people have died at a hospital in Delhi today when critically ill patients were left without oxygen for about 80 minutes before re-supply tankers arrived, according to local media reports. And a fire in a Covid-19 hospital ward in the western city of Bharuch killed 18 people - the latest in a number of deadly hospital fires across the country this week. Vijay Gupta, 62, was gasping for air outside a hospital in the south-east of India's capital because all of its beds were full. ""We have been roaming around since 06:00 looking for a bed,"" a friend told Reuters news agency. ""Where shall we go?"" In Srinagar, the main city of Indian-administered Kashmir, one man said he had been waiting for vaccines to become available at a health centre, only to be told to come back another time. He said two relatives were with him who had health conditions. ""I'm very worried about them but we're still waiting,"" he told the BBC. We've got more on the Covid situation in Indiahere. Aamir PeerzadBBC News, Srinagar This video can not be played India Covid vaccination: 'Everybody should get jabs as cases are rising' According to the federal government's new vaccination policy, the state governments and the hospitals can purchase the vaccines directly from the manufacturers. But while India is the largest vaccine manufacturer, it seems there are not enough vaccines available. Many states have announced that they can't begin the vaccination drive as the manufacturers have not been able to keep up with demand. That has led to widespread disappointment. Experts say at the current rate, it may take India years to vaccinate its entire population. But can India's estimated 800 million eligible citizens, and indeed the world, afford to wait for so long? Border restrictions have been eased on the Isle of Man to allow non-resident family members to visit from today. The island's border has beenclosed to almost all non-residentssince the start of the pandemic, keeping some families apart for more than a year. Anyone who visits must isolate for seven days and pay Â£60 for two Covid-19 tests. Following a second negative test, people can leave isolation but will face further restrictions for the next three days, including a ban on using public transport or visiting pubs, restaurants and theatres. Anyone visiting from further afield must isolate for 14 days. Chief Minister Howard Quayle says the relaxation is possible because of the island's progress with its vaccination programme and the fall in infection rates in the UK. More than three quarters of adults living on the island have had at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine and there are only 10 active coronavirus cases. We've got more on this storyhere. Earlier we told you about criticism over the goverment's failure to reveal more details about the traffic light system that it has proposed to help regulate international travel after 17 May. Tory MP Huw Merriman, who chairs the Commons' Transport Select Committee, accused ministers of missing today's deadline to grade overseas destinations. But a spokeswoman for the Department for Transport insists the government ""has not missed a deadline"". ""We have always said we will confirm by early May if international travel can resume on 17 May and which countries will fall into which list. ""This will determine the requirements for travel for passengers."" She says the government's Global Travel Taskforce is working towards restarting international in a ""safe and sustainable way"". Mr Merriman earlier bemoaned the lack of information, which meant travellers and the travel industry were ""still in the dark"". ""Uncertainty has been prolonged. This uncertainty could cost people their jobs,"" he said. ""How can it be right that countries with slower vaccination roll-outs are safely reopening to international travellers while the UK stays static?"" As we've mentioned, social distancing is being eased at the Snooker World Championship to allow the final to be played in front of a capacity crowd at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield. The return of fans is being staggered throughout the event from 33% capacity for the first round to 100% for the final games on Sunday and Monday. World Snooker says face coverings are required but social distancing ""will not be expected"". The tournament ispart of the government's pilot schemeto ensure fans can safely return to sporting and cultural venues. Fans have to take a Covid-19 test before arriving and another five days afterwards. Revellers at the Circus Nightclub at Bramley-Moore Dock, Liverpool DJ Marea Stamper has described the ""incredible energy"" at a pilot event in a warehouse on Liverpool's waterfront which saw some 3,000 clubbers gathered together without masks or social distancing on Friday. The event was part of the government's test programme to evaluate how to hold mass gatherings safely as the country unlocks. ""Of course the whole thing sort of operated silently as a science experiment - they were studying ventilation and crowd patterns - but every precaution was taken to make sure we were safe,"" said the DJ, whose professional name is The Blessed Madonna. She told the BBC that those attending were ""incredibly emotional"". ""I think we felt excited but also proud to be a part of creating the protocols that would lead to the reopening of all kinds of things."" Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden has described the event as ""another huge moment in our journey back to normality"". The MP said he had attended the Snooker World Championship at Sheffield's Crucible Theatre on Friday - where initial social distancing requirements are being ""gradually eased"" to allow 100% capacity at the finals on Sunday and Monday. ""I have seen first hand just how important these research events are,"" said Mr Dowden. But he cautioned: ""We are making good progress but we have been clear that decisions on reopening will be led by the data.  A woman has shared how she paid for a private coronavirus vaccine in Pakistan as cases there hit a record high. Mahwish Bhatti is one of only 2% to have received a jab in the country. She paid 12,000 rupees ($78; Â£56) to a private lab - a price out of reach to many Pakistanis. Already Pakistan has seen active cases go from as low as 16,000 in the first week of March, to more than 140,000 new cases in April alone, as well as over 3,000 deaths - making it the worst month there since the pandemic began. Prime Minister Imran Khan has warned that Pakistan - with less than one doctor per 963 people - could be headed for disaster. For Bhatti, choosing a private laboratory to be vaccinated against the coronavirus was a last resort. ""I was desperate. I panicked,"" the 35-year-old from Lahore, Pakistan, told the BBC over the phone. ""My mother was still waiting for her second dose of the vaccine, so I thought my turn would never come. I thought to myself, I will just buy whatever vaccine is available."" Bhatti, who lost her job recently, used some of her savings to get the Russian-made Sputnik V jab. She says: ""I did get one jab of vaccines, but also one jab to my wallet."" We've got more on this storyhere. Â© 2025 BBC.

Updates were brought to you by Mary O'Connor, Jennifer Meierhans, George Wright, Paul Kirby, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Holly Wallis and Claire Heald. Join us again tomorrow. Here's a recap of the UK's coronavirus news today:  We're drawing the live page to a close for the day soon. Here's a round-up of some of the biggest developments from around the world today:  A US state says it will offer young people a $100 (Â£72) savings bond if they receive a Covid-19 vaccine. West Virginia saysit hopes the payment for those aged 16 to 35 will ""motivate"" them to get the jab. ""Our kids today probably don't really realise just how important they are in shutting this thing down,"" State Governor Jim Justice said on Monday. West Virginia had been among the top US states for vaccination rates, but progress has slowed in recent weeks. There are particular concerns that younger people may be more hesitant about receiving a jab. The incentive means those who are vaccinated within the age group can retrieve the $100, plus interest, at a later date. It will also be offered to anyone aged 16 to 35 who has already been vaccinated. West Virginia has the 16th highest rate of new coronavirus cases per person among US states, according to the New York Times. Conversely,a Miami school has discouraged teachers from getting the Covid vaccine, saying any vaccinated employees will be barred from interacting with students. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst People wait to receive vaccines in Ruili over the weekend There is a lot of fanfare today in the Chinese city of
Ruili, where the authorities have lifted stay-at-home orders for people in
low-risk areas. Ruili, in southwestern Yunnan province, has been the site
of Chinaâs one domestic Covid-19 outbreak over the last month. There have been
more than 100 confirmed cases in the China-Myanmar border city since 30 March,
affecting both Chinese and Burmese nationals. The city implemented strict lockdowns in March, with a
number of city districts becoming âmediumâ or âhigh-riskâ. In these areas, people were
under strict orders to stay at home. All but essential businesses closed.
Students began having online classes, and transport links were suspended. Thousands of medical workers from outside of the city were
also sent to the front-line. However, today, media note that they have
âcompleted their missionâ, and footage is circulating showing local residents
dancing and waving to see them off. There were also fireworks set off yesterday evening
following the announcement that in areas that had recently returned to being
âlow-riskâ, home lockdowns were to be lifted. The Yunnan Health Commission says that 59 people are
currently being treated with symptoms,
including 13 who have arrived from overseas. Dr Jerryl Bennett from the Doctors Association of India has spoken to the BBC from Nagpur in Maharsahtra state. He says authorities are trying to step up supplies of oxygen, but it's been a losing battle: ""They are trying to provide us with oxygen, but the demand is so much that whatever amount of supply is there from the government it is not sufficient enough right now,"" he says. ""Patients are in a panic-stricken mode. The entire country is in panic-stricken mode."" He says medical staff are being pushed to the edge. ""We are physically exhausted. We are working over the capacity which a human can work. But it is also very traumatising emotionally and mentally that we are losing patients because of lack of oxygen or lack of beds. ""We are losing patients because they are coming in the hospitals at a very late stage where it is very difficult for us to give them the treatment for them to survive or for them to revive back from Covid,"" he says. ""It becomes very difficult for all the young generation doctors as well as the senior doctors. These patients could have been saved had we intervened a little earlier."" An Isle of Man ferry terminal in Liverpool will be at least Â£5m over budget and a year late due to the impact of coronavirus. Delays to the government-funded project caused by the pandemic are currently costing Â£8,000 per day, says infrastructure minister Tim Baker. The project was originally expected to cost Â£38m and be completed by December 2020, but that waspushed back to March and then July 2021. It will now be finished in March 2022. Baker told the Manx House of Keys: ""Progress is being made day by day, week by week, but it is being heavily impacted by the ongoing impact of coronavirus."" He says: ""I will do absolutely what I can to control the cost and to speed up delivery, but I cannot promise that we have yet met all the challenges that this scheme will bring."" The new facility is being built at the Princes Half Tide Dock about 670m from the existing terminal at Pier Head. BBC Radio 5 Live With a deadly second wave of Covid infections happening in India, BBC Radio 5 Live Drive has been hearing from people whose family and friends have been affected. Harsimrat Kaur lives in London with her husband Jagjit Singh and has relatives in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. Her aunt and cousin have both died of Covid-19 in the last couple of weeks. Harsimrat said: ""It hit home really hardâ¦ two people from the same family, theyâve got young kids as wellâ¦ I donât have any words, itâs just insane what is happening.â Harsimrat explained that her cousin managed to get a hospital bed ""after fighting for days with the doctors"" but still couldnât get oxygen or treatment there. Her aunt never got into hospital and had been ""struggling for oxygen"" too. Following the recent birth of their baby boy, both Harsimrat and her husband feel jumping on a plane to be with their family on compassionate grounds, would be âtoo much of a riskâ for their sonâs health. She added that her and her husband also âjust canât affordâ to travel to India and then spend two weeks in hotel quarantine. They have applied for a visa to allow some members of their family to come to the UK, when international travel opens up again. Listen back to the conversation on BBC Sounds. Leisure centres, outdoor attractions and hairdressers are open to customers across much of the UK, for the first time in months since coronavirus restrictions were imposed. But what are the rules in the UK's different nations? Here's our explainer of the rules below - which you can read it in fullhere. InEngland:  InWales:  InScotland:  InNorthern Ireland: Love of Lesbian played to a crowd of 5,000 Researchers in Spain have found ""no sign"" of higher levels of infection among people who took part in a large test concert last month. Six people tested positive within 14 days of attending the gig in Barcelona, but the incidence was lower than that seen in the general population. Around 5,000 music fans took part in the experiment after testing negative for Covid-19. Revellers wore masks but did not have to socially distance. Of the six people who tested positive, researchers concluded that four of them were infected elsewhere, not at the event itself. Spanish authorities let the show, featuring band Love of Lesbian, go ahead as part of a research project. The rate of infection among attendees was half the rate of people of the same age in Barcelona, researchers found. ""There is no sign that suggests transmission took place during the event,"" infectious disease specialist Josep Maria Llibre told a news conference on Tuesday. Read more here. More than 1.5 million Moroccans were arrested in the last nine months for not respecting Covid measures, a top official has said. This translates to a rate of more than 5,700 people arrested every day during that timeframe, Deputy Interior Minister Noureddine Boutayeb said, according to the 2M TV channel. ""Although this number seems large, it indicates a great involvement of all the authorities in charge of law enforcement,"" he told parliament. Failure to wear protective masks, respect curfews and travel bans were among the main offences, according to the Hespress website. Last year, Morocco rejected allegations of police abuse in taking measures to combat the spread of coronavirus in the country. This came after a top official at the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) included the country in a list of states where the authorities' response to the pandemic had raised concerns. Almost 9,000 people have been reported to have lost their lives to Covid-19 in the country of 36 million people. A customer picks up a token that can be exchanged for a beer at the Warpigs Brewpub in Copenhagen A bar in the Danish capital, Copenhagen, has come up with a novel way of tempting its customers back in. In return for 149 kroner (Â£17, $24), punters at Warpigs Brewpub are able to take a test and wait for the result with a free beer. After half an hour, if they test negative, they are allowed inside the bar. It works as part ofthe country's coronapas (corona passport) systemwhich allows Danes to show proof that they are infection-free. Although they can get hold of free government-provided tests, the bar's customers
say the paid-for versions let them avoid the queues at testing centres. Warpigs says it's trying this out in partnership with a medical company to see if there's appetite for the scheme. One customer seemed happy enough: ""It [the test] costs some money, but you get a free beer - paid beer I guess, but you get a beer. And it was worth it. It took two minutes, you did it yourself, it wasn't uncomfortable and I got 'negative', so it's a win-win in my opinion,"" Nicolai Marteens told Reuters news agency. Health authorities in Bangladesh have approved the Russian vaccine, Sputnik V, for emergency use amid uncertainty over deliveries from neighbouring India. The director-general of the Bangladeshi Drug Administration, Mahbubur Rahman, said the country was expecting the arrival of about four million doses from Russia next month. Rahman also indicated that Bangladesh could approve China's Sinopharm vaccine shortly. India has halted exports
of the AstraZeneca vaccinein response to a record surge in domestic infections. Assome MPs call for a review of fixed penalty noticesfor Covid lockdown breaches today, we've been hearing from people who were issued fines. One public sector worker told us he has been left in debt after being given a Â£1,000 fine for going to a friend's house for drinks. He and his wife, who was a nurse, met up with friends on the 11th day of self-isolation after a holiday abroad. At the time, the self-isolation period was 14 days. They'd both had Covid earlier in the year and thought the party posed minimal risk. ""It was wrong, I admit it and I came clean about it. But Â£1,000 is a ridiculous amount
of money. I'm still paying it off every month out of my wages, it's an impossible situation,"" the father-of-three explained. And in Manchester, Abe, 29, was fined after he went to a BBQ in January with four friends, and a neighbour called the police. He was issued two fines of Â£200 each, instead of one. After challenging the mistake, both fines were withdrawn, but his friends each paid their fines. ""Most people just pay the fine because theyâre
scared - the letters are alarming and say ""criminal records office"". It also concerned me that police were attending these calls when there are so many other serious issues,"" he said. There have been a further 17 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK, according to thegovernment's latest figures.,external That brings the number of deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test to 127,451. There were also a further 2,685 new infections recorded in the last 24 hours. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Over the last few days, Chinese media have been
dominated by reports on the catastrophic scenes in India. State media yesterday
noted that China had sent hundreds of oxygen concentrators, and was vowing to
send 10,000 more. The national Global Times newspaper said that the country
would âkeep in contact with India for urgent supportâ. Today, the Global Times has criticised the US for
not responding in the same way. It says that âUS aid to India is long overdueâ,
and says that âcountries with strong, anti-epidemic capabilities must shoulder
greater responsibilitiesâ. The Xinhua news agency says that only 1.4% of Indiaâs
population have been vaccinated, and that âthe US is hoarding Covid-19
vaccinesâ. It adds that this comes amid other developing nations denouncing US
âvaccine apartheidâ. Chinese media have been keen to highlight
internal divisions between ordinary Indians and the elite. They were critical
of Indiaâs super-rich chartering eight private jets to London ahead of being
included on the UK governmentâs red list,
and The Paper notes that some Bollywood stars have been trolled for taking
holiday photos in the Maldives as the situation continues to escalate. Meanwhile, papers have been speaking to Chinese
nationals who are based in India. One called Niko told Beijing News that she
has tested positive for Covid-19, âbut the hospital said on 13 April that
hospital beds were all occupiedâ¦ so Iâve had no choice but to take medicine at
homeâ. In a video shared by the Global Times, a student,
Ms Chen, says that âthere are no flights; I can only stay at home and protect
myselfâ. An NHS boss has praised the ""heroic efforts"" of all those involved in the vaccine roll out as the UK reaches one-in-four adults having had their second jab. But Ruth Rankine, primary care director at the NHS Confederation, has urged everyone to stick to lockdown rules, warning that the pandemic is not yet over. She says: ""Today we reach another milestone in the UK's vaccination campaign and this is yet more evidence of the heroic efforts of so many people across the NHS, including and especially primary care, to make sure as many people as possible are protected."" ""But at the same time, we need to continue to follow the rules, maintaining social distancing and wearing masks to make sure the progress we have made in recent weeks can continue. ""With growing numbers of cases in the UK of mutant strains of the virus, we must not fall into the trap of believing the crisis is over.""

Assistant head teacher Victoria Day has shared her top tips to help children with their communication. The Brazilian congress is launching an inquiry today into the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed almost 400,000 people. The commission could potentially lead to the impeachment of President Jair Bolsonaro. He's been widely criticised for his anti-lockdown, vaccine-sceptic stance. He has also told Brazilians to ""stop whining"" about the situation. Bolsonaro said he's ""not worried"" by the commission - but his chance of re-election next year could be at stake. On Monday, Brazil's health regulator rejected requests from several states to receive batches of the Russian vaccine, Sputnik V. The UK has fully vaccinated a quarter of its adult population against coronavirus and is on track to offer a first jab to all adults by the end of July, the government says. Public Health England data shows
vaccines are already having a significant impact in the UK in reducing
hospitalisations and deaths, and saved more than 10,000 lives between December
and March. Data from the ONS and Oxford University shows that
COVID-19 infections fell by 65% after the first dose of the
Oxford/AstraZeneca or Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines, and further after the second
dose. The latest vaccine effectiveness data from PHE
show that in those aged over 70, both the Pfizer/BioNTech and
Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines reduce the risk of getting symptomatic disease by
around 60% after a single dose. This protection lasts for several weeks. In
those aged over 80, protection against hospitalisation is around 80% and the
Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is 85% effective at stopping people aged over 80 dying

"India has expanded its coronavirus vaccination drive as it grapples with huge numbers of Covid cases All people aged over 18 are now eligible for a first jab, but the drive's being hampered by a supply shortage The nation has become the first country to report more than 400,000 new coronavirus cases in a single day Some 3,523 deaths were officially recorded in the past 24 hours - but the real figure is thought to be far higher as many fatalities go unreported In England, care home residents will be able to make low-risk trips without having to self-isolate for two weeks on their return, from Tuesday A campaign is launched to raise money to build a memorial in St Paul's Cathedral to those who've died as a result of the pandemic South Asian communities in England were more at risk of infection, severe illness and death during the second wave of the pandemic, compared with other ethnic groups, a study says Surge testing is launched in the Tower Hamlets area of London after the discovery of several cases of the Brazilian and South African variants Edited by Holly Wallis That's all from the live page team. You updates were brought to you by Chris Clayton, Holly Wallis, Jennifer Meierhans and Victoria Lindrea. We will be back with more coronavirus news tomorrow, have a good evening. We're going to be drawing our live page updates to a close soon so here's a recap of the main coronavirus news from the UK and beyond. Lockdown is being extended for another week in Delhi. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal asked people not to queue up for injections as the city had not yet received fresh vaccine stocks. ""As soon as vaccines arrive we will let you know, then you can come for shots. We appeal to you not to crowd vaccine centres in the next few days,"" Kejriwal said. About 150 million shots have been given so far in India, equivalent to 11.5% of its 1.3 billion strong population. But despite being the world's biggest producer of vaccines, the country is suffering an internal shortage and has placeda temporary hold on all exports of AstraZenecato meet domestic demand. More than 13 million people aged 18-45 have registered for the jab, but states including central Madhya Pradesh and hard-hit Maharashtra have said they will not start vaccinating this age group on 1 May as planned due to supply problems. We've got more on the Covid situation in Indiahere. Surge testing is to be carried out in Tower Hamlets, east London after a small number of the coronavirus variants first detected in Brazil and South Africa were identified there. These strains,externalof Covid-19 may be more contagious and dodge immunity to some extent. All the confirmed cases are self-isolating and there are no links between these cases and the cluster of cases recently
identified in the South London area. The variants have been identified in the area around E1 4 and E1 3 and some of E1 0, E1 1, E1 2, E1 5, E14 7, E2 0, E2 6, E3 4. Everyone over the age of 11 in these areas is being advised to take a PCR test, even if they donât have symptoms. You can find out more about the variants of concernhere. International travel is expected to be allowed again from 17 May at the earliest Monday 17 May marks the next stage of the government's lifting of lockdown restrictions across England. So what is expected to change in mid-May?  How and when restrictions change will ultimately depend on key data improving - and the easing differs between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.You can find out all you need to know about the relaxation of rules here. Restaurateur Hugh Osmond has called for a faster reopening of hospitality than 17 May - the date which marks the next stage for relaxing restrictions in England. Changes in the road map on 17 May are expected to include allowing pubs, cafes and restaurants to serve customers indoors - they can currently only serve outdoors. Osmond, the founder of Punch Taverns, said ""hard data"" suggested restrictions could be eased more quickly, since infections, hospital admissions and deaths were falling faster than previously predicted. He said the current data was ""significantly ahead of the assumptions in the model"" used to draw up the road map out of lockdown. There was now ""zero chance of the NHS being overwhelmed"", he added. Osmond, who brought a legal case against the government challenging Covid restrictions on hospitality, highlighted a recent study from Sage which had concluded that eating out had not led to an increased risk of becoming ill with coronavirus. Meanwhile, every day of closure was costing the industry Â£200m, he said, and ""every day places are closed and more go bust"". It comes asgovernment scientific adviser Prof Sir Mark Walport cautioned that many people were still not vaccinated,adding the public needed to be ""patient for a short period"" while lockdown was gradually eased. He told the BBC there was still a ""potential for that spark to reignite"" and cause infections to rise. A total of 49,287,257 coronavirus vaccinations have been given in the UK,according to today's government data.,external That's 34,346,273 first doses and 14,940,984 second doses. You can find out when you'll get your jabhere. A further seven people have died with coronavirus in the UK,according to the government's daily figures.,external This brings the total number of people to die within 28 days of a positive test to 127,524. There were also another 1,907 new infections reported in the last 24 hours. As we've been reporting, India has become the first country to report more than 400,000 new coronavirus cases in a single day, as its nationwide vaccine drive launches amid a supply crisis. There are also acute shortages of oxygen and hospital beds. Members of the diaspora - with family and friends in India - have responded by raising funds, sending life-saving equipment and offering their own expertise. Mehez Warsi is an Indian-born physiotherapist who has lived in the UK for the past seven years but is now back in Mumbai. She told the BBC's Newshour she had lost ""at least 36 people in the last two weeks"" including her father and her aunt. This video can not be played Devina GuptaBBC News India continues to struggle. In the past 48 hours the situation has worsened. Twelve people died when a private hospital in Delhi  ran out of Oxygen. Some hospitals are now turning away critically ill patients. To fight the pandemic, India's prime minister Narendra Modi has lowered the age limit for vaccination from 45 to 18. This will make an estimated 600 million more people eligible for the jab starting today. But only six states will be rolling out this initiative, others have put it on hold, saying their vaccine reserves have dried up. So far, the central government has denied there are vaccine shortages in the country. India is one of the world's largest vaccine manufacturers and produces nearly 80 million doses every month, but experts say this needs to be ramped up fast. The government has so far opposed a national lockdown. With an aim to give doses to nearly every adult around the world, this is the largest vaccination programme in history. More than one billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in 179 countries worldwide. China and the US have administered the highest number of doses, 255 million and 237 million respectively. India ranks third, with nearly 150 million. But while nearly all of Europe and the Americas have begun vaccination campaigns,a few countries in Africa are still to get started. Our Visual and Data Journalism team has been looking at the stats -read on to find out which vaccines are going where, and why.  We told you earlier about changes to care home regulations, which mean residents will be allowed to leave their home to see loved ones without having to quarantine for 14 days on their return. So what are the key changes taking place next week? From Tuesday, the government has said residents can take day trips, such as walks or visits to parks or gardens, providing they remain outside. Residents must be accompanied by either a member of staff or one of their two nominated visitors, and they must follow social distancing throughout. They cannot meet in groups or go indoors, except for the use of toilets, and public transport should be avoided where possible. An exemption is in place for those who wish to vote in person in the local elections on 6 May, the government says. Only trips deemed ""low risk"" are exempt from the self-isolation rule, so this does not include activities such as overnight visits. The Department of Health and Social Care said updated guidance would be published in due course. There remain different rules in the UK's devolved nations, with residents inWales,externalable to leave homes - where there is no Covid outbreak - without isolating on their return. Scotland'sguidance for care homes,externalallows for residents to see loved ones outside of the care home, while rules for care homes in Northern Irelandvary by region,external.   Michael BristowBBC World Service Asia Pacific editor Hong Kong officials have been accused of discrimination after ordering all foreign domestic workers to have coronavirus tests. Nearly 400,000 domestic employees - mostly women from the Philippines and Indonesia - will have to be tested.
They have one week to comply. The order came after two foreign workers were infected - but the order doesn't extend to the families they work for, or local people working in similar environments. In future, overseas domestic helpers employed in Hong Kong will also have to be vaccinated against the virus. Rights groups say this low-paid group is being unfairly targeted.
But officials said they're simply protecting the public. Meanwhile, several people have died at a hospital in Delhi today when critically ill patients were left without oxygen for about 80 minutes before re-supply tankers arrived, according to local media reports. And a fire in a Covid-19 hospital ward in the western city of Bharuch killed 18 people - the latest in a number of deadly hospital fires across the country this week. Vijay Gupta, 62, was gasping for air outside a hospital in the south-east of India's capital because all of its beds were full. ""We have been roaming around since 06:00 looking for a bed,"" a friend told Reuters news agency. ""Where shall we go?"" In Srinagar, the main city of Indian-administered Kashmir, one man said he had been waiting for vaccines to become available at a health centre, only to be told to come back another time. He said two relatives were with him who had health conditions. ""I'm very worried about them but we're still waiting,"" he told the BBC. We've got more on the Covid situation in Indiahere. Aamir PeerzadBBC News, Srinagar This video can not be played India Covid vaccination: 'Everybody should get jabs as cases are rising' According to the federal government's new vaccination policy, the state governments and the hospitals can purchase the vaccines directly from the manufacturers. But while India is the largest vaccine manufacturer, it seems there are not enough vaccines available. Many states have announced that they can't begin the vaccination drive as the manufacturers have not been able to keep up with demand. That has led to widespread disappointment. Experts say at the current rate, it may take India years to vaccinate its entire population. But can India's estimated 800 million eligible citizens, and indeed the world, afford to wait for so long? Border restrictions have been eased on the Isle of Man to allow non-resident family members to visit from today. The island's border has beenclosed to almost all non-residentssince the start of the pandemic, keeping some families apart for more than a year. Anyone who visits must isolate for seven days and pay Â£60 for two Covid-19 tests. Following a second negative test, people can leave isolation but will face further restrictions for the next three days, including a ban on using public transport or visiting pubs, restaurants and theatres. Anyone visiting from further afield must isolate for 14 days. Chief Minister Howard Quayle says the relaxation is possible because of the island's progress with its vaccination programme and the fall in infection rates in the UK. More than three quarters of adults living on the island have had at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine and there are only 10 active coronavirus cases. We've got more on this storyhere. Earlier we told you about criticism over the goverment's failure to reveal more details about the traffic light system that it has proposed to help regulate international travel after 17 May. Tory MP Huw Merriman, who chairs the Commons' Transport Select Committee, accused ministers of missing today's deadline to grade overseas destinations. But a spokeswoman for the Department for Transport insists the government ""has not missed a deadline"". ""We have always said we will confirm by early May if international travel can resume on 17 May and which countries will fall into which list. ""This will determine the requirements for travel for passengers."" She says the government's Global Travel Taskforce is working towards restarting international in a ""safe and sustainable way"". Mr Merriman earlier bemoaned the lack of information, which meant travellers and the travel industry were ""still in the dark"". ""Uncertainty has been prolonged. This uncertainty could cost people their jobs,"" he said. ""How can it be right that countries with slower vaccination roll-outs are safely reopening to international travellers while the UK stays static?"" As we've mentioned, social distancing is being eased at the Snooker World Championship to allow the final to be played in front of a capacity crowd at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield. The return of fans is being staggered throughout the event from 33% capacity for the first round to 100% for the final games on Sunday and Monday. World Snooker says face coverings are required but social distancing ""will not be expected"". The tournament ispart of the government's pilot schemeto ensure fans can safely return to sporting and cultural venues. Fans have to take a Covid-19 test before arriving and another five days afterwards. Revellers at the Circus Nightclub at Bramley-Moore Dock, Liverpool DJ Marea Stamper has described the ""incredible energy"" at a pilot event in a warehouse on Liverpool's waterfront which saw some 3,000 clubbers gathered together without masks or social distancing on Friday. The event was part of the government's test programme to evaluate how to hold mass gatherings safely as the country unlocks. ""Of course the whole thing sort of operated silently as a science experiment - they were studying ventilation and crowd patterns - but every precaution was taken to make sure we were safe,"" said the DJ, whose professional name is The Blessed Madonna. She told the BBC that those attending were ""incredibly emotional"". ""I think we felt excited but also proud to be a part of creating the protocols that would lead to the reopening of all kinds of things."" Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden has described the event as ""another huge moment in our journey back to normality"". The MP said he had attended the Snooker World Championship at Sheffield's Crucible Theatre on Friday - where initial social distancing requirements are being ""gradually eased"" to allow 100% capacity at the finals on Sunday and Monday. ""I have seen first hand just how important these research events are,"" said Mr Dowden. But he cautioned: ""We are making good progress but we have been clear that decisions on reopening will be led by the data.  A woman has shared how she paid for a private coronavirus vaccine in Pakistan as cases there hit a record high. Mahwish Bhatti is one of only 2% to have received a jab in the country. She paid 12,000 rupees ($78; Â£56) to a private lab - a price out of reach to many Pakistanis. Already Pakistan has seen active cases go from as low as 16,000 in the first week of March, to more than 140,000 new cases in April alone, as well as over 3,000 deaths - making it the worst month there since the pandemic began. Prime Minister Imran Khan has warned that Pakistan - with less than one doctor per 963 people - could be headed for disaster. For Bhatti, choosing a private laboratory to be vaccinated against the coronavirus was a last resort. ""I was desperate. I panicked,"" the 35-year-old from Lahore, Pakistan, told the BBC over the phone. ""My mother was still waiting for her second dose of the vaccine, so I thought my turn would never come. I thought to myself, I will just buy whatever vaccine is available."" Bhatti, who lost her job recently, used some of her savings to get the Russian-made Sputnik V jab. She says: ""I did get one jab of vaccines, but also one jab to my wallet."" We've got more on this storyhere. Â© 2025 BBC.

Updates were brought to you by Mary O'Connor, Jennifer Meierhans, George Wright, Paul Kirby, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Holly Wallis and Claire Heald. Join us again tomorrow. Here's a recap of the UK's coronavirus news today:  We're drawing the live page to a close for the day soon. Here's a round-up of some of the biggest developments from around the world today:  A US state says it will offer young people a $100 (Â£72) savings bond if they receive a Covid-19 vaccine. West Virginia saysit hopes the payment for those aged 16 to 35 will ""motivate"" them to get the jab. ""Our kids today probably don't really realise just how important they are in shutting this thing down,"" State Governor Jim Justice said on Monday. West Virginia had been among the top US states for vaccination rates, but progress has slowed in recent weeks. There are particular concerns that younger people may be more hesitant about receiving a jab. The incentive means those who are vaccinated within the age group can retrieve the $100, plus interest, at a later date. It will also be offered to anyone aged 16 to 35 who has already been vaccinated. West Virginia has the 16th highest rate of new coronavirus cases per person among US states, according to the New York Times. Conversely,a Miami school has discouraged teachers from getting the Covid vaccine, saying any vaccinated employees will be barred from interacting with students. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst People wait to receive vaccines in Ruili over the weekend There is a lot of fanfare today in the Chinese city of
Ruili, where the authorities have lifted stay-at-home orders for people in
low-risk areas. Ruili, in southwestern Yunnan province, has been the site
of Chinaâs one domestic Covid-19 outbreak over the last month. There have been
more than 100 confirmed cases in the China-Myanmar border city since 30 March,
affecting both Chinese and Burmese nationals. The city implemented strict lockdowns in March, with a
number of city districts becoming âmediumâ or âhigh-riskâ. In these areas, people were
under strict orders to stay at home. All but essential businesses closed.
Students began having online classes, and transport links were suspended. Thousands of medical workers from outside of the city were
also sent to the front-line. However, today, media note that they have
âcompleted their missionâ, and footage is circulating showing local residents
dancing and waving to see them off. There were also fireworks set off yesterday evening
following the announcement that in areas that had recently returned to being
âlow-riskâ, home lockdowns were to be lifted. The Yunnan Health Commission says that 59 people are
currently being treated with symptoms,
including 13 who have arrived from overseas. Dr Jerryl Bennett from the Doctors Association of India has spoken to the BBC from Nagpur in Maharsahtra state. He says authorities are trying to step up supplies of oxygen, but it's been a losing battle: ""They are trying to provide us with oxygen, but the demand is so much that whatever amount of supply is there from the government it is not sufficient enough right now,"" he says. ""Patients are in a panic-stricken mode. The entire country is in panic-stricken mode."" He says medical staff are being pushed to the edge. ""We are physically exhausted. We are working over the capacity which a human can work. But it is also very traumatising emotionally and mentally that we are losing patients because of lack of oxygen or lack of beds. ""We are losing patients because they are coming in the hospitals at a very late stage where it is very difficult for us to give them the treatment for them to survive or for them to revive back from Covid,"" he says. ""It becomes very difficult for all the young generation doctors as well as the senior doctors. These patients could have been saved had we intervened a little earlier."" An Isle of Man ferry terminal in Liverpool will be at least Â£5m over budget and a year late due to the impact of coronavirus. Delays to the government-funded project caused by the pandemic are currently costing Â£8,000 per day, says infrastructure minister Tim Baker. The project was originally expected to cost Â£38m and be completed by December 2020, but that waspushed back to March and then July 2021. It will now be finished in March 2022. Baker told the Manx House of Keys: ""Progress is being made day by day, week by week, but it is being heavily impacted by the ongoing impact of coronavirus."" He says: ""I will do absolutely what I can to control the cost and to speed up delivery, but I cannot promise that we have yet met all the challenges that this scheme will bring."" The new facility is being built at the Princes Half Tide Dock about 670m from the existing terminal at Pier Head. BBC Radio 5 Live With a deadly second wave of Covid infections happening in India, BBC Radio 5 Live Drive has been hearing from people whose family and friends have been affected. Harsimrat Kaur lives in London with her husband Jagjit Singh and has relatives in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. Her aunt and cousin have both died of Covid-19 in the last couple of weeks. Harsimrat said: ""It hit home really hardâ¦ two people from the same family, theyâve got young kids as wellâ¦ I donât have any words, itâs just insane what is happening.â Harsimrat explained that her cousin managed to get a hospital bed ""after fighting for days with the doctors"" but still couldnât get oxygen or treatment there. Her aunt never got into hospital and had been ""struggling for oxygen"" too. Following the recent birth of their baby boy, both Harsimrat and her husband feel jumping on a plane to be with their family on compassionate grounds, would be âtoo much of a riskâ for their sonâs health. She added that her and her husband also âjust canât affordâ to travel to India and then spend two weeks in hotel quarantine. They have applied for a visa to allow some members of their family to come to the UK, when international travel opens up again. Listen back to the conversation on BBC Sounds. Leisure centres, outdoor attractions and hairdressers are open to customers across much of the UK, for the first time in months since coronavirus restrictions were imposed. But what are the rules in the UK's different nations? Here's our explainer of the rules below - which you can read it in fullhere. InEngland:  InWales:  InScotland:  InNorthern Ireland: Love of Lesbian played to a crowd of 5,000 Researchers in Spain have found ""no sign"" of higher levels of infection among people who took part in a large test concert last month. Six people tested positive within 14 days of attending the gig in Barcelona, but the incidence was lower than that seen in the general population. Around 5,000 music fans took part in the experiment after testing negative for Covid-19. Revellers wore masks but did not have to socially distance. Of the six people who tested positive, researchers concluded that four of them were infected elsewhere, not at the event itself. Spanish authorities let the show, featuring band Love of Lesbian, go ahead as part of a research project. The rate of infection among attendees was half the rate of people of the same age in Barcelona, researchers found. ""There is no sign that suggests transmission took place during the event,"" infectious disease specialist Josep Maria Llibre told a news conference on Tuesday. Read more here. More than 1.5 million Moroccans were arrested in the last nine months for not respecting Covid measures, a top official has said. This translates to a rate of more than 5,700 people arrested every day during that timeframe, Deputy Interior Minister Noureddine Boutayeb said, according to the 2M TV channel. ""Although this number seems large, it indicates a great involvement of all the authorities in charge of law enforcement,"" he told parliament. Failure to wear protective masks, respect curfews and travel bans were among the main offences, according to the Hespress website. Last year, Morocco rejected allegations of police abuse in taking measures to combat the spread of coronavirus in the country. This came after a top official at the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) included the country in a list of states where the authorities' response to the pandemic had raised concerns. Almost 9,000 people have been reported to have lost their lives to Covid-19 in the country of 36 million people. A customer picks up a token that can be exchanged for a beer at the Warpigs Brewpub in Copenhagen A bar in the Danish capital, Copenhagen, has come up with a novel way of tempting its customers back in. In return for 149 kroner (Â£17, $24), punters at Warpigs Brewpub are able to take a test and wait for the result with a free beer. After half an hour, if they test negative, they are allowed inside the bar. It works as part ofthe country's coronapas (corona passport) systemwhich allows Danes to show proof that they are infection-free. Although they can get hold of free government-provided tests, the bar's customers
say the paid-for versions let them avoid the queues at testing centres. Warpigs says it's trying this out in partnership with a medical company to see if there's appetite for the scheme. One customer seemed happy enough: ""It [the test] costs some money, but you get a free beer - paid beer I guess, but you get a beer. And it was worth it. It took two minutes, you did it yourself, it wasn't uncomfortable and I got 'negative', so it's a win-win in my opinion,"" Nicolai Marteens told Reuters news agency. Health authorities in Bangladesh have approved the Russian vaccine, Sputnik V, for emergency use amid uncertainty over deliveries from neighbouring India. The director-general of the Bangladeshi Drug Administration, Mahbubur Rahman, said the country was expecting the arrival of about four million doses from Russia next month. Rahman also indicated that Bangladesh could approve China's Sinopharm vaccine shortly. India has halted exports
of the AstraZeneca vaccinein response to a record surge in domestic infections. Assome MPs call for a review of fixed penalty noticesfor Covid lockdown breaches today, we've been hearing from people who were issued fines. One public sector worker told us he has been left in debt after being given a Â£1,000 fine for going to a friend's house for drinks. He and his wife, who was a nurse, met up with friends on the 11th day of self-isolation after a holiday abroad. At the time, the self-isolation period was 14 days. They'd both had Covid earlier in the year and thought the party posed minimal risk. ""It was wrong, I admit it and I came clean about it. But Â£1,000 is a ridiculous amount
of money. I'm still paying it off every month out of my wages, it's an impossible situation,"" the father-of-three explained. And in Manchester, Abe, 29, was fined after he went to a BBQ in January with four friends, and a neighbour called the police. He was issued two fines of Â£200 each, instead of one. After challenging the mistake, both fines were withdrawn, but his friends each paid their fines. ""Most people just pay the fine because theyâre
scared - the letters are alarming and say ""criminal records office"". It also concerned me that police were attending these calls when there are so many other serious issues,"" he said. There have been a further 17 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK, according to thegovernment's latest figures.,external That brings the number of deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test to 127,451. There were also a further 2,685 new infections recorded in the last 24 hours. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Over the last few days, Chinese media have been
dominated by reports on the catastrophic scenes in India. State media yesterday
noted that China had sent hundreds of oxygen concentrators, and was vowing to
send 10,000 more. The national Global Times newspaper said that the country
would âkeep in contact with India for urgent supportâ. Today, the Global Times has criticised the US for
not responding in the same way. It says that âUS aid to India is long overdueâ,
and says that âcountries with strong, anti-epidemic capabilities must shoulder
greater responsibilitiesâ. The Xinhua news agency says that only 1.4% of Indiaâs
population have been vaccinated, and that âthe US is hoarding Covid-19
vaccinesâ. It adds that this comes amid other developing nations denouncing US
âvaccine apartheidâ. Chinese media have been keen to highlight
internal divisions between ordinary Indians and the elite. They were critical
of Indiaâs super-rich chartering eight private jets to London ahead of being
included on the UK governmentâs red list,
and The Paper notes that some Bollywood stars have been trolled for taking
holiday photos in the Maldives as the situation continues to escalate. Meanwhile, papers have been speaking to Chinese
nationals who are based in India. One called Niko told Beijing News that she
has tested positive for Covid-19, âbut the hospital said on 13 April that
hospital beds were all occupiedâ¦ so Iâve had no choice but to take medicine at
homeâ. In a video shared by the Global Times, a student,
Ms Chen, says that âthere are no flights; I can only stay at home and protect
myselfâ. An NHS boss has praised the ""heroic efforts"" of all those involved in the vaccine roll out as the UK reaches one-in-four adults having had their second jab. But Ruth Rankine, primary care director at the NHS Confederation, has urged everyone to stick to lockdown rules, warning that the pandemic is not yet over. She says: ""Today we reach another milestone in the UK's vaccination campaign and this is yet more evidence of the heroic efforts of so many people across the NHS, including and especially primary care, to make sure as many people as possible are protected."" ""But at the same time, we need to continue to follow the rules, maintaining social distancing and wearing masks to make sure the progress we have made in recent weeks can continue. ""With growing numbers of cases in the UK of mutant strains of the virus, we must not fall into the trap of believing the crisis is over.""

Assistant head teacher Victoria Day has shared her top tips to help children with their communication. The Brazilian congress is launching an inquiry today into the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed almost 400,000 people. The commission could potentially lead to the impeachment of President Jair Bolsonaro. He's been widely criticised for his anti-lockdown, vaccine-sceptic stance. He has also told Brazilians to ""stop whining"" about the situation. Bolsonaro said he's ""not worried"" by the commission - but his chance of re-election next year could be at stake. On Monday, Brazil's health regulator rejected requests from several states to receive batches of the Russian vaccine, Sputnik V. The UK has fully vaccinated a quarter of its adult population against coronavirus and is on track to offer a first jab to all adults by the end of July, the government says. Public Health England data shows
vaccines are already having a significant impact in the UK in reducing
hospitalisations and deaths, and saved more than 10,000 lives between December
and March. Data from the ONS and Oxford University shows that
COVID-19 infections fell by 65% after the first dose of the
Oxford/AstraZeneca or Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines, and further after the second
dose. The latest vaccine effectiveness data from PHE
show that in those aged over 70, both the Pfizer/BioNTech and
Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines reduce the risk of getting symptomatic disease by
around 60% after a single dose. This protection lasts for several weeks. In
those aged over 80, protection against hospitalisation is around 80% and the
Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is 85% effective at stopping people aged over 80 dying
from COVID-19. Rolling reviews are under way by the MHRA to
assess the Janssen and Novavax vaccines - find out when you'll get your jabhere. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,1.0
"Last March as lockdown was announced across the UK people were told to stay at home apart from for essential reasons Urgent changes are needed to get people out of cars and back on trains after Covid travel restrictions are eased, campaigners have warned. Passenger numbers plummeted by about 95% as ""non-essential"" travel was banned at the height of the pandemic. Now there are fears people will switch back to cars unless action is taken to make rail more affordable, attractive and address safety fears. Transport for Wales (TfW) said trains were safe and changes were being made. Over the past 20 years, the number of people using trains to travel into, out of and across Wales increased by about 80%, with about 31.1 million journeys in 2019, compared to about 16.6 million in 1999-2020. Commuters have complained of packed carriages, delays and cancellations, while queues were seen outside stations as thousands used trains to get into Cardiff on match and concert days. Traffic on Welsh roads 60% higher than first lockdown Homeworking could ease M4 traffic, says minister In December, during the national ""stay at home"" lockdown, passenger numbers on services run by TfW dropped to 5-10% of pre-Covid levels and the hit to ticket income led toTfW being nationalised in February, in a bid to keep services running. In April, after travel bans were lifted,allowing people to travel anywhere in England and Wales, TfW reported a rise in passengers to 20-30% of pre-pandemic levels, with footfall in stations up to 39% by 12 April. It said had done all it could to keep services going during ""challenging times"", and the rail service was ""adapting"" to changes in demand and lifestyle due to Covid-19. Alexia Course, director of rail operations, said as many moved away from office based 9-5 working, it aimed to make rail a ""more attractive option"" for day-trips and holidays, and working on new fares and ticketing options. This video can not be played Pre-pandemic, many commuters had complained about ""packed"" trains But transport experts and green campaigners have warned safety messaging about avoiding public transport could have a ""lasting impact"" and it could take years for passengers to get back on board. Â£62m needed to keep Transport for Wales afloat Has the pandemic changed our behaviour for ever? With some of Wales major employersnow considering allowing employees to work from home full-time, campaigners fear the rail network will be unsustainable, unless it adapts to people's lifestyle changes, with a knock-on effect for the environment if more of us choose cars over public transport as restrictions are eased. Peter Kingsbury, of Rail Future Wales, warned getting people back on the trains and out of cars was essential for the ""wider good of society"". ""Future generations will potentially have a much lower quality of life if we are not able to change our habits over the next decade or two,"" he said. Cardiff saw one of the highest increases in south Wales in traffic on roads during lockdown The Welsh government wants 45% of journeys to be made by public transport, walking or cycling by 2040 and all political parties have made promises for more sustainable transport in the run-up to the election. Who should I vote for? Compare party's transport policies How our daily travel harms the planet However, Christine Boston, director of sustainable travel charity Sustrans Cymru, said the rail service must adapt quickly or there was a ""real danger"" people who previously used trains could switch back to cars. Figures obtained by BBC Walesshow traffic on Welsh roads increased by 62% in the last stay-at-home lockdown, compared with the first lockdown in March 2020, while public transport levels remained comparably low. With a surge in cycling in lockdown, the charity wants to see cycle routes and train stations joined up, with more space for bikes on trains, in a bid to help people ""travel green"". ""The fall in passenger numbers risks pushing the cost of travel far beyond the means of many,"" Ms Boston said. ""Car use has crept back up to pre-pandemic levels, with a real risk of a car-led recovery, which would be devastating for us all."" This video can not be played A cycling group says lockdown is ""a once in a lifetime opportunity"" Norman Baker, of Campaign for Better Transport, said the rise in traffic showed there was an ""urgent need"" for incentives to get people out of their cars. ""If you don't get people back on trains and buses there will be gridlock on the roads,"" he warned. Ms Course said people needed to be reminded of the benefits of travelling by rail, such as enjoying ""looking out of the window"", reading a book, getting work done and having a cup of coffee while travelling. ""There's a lot you can't get when you're sat behind the wheel of a car and driving to wherever you need to get to,"" she said. She said new trains were being built and TfW was looking at how to create more space for bikes. Working from home has become the norm for many over the past year Before the pandemic, many used rail services to commute to work, at times leading to issues with overcrowding on Valleys lines into Cardiff, and other major hubs, at peak times. Now, with some companies introducing more flexible ways of working, and some announcing home working will continue way into the future, campaigners say rail services must adapt to a very ""different working world"". Mr Baker said the days of 9-5 commuting patterns were over and the rail timetable and tickets needed to ""reflect a new reality"" where more people would travel for leisure. He said dates for engineering works needed to change, making sure timetables were not limited on a Sunday, when many people would be taking trips. ""Sunday is no longer a day where we can shut the service down, Sunday is a busy day, engineering works should take place on a different time, on a different day,"" he said. Some fares on a number of TfW servicesincreased by 2.6% from March, bringing it in line with a similar increaseannounced in England in December. An off-peak return trip from Cardiff Central to London Paddington, on a Monday, costs Â£113.70, while at peak commuting times, it would cost more than Â£200, according to one ticketing website. Mr Kingsbury said there was an urgent need for fare reform to reflect many people would not be commuting five days a week. He said traditional season tickets - aimed at people who commute at peak times to offices - needed to be replaced with flexible options and was ""urgent to bring people back over the next six months"". Ms Course said TfW already had more flexible ticketing, for people to save while working from different locations, but was ""looking at other ways we can encourage different types of ticketing"" and the UK rail industry to create a new flexible ticket. Train operators hope people will get on board to travel around the UK for their summer staycations With no timeframe for when people can start jetting off on holidays abroad again, many are predicting a staycation boom this year. Campaigners said it was vital rail services capitalised on increased tourism and encouraged people to use rail to travel for trips this summer. Mr Kingsbury said the current rail network was ""not financially sustainable"" and a scheme similar toEat Out to Help Outcould be introduced, with discount fares or even a free journey to get back on board. Ms Course said TfW was working to promote rail as a more attractive way of travelling across Wales for trips and was working with businesses to ""try and tap into customer bases that maybe haven't looked at the railway in the same light previously"". Passengers had complained of packed platforms and carriages on some services pre-pandemic However, there are also fears that people using trains for trips and holidays could lead to overcrowding. Jeff Smith, of the Shrewsbury to Aberystwyth Rail Passenger Group (SARPA) and a Plaid Cymru town councillor, said he feared the Cambrian line would struggle to cope. Some servicescontinued to see overcrowding, as people ignored travel rules to head to beacheslast summer. ""You are looking at a situation like in the 1970s where you're going to have everyone going to resorts in the UK, so we will have people from Birmingham going to Aberystwyth,"" said Mr Smith. Mr Smith said a lack of carriages on the line would mean little space for passengers to stay apart, if passenger numbers increased in the summer. ""If you have an overcrowded train then the social distancing goes out of the window,"" he said. Ms Course said new trains were currently being built which would help increase capacity and customer experience, and allow for more frequent services, including on the Cambrian line. She said dealing with overcrowding would be ""challenging"", but with fewer people commuting, things did not need to ""go back to how things were"", while extra support would be put on when major events resumed. This video can not be played Face masks have been mandatory on public transport since the end of July With few people using trains during repeated lockdowns, maintaining social-distancing was fairly easy, and people have been turned away for not wearing masks. However, campaigners said after months being told not to use public transport and to stay at home, there was a public misperception trains were ""unsafe"". Scientists have said the risk of transmissiondepends on how crowded a train is, and how far away you can stay away from people,external. British Transport Police patrolled railway stations to help maintain Covid rules last year So far this year, 9,348 people have been challenged by British Transport Police and rail staff for not wearing face masks - which are mandatory on trains - with 1,039 people refused travel. Ms Course said there was no evidence trains were unsafe, with enhanced cleaning and security measures in place, and urged people to use a capacity checker before travelling. She added that keeping people apart as demand increased would be ""challenging"", but social distancing was a priority and safety measures would continue. Mick Lynch, of the RMT trade union, told a recent Senedd committee inquiry there would come a point where social distancing could no longer be maintained on the network: ""You will get to your ceiling of 2m social distancing, and any answer to that is to restrict travel or to change the social distancing.""

"Boomtown Fair was postponed until next year because it could not get Covid cancellation insurance Most of the music festivals still due to take place this year could be scrapped without the safety net of government-backed cancellation insurance, organisers have warned. A quarter of UK festivals have already been called off, but 76% of the rest are at risk, according to the industry. The Association of Independent Festivals (AIF) has called for ""urgent intervention"" to save the season. The government said it was exploring what further support it could provide. The AIF said events had been scrapped because of ""government inaction on insurance"". It has been calling on the government to back cancellation insurance. That would allow organisers to go ahead with their plans without suffering financial losses if they were forced to cancel their events due to a new spike in Covid cases. Paul Reed said insurance is a ""Don't pass go"" issue for festival organisers ""For months now, we have been warning government that the UK's 2021 festival season would be quickly eroded if they failed to back their own roadmap out of lockdown and act on Covid related cancellation insurance,"" said Association of Independent Festivals (AIF) chief executive Paul Reed. ""It's now red alert for the UK's festival season. By the end of this month, 76% of the remaining festivals planned for 2021 could very quickly disappear from the calendar. ""Without a safety net, independent promoters cannot begin to confidently invest in their events. ""If government-backed insurance is off the table, festival organisers deserve to know what [the] government is proposing as an alternative to prevent the widespread collapse of the festival season."" The ""long-term survival of many of the businesses behind these events"", was also at stake, he added. Blossoms will headline a concert at Liverpool's Sefton Park which is part of a government pilot A spokesperson said the government was ""aware of the wider concerns about securing indemnity for live events and are exploring what further support we may provide"". More than Â£34m from the Culture Recovery Fund had supported festivals including Glastonbury, Boomtown, and Hay Literary Festival, the spokesperson said. The government isrunning a live music test event at Sefton Park in Liverpool on Sundayto see how festivals can be reopened aspart of a programme of events in the city. However, people should be aware that there is a risk in booking festival tickets for the summer, vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi told the BBC on Thursday. ""People have to be careful,"" he said. ""If you are now booking [festival tickets], then you do carry some risk clearly, because we have to follow the [infection] data. ""The good news is the vaccinations are working. About 70% of the adult population of England now have antibodies... but we have to remain cautious."" Insurance really is a ""Don't pass go"" issue for many festival organizers, Mr Reed said. He added that festivals contribute Â£1.76bn to the UK economy and support 85,000 jobs. The Association of British Insurers said: ""We understand that this has been a difficult and uncertain time for the events industry. ""With the Covid-19 public health emergency continuing to present a significant risk of cancellation or disruption, commercial insurers remain unable to offer this type of cover, or only at a cost that is unaffordable for many."" Of UK festivals with a capacity of more than 5,000, 26% have already been abandoned, including Boomtown Fair and Deer Shed. That leaves 131 still due to go ahead, mostly in July and August. It is uncertain whether the Nozstock festival will go ahead this year ""Most of the festivals that are holding their position in July and August will need to commit to substantial, non-refundable costs by the end of May,"" said AIF. ""And 72% of AIF members have said that if they do not take place in 2021, they will require financial support to return in 2022."" Some festival organisers have already delayed their events. According to the AIF 22% of festivals it tracks are now taking place in September and October, up from 10% earlier in the year. Boomtown director of communications and strategy Anna Wade said Boomtown decided to postpone the event until next year as it could not get Covid cover. ""It basically means you're proceeding without the safety net of insurance, which no company or even individual would want to do, because the risks are just so high, with so many unknowns,"" she said. Ella Nosworthy, creative director at the Nozstock festival, said they would wait until the results of the government pilot in Liverpool to see whether they could get insurance so their festival could go ahead in July. Helen Kenny, a freelance stage and production manager, said that typically she would work on 25 to 30 festivals per year over a six-month period in the UK and Europe, including Boomtown. So far this summer she has only been booked for six, and she is unsure whether any of those will cancel. ""I wake up every day at the moment with a smile on my face, attending meetings, and finally back to doing what I love,"" she said. ""However, I'm totally aware that we are still in a pandemic and anything declared or planned could change at any time."" Ms Kenny added that she worries about the mental health of freelance colleagues and friends who are finding it difficult to make ends meet. ""Can they feed their families and pay rent? Will we all be able to hug and be on a site somewhere doing what we love, and what we've worked towards for years as our careers?"" she said. ""Not enough support has been provided for self employed freelancers and watching them struggle when they come from a background of high grossing events just blows my mind,"" she added.
