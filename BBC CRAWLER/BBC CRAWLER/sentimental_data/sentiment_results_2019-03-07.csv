"This video can not be played Amber Rudd: Abuse is ""worst of all if you're a coloured woman"" Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd has apologised for using the word ""coloured"" in a BBC interview. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott criticised the use of the term, saying it was ""outdated"", ""offensive"" and a ""revealing choice of words"". During a discussion about MP abuse, Ms Rudd said: ""It's worst of all if you're a coloured woman. I know that Diane Abbott gets a huge amount of abuse."" In her apology, Ms Rudd said she was ""mortified at my clumsy language"". The prime minister's official spokeswoman said making an apology was ""absolutely the right thing to do"". Historically, the word is associated with segregation, especially in the US, where black people were kept separate from white people - on public transport, or at drinking fountains which were described as ""coloured-only"" for example. It is regarded as an offensive racial slur which recalls a time when casual racism was a part of everyday life. Why the term 'coloured' is offensive The exchange happened during an interview on BBC Radio 2's Jeremy Vine show. Host Jeremy Vine asked Ms Rudd: ""The question is, given that all people in the public eye seem to get terrible tweets from strangers, whether it's worse if you're a woman?"" Ms Rudd replied: ""It definitely is worse if you're a woman, it's worst of all if you're a coloured woman. ""I know that Diane Abbott gets a huge amount of abuse, that's something we need to call out."" But Ms Abbott responded on Twitter, saying it was a ""revealing choice of words"".

Separately, Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom has been criticised for her response to a question from Labour MP Naz Shah, about Islamophobia. The shadow women and equalities minister had called for a Commons debate, after the former Tory minister Baroness Warsi criticised the Conservatives over Islamophobia. Ms Shah added that the all-party parliamentary group on British Muslims had recently published a definition of Islamophobia. Mrs Leadsom replied that the Conservatives had an ""extremely robust and urgent"" response to Islamophobia but went on to suggest that, on the definition of Islamophobia, Ms Shah ""can discuss with Foreign Office ministers whether that would be a useful way forward"". Ms Shah said later: ""To say that British Muslims facing Islamophobia here in the UK is a 'Foreign Office' issue is truly baffling and horrifically alludes to British Muslims as foreigners. ""It just goes to show how out of touch the Tories are with a problem that their politicians and councillors are exacerbating."" A spokesman for the Commons Leader's office spokesman said: ""Islamophobia is unacceptable wherever it takes place. ""It was thought the MP for Bradford West was referring to a global definition of Islamophobia. ""International efforts to combat Islamophobia (and all forms of religious persecution and prejudice) are lead by the PM's special envoy on freedom of religion or belief, Lord Ahmad, at the Foreign & Commonwealth Office. ""Of course, any form of Islamophobia in the UK would be dealt with swiftly by the Home Office or Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government as appropriate."" But Baroness Warsi, a Conservative peer, tweeted: ""What is wrong with some of my colleagues?"" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"The Queen has posted a photo on the official royal family Instagram account for the first time. She was applauded after sharing an image of a letter from 19th century inventor and mathematician Charles Babbage to Prince Albert. The Queen used an iPad to share the photo as she looked at exhibits in the Science Museum's summer exhibition - Top Secret. The museum's director said it was a ""nerve-wracking moment"". The Queen's post read: ""In the letter, Babbage told Queen Victoria and Prince Albert about his invention, the Analytical Engine, upon which the first computer programmes were created by Ada Lovelace, a daughter of Lord Byron. ""Today, I had the pleasure of learning about children's computer coding initiatives and it seems fitting to me that I publish this Instagram post at the Science Museum, which has long championed technology, innovation and inspired the next generation of inventors.""

During her long reign, the Queen - Britain's longest-reigning monarch - has encountered many technological changes. She was the first person to have her Coronation filmed when television cameras were allowed inside Westminster Abbey in 1953. More than half a million extra TV sets were sold in the weeks running up to the historic event. She has also seen the introduction of colour television, mobile phones and the internet. The Queen was shown an Enigma machine - one of the exhibits in the upcoming exhibition She also made the UK's first ""trunk call"" - a long distance call made within the same country - in 1958. She became the first monarch to send an email when the technology was in its infancy during a visit to an Army base in 1976. Her grandchildren, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie explained the concept of YouTube to her, and she then launched her own channel on the site in 2007. She also personally uploaded a video to the video sharing site during a visit to Google's offices in London in 2008. Five years ago,the Queen also sent her first tweetduring a visit to the Science Museum. During that visit she was also opening an exhibition, tweeting: ""It is a pleasure to open the Information Age exhibition today at the @ScienceMuseum and I hope people will enjoy visiting.

"After it rains the surface darkens, which speeds up melting Rain is becoming more frequent in Greenland and accelerating the melting of its ice, a new study has found. Scientists say they're ""surprised"" to discover rain falling even during the long Arctic winter. The massive Greenland ice-sheet is being watched closely because it holds a huge store of frozen water. And if all of that ice melted, the sea level would rise by seven metres, threatening coastal population centres around the world. Precipitation usually falls as snow in winter - rather than as rain - which can balance out any melting of the ice in the summer. The scientists studied satellite pictures of the ice-sheet which reveal the areas where melting is taking place. And they combined those images with data gathered from 20 automated weather stations that recorded when rainfall occurred. The findings, published in the journal The Cryosphere, show that while there were about two spells of winter rain every year in the early phase of the study period, that had risen to 12 spells by 2012. On more than 300 occasions between 1979-2012, the analysis found that rainfall events were triggering a melting of the ice. Most of these were in summertime, when the air often gets above zero. But a growing number happened in winter months when the permanent dark of the polar winter would be expected to keep temperatures well below freezing. The ice after rain in the Kangerlussuaq region, Greenland The lead author of the study, Dr Marilena Oltmanns of the GEOMAR ocean research centre in Germany, told BBC News: ""We were surprised that there was rain in the winter. ""It does make sense because we're seeing flows of warm air coming up from the South, but it's still surprising to see that associated with rainfall."" Another scientist on the study, Prof Marco Tedesco of Columbia University in New York, said that the increase in rain had important implications. Even if it falls during winter, and then quickly refreezes, the rain changes the characteristics of the surface, leaving it smoother and darker, and ""pre-conditioned"" to melt more rapidly when summer arrives. The darker the ice is, the more heat it absorbs from the Sun - causing it to melt more quickly. ""This opens a door to a world that is extremely important to explore,"" Prof Tedesco said. ""The potential impact of changes taking place in the winter and spring on what happens in summer needs to be understood."" A smoother surface, particularly a ""lens"" of ice, will allow meltwater to flow over it much faster and being darker means that more of the Sun's rays are absorbed, further speeding-up the warming process. Pictures taken by a British research team, caught in a rainstorm on the ice-sheet last year, show how a bright highly reflective landscape of snow and ice was turned into a much darker scene. Although Greenland is extremely remote, a vast island lying at the northern end of the Atlantic Ocean, the sheer volume of ice covering it means its fate could have global repercussions. The Greenland ice sheet in rainy conditions in 2014 In stable times, snowfall in winter will balance any ice melted or breaking off into the ocean in summer. But research has shown how in recent decades the ice-sheet has been losing vast amounts of mass. Although this contributes only a relatively small amount to the rise in the sea-level - with much of the rest coming from thermal expansion as the oceans warm - the fear is that the flow of meltwater could accelerate as temperatures rise. Two years ago, the BBCreported from Greenland on the risks of faster melting, because of the growth of algae which makes the ice darker and more likely to warm. This effect of algae is, in addition to darkening, caused by soot and other forms of pollution carried by winds to the Arctic. This comes amid growing concern that the region as a whole is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet, which may be influencing the flow of the high-altitude jet stream. That could disturb weather patterns in Europe and other regions, and may also explain how the flows of warm, moist air from the Atlantic are reaching Greenland, even in winter. Prof Jason Box, a glaciologist not involved in the new study, says the research builds on earlier work by him and colleagues published in 2015 that found that summer rainfall could increase the rate of melting. Their analysis found that because water has a high heat content, it takes only 14mm of rain to melt 15cm of snow, even if that snow is at a temperature of minus 15C. ""There's a simple threshold, the melting point, and when the temperature goes above that you get rain instead of snow,"" he said. ""So, in a warming climate it's not rocket science that you're going to have more rain than snow, and it's one more reason why the ice sheet can go into deficit instead of being in surplus."" Prof Box has himself experienced sudden rainstorms while camped on the ice-sheet. ""After weeks of sunshine, it started raining on us and it completely transformed the surface - it got darker. ""And I became convinced - only by being there and seeing it with my own eyes - that rain is just as important as strong sunny days in melting the Greenland ice sheet.""

"If appointed to the Debenhams board Mike Ashley would step down from his current roles at Sports Direct Sports Direct has said it wants to remove all the current members of the Debenhams board except one, and appoint its boss Mike Ashley to run the business. Sports Direct has a nearly 30% share in Debenhams. The department store chain said it was ""disappointed that Sports Direct has taken this action"". Earlier this week, Debenhams issued another profit warning as its sales continue to fall. The struggling department store, which has 165 stores and employs about 25,000 people, reported a record pre-tax loss of Â£491.5m last year and said more recently that sales had fallen sharply over Christmas. High Street retailers have been under increasing pressure as more people choose to shop online and visit stores less. Tuesday's profits warning followed three which Debenhams issued last year. It also said in October that it plans to close 50 stores, putting 4,000 jobs at risk, over the next three to five years. In January Mr Ashley joined together with investor Landmark Groupto vote the retailer's chairman and chief executive off the board. Sergio Bucher remained as chief executive of Debenhams but no longer sits on the board. In a statement, Sports Direct said it had called for a general meeting of Debenhams shareholders to appoint Mr Mike Ashley to the board of directors of Debenhams, and to remove all of the current members of the Debenhams board, other than Rachel Osborne who became a director in September 2018. It said that if Mr Ashley were to be appointed to the board of directors of Debenhams ""during this business critical period for Debenhams"", Mr Ashley would carry out an executive role, and would focus on the Debenhams business, ""including building a strong board and management team"". ""If appointed, Mr Ashley would step down from his current roles as a director and chief executive of Sports Direct,"" it added. He would be replaced as acting chief executive by Sports Direct's deputy chief financial officer Chris Wootton. Mr Ashley, who founded Sports Direct, has been taking an increased interest in Debenhams. Debenhams secures cash lifeline Ashley votes Debenhams bosses off board Ashley: Debenhams snubbed my Â£40m lifeline Sports Direct already owns 29% of the shares in the department store chain. It did offer a further investment of Â£40m, which Debenhams rejected. In February, Debenhams came to an agreement with its lenders which secured it a cash injection of Â£40m. The extra money extended the retailer's Â£520m borrowing facilities with banks for 12 months and enabled it to continue talks about a longer-term refinancing. In a statement, Debenhams said it had received notice from Sports Direct ""proposing changes to the board"". ""The board has been engaging with Sports Direct and our other stakeholders and is disappointed that Sports Direct has taken this action. ""In the meantime, we remain focused on delivering the restructuring of our balance sheet, and our discussions are well advanced."" Last year, rival department store chain House of Fraser fell into administration before Mr Ashley bought its assets for Â£90m.

"This video can not be played Penny Jones: 'Nobody ever told us he was trained to kill' A couple who fostered the Parsons Green bomber are suing Surrey County Council for negligence, after not being told he had been ""trained to kill"" by the Islamic State group. Ron and Penny Jones fostered Ahmed Hassan, whose homemade bomb injured 51 people on a London Tube train in 2017. The couple, who have looked after nearly 270 children, have not been allowed to foster any more children and say their lives are ""empty"". The council is defending the claim. Hassan, an Iraqi asylum seeker,was jailed for life aged 18 last yearfor the Parsons Green attack, which he said he carried out after contacting Islamic State militants. Tube bomber has appeal bid rejected Parsons Green Tube bomber failings revealed Tube bomber's foster mum 'felt betrayed' He had made the bomb at the kitchen table in his foster home, while his foster parents Mr and Mrs Jones were away on holiday. Mr and Mrs Jones have been foster carers for 40 years and received MBEs from the Queen in 2010. Surrey County Council - which placed Hassan with Mr and Mrs Jones - did not tell the couple that in a January 2016 immigration interview, Hassan had told officials he had been ""trained to kill"" by the Islamic State group. That information was not mentioned in the risk assessment prepared prior to the foster placement. Nine years ago, Ron and Penny Jones were given awards for their services to children The couple only found out during Hassan's trial and were horrified. Mr and Mrs Jones had raised concerns about Hassan with the council. They reported that he had been taking calls in the middle of the night and had multiple phones. Last June, a review into the handling of Hassanrevealed a series of errorsby Surrey County Council and the police. Following Hassan's trial, Surrey County Council stopped the couple from fostering. Now the Joneses are taking unprecedented legal action against it. Prosecutors said Hassan's actions were ""an act of anger and hatred"" Penny Jones told the BBC: ""How was it our fault they put him here, they didn't tell us the truth, they should have been honest with us to start with."" ""We've lost everything, we've lost our income, we've lost our will to get up in the morning, because our life has revolved around children for over 40 years. Our life is empty."" She said she hopes that the legal action - which is being crowdfunded - will ensure that other foster carers do not suffer as they have. ""I don't want anyone else to go through what we've gone through,"" said Mrs Jones. ""We need social services to be open and honest, and to tell you the truth. ""If you've got a trained killer, you need to know you've got that trained killer."" On 15 September 2017, horror descended on a London Tube train. A partially detonated bomb sent a fireball down a carriage, burning morning commuters who stampeded to escape. A total of 23 people suffered burn injuries and 28 received crush injuries as they fled from the train and station. The bomber was 18-year-old Ahmed Hassan. Hassan placed his bomb in the carriage and left the train Prosecutors at the sentencing hearing said there would have been ""serious harm, if not fatality"" if the bomb - packed with 2kg of screwdrivers, knives, nuts and bolts - had fully detonated. The judge branded Hassan ""dangerous and devious"". Mr and Mrs Jones have both suffered health problems as a result of their time with Hassan, the bombing, and the criminal trial. Mr Jones has been diagnosed with angina and suffers night terrors recalling the bomb made on the kitchen table, and what might have happened if Hassan had turned on them. ""I still get dreams about what might have happened, but to think he had enough to blow this place to pieces..."" said Mr Jones. ""If we had known he was a trained killer he wouldn't have got over the doorstep."" Ahmed Hassan had been in the UK for almost two years when he planted the bomb In legal papers seen exclusively by the BBC, Ron and Penny Jones are claiming negligence and breach of their human rights against Surrey County Council. The papers state: ""In breach of this duty of care, your client failed to disclose that Ahmed Hassan had been and/or had said that he had been 'trained to kill' by ISIS and falsely represented that Ahmed Hassan was simply a very vulnerable young person who had been deeply traumatised by his experience in Iraq and was suffering from mental health problems as a consequence of those experiences."" The papers go on to say that, but for the breaches of duty, ""Mr and Mrs Jones would not have agreed to become Ahmed Hassan's foster carers."" The case has garnered support from other foster carers, who on Wednesday staged a protest outside Surrey County Council's County Hall in Kingston Upon Thames, demanding justice for the couple. A petition with 2,500 signatures was handed in to the director of children's services, Dave Hill. When the demonstrators entered the building, Penny Jones was asked to leave. Sarah Anderson, chair of the Foster Care Workers Union, believes the treatment of the Joneses by Surrey is indicative of a wider problem. ""Penny and Ron were literally thrown on the scrap heap due to Surrey's failings,"" she said. ""We are kind of disposable, we live in the most precarious of circumstances where we are not classed as workers, though we actually are. We have no rights whatsoever, and this just shows how disposable we are."" In a statement, a spokesman for Surrey County Council said: ""We are defending this claim however we acknowledge this has been a very difficult time for Mr and Mrs Jones and their family. ""We place a high value on openness with all our foster carers, share information about any risks with them from the outset and continue to keep them informed. ""This was our approach with Mr and Mrs Jones."" Jocelyn Cockburn, a specialist civil liberties solicitor from Hodge Jones & Allen, who represents Penny and Ron, said: ""Surrey Council owed Penny and Ron a duty to disclose key information about the danger Ahmed posed, and to ensure any information given was accurate, before asking them to invite him into their home. ""Instead he was presented merely as a troubled young person. This is a clear failing by the Council and gives rise to claims in negligence and under the Human Rights Act"".

Jodie Chesney was knifed in the back while playing music with friends in the east London park on Friday. Police now believe ""up to four"" attackers were involved, havingpreviously been searching for two men. Jodie's father Peter said: ""Someone knows who did this. Jodie needs justice."" A 20-year-old man arrested in Leicester on Tuesday on suspicion of Jodie's murder remains in custody. A magistrate earlier granted police an extension to the custody time limit. At Scotland Yard on Thursday, Mr Chesney said whoever had killed his daughter was ""horrendous"", and urged anyone with information about the attack to come forward. ""Someone knows who it is,"" he said. ""You can't get kudos for stabbing a 17-year-old in the back. ""So, just dob them in, grass them up, this is not all right."" Jodie Chesney was the fifth teenager to be stabbed to death in London this year Mr Chesney said his daughter had lost ""so much blood"" in the ""ferocious attack"" and that clearly ""someone meant to murder her"". Jodie was with friends near a children's playground in Harold Hill when she was stabbed in a seemingly motiveless attack. She was pronounced dead just over an hour after officers were called to the park in Romford, east London, at about 21:25 GMT. Asked what Jodie was like, Mr Chesney said she was a ""proud geek"" and a ""great girl"". He said the fibre of her being was ""just about being good and kind. There was nothing bad in her body"". Jodie's father Peter, her stepmother Joanne and sister Lucy have appealed for information Mr Chesney said Jodie's death had torn the family apart and that they were ""a mess"", adding: ""We don't know how to deal with it. ""Everyone is suffering because she was so good. Everyone just can't believe - why her? ""It is not that one life deserves to be killed over another, but specifically her, she was so kind."" Fight knife crime from force funds - Hammond London killings: All the victims of 2018 Can knife crime be stopped before it starts? Jodie's stepmother Joanne said the teenager was ""very dry"" and ""did not have a filter"" - always speaking her mind whether someone wanted to hear it or not. Mr Chesney was wearing a purple ribbon made by Jodie's friends. He said her peers were dyeing their hair purple in her honour as it was her favourite colour. People have been laying flowers near the entrance to the park where Jodie was murdered Jodie was the fifth teenager to be stabbed to death in the capital so far this year. Det Ch Insp Dave Whellams, who has been an officer for more than 30 years, said Jodie's killing was ""one of the worst I have come across"" because it was ""completely motiveless"". He added: ""I think day by day as the investigation progresses we get closer and closer to the truth, and closer to identifying who they are. ""I believe there's more than two of them involved, possibly up to four, and that one of them is black and one of them is white.""

"Bethan Colebourn was found dead at the family home in October 2017 A mother drowned her three-year-old daughter in a bath a month after separating from her husband, whom she believed was having an affair, a court has heard. Bethan Colebourn was found dead at the family home in Fordingbridge, Hampshire, in October 2017. Claire Colebourn, 36, had searched for websites about suicide and drowning before the death, Winchester Crown Court heard. She denies murder. Kerry Maylin, prosecuting, said Bethan was found lying on a wet bed at her home in Whitsbury Road on 19 October. Paramedics were unable to revive her. Ms Maylin said the cause of death was not certain but was ""very likely to be immersion in water"", according to a pathologist. ""Bethan had been put in the bath at home and held under the water,"" Ms Maylin told the jury. ""That act was completed by her mother."" Bethan died in hospital after being found at the family home in Whitsbury Road Ms Maylin said the defendant had an ""unfounded"" belief that her husband Michael, a company chief executive, was having an affair with his financial director at their marine interiors firm Trimline. She met the firm's chairman to express her concerns and told friends. The court was told of a Facebook post in which Ms Colebourn wrote: ""Michael walked out on his family on 7 September and we haven't seen him since. ""He has been having an affair with his financial director at work. Everything has been pre-planned. ""They are aiming to conquer the business and set up a new life together."" Ms Colebourn also changed her wi-fi password because she thought her husband was monitoring her over the internet, the jury heard. The court was told Ms Colebourn was suffering from a diabetic episode when Bethan was found. She described to police how she took her daughter to the bathroom after setting an alarm for 03:00, jurors heard. Ms Colebourn told officers: ""She woke up... she put her hands on my cheeks, told me she loved me and said 'I don't want a bath, mummy, I don't want a bath'."" A large police operation began at the home after the discovery of Bethan's body The jury heard she then drowned her daughter, telling police: ""I wanted to fight myself but I couldn't. She didn't fight... She had complete trust in me."" Ms Maylin said the defendant told friends she then tried to kill herself by hanging herself, stabbing herself in the stomach and taking a fatal overdose of insulin. Asked in a police interview why she had killed Bethan, the defendant replied: ""Because I didn't want her to go anywhere near her father."" Jurors heard the girl's body was found by Ms Colebourn's mother, Janet Fildew, who visited at 18:30 on 19 October. The defendant was in another bedroom and was found to have injected herself with 306 units of insulin that day - nearly 10 times her normal dose, the prosecutor said. In hospital, Ms Colebourn wrote a letter to a relative saying about Bethan: ""In my eyes, I saved her"", the court heard. Asked about the comment in a police interview, she replied: ""I can't be a liar... I'm going to have to go against legal advice. ""Bethan drowned because I was there. I held her under the water."" Giving evidence, Mr Colebourn said his wife had filed for divorce, claiming he was not interested in bringing up Bethan, which he was ""not happy with"". He described how he had met his wife at university in 2001 but said their relationship deteriorated quickly after Bethan's birth and he decided to leave in September 2017. ""The relationship wasn't working, there was a realisation that the best for both parties and for Bethan was to separate,"" he said. He told the court his wife had reluctantly allowed him to see their daughter alone a week before she died. Mr Colebourn said when he had returned his daughter ""she kissed me and hugged me and went in, she was fine, she was happy"". He told the court Mrs Colebourn became ""obsessed"" with his ex-partner who was his Facebook friend, causing him to close down his account. In cross-examination Mr Colebourn accepted his wife was ""devoted"" to their daughter. The trial continues.

"This video can not be played Karen Bradley says she's ""devastated"" to think she made pain worse for Troubles victims' families Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley has said she is determined to deliver for families hurt by comments she made about the Troubles. She said on Wednesday thatdeaths caused by the security forces in Northern Ireland were ""not crimes"". Speaking to the BBC's The View programme on Thursday, Mrs Bradley said she had ""said the wrong thing"". When asked about whether she would resign, she said she was determined to deliver for people in Northern Ireland. Is Northern Ireland secretary running out of road? Bradley 'did not understand' NI voting patterns ""What I do want to do now is make sure I deliver for those families, from all parts of the community, who have been so deeply affected by the Troubles,"" said Mrs Bradley. ""I know how raw that pain is and I'm devastated to think that I have made it worse."" There were no excuses for what she said in the House of Commons on Wednesday, she said, adding: ""It's not what I think, it's not what I mean."" ""I said something in response to an oral question and as soon as I realised what I had said I corrected the record. ""I am determined that those families who have been hurt by what I said will see justice."" This video can not be played 'They were people acting under orders' - Bradley Mrs Bradley has faced considerable criticism for the remarks she made on Wednesday. The Police Service of Northern Ireland's (PSNI) chief constable said on Thursday that a soldier or police officer should be investigated if they shot someone. ""Where people have lost their lives we should all be equal under the law,"" added George Hamilton. ""There should be a thorough and effective investigation."" Speaking at a high-profile Troubles-related inquest in Belfast, the leading barrister Michael Mansfield QC said Mrs Bradley had made ""entirely inappropriate observations"" on Wednesday. This video can not be played Simon Coveney: The comments have come at time of 'real sensitivity' The inquest is examining 10 people's deaths at Ballymurphy in August 1971, which followed three days of gunfire in west Belfast after the introduction of internment. Mr Mansfield is representing some of the victims' families and previously participated in the Bloody Sunday and Hillsborough inquiries and the Birmingham Six case. He told the coroner that Mrs Bradley clearly had ""no regard whatsoever for these proceedings"". After almost 24 hours of facing pressure to say sorry, Karen Bradley's statement may be too little, too late for some. Although she has acknowledged that her language was wrong, she will still face questions as to why she ever made the remark in the first place. Number 10 says it has full confidence in her as Northern Ireland secretary, who is a Theresa May loyalist. It is also unlikely she will face pressure in London to step down. The prime minister can hardly afford to lose another cabinet minister when she is in the throes of the last Brexit act. But some politicians and victims' campaigners in Belfast and Dublin have said Mrs Bradley's apology does not cut it. The TÃ¡naiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Simon Coveney welcomed Mrs Bradley's apology and said he thought she recognised ""the seriousness of the statement made yesterday"". ""I made it perfectly clear to the secretary of state last night that I believed her statement was wrong, that it was ill-advised and that it would cause deep offence to many people."" Lord Dannatt, the former head of the Army, said Mrs Bradley should consider apologising over the comments but should not quit her role. Lord Dannatt is a former head of the Army ""It would not be unreasonable for her to offer an apology,"" he said. ""I think it's unnecessary for her to resign - there's enough confusion in our political world at the present moment."" Attorney General Geoffrey Cox defended the Northern Ireland secretary, telling the Commons that he ""believed firmly"" that she had not intended any offence. The shadow Northern Ireland secretary Tony Lloyd called on Mrs Bradley to outline what the government ""plans to do around legacy cases in Northern Ireland"". Ulster Unionist MLA and former Army officer Doug Beattie said that politicians must be mindful about what they say about Troubles legacy issues. Politics had arrived at a ""major tipping point"", he added, and Mrs Bradley ""should have been alive"" to the fact thatan announcement is due to be made on whether or not former soldiers should be prosecuted in relation to Bloody Sunday. ""She has clearly put her foot in her mouth... and I think she knows that,"" he added. Mr Beattie said Mrs Bradley should apologise to the families of those who died on Bloody Sunday in Londonderry in January 1972. Thirteen people were killed on Bloody Sunday after troops opened fire, and another died of his injuries some months later. This video can not be played 'Her place now is untenable' But Mr Beattie differentiated those events from the SAS killings of eight IRA men who were preparing to bomb a police station in Loughgall, County Armagh, in 1987. ""If you take the likes of Loughgall, that was force on force and was absolutely right,"" he added. ""Bloody Sunday was not and if there is evidence against those people who killed those innocent civilians then the law must be seen to run its course."" Victims' families have called for Mrs Bradley to resign. John Kelly, whose teenage brother Michael was killed on Bloody Sunday, described her remarks as ""outrageous"". John Teggart,whose father was killed in the 1971 Ballymurphy shootings, also said she should quit.

"After it rains the surface darkens, which speeds up melting Rain is becoming more frequent in Greenland and accelerating the melting of its ice, a new study has found. Scientists say they're ""surprised"" to discover rain falling even during the long Arctic winter. The massive Greenland ice-sheet is being watched closely because it holds a huge store of frozen water. And if all of that ice melted, the sea level would rise by seven metres, threatening coastal population centres around the world. Precipitation usually falls as snow in winter - rather than as rain - which can balance out any melting of the ice in the summer. The scientists studied satellite pictures of the ice-sheet which reveal the areas where melting is taking place. And they combined those images with data gathered from 20 automated weather stations that recorded when rainfall occurred. The findings, published in the journal The Cryosphere, show that while there were about two spells of winter rain every year in the early phase of the study period, that had risen to 12 spells by 2012. On more than 300 occasions between 1979-2012, the analysis found that rainfall events were triggering a melting of the ice. Most of these were in summertime, when the air often gets above zero. But a growing number happened in winter months when the permanent dark of the polar winter would be expected to keep temperatures well below freezing. The ice after rain in the Kangerlussuaq region, Greenland The lead author of the study, Dr Marilena Oltmanns of the GEOMAR ocean research centre in Germany, told BBC News: ""We were surprised that there was rain in the winter. ""It does make sense because we're seeing flows of warm air coming up from the South, but it's still surprising to see that associated with rainfall."" Another scientist on the study, Prof Marco Tedesco of Columbia University in New York, said that the increase in rain had important implications. Even if it falls during winter, and then quickly refreezes, the rain changes the characteristics of the surface, leaving it smoother and darker, and ""pre-conditioned"" to melt more rapidly when summer arrives. The darker the ice is, the more heat it absorbs from the Sun - causing it to melt more quickly. ""This opens a door to a world that is extremely important to explore,"" Prof Tedesco said. ""The potential impact of changes taking place in the winter and spring on what happens in summer needs to be understood."" A smoother surface, particularly a ""lens"" of ice, will allow meltwater to flow over it much faster and being darker means that more of the Sun's rays are absorbed, further speeding-up the warming process. Pictures taken by a British research team, caught in a rainstorm on the ice-sheet last year, show how a bright highly reflective landscape of snow and ice was turned into a much darker scene. Although Greenland is extremely remote, a vast island lying at the northern end of the Atlantic Ocean, the sheer volume of ice covering it means its fate could have global repercussions. The Greenland ice sheet in rainy conditions in 2014 In stable times, snowfall in winter will balance any ice melted or breaking off into the ocean in summer. But research has shown how in recent decades the ice-sheet has been losing vast amounts of mass. Although this contributes only a relatively small amount to the rise in the sea-level - with much of the rest coming from thermal expansion as the oceans warm - the fear is that the flow of meltwater could accelerate as temperatures rise. Two years ago, the BBCreported from Greenland on the risks of faster melting, because of the growth of algae which makes the ice darker and more likely to warm. This effect of algae is, in addition to darkening, caused by soot and other forms of pollution carried by winds to the Arctic. This comes amid growing concern that the region as a whole is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet, which may be influencing the flow of the high-altitude jet stream. That could disturb weather patterns in Europe and other regions, and may also explain how the flows of warm, moist air from the Atlantic are reaching Greenland, even in winter. Prof Jason Box, a glaciologist not involved in the new study, says the research builds on earlier work by him and colleagues published in 2015 that found that summer rainfall could increase the rate of melting. Their analysis found that because water has a high heat content, it takes only 14mm of rain to melt 15cm of snow, even if that snow is at a temperature of minus 15C. ""There's a simple threshold, the melting point, and when the temperature goes above that you get rain instead of snow,"" he said. ""So, in a warming climate it's not rocket science that you're going to have more rain than snow, and it's one more reason why the ice sheet can go into deficit instead of being in surplus."" Prof Box has himself experienced sudden rainstorms while camped on the ice-sheet. ""After weeks of sunshine, it started raining on us and it completely transformed the surface - it got darker. ""And I became convinced - only by being there and seeing it with my own eyes - that rain is just as important as strong sunny days in melting the Greenland ice sheet.""

"This video can not be played Penny Jones: 'Nobody ever told us he was trained to kill' A couple who fostered the Parsons Green bomber are suing Surrey County Council for negligence, after not being told he had been ""trained to kill"" by the Islamic State group. Ron and Penny Jones fostered Ahmed Hassan, whose homemade bomb injured 51 people on a London Tube train in 2017. The couple, who have looked after nearly 270 children, have not been allowed to foster any more children and say their lives are ""empty"". The council is defending the claim. Hassan, an Iraqi asylum seeker,was jailed for life aged 18 last yearfor the Parsons Green attack, which he said he carried out after contacting Islamic State militants. Tube bomber has appeal bid rejected Parsons Green Tube bomber failings revealed Tube bomber's foster mum 'felt betrayed' He had made the bomb at the kitchen table in his foster home, while his foster parents Mr and Mrs Jones were away on holiday. Mr and Mrs Jones have been foster carers for 40 years and received MBEs from the Queen in 2010. Surrey County Council - which placed Hassan with Mr and Mrs Jones - did not tell the couple that in a January 2016 immigration interview, Hassan had told officials he had been ""trained to kill"" by the Islamic State group. That information was not mentioned in the risk assessment prepared prior to the foster placement. Nine years ago, Ron and Penny Jones were given awards for their services to children The couple only found out during Hassan's trial and were horrified. Mr and Mrs Jones had raised concerns about Hassan with the council. They reported that he had been taking calls in the middle of the night and had multiple phones. Last June, a review into the handling of Hassanrevealed a series of errorsby Surrey County Council and the police. Following Hassan's trial, Surrey County Council stopped the couple from fostering. Now the Joneses are taking unprecedented legal action against it. Prosecutors said Hassan's actions were ""an act of anger and hatred"" Penny Jones told the BBC: ""How was it our fault they put him here, they didn't tell us the truth, they should have been honest with us to start with."" ""We've lost everything, we've lost our income, we've lost our will to get up in the morning, because our life has revolved around children for over 40 years. Our life is empty."" She said she hopes that the legal action - which is being crowdfunded - will ensure that other foster carers do not suffer as they have. ""I don't want anyone else to go through what we've gone through,"" said Mrs Jones. ""We need social services to be open and honest, and to tell you the truth. ""If you've got a trained killer, you need to know you've got that trained killer."" On 15 September 2017, horror descended on a London Tube train. A partially detonated bomb sent a fireball down a carriage, burning morning commuters who stampeded to escape. A total of 23 people suffered burn injuries and 28 received crush injuries as they fled from the train and station. The bomber was 18-year-old Ahmed Hassan. Hassan placed his bomb in the carriage and left the train Prosecutors at the sentencing hearing said there would have been ""serious harm, if not fatality"" if the bomb - packed with 2kg of screwdrivers, knives, nuts and bolts - had fully detonated. The judge branded Hassan ""dangerous and devious"". Mr and Mrs Jones have both suffered health problems as a result of their time with Hassan, the bombing, and the criminal trial. Mr Jones has been diagnosed with angina and suffers night terrors recalling the bomb made on the kitchen table, and what might have happened if Hassan had turned on them. ""I still get dreams about what might have happened, but to think he had enough to blow this place to pieces..."" said Mr Jones. ""If we had known he was a trained killer he wouldn't have got over the doorstep."" Ahmed Hassan had been in the UK for almost two years when he planted the bomb In legal papers seen exclusively by the BBC, Ron and Penny Jones are claiming negligence and breach of their human rights against Surrey County Council. The papers state: ""In breach of this duty of care, your client failed to disclose that Ahmed Hassan had been and/or had said that he had been 'trained to kill' by ISIS and falsely represented that Ahmed Hassan was simply a very vulnerable young person who had been deeply traumatised by his experience in Iraq and was suffering from mental health problems as a consequence of those experiences."" The papers go on to say that, but for the breaches of duty, ""Mr and Mrs Jones would not have agreed to become Ahmed Hassan's foster carers."" The case has garnered support from other foster carers, who on Wednesday staged a protest outside Surrey County Council's County Hall in Kingston Upon Thames, demanding justice for the couple. A petition with 2,500 signatures was handed in to the director of children's services, Dave Hill. When the demonstrators entered the building, Penny Jones was asked to leave. Sarah Anderson, chair of the Foster Care Workers Union, believes the treatment of the Joneses by Surrey is indicative of a wider problem. ""Penny and Ron were literally thrown on the scrap heap due to Surrey's failings,"" she said. ""We are kind of disposable, we live in the most precarious of circumstances where we are not classed as workers, though we actually are. We have no rights whatsoever, and this just shows how disposable we are."" In a statement, a spokesman for Surrey County Council said: ""We are defending this claim however we acknowledge this has been a very difficult time for Mr and Mrs Jones and their family. ""We place a high value on openness with all our foster carers, share information about any risks with them from the outset and continue to keep them informed. ""This was our approach with Mr and Mrs Jones."" Jocelyn Cockburn, a specialist civil liberties solicitor from Hodge Jones & Allen, who represents Penny and Ron, said: ""Surrey Council owed Penny and Ron a duty to disclose key information about the danger Ahmed posed, and to ensure any information given was accurate, before asking them to invite him into their home. ""Instead he was presented merely as a troubled young person. This is a clear failing by the Council and gives rise to claims in negligence and under the Human Rights Act"".

"A crime scene remains in place on Lanfrey Place, in West Kensington A teenager has been stabbed to death in west London. The male, aged in his late teens, was found with multiple stab wounds to the chest at 14:14 GMT on Lanfrey Place, West Kensington. He received treatment from London's Air Ambulance but died a short time later, police said. A crime scene remains in place and no arrests have been made. A Section 60 stop and search order is in place until 04:00 on Friday in north Westminster. The fatal stabbing in Fulham comes on the same day a man died of wounds he suffered during a knife attack in central London on Sunday. Meanwhile, Chancellor Philip Hammond has called on police forces in England and Walesto use their existing budgets to tackle knife crime. Senior officers had asked for more money to pay for extra officers after a spate of fatal stabbings but Mr Hammond said forces must use money and staff from other parts of their set-up to deal with the problem. The first stabbing happened in Romily Street in Soho on Sunday Sunday's victim, an unnamed 37-year-old, was found suffering from stab injuries at about 06.00 on Romilly Street, Soho. He died in hospital on Wednesday evening. His next of kin have been informed but formal identification awaits.

"This video can not be played Geoffrey Cox is keen to ensure that what was in ""Cox's Codpiece"" is ""in full working order"". The UK's attorney general says Brexit negotiations will continue as EU officials call for ""acceptable"" ideas by Friday to break the impasse. Geoffrey Cox said plans to solve the deadlock over the Irish backstop were ""as clear as day"", with just days until MPs vote on the Brexit deal. Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom confirmed the vote will be held on 12 March. Chancellor Philip Hammond has warned Brexiteers to vote for the deal or face delay to the UK's exit from the EU. The backstop is an insurance policy designed to prevent physical checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. No breakthrough in Brexit talks, says EU Brexit: A really simple guide Mr Cox, who was in Brussels on Tuesday to push for further changes to the Brexit deal, said talks will ""almost certainly"" continue through the weekend. He said there had been ""careful discussions"" with the EU and stressed it was government policy to seek the legal changes to the backstop. ""We are discussing text with the European Union,"" he said. ""I am surprised to hear the comments that have emerged over the last 48 hours that the proposals are not clear; they are as clear as day, and we are continuing to discuss them."" This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Earlier Mr Hammond refused to be drawn on how he would vote if Mrs May's deal is defeated. ""If the prime minister's deal does not get approved on Tuesday then it is likely that the House of Commons will vote to extend the Article 50 procedure, to not leave the European Union without a deal, and where we go thereafter is highly uncertain,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""For those people who are passionate about ensuring that we leave the European Union on time it surely must be something that they need to think very, very carefully about now because they run the risk of us moving away from their preferred course of action if we don't get this deal through."" In the Commons, Mr Cox also noted that his proposals to change the backstop had been referred to in some quarters as ""Cox's codpiece"" - using a term to describe a pouch attached to a man's breeches worn in the 15th and 16th Century. ""What I am concerned to ensure is that what's inside the codpiece is in full working order,"" he quipped. But Brexiteer Mark Francois, who is a member of the Eurosceptic group of Conservative MPs, the ERG, said Mr Cox had taken charge of the negotiations and would ""effectively be examining his own codpiece in the Commons"". He questioned how Mr Cox could provide objective advice when he was ""in effect marking his own homework"". Mr Cox replied that ""the law is the law"", and that he will judge documents relating to the backstop ""entirely and impartially"". What we heard from the chancellor this morning was that he was clear about the uncertainties ahead - and rather unclear (cagey, in fact) about how he might vote when it came to decision-time about a no-deal. There was an explicit warning to Brexiteers: vote for the prime minister's deal because otherwise, it's delay and a soft Brexit. As one minister expressed to me yesterday, they believe the vote does have a chance of getting through because Brexiteers will realise - just in time - that it's either the PM's deal next week, or what this minister described as ""soft, softer, then meltdown"". But across government, the mood is not optimistic about what's going to happen next week and most ministers are expecting a defeat. French Europe minister Nathalie Loiseau reiterated the EU's position that the withdrawal agreement cannot be reopened and said the deal was the ""best possible solution"" with the controversial Irish backstop a ""last resort solution"". She said: ""We don't like the backstop, we don't want to have to implement it, and if we have to, we don't want to stay in the backstop. ""We all agree that it should be temporary."" Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Meanwhile, former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown has told the BBC he is calling for the UK to seek an extension to the Article 50 process, under which the UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March. Mr Brown suggested a year-long extension would allow further consultation with the British people. Any extension would require the unanimous agreement of the EU. He suggested citizens' assemblies could be used - as they were in Ireland ahead of a referendum on abortion - to consult people further on the issues in the absence of any clear majority for a way forward. ""Parliament has proved itself incapable of solving this problem,"" he said. ""I respect the job that legislators try to do but the country is fed up that Parliament hasn't found an answer. I think the only way that we can get unity in this country is by involving the people in trying to find the solution."" In the Commons, Andrea Leadsom said in the ""deeply regrettable case"" that the deal is rejected, she will make another statement on Tuesday, to allocate time for the promised votes on leaving without a deal or deferring the UK's exit from the EU beyond the scheduled date of 29 March. Mrs May is pinning her hopes on getting changes to the backstop that will prevent the UK from being tied to EU customs rules if no permanent trade deal is agreed after Brexit. Critics say that - if the backstop were used - it would keep the UK tied to the EU indefinitely. Conservative backbencher Theresa Villiers, a Brexiteer who voted against the withdrawal deal in January, told BBC Radio 4's World at One: ""As things look at the moment, I don't see that there is a new revised deal coming back from the European Union which implements significant enough changes to the draft withdrawal agreement to change the result [of the Commons vote on the deal]."" Negotiations between British ministers and the EU officials over the past 24 hours have been described as ""difficult"", with the EU insisting there has been no breakthrough. Diplomats from the 28 member states were told on Wednesday that Mrs May could meet European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Monday if progress was made. But the BBC's Europe reporter Adam Fleming said talk of a deadline for new proposals and a weekend of negotiations was ""a notional timetable"" and that more flexibility could be possible.

"This video can not be played PM Theresa May: ""Now is the moment for us to act"" Theresa May has asked the EU for ""one more push"" to get her Brexit deal through Parliament and warned that, if it fails, ""we may never leave at all"". The prime minister said the UK had tabled ""serious"" proposals to resolve the deadlock over the Irish backstop. Warning of a ""moment of crisis"" if the deal was rejected again, the PM told EU leaders: ""Let's get it done."" The EU said it would give ""legal force"" to assurances already made that the UK could not be stuck in a customs union. Setting out the EU's position on Twitter, chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said it was ""not interested in the blame game"" and talks would continue over the weekend. Allow Twitter content?

The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said what the EU was offering amounted to a ""legal beefing-up of existing promises"". Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay and the DUP, the party Mrs May's government relies on for a majority in Parliament, were both dismissive of Mr Barnier's proposal. Mr Barclaytweeted,external: ""With a very real deadline looming, now is not the time to rerun old arguments. The UK has put forward clear new proposals. We now need to agree a balanced solution that can work for both sides"" While Nigel Dodds, the deputy leader of the DUP, said Mr Barnier's proposal regarding the backstop ""disrespects the constitutional and economic integrity"" of the UK, and it was neither ""realistic nor sensible"". He said the EU's proposal ""demonstrates that they have a one-sided approach and a lack of understanding about the divisions in Northern Ireland"". The UK is due to leave on 29 March, although Parliament has yet to agree the terms of withdrawal. Big Brexit vote: What do I need to know? Deadline looms as UK pushes for Brexit deal No breakthrough in Brexit talks, says EU MPs will vote for a second time on the withdrawal deal Mrs May has negotiated with the EU on Tuesday - after it wasdefeated by a historic marginin a Commons vote in January. If they reject it again, they will get the option of either leaving without a deal or delaying the exit date. In a speech to a green energy firm in Lincolnshire, Mrs May said she understood the ""genuine concerns"" about the backstop but appealed to MPs to recognise that the deal as a whole respected the 2016 referendum result and would ensure the UK's long-term prosperity. ""Back it and the UK will leave the EU,"" she said. ""Reject it and no-one knows what will happen. We may not leave the EU for many months. We may leave without the protections a deal provides, we may never leave at all."" It was in neither side's interest to prolong the uncertainty by ""carry on arguing"" about Brexit, she said, claiming any delay beyond 29 March only risked ""creating new problems"". ""It needs one more push to address the specific concerns of our Parliament,"" she said. ""So let's not hold back and do what is necessary for MPs to back the deal. ""Because if MPs reject the deal, nothing is certain. It would be at a moment of crisis."" She suggested the British people, to whom Brexit ""belonged"", had ""moved on"" and ""are ready for this to be settled"", adding: ""Everyone now wants to get it done."" But former Conservative minister Dominic Grieve, who backs a referendum to endorse the terms of Brexit, said it was ""hard to see"" how Parliament would agree to the current deal. Speaking at the Scottish Labour conference, party leader Jeremy Corbyn said the prime minister sounded ""desperate"" in her speech. ""If she cannot get her botched Brexit deal through Parliament next week, it will represent an unprecedented failure in British political history. ""The utter mess the government has made of the Brexit negotiations, and their reckless abandon when it comes to people's jobs and livelihoods, is absolutely unforgiveable. ""Having already failed once to get her deal through, I want to make it clear to the PM that if she fails again, it will be the end of the road for her deal."" The SNP said the deal on offer was ""fundamentally flawed"" and would damage the Scottish economy. ""Theresa May must stop passing the buck and take personal responsibility for the Brexit crisis created as a result of her own intransigence,"" said its Westminster leader Ian Blackford. Thefirst Commons vote, in January, saw the deal rejected by 432 votes to 202, the largest defeat for a sitting government in history. Mrs May is seeking legally enforceable changes to the backstop - a controversial insurance policy designed to prevent physical checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland - but there have been few visible signs of progress. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Leading Brexiteers are looking for reassurances that the backstop - which would see the UK aligned with EU customs rules until the two sides' future relationship is agreed or alternative arrangements worked out - will not endure indefinitely. On Friday the EU said it was prepared to include a number of existing commitments relating to the application of the backstop in a legally-binding document. Michel Barnier tweeted that the UK ""will not be forced into [a] customs union against its will"" as it could choose to exit the proposed ""single customs territory"" on its own. But Northern Ireland would remain part of the EU's customs territory, subject to many of its rules and regulations - something the government has previously said would threaten the constitutional integrity of the UK. There will also be a reminder that the UK can suspend parts of the backstop if an independent arbitration panel rules that the EU is not behaving in good faith. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said it was ""not really a concession"" as the suggestion that Great Britain could leave the backstop - and become free to diverge from EU rules - while leaving Northern Ireland behind, had already been rejected. Any extension to the Article 50 process, under which the UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March, would need the unanimous approval of the EU. Two former prime ministers, Sir John Major and Gordon Brown, have called for a delay of a year to allow for a ""public consultation"" on the way ahead and to ensure an orderly exit. But Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson warned against any delay, tellingNick Robinson's Political Thinking podcast: ""Wherever we are, and I very much hope we land it with a deal, but if we don't get a deal and we exit without a deal, Britain will succeed and thrive - I don't have a moment's doubt about that. ""But we need to deliver Brexit and ensure that's it's done. I personally believe 29th March is the best day for making sure that is delivered upon.""

"This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt: ""I am sure that that is what Theresa May will tell Nicola Sturgeon if she makes that request."" A senior UK government minister has said it would ""of course"" refuse to give permission for a second independence referendum. Speaking during a visit to Glasgow, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the answer to any request for another vote would be ""no"". First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in January she would give an update on her plans for a referendum ""in weeks"". But she has stressed that she will not hold a referendum without an agreement. The UK and Scottish governmentssigned an agreement in October 2012,externalwhich allowed the Scottish Parliament to legislate for the independence referendum to be held two years later. Ms Sturgeon told BBC Scotland on Thursday afternoon that she was ""not open to the possibility"" of another referendum being held without a similar agreement in place. UK 'will reject Sturgeon's Indyref2 calls' Indyref2 update 'even if Brexit delayed' There have been calls from some within the independence movement for an unofficial referendum to be held, similar to the one in Catalonia in 2017, if the UK government's position does not change. But Ms Sturgeon said: ""My view is clear and always has been clear. The legal basis of any future independence referendum should be the same as the referendum in 2014, which is the transfer of power under a section 30 order. ""Of course the only reason we're talking about this is because of the anti-democratic stance of the Conservatives, who I think are running so scared of the will of the Scottish people on independence. ""They refuse to acknowledge the democratic mandate that the Scottish government has."" This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: ""The legal basis for the next independence referendum should be the same as the basis for the last."" She was speaking after video footage emerged on the Broadcasting Scotland channel on Youtube of SNP deputy leader Keith Brown telling activists in Aberdeen last month that: ""If we want to have a referendum, then we decide we're going to have a referendum"". The Scottish Conservatives claimed it proves the SNP is ""planning for an illegal referendum"" - but Mr Brown said his comments had been misinterpreted. In a statement, he said: ""My position is clear - the deeply undemocratic stance of the UK government in denying the mandate for indyref and refusing a Section 30 order should not prevent the Scottish government seeking one and planning on the basis of winning that case."" A video of Mr Brown addressing independence activists in Aberdeen has been uploaded to Youtube Several sources told the BBC last monththat the UK government was preparing to reject any call from the Scottish government for the power to hold another referendum. Mr Hunt confirmed this was the case as he was asked by journalists during a visit to Glasgow University whether Mrs May's response should be ""yes or no"". The foreign secretary said: ""The answer of course would be no for the very simple reason that we think the Scottish government should be focusing on the concerns of Scottish voters, which is not to have another very divisive independence referendum but to focus on an education system which used to be the envy of the world and standards are now falling, to focus on long waits in the NHS. ""That's what Scottish voters want the Scottish government to focus on and I am sure that that is what Theresa May will tell Nicola Sturgeon if she makes that request."" Ms Sturgeon called for a new independence vote in the aftermath of the EU referendum, which saw 62% of Scottish voters back remain only for the UK as a whole to vote to leave. However, the SNP leader subsequently ""reset"" her timetable after her party lost 21 seats in the snap general election of 2017. Having previously said she must ""wait for the fog of Brexit to clear"" before settling on a new plan, Ms Sturgeon told MSPs on 17 January that she would outline her thoughts on the timing of a second independence referendum within ""weeks"" - even if Brexit was delayed. The SNP say its 2016 Holyrood election manifesto gives them the right to hold another vote. Ms Sturgeon's party won that election, with the manifesto including a commitment that another referendum could be held if there was a significant change in circumstances from 2014 - such as Scotland being taken out of the European Union against the wishes of voters north of the border.

"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her daughter Gabriella, who she saw during a temporary release from prison Jailed British-Iranian woman Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe will be given diplomatic protection by Britain, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said. It means the case will now be treated as a formal, legal dispute between the two states involved - Britain and Iran. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffewas jailed for five yearsin Iran in 2016 after being convicted of spying, which she denies. Mr Hunt said the move was unlikely to be a ""magic wand"" to get her released, but was an ""important diplomatic step"". He said it ""demonstrates to the whole world that Nazanin is innocent"" and signalled to Iran ""that its behaviour is totally wrong"". The Iranian ambassador to London said the decision ""contravenes international law"". Iran refuses to recognise dual nationals so does not recognise Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's right to be represented by Britain. Diplomatic protection is a rare legal procedure in international law. States can use it to help one of their nationals whose rights have been breached in another country. It is very different to diplomatic immunity, which is something given to diplomats to ensure their safe passage and protection from prosecution. What is diplomatic protection? What is the Zaghari-Ratcliffe case about? Iran 'tried to get jailed mum to spy on UK' According to the BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale, her new legal status will not force Iran to change the way it treats her. But it will allow Britain to raise her case with greater ease at international forums such as the United Nations. Mr Hunt told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the decision to grant Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe diplomatic protection ""sends a very strong message"" to Iran. Addressing the republic, he said: ""You may have disagreements with the UK, but at the heart of this is an innocent woman, vulnerable, unwell and scared. She should not be paying the price for whatever disagreements you have with the UK."" Asked if he was prepared to take Iran to international court, sanction it, or summon its ambassador, Mr Hunt said ""all these things are possible, but we would like to solve this in an amicable way"". He added that diplomatic protection had not been granted to a British citizen in 100 years. ""It's difficult to know exactly what the impact will be. But we do want the world to know the UK will not stand by while its citizens are unjustly treated."" Asked about Iran's allegation that the UK had broken international law, Mr Hunt said he ""would expect some sort of negative reaction"" from the country. This video can not be played Why one mother's personal plight is part of a complicated history between Iran and the UK (video published August 2019 and last updated in October 2019) By BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale Now this has been elevated to a formal state-to-state dispute, Britain can look for allies on the international stage to put collective pressure on Tehran. So what British diplomats hope is that this sends a clear signal to Iran that this issue is not going away, that the UK government is determined to keep pushing for Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's release, and that it is prepared to escalate the dispute in the face of Tehran's intransigence. The granting of diplomatic protection will have no immediate impact on Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's conditions in jail in Tehran. But what diplomats hope is that it will focus minds in Tehran, not just in the foreign ministry but also among the hardliners whom officials believe will ultimately decide Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's future. The question now will be how Iran responds. Read more: What will diplomatic protection mean for Nazanin? This video can not be played Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband Richard said the news she will be given diplomatic protection ""changes the stakes"" Richard Ratcliffe, who has been campaigning for his wife's release - and for the UK government to take this step - welcomed the news. He told the Today programme on Friday: ""Until yesterday, it was our problem that the British government was sympathetic with, in solidarity with, trying to help us along the way. ""Now it's also the British government's case and all the injustices that happen to Nazanin are effectively injustices to the British government."" He said he hoped the decision would allow doctors to check on his wife's health, as she had been suffering ""neurological problems"". He last spoke to her on Wednesday, he said, and the prospect of being afforded diplomatic protection meant she was ""a bit more upbeat"". Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who went on hunger strike in January over a lack of medical care, had been ""very low again"" recently, he said. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was detained in Iran when she was visiting her parents with her daughter Human rights organisation Redress, which has been pushing for the UK government to grant diplomatic protection to Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe for more than a year, said Mr Hunt's move was ""hugely significant"" for her and would give her hope for the future. And Liberal Democrat spokeswoman for foreign affairs, Jo Swinson, described Mr Hunt's decision as ""a promising and welcome step in the right direction"". Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 41, was a project manager for the Thomson Reuters Foundation and lived in London when she was arrested in Iran in April 2016. She was later sentenced to five years in prison for allegedly plotting against the Iranian government. She maintains her innocence, and says she was on holiday in Iran taking her daughter Gabriella to visit her parents.

"This video can not be played Corbyn on Brexit: We are looking at all the options Jeremy Corbyn has said he is ""looking at all the options"" to prevent a no-deal Brexit after he met Tory MPs to discuss alternatives to the PM's deal if it rejected again by Parliament. The Labour leader held talks with ex-Tory ministers Nick Boles and Sir Oliver Letwin, who favour a closer, Norway-style relationship with the EU. He said he had discussed the so-called ""Common Market 2.0 option"" but would not commit to backing it at this stage. The UK is due to leave on 29 March. MPs will vote on whether to back Theresa May's Brexit deal on Tuesday. They emphatically rejected the terms of withdrawal negotiated by the prime minister in January. UK urged to offer 'acceptable' Brexit plan Corbyn: We will support Brexit referendum Brexit: A really simple guide If they do so again, they will get to choose between leaving without a negotiated agreement or deferring the UK's exit date by an unspecified period. Conservative MPs have been warned by the chief whip that if they vote down the deal and the negotiations are extended, they risk ending up with a ""softer Brexit"". The Labour leadership wants the UK to remain in a customs union with the EU. Many Labour MPs and some Conservatives back an even closer arrangement with the European Union - dubbed the ""Common Market 2.0"" plan - which would see the UK remain in the EU's single market by staying part of the European Economic Area. Mr Corbyn said he had agreed to meet the Conservative MPs because he was adamantly opposed to a no-deal exit and he wanted to hear ""what their ideas and options are"". ""I am reaching out to all groups in Parliament to try and prevent a no-deal Brexit which I think would be very damaging,"" he said after the meeting. ""We are looking at all the options."" This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. While Labour wanted an agreement encompassing customs union, unhindered access to EU markets and legal protection of workers rights ""what exact form that takes is subject to negotiation"". Asked if he would throw his weight behind the Boles-Letwin plan and oblige Labour MPs to vote for it, he said they were ""quite a long way from that at this stage"". ""We are obviously discussing it but our priority at the moment is preventing a no-deal exit"". In an article for the Mirror newspaper,,externalMr Corbyn said a close economic relationship was ""the best Brexit compromise for both 17 million leave voters and 16 million remain voters"".

"Iranian-British aid worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe denies the charge of plotting against the Iranian government The decision by the British government to give Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe formal diplomatic protection marks a significant escalation in the UK's campaign to secure the release of the British-Iranian dual national who is detained in Tehran. It is an extremely rare diplomatic and legal move that signals the UK is no longer treating the case as a consular matter but a formal, legal dispute between Britain and Iran. It means that the government believes Iran's treatment of Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe - her lack of access to due process and medical treatment - has failed to meet international standards. As such, she should be given the formal protection of the British state. So when British diplomats raise her case with Iranian counterparts in the future, they will no longer be representing just the interests of a UK citizen but also those of the British state. What is the Zaghari-Ratcliffe case about? Iran 'tried to get jailed mum to spy on UK' This theoretically opens up the possibility of Britain taking some kind of international legal action against Iran. This could range from requesting inquiries, demanding negotiations, even suing for compensation for an ""internationally wrongful act"". But Foreign Office sources indicated they were unlikely to go down this route. Few diplomats want the case snarled up in the International Court of Justice for many years. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was detained in Iran when she was visiting her parents with he infant daughter Instead, the assertion of diplomatic protection will give the UK new ways of raising the case of Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe in international forums like the United Nations. Most countries prefer to avoid getting involved in bilateral rows about complicated consular cases. But now this has been elevated to a formal state-to-state dispute, Britain can look for allies on the international stage to put collective pressure on Tehran. So what British diplomats hope is that this sends a clear signal to Iran that this issue is not going away, that the UK government is determined to keep pushing for Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's release, and that it is prepared to escalate the dispute in the face of Tehran's intransigence. The 41-year-old has dual British and Iranian citizenship The granting of diplomatic protection will have no immediate impact on Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's conditions in jail in Tehran. It is not the same as the diplomatic immunity given to envoys and diplomats to ensure their safe passage and protection from prosecution in a foreign land. And the mechanism cannot be used to force Iran to do anything. But what diplomats hope is that it will focus minds in Tehran, not just in the foreign ministry but also among the hardliners whom officials believe will ultimately decide Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's future. Mr Hunt met Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's daughter, Gabriella, during a visit to Iran in November last year Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said that diplomatic protection ""is unlikely to be a magic wand that leads to an overnight result"". But he said it showed the whole world that ""Nazanin is innocent and the UK will not stand by when one of its citizens is treated so unjustly"". The question now will be how Iran responds. Officials say Iran does not like being put under international pressure. And there is always a risk that this plunges relations between Tehran and London into the deep freeze. This is one reason why the British government has, until now, been reluctant to play the diplomatic protection card, fearing that it might make things worse. But diplomats say that the lack of any progress and the refusal of Iran even to give Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe the proper medical treatment she needs has left them with little choice but to escalate. They say Iran will not be surprised by the British move. The question is whether it will respond positively to the pressure or step up the confrontation. Who is Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe?

"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has told the BBC that Iran forced her to sign a false confession before allowing her to fly home to the UK. She was freed in March, along with fellow British-Iranian national Anoosheh Ashoori, six years after being arrested on spying charges. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe said the Iranian authorities would not let her board her plane home until she had signed the last-minute false confession. A UK official was with her when she signed the statement ""under duress"", she told the BBC. The former political prisoner said she wanted to make sure people knew she had been forced to sign, to prevent the Iranian regime from exploiting her ""dehumanising"" confession. I was forced to sign a false confession - Nazanin Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe was detained in Iran while visiting the country with her daughter Gabriella in 2016. Before her arrest, she lived in London with her daughter and husband. She worked as a project manager for the charity Thomson Reuters Foundation and had been previously employed by BBC Media Action, an international development charity. Iranian authorities alleged Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe was plotting to topple the government in Tehran, but no official charges were ever made public. Iran's Revolutionary Guards said she was leading a ""foreign-linked hostile network"", and sentenced her to five years in prison. She has always denied the accusations she faced, and insisted she had taken her baby daughter to visit her parents and celebrate the Iranian new year. Both the Thomson Reuters Foundation and BBC Media Action issued statements confirming that she was not working in Iran but was on holiday. Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe spent the final year of her prison term on parole at her parents' home in Tehran. But in April 2021, shewas sentenced to a further year in prisonand a one-year travel ban, after being found guilty of propaganda against the Iranian government. Shesubsequently lost an appealagainst this second conviction. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was freed after months of talks between Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and her Iranian counterpart. Along withanother released British-Iranian, Anoosheh Ashoori, she arrived at RAF Brize Nortonin the early hours of Thursday 17 Marchthis year. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori shortly after disembarking at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire Anotherdual national prisoner, Morad Tahbaz, was briefly released on furlough at the same time, but returned to prison just two days later. It was claimed by Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband, Richard, that she was being held in order to force the UK into settling a multi-million pound dispute, which dates back to the 1970s. Iran said the UK owed Â£400m as a result of a cancelled order for 1,500 Chieftain tanks. Announcing Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe's release, Ms Truss said this debt had been settled ""in parallel"", and ""in full compliance with UK and international sanctions and all legal obligations"". She said that negotiations had been taking place over the past few months with Iran, with the help of the Gulf state of Oman. Why has Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe been freed now?

"The UK won't be bound by future EU changes and can choose whether to accept them or not MPs have been promised a vote on any changes to workers' rights after Brexit as Theresa May seeks Labour support to pass her deal on leaving the EU. No 10 said Parliament would be given a say over whether to adopt any new protections introduced on the continent and to stay aligned with EU standards. Labour MPs in Leave constituencies have been seeking assurances the UK will not fall behind EU standards after Brexit. But the TUC said they should not be ""taken in by blatant window dressing"". The union movement said what was being offered was ""flimsy procedural tweaks"". Brexit: A really simple guide Could 'customs co-operation' bridge a gap? It comes as Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay and Attorney General Geoffrey Cox emerged from their latest round of talks with EU officials in Brussels, as they seek to get legally-binding changes to the EU withdrawal agreement ahead of crunch Commons vote. Speaking after a meeting with the EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, Mr Cox said: ""Both sides have exchanged robust, strong views. We're now facing the real discussions. Talks will be resuming soon."" He added: ""We're into the meat of the matter, we've put forward very reasonable proposals."" Safeguarding workers' rights has been one of Labour's key demands in the Brexit negotiations. In January, the vast majority of Labour MPs voted against the withdrawal agreement negotiated by Mrs May. But a handful have suggested they could be persuaded to back the deal when it returns to Parliament next week - if there are guarantees employment rights deriving from the UK's EU membership, covering areas such as paid parental leave, leave for carers and flexible working, will not be watered down. With MPs due to vote on the PM's deal again by 12 March, ministers have offered the following commitments. MPs will be given a vote on adopting future EU rules on workers' rights Trade unions will be consulted in advance on any proposed future changes There will be a new single enforcement body to protect vulnerable and agency workers The first EU laws to be subject to the proposed new ""Commons lock"" would be the Work Life Balance Directive and Transparent and Predictable Working Conditions Directive. The Work Life Balance Directive, due to come into force after 2020, will guarantee two months of paid leave for parents with children under eight and five days paid leave a year for carers, while all working parents of children aged up to eight will be able to request flexible working. The Transparent and Predictable Working Conditions Directive will set employment terms for workers from their first day and give more certainty to staff doing shifts. The UK voted for the measures at EU meetings but ministers say it will now be up to Parliament to decide whether to implement them. The government has already committed to enshrine the existing body of EU law on workplace standards into domestic legislation after Brexit. Mrs May said the UK had a long record of exceeding minimum EU standards in its own domestic legislation and, after Brexit, it should be up to MPs to ""decide what rules are most appropriate, rather than automatically accepting EU changes"". ""When it comes to workers' rights, this Parliament has set world-leading standards and will continue to do so in the future, taking its own decisions working closely with trade unions and businesses,"" she said. New EU directives will guarantee paid leave for carers But the TUC said legally-binding commitments on workers' rights were missing from the withdrawal agreement and the best way for the UK to maintain existing standards was to remain in the EU single market and some form of customs union - which No 10 has rejected. ""There's nothing to stop a future right-wing government tearing up this legislation altogether,"" said its general secretary Frances O'Grady. ""MPs must not be taken in by this blatant window dressing. Our hard-won rights are still under threat."" The GMB union said Parliament already had the right to legislate on employment rights and suggested the PM would be unable to resist demands by Tory MPs to deregulate after Brexit. ""No one should be under any illusion,"" said its general secretary Tim Roache. ""Support for the prime minister's bad Brexit deal means swapping strong legal protections on workers' rights for legally unenforceable tweaks that are not worth the paper they are written on."" The British Chambers of Commerce said it welcomed the fact business would also be consulted, particularly over proposals to create a single body to enforce laws relating to the minimum and living wages, the rights of agency workers, and exploitation in the workplace. ""Businesses will welcome moves to strengthen enforcement measures against the tiny minority of employers out there who wilfully violate the law of the land to undercut their competitors,"" said its director general Dr Adam Marshall.

"Iranian-British aid worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe denies the charge of trying to overthrow the Iranian regime When a British citizen is jailed overseas,as has happened with Iranian-British woman Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe,they normally get basic consular help from the local embassy. This could include anything from contacting family to legal support to medical help. But if the UK were to assert its diplomatic protection over a British citizen - an option that Downing Street says is being considered in this case - that would change things significantly. This would be a signal that the UK is no longer treating the case as a consular matter but a formal, legal dispute between Britain and that country. That's because diplomatic protection is a mechanism under international law that a state can use to help one of its nationals whose rights have been breached in another country. The broad legal principle is that British diplomats would no longer be representing the interests of a citizen but the interests of their state. Incidentally, diplomatic protection is very different from diplomatic immunity. The latter is something given to diplomats to ensure their safe passage and protection from prosecution as agreed under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. Boris Johnson has taken back his remarks that Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was in Iran teaching journalism Carla Ferstman, director of the Redress human right campaign group, says that diplomatic protection can come in many forms. She explains that these are ""a request for an inquiry or for negotiations aimed at the settlement of disputes, negotiation, mediation and conciliation ranging up to arbitral and judicial dispute settlement"". So if Britain were to assert diplomatic protection over Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, that would potentially open the way for the UK to take legal action against Iran. But that is considered unlikely. The declaration in itself would be seen as a significant diplomatic escalation by the British government. What is not clear is how Iran would respond and what immediate practical impact it would have on Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's circumstances.

"Nemmouche has not allowed himself to be photographed in the years since his arrest A French-born jihadist who spent a year fighting in Syria for the Islamic State (IS) group has been found guilty of the murder of four people in an anti-Semitic attack in Brussels in May 2014. Mehdi Nemmouche, 33, opened fire with a Kalashnikov assault rifle and a handgun at the city's Jewish Museum. Three people died at the scene and one died later in hospital. A man who helped plan the attack and provided the weapons, Nacer Bendrer, was also found guilty of murder. Sentencing will be announced at a later date. The two-month-long trial involved apparent witness intimidation and testimony from former prisoners of IS in Syria. Two Israeli tourists, a volunteer worker and a receptionist were killed in the attack on the museum. Why known extremists can carry out terror attacks Which countries have fleeing IS fighters gone to? Nemmouche's lawyers tried to suggest that he'd been framed in an elaborate conspiracy which blamed the murders on foreign intelligence agencies, but produced no evidence to support the claim. He is believed by Belgian prosecutors to be the first European jihadist to return from the battlefields of Syria to carry out terror attacks in Europe. He was born into a family of Algerian origin in the northern French town of Roubaix. He was previously known to French authorities, having served five years in prison for robbery. He is said to have met Bendrer while in prison. Both have been described as ""radicalised"" prisoners. This file photo of Nemmouche was released in 2014 - and he has not been photographed at trial He travelled to Syria in 2013 and stayed for one year, during which time he is believed to have fought for a jihadist group in the country's civil war. Investigators say that while there, he metNajim Laachraoui, who was a suicide bomber in the Brussels airport attack of March 2016, which killed 32 people. Four French people held hostage in Syria allegethey were guarded by both Laachraoui and Nemmouche during their captivity. Nemmouche was extradited to Belgium to face charges connected to the museum shooting, but may also face trial in France over the allegations he was involved in the French prisoner's captivity. The trial was dramatic from the outset. Security was put in place to match that of the trial of jailed jihadist Salah Abdeslam, the sole surviving member of the 2015 Paris attackers. Days after it began, a lawyer representing a witness reported his laptop and some paperwork on the case had been stolen from his office. A baseball bat and replica gun were left in their place â something prosecutors viewed as a threat. In the dock the next day, Nemmouche denounced the attempt at intimidation - and the witness, 81-year-old Chilean artist Clara Billeke Villalobos, went on to testify anyway. Firearms used in the attack were displayed in court as evidence Next came the orphaned daughters of Miriam and Emmanuel Riva, tourists from Israel who were killed in the attack. The couple had been celebrating their 18th wedding anniversary. Ayalet, 19, and Shira, 21, described a mother ""devoted to her family"" and an unassuming father who ""loved to travel"". Three weeks into proceedings, jurors were shown video of Nemmouche in custody after his arrest. Belgian newspaper Le Soir described it as showing an ""arrogant"" Nemmouche in front of police with a ""disdainful smile"", arms folded. He repeats his right to remain silent again and again. Four French journalists were kidnapped in June 2013 and held hostage by the IS group in the northern city of Aleppo until April 2014. Two of them appeared in court - pointing out Nemmouche as their captor. Nicolas Henin told the court Nemmouche was ""sadistic, playful and narcissistic"", while Didier Francois said Nemmouche had beaten him dozens of times with a truncheon. Their kidnapping is the subject of separate proceedings in France. By the end of February, prosecutor Bernard Michel was ready to sum up his case and demand a guilty verdict. He told the court Nemmouche was ""not simply radicalised but ultra-radicalised"". ""If attacking a museum with a combat weapon is not violent and savage then nothing will ever be violent and savage,"" he said. ""We are looking at one of the most serious possible crimes."" ""For the killer, for Mehdi Nemmouche, the identity of the victims mattered little,"" he added. ""The aim was simply that there should be victims. Everything was premeditated."" The closing argument from the defence was described by some as ""mind-boggling"", as it wove a web of conspiracy involving foreign intelligence agencies and assassination. Sebastien Courtoy, Nemmouche's lawyer, suggested that his client was recruited in Lebanon in January 2013 by Iranian or Lebanese intelligence to join the ranks of IS. But this claim went unsubstantiated. According to Mr Courtoy, the murder was not an IS attack, but a ""targeted execution of Mossad agents"" - a reference to the Israeli intelligence agency, which he claimed the Israeli couple belonged to. The killing was carried out by an unknown person, he said. Nemmouche's lawyer Sebastien Courtoy laid out an alleged spy plot Yet judges investigating the museum attack last month told the court there was no evidence to support any link to Mossad. Mr Courtoy claimed that it was in this supposed double-agent capacity that Nemmouche was the jailer of the French journalists, though he claimed they were never mistreated. He said Nemmouche ""went off the radar towards the end of 2013"" after British jihadists suspected him of ""engaging in double- dealing"". Upon his return to Europe, he supposedly tried to quit the spy group, ""which was simply trying to use him"". At one pointed the defence even argued that Nemmouche could not be considered anti-Semitic because he wore Calvin Klein shoes - an apparent reference to Mr Klein's Jewish heritage. A lawyer representing a committee of Jewish organisations called that observation ""mind-boggling and incoherent"".

"Chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak (left) and owner Sheikh Mansour (right) led the Manchester City takeover in 2008 Manchester City are being investigated by Uefa for alleged financial fair play violations. Uefa said the investigation ""will focus on several alleged violations of FFP that were recently made public in various media outlets"". German news magazine Der Spiegel has published a series of claims, based on leaked documents, that Premier League champions City have violated FFP rules. City said: ""The accusation of financial irregularities is entirely false."" The club added: ""Manchester City welcomes the opening of a formal Uefa investigation as an opportunity to bring to an end the speculation resulting from the illegal hacking and out of context publication of City emails. ""The club's published accounts are full and complete and a matter of legal and regulatory record."" FFP rules are designed to ensure the amount clubs spend on their players and wages is approximately equal to what they earn in commercial revenue and prize money. Archive: How damaging are the Man City allegations? Uefa previously found City had breached FFP rules in 2014. The two parties reached a settlement, with City paying a Â£49m fine - Â£32m of which was suspended - while their Champions League squad was reduced for the 2014-15 season. TheFootball Association is looking into claimsCity made a banned Â£200,000 payment to Jadon Sancho's agent when the England winger was 14 years old. That allegation was also made in documents published by Der Spiegel last month. Uefa says it will make no further comment while the investigation is ongoing. In November, Der Spiegel alleged City had ""deceived"" European football's governing body. It claimed City and their sponsors manipulated contracts to wipe out a Â£9.9m shortfall in 2013 and circumvent FFP regulations. After those claims, Uefa said it would reopen FFP investigations on a ""on a case-by-case basis"" if there is evidence of ""abuse"". In December, there werereports that City could be banned,externalfrom European competition if Uefa found they had contravened FFP rules. City managerPep Guardiola subsequently said he had been assuredby chairman Khaldoon al-Mubarak and chief executive Ferran Soriano that the club would not be banned. However, in January, Uefa's chief FFP investigatorYves Leterme,externalsaid City could face a Champions League ban if the claims are proven. BBC sports news correspondent Richard Conway The credibility of Uefa's financial fair play rules are on the line here. They must be seen to be taking seriously these allegations of financial irregularities. City firmly deny any wrongdoing. But they - and Uefa - know that a lot is at stake. The European confederation has, ultimately, the power to bar City from the Champions League. If it comes to that City - with the monetary and legal firepower of Sheikh Mansour behind them - can be expected to fight such a sanction tooth and nail. This matter has a long way to go.

Saudi Arabia's enduring male guardianship system Saudi Arabia freezes Canada trade ties for urging activists' release The Jamal Khashoggi story so far The BBC's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva says that for years the Human Rights Council has shied away from public criticism of Saudi Arabia. Many European countries view Riyadh as an ally in a troubled part of the world, restricting their concerns over human rights to private informal chats, our correspondent adds. On Thursday that changed. All 28 members of the European Union and eight other states - Australia, Canada, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Montenegro, New Zealand and Norway - ""expressed significant concerns about reports of continuing arrests"" of human rights defenders, including women's rights activists. The joint statement was the first collective rebuke of Saudi Arabia at the Human Rights Council ""We are particularly concerned about the use of the counter-terrorism law and other national security provisions against individuals peacefully exercising their rights and freedoms,"" saidthe joint statement, which was read out by Iceland's permanent representative, Harald Aspelund,external. ""Human rights defenders and civil society groups can and should play a vital role in the process of reform which the kingdom is pursuing."" The countries called on the Saudi authorities to release all the activists, including the nine women and one man whose names Mr Aspelund read out. Saudi Arabia began detaining the activists in May, just weeks ahead of the lifting of the ban on women driving for which many of them had campaigned. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (R), the son of King Salman (L), says the women were arrested on national security grounds In November, human rights groups reported that at least four of the women were alleging that interrogators had tortured them, including with electric shocks and whippings, and had sexually harassed and assaulted them. The Saudi deputy public prosecutor has said the allegations are ""false"". On Friday, the public prosecutor's office announced it was referring to court the cases of a group of people, who human rights groups said included several of the activists. It did not specify the charges, but saidthey were suspected of undertaking ""co-ordinated and organized activities,externalâ¦ that aim to undermine the kingdom's security, stability, and national unity"".

"This video can not be played Karen Bradley says she's ""devastated"" to think she made pain worse for Troubles victims' families Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley has said she is determined to deliver for families hurt by comments she made about the Troubles. She said on Wednesday thatdeaths caused by the security forces in Northern Ireland were ""not crimes"". Speaking to the BBC's The View programme on Thursday, Mrs Bradley said she had ""said the wrong thing"". When asked about whether she would resign, she said she was determined to deliver for people in Northern Ireland. Is Northern Ireland secretary running out of road? Bradley 'did not understand' NI voting patterns ""What I do want to do now is make sure I deliver for those families, from all parts of the community, who have been so deeply affected by the Troubles,"" said Mrs Bradley. ""I know how raw that pain is and I'm devastated to think that I have made it worse."" There were no excuses for what she said in the House of Commons on Wednesday, she said, adding: ""It's not what I think, it's not what I mean."" ""I said something in response to an oral question and as soon as I realised what I had said I corrected the record. ""I am determined that those families who have been hurt by what I said will see justice."" This video can not be played 'They were people acting under orders' - Bradley Mrs Bradley has faced considerable criticism for the remarks she made on Wednesday. The Police Service of Northern Ireland's (PSNI) chief constable said on Thursday that a soldier or police officer should be investigated if they shot someone. ""Where people have lost their lives we should all be equal under the law,"" added George Hamilton. ""There should be a thorough and effective investigation."" Speaking at a high-profile Troubles-related inquest in Belfast, the leading barrister Michael Mansfield QC said Mrs Bradley had made ""entirely inappropriate observations"" on Wednesday. This video can not be played Simon Coveney: The comments have come at time of 'real sensitivity' The inquest is examining 10 people's deaths at Ballymurphy in August 1971, which followed three days of gunfire in west Belfast after the introduction of internment. Mr Mansfield is representing some of the victims' families and previously participated in the Bloody Sunday and Hillsborough inquiries and the Birmingham Six case. He told the coroner that Mrs Bradley clearly had ""no regard whatsoever for these proceedings"". After almost 24 hours of facing pressure to say sorry, Karen Bradley's statement may be too little, too late for some. Although she has acknowledged that her language was wrong, she will still face questions as to why she ever made the remark in the first place. Number 10 says it has full confidence in her as Northern Ireland secretary, who is a Theresa May loyalist. It is also unlikely she will face pressure in London to step down. The prime minister can hardly afford to lose another cabinet minister when she is in the throes of the last Brexit act. But some politicians and victims' campaigners in Belfast and Dublin have said Mrs Bradley's apology does not cut it. The TÃ¡naiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Simon Coveney welcomed Mrs Bradley's apology and said he thought she recognised ""the seriousness of the statement made yesterday"". ""I made it perfectly clear to the secretary of state last night that I believed her statement was wrong, that it was ill-advised and that it would cause deep offence to many people."" Lord Dannatt, the former head of the Army, said Mrs Bradley should consider apologising over the comments but should not quit her role. Lord Dannatt is a former head of the Army ""It would not be unreasonable for her to offer an apology,"" he said. ""I think it's unnecessary for her to resign - there's enough confusion in our political world at the present moment."" Attorney General Geoffrey Cox defended the Northern Ireland secretary, telling the Commons that he ""believed firmly"" that she had not intended any offence. The shadow Northern Ireland secretary Tony Lloyd called on Mrs Bradley to outline what the government ""plans to do around legacy cases in Northern Ireland"". Ulster Unionist MLA and former Army officer Doug Beattie said that politicians must be mindful about what they say about Troubles legacy issues. Politics had arrived at a ""major tipping point"", he added, and Mrs Bradley ""should have been alive"" to the fact thatan announcement is due to be made on whether or not former soldiers should be prosecuted in relation to Bloody Sunday. ""She has clearly put her foot in her mouth... and I think she knows that,"" he added. Mr Beattie said Mrs Bradley should apologise to the families of those who died on Bloody Sunday in Londonderry in January 1972. Thirteen people were killed on Bloody Sunday after troops opened fire, and another died of his injuries some months later. This video can not be played 'Her place now is untenable' But Mr Beattie differentiated those events from the SAS killings of eight IRA men who were preparing to bomb a police station in Loughgall, County Armagh, in 1987. ""If you take the likes of Loughgall, that was force on force and was absolutely right,"" he added. ""Bloody Sunday was not and if there is evidence against those people who killed those innocent civilians then the law must be seen to run its course."" Victims' families have called for Mrs Bradley to resign. John Kelly, whose teenage brother Michael was killed on Bloody Sunday, described her remarks as ""outrageous"". John Teggart,whose father was killed in the 1971 Ballymurphy shootings, also said she should quit.

"High-end fashion chain LK Bennett has called in administrators. The business, which has 39 shops and about 500 staff in the UK, signalled it was in difficulties last week after lining up EY as administrator if it could not find fresh financing. The company was founded by Linda Bennett in 1990, and counts the Duchess of Cambridge as a customer. EY said 55 jobs had already gone at the firm's headquarters and following the closure of five stores. The stores which have shut are Sheffield in the Meadowhall shopping centre, Bristol, Liverpool and two in London at Brent Cross and Westbourne Grove. The brand also trades out of 37 concessions in stores around the country. LK Bennett on brink of collapse Earlier today, its website had put up a notice indicating it had stopped taking orders. Callers to its customer service line are told that the offices are closed. Joint administrator Dan Hurd said that amid ""tough trading conditions"" for retailers, LK Bennett had been ""further impacted by significant rent increases and business rate rises"". He added: ""Linda and the management team therefore made the difficult decision to place the company into administration, to protect the future of the business."" The business had been put up for sale and the administrators hoped it would be ""attractive to prospective buyers"". Meanwhile, trading at the shops will continue as normal, although web sales will be temporarily suspended, to allow the administrators to work with the company so that customer orders can be processed and delivered as usual. The Duchess of Cambridge is known to be a fan of the LK Bennett fashion label Last week, Ms Bennett emailed staff saying she had ""fought as hard as I can, with all your help, to turn the business into the success that I know it deserves to be"". ""These are difficult and unstable times, and we are doing everything we can to identify the best way forward,"" she had said. Ms Bennett sold her majority stake in the chain to private equity firm Phoenix Equity Partners in 2008, but in 2017 returned to advise the business after the retailer started to struggle. She bought the company back a short time later. The chain reported an operating loss of nearly Â£6m in the year to the end of July 2017, the most recent results available for the firm. The accounts show that on her return, Ms Bennett invested about Â£11.2m into the business. EY said the company's international operations were not included in the administration process. When she founded the chain, Ms Bennett - who was awarded an OBE in 2006 - said her aim was to bring ""a bit of Bond Street luxury to the High Street"". The chain, which opened its first store in Wimbledon Village in south-west London,  became famed for its kitten-heel shoes. Maureen Hinton, global research director GlobalData, said LK Bennett had ""become expensive and it wasn't as compelling as distinctive as it had been originally. Therefore you're not going to get the turnover or volume of sales that you need to keep business going. ""It's a tough one because it's people's disposable income, they are being careful what they spend it on, especially when it's expensive and it's lost some of its cachet as a compelling brand. ""It's probably in quite expensive places as well, with business rates going up,"" she added. ""I think it might be taken into a group that might be able to consolidate all the back office... costs as well.""

"There were more severely obese boys than girls, the figures show More than a thousand children in Wales starting school are classed as ""severely obese,"" according to public health officials. For the first time, thechild measurement programme,externalhas a category for super-obese four and five-year-olds. Latest figures show 3.3% of children are severely obese, described as ""very worrying"" by Public Health Wales (PHW). It was highest for boys and those living in the most deprived areas. The figures show: Severe obesity is highest in Merthyr Tydfil at 5.7% and lowest in the Vale of Glamorgan (1.7%) The total of children in this category is 1,065 There are 598 (3.6%) severely obese boys and 467 girls (3%) Children from Asian, black or Chinese ""or other"" backgrounds have a higher prevalence of severe obesity, with ""more work needed"" to understand why Severe obesity prevalence in Wales is ""significantly higher"" than in England (2.36%) and is higher than in Scotland (2.7%). 26.4% of children in Wales are overweight or obese, compared to 22.4% in England. There is no nationally accepted definition for severe obesity in children; in adults it is those with abody mass index (BMI),externalof above 40, based on height and weight. The PHW report says it would roughly be a child heavier than 99.6 out of 100 other children of the same age. Lucy O'Loughlin, consultant in public health for PHW, said it highlighted that children currently did not have the same opportunities, with rates of obesity much higher in areas of greater social and economic disadvantage. ""Childhood obesity levels in Wales are not improving, and it is very worrying that children as young as four years old are falling into the category of being severely obese,"" she said. ""We know that once children are obese, they are at risk of getting even more obese as they get older."" She said there needed to be ""coordinated system-wide action"" to tackle the problem or things would not get any better. Obesity overtaking smoking as biggest health risk PE in schools may be squeezed Cheap junk food blamed for obesity Children with obesity need NHS help It comes as the Welsh Government is consulting on itsHealthy Weight, Healthy Wales strategy,external, which sets out ambitions to reduce obesity over the next 10 years. PHW said it recognised parents had to fight against a range of commercial and other influences, from advertising of sugary and fatty foods to affordability. By Owain Clarke, BBC Wales health correspondent Although there's been some slight improvement since last year it's obvious the proportion of children who are overweight or obese when they start school has remained stubbornly high for a number of years. If things continue as they are the Welsh Government's top doctor warns the current generation of children could well be the first to live shorter lives than their parents. The figures for the first time show us the proportion of children in Wales that are severely obese - meaning they might need ongoing monitoring, support or treatment. Rates have been creeping up and, again, there's a distinct link with deprivation, - with children from poorer backgrounds more likely to be dangerously overweight. The problem hasn't gone unnoticed. The Welsh Government's recent obesity strategy talks about making it easier for children to eat healthily in schools and nurseries,while the assembly's health committee on Thursday called for physical activity to be prioritised for young children. But it will take more than that to tackle what is being described as a ""national crisis"".

"Facebook has removed more than 130 accounts, pages and groups it says were part of a UK-based misinformation network. The company said it was the first time it had taken down a UK-based group targeting messages at British citizens. The same group set up pages posing both as far-right outlets and anti-fascist activists. Facebook said it had shared its discovery,externalwith law enforcement and the government. The group was able to gain followers by setting up innocent-looking pages and groups. It later renamed them, and started posting politically-motivated content. MP Damian Collins, who chairs a committee investigating fake news, said it was the ""tip of the iceberg"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""They frequently posted about local and political news including topics like immigration, free speech, racism, LGBT issues, far-right politics, issues between India and Pakistan, and religious beliefs including Islam and Christianity. ""We're taking down these pages and accounts based on their behaviour, not the content they posted.

Facebook gave this example - a post by a group calling itself Politicalised - that had sought to create tensions by sharing genuine news reports it had sourced from elsewhere Another Facebook post tried to insult ""leftists"" Facebook said the pages had spent about $1,500 (Â£1,140) on advertising between them. The earliest advert was placed in December 2013, and the most recent in October 2018. Facebook said it had not completed its ""review of the organic content coming from these accounts"". Separately, the company has also removed 31 pages, groups and accounts for engaging in ""co-ordinated inauthentic behaviour"" in Romania.

"Nemmouche has not allowed himself to be photographed in the years since his arrest A French-born jihadist who spent a year fighting in Syria for the Islamic State (IS) group has been found guilty of the murder of four people in an anti-Semitic attack in Brussels in May 2014. Mehdi Nemmouche, 33, opened fire with a Kalashnikov assault rifle and a handgun at the city's Jewish Museum. Three people died at the scene and one died later in hospital. A man who helped plan the attack and provided the weapons, Nacer Bendrer, was also found guilty of murder. Sentencing will be announced at a later date. The two-month-long trial involved apparent witness intimidation and testimony from former prisoners of IS in Syria. Two Israeli tourists, a volunteer worker and a receptionist were killed in the attack on the museum. Why known extremists can carry out terror attacks Which countries have fleeing IS fighters gone to? Nemmouche's lawyers tried to suggest that he'd been framed in an elaborate conspiracy which blamed the murders on foreign intelligence agencies, but produced no evidence to support the claim. He is believed by Belgian prosecutors to be the first European jihadist to return from the battlefields of Syria to carry out terror attacks in Europe. He was born into a family of Algerian origin in the northern French town of Roubaix. He was previously known to French authorities, having served five years in prison for robbery. He is said to have met Bendrer while in prison. Both have been described as ""radicalised"" prisoners. This file photo of Nemmouche was released in 2014 - and he has not been photographed at trial He travelled to Syria in 2013 and stayed for one year, during which time he is believed to have fought for a jihadist group in the country's civil war. Investigators say that while there, he metNajim Laachraoui, who was a suicide bomber in the Brussels airport attack of March 2016, which killed 32 people. Four French people held hostage in Syria allegethey were guarded by both Laachraoui and Nemmouche during their captivity. Nemmouche was extradited to Belgium to face charges connected to the museum shooting, but may also face trial in France over the allegations he was involved in the French prisoner's captivity. The trial was dramatic from the outset. Security was put in place to match that of the trial of jailed jihadist Salah Abdeslam, the sole surviving member of the 2015 Paris attackers. Days after it began, a lawyer representing a witness reported his laptop and some paperwork on the case had been stolen from his office. A baseball bat and replica gun were left in their place â something prosecutors viewed as a threat. In the dock the next day, Nemmouche denounced the attempt at intimidation - and the witness, 81-year-old Chilean artist Clara Billeke Villalobos, went on to testify anyway. Firearms used in the attack were displayed in court as evidence Next came the orphaned daughters of Miriam and Emmanuel Riva, tourists from Israel who were killed in the attack. The couple had been celebrating their 18th wedding anniversary. Ayalet, 19, and Shira, 21, described a mother ""devoted to her family"" and an unassuming father who ""loved to travel"". Three weeks into proceedings, jurors were shown video of Nemmouche in custody after his arrest. Belgian newspaper Le Soir described it as showing an ""arrogant"" Nemmouche in front of police with a ""disdainful smile"", arms folded. He repeats his right to remain silent again and again. Four French journalists were kidnapped in June 2013 and held hostage by the IS group in the northern city of Aleppo until April 2014. Two of them appeared in court - pointing out Nemmouche as their captor. Nicolas Henin told the court Nemmouche was ""sadistic, playful and narcissistic"", while Didier Francois said Nemmouche had beaten him dozens of times with a truncheon. Their kidnapping is the subject of separate proceedings in France. By the end of February, prosecutor Bernard Michel was ready to sum up his case and demand a guilty verdict. He told the court Nemmouche was ""not simply radicalised but ultra-radicalised"". ""If attacking a museum with a combat weapon is not violent and savage then nothing will ever be violent and savage,"" he said. ""We are looking at one of the most serious possible crimes."" ""For the killer, for Mehdi Nemmouche, the identity of the victims mattered little,"" he added. ""The aim was simply that there should be victims. Everything was premeditated."" The closing argument from the defence was described by some as ""mind-boggling"", as it wove a web of conspiracy involving foreign intelligence agencies and assassination. Sebastien Courtoy, Nemmouche's lawyer, suggested that his client was recruited in Lebanon in January 2013 by Iranian or Lebanese intelligence to join the ranks of IS. But this claim went unsubstantiated. According to Mr Courtoy, the murder was not an IS attack, but a ""targeted execution of Mossad agents"" - a reference to the Israeli intelligence agency, which he claimed the Israeli couple belonged to. The killing was carried out by an unknown person, he said. Nemmouche's lawyer Sebastien Courtoy laid out an alleged spy plot Yet judges investigating the museum attack last month told the court there was no evidence to support any link to Mossad. Mr Courtoy claimed that it was in this supposed double-agent capacity that Nemmouche was the jailer of the French journalists, though he claimed they were never mistreated. He said Nemmouche ""went off the radar towards the end of 2013"" after British jihadists suspected him of ""engaging in double- dealing"". Upon his return to Europe, he supposedly tried to quit the spy group, ""which was simply trying to use him"". At one pointed the defence even argued that Nemmouche could not be considered anti-Semitic because he wore Calvin Klein shoes - an apparent reference to Mr Klein's Jewish heritage. A lawyer representing a committee of Jewish organisations called that observation ""mind-boggling and incoherent"".

"A crime scene remains in place on Lanfrey Place, in West Kensington A teenager has been stabbed to death in west London. The male, aged in his late teens, was found with multiple stab wounds to the chest at 14:14 GMT on Lanfrey Place, West Kensington. He received treatment from London's Air Ambulance but died a short time later, police said. A crime scene remains in place and no arrests have been made. A Section 60 stop and search order is in place until 04:00 on Friday in north Westminster. The fatal stabbing in Fulham comes on the same day a man died of wounds he suffered during a knife attack in central London on Sunday. Meanwhile, Chancellor Philip Hammond has called on police forces in England and Walesto use their existing budgets to tackle knife crime. Senior officers had asked for more money to pay for extra officers after a spate of fatal stabbings but Mr Hammond said forces must use money and staff from other parts of their set-up to deal with the problem. The first stabbing happened in Romily Street in Soho on Sunday Sunday's victim, an unnamed 37-year-old, was found suffering from stab injuries at about 06.00 on Romilly Street, Soho. He died in hospital on Wednesday evening. His next of kin have been informed but formal identification awaits. Joe Gynane, 34, of no fixed address, has been charged with attempted murder in relation to the attack. Police said that charge would now be subject to a review by the Crown Prosecution Service. He also faces a charge of attempted murder in relation to a second stabbing in Camden that day. A 16-year-old boy, who was stabbed in University Street at 11.36, suffered injuries not thought to be life-threatening. London has seen at least 24 homicides since the start of 2019. Six teenagers have been murdered in the capital this year, all of whom died from stab wounds.

" Haven Shepherd kneels on the school diving board, takes a deep breath and launches herself into the pool. “When I'm in the water I feel completely free, I get to feel completely myself.” The pool gives Haven respite from her prosthetic legs. Wearing them all day can be “exhausting”, the 15-year-old says. It’s a long way from her training pool in Carthage, Missouri, to the hut in rural Vietnam where her father tried to end her life. Haven Shepherd was born Do Thi Thuy Phuong on 10 March 2003, in Quang Nam province. When she was just 14 months old, her father made a deadly decision. He entered their hut and strapped himself and Haven’s mother to a TNT explosive device. They held Haven between them. I survived something so dramatic - I wasn't supposed to live The force of the explosion killed both her parents instantly and threw Haven more than 30ft [9m]  from the hut, local reports at the time said. “I survived something so dramatic - I wasn't supposed to live,” Haven says. According to local media reports, Haven’s father was married to someone else and had other children. When Haven’s mother discovered this, she is reported to have threatened to leave him and he decided to end all their lives. Haven’s birth certificate: One translation of Haven’s Vietnamese name, Phuong, is ‘Phoenix.’ Haven has been told a different story, passed down by her grandparents. Their account was that, desperate at being unable to marry, Haven’s parents decided together to detonate the bomb. What we do know is that Haven was found burned, shrapnel embedded in her head, and her feet mangled. But still alive. Haven smiles as she recalls being called “the miracle child” as she grew up. But she remembers very little of her life in Vietnam. She was rushed to hospital by her grandmother, and although it was a long motorcycle ride, across mountains and jungle, she didn't go into shock. Once in hospital, both her legs were immediately amputated beneath the knee to avoid infection. She spent more than a month receiving treatment. Her grandparents’ distress was compounded by their poverty. Unable to pay for treatment themselves, they had to rely on donations from other patients’ families to help pay for her care. “We hope you readers can help with this heart breaking case,” ends a local newspaper report from the time. As Haven lay in hospital, more than 8000 miles (13,000km) away Shelly and Rob Shepherd were grappling with a dilemma. The couple led a busy life in a small town in Missouri, US, raising their six children and running a family flooring business. But Shelly couldn’t shake the feeling that their family was not complete. “We had heard a speaker talk about international adoption, and the astronomical amount of children in the world that needed a home. I sat there telling myself that could never be us. Why would we? We had six biological children. “Then the next thought was: ‘Why not us?’ From that point on I couldn’t rid myself from the feeling that we were absolutely supposed to do this.” But for her husband it was not so simple. Rob was still deeply affected by a fatal accident he had been involved in with his brother Terry in 2000. They had been travelling home from a company picnic, with a dunking machine that had provided the afternoon’s entertainment strapped to their vehicle. They misjudged the height of the game and the top of it struck a tunnel. The structure gave way, and Terry was crushed by the roof of their truck. He died instantly. Rob and Shelly were a couple with a strong faith and had always opened up their home to other children - hosting and even fostering children for periods of time. But Rob just didn’t feel in the right frame of mind to go ahead with an adoption. Eventually Shelly managed to convince him, and shortly after their decision the couple were invited on a trip to Vietnam with Shelly’s school friend Pam Copes and her husband Randy. Pam and Randy had also suffered a terrible tragedy. In 1999, their teenage son Jantsen had died suddenly from an undetected heart ailment after football practice. Pam and Randy cite a visit to Vietnam, where other friends had opened an orphanage, as an invaluable part of their own healing process. They went on to help street children in Vietnam, using Jantsen’s memorial money to set up a foundation called Touch a Life. Now the couple wanted Shelly and Rob to travel to Vietnam with them to help facilitate the adoption of a Vietnamese baby they had read about on a previous trip. That baby was Haven. We didn’t know then that we’d fall in love with her Haven’s grandparents had explained they were too poor to care for her, and wanted Pam and Randy to take her into a shelter they had opened for disabled children in Vietnam. But Pam and Randy felt this was not the best place for her. There were not a lot of prosthetics available in the country. They arranged for Haven to be adopted by another family in the US. Shelly decided to take up her friends’ invitation to travel to Vietnam and help with the adoption. She thought the experience there would help her and her husband understand the needs of the world’s children. But while they were there, something unexpected happened. “We didn’t know then that we’d fall in love with her,” Shelly says. It was October 2004, and the Copes and the Shepherds had travelled to Da Nang on Vietnam’s coast. They were then driven by van and finally motorbikes to a small village high in the mountains and thick jungle. It was there that Haven lived with her grandparents. Shelly remembers with complete clarity the moment she met the baby for the first time. “Her sister brought her up and I just put my hands out to her and she just put her hands out to me and at that moment it was like we both knew.” Back in Da Nang, as they walked on the beach the following morning, Haven seemed to want Rob to carry her all the time. The couple started to realise that she was beginning to feel like their own child. But just a couple of weeks later, once the paperwork and visas had been processed, Haven was in the US with her new adopted parents. Shelly had expected to feel inspired by the trip to Vietnam. In fact she returned heartbroken. “That moment where Shelly handed the baby over just about killed her,” recalls Rob. “But at the same time that was what we [had] agreed to do.” And then, six days later, Shelly received a call from Pam. She told her that the other family had decided that they weren’t the right fit for her. In just a matter of hours Haven was reunited with the Shepherds. Now 15, Haven describes 19 November 2004 as her “gotcha day”. “It’s the day when you are brought home to your family”. Shelly, her voice breaking, says: “When she came back through the door our family was complete.” She says her other children were fully supportive of the decision to adopt Haven. “I think because we've been a big family, I always focused on teaching the kids that love is always multiplied, it’s never divided. So when you add another child, it just means we have a whole lot more love to share with each other.” Among the open fields and expansive skies of their Midwest town, the Shepherd house is hosting a family breakfast. The living room is full of the noise and chaos of 13 children. Toddlers run across the room while older siblings discuss an upcoming wedding, laughing and joking. Haven lies in the middle of the carpet as her nieces and nephews crowd around. One takes her arms, while another playfully lifts her by her prosthetic legs to swing her back and forward. Haven shrieks with laughter. She says she loves being part of such a big family. Her siblings ranged in age from seven to 21 when she was adopted. “I had four older sisters and I was always in their make-up, always dressing up just to be like them. I think that really shaped me because they were such great role models in my life. The Shepherd sisters during Christmas 2018 “And, you know, growing up with a bunch of high schoolers - that was really fun. I got to eat breakfast for dinner a lot of times after a big dance and just had a really great childhood.” Haven was five years old when she first asked Shelly how she lost her legs. Her mum was lifting her out of the bath and wrapping her in a towel. Shelly told her the story. The first prosthetic feet made for Haven “Well that was stupid,” Shelly says Haven interjected. And then asked: “Where do you even get a bomb in Vietnam?” It wasn’t something Shelly could answer, and her daughter, confident and unfazed, had already started to play. The use of explosives to settle debts, family disputes, and even take lives is not uncommon in Vietnam, and often reported by the local media, says the BBC Vietnamese service. Some parts of the country are still littered with explosives left over from the Vietnam war, which ended in 1975. I always knew I was going to be an athlete. Haven’s story has had a profound effect on her siblings. One of her sisters, 31-year-old Haley, has gone on with her husband to adopt their own child - from DR Congo. Haven’s sister Haley and her 6-year-old son, Shep And they in turn have influenced Haven’s life choices. “I went from track meet to volleyball game to basketball game. I was always surrounded by a very active household,” she says. “So I always knew I was going to be an athlete.” Shelly, however, admits that she initially had a stereotypical view of her disabled child. “I thought, ‘OK I'm going to have to give her alternatives to sport.’ I thought maybe she'd play the piano or she would want to sew - there's so many dumb things I thought.” Haven initially tried running like her sisters, but the sweat on her legs made her prosthetics slip. Finally, Shelly suggested they try swimming. “It makes me feel really empowered,” Haven says. “[Growing up], I couldn't really do everything on my own, so it's like the first thing that I got to do by myself.” She started swimming at 10 years old, and just two years later had joined a more serious swimming team that trained all year round. After her 13th birthday, Haven’s racing times were such that the US Paralympic team started tracking her as a potential national candidate. Haven says this meant it was no longer enough just to be “an OK swimmer”. She needed to add weights and more time in the pool to her training regime. Nowadays there are also trips to Colorado to swim at the Olympic Training Center. Last summer, Haven travelled to Italy with other prospective US Paralympic competitors and the team won two gold medals. “I got to wear the USA across my cap and that was super cool. I took a picture of it and said [to my friends and family] ‘it’s real, it’s real.’ “Swimming for your country means a lot.” It’s just over a year until Tokyo hosts the next Olympic and Paralympic games. For Haven, the honour of being chosen to represent Team USA would be “the peak of my life”. Her coach Shawn Klosterman thinks she has a good chance. “She isn’t afraid to do the work,” he says. Final trials are just a few months before the Games so they know that the next couple of years are going to be “kind of a grind”. Shawn also recognises that Haven is still a teenager. “She's a good example that you can be a committed top level athlete working hard and still be a goofy kid, and the fun and the training can go hand in hand,” he says. Haven says that she loves being with her swim team - friends who she jokes are her “four leggers”, referring to the fact they have all their limbs. She says she hopes she is helping to teach them that “there's more Havens out there”. Haven says she grew up with very few disabled people around her, but she was always secure with her disability. “I had two choices,” she says. “I could have become a very insecure person that was having her feelings hurt all the time, or I could see it as, 'Oh, you're staring at me because I have really cool legs.' And I do.” Haven has the word “create” tattooed on her wrist When she’s not training and being home-schooled, Haven spends time working as an ambassador for other amputees. She visits amputees in the military, talks at schools, and emphasises the benefits of being different. The pressure on Haven as a role model and the growing attention she receives did become too much last year, she admits. “I really had to find a balance between being 14 and being this story that everybody wants to have.” For Rob, Haven returning to Vietnam is an important part of her journey. Her maternal grandparents remain in the country and her half-sister has been in contact online. The Shepherds plan to visit after the 2020 Games “to get that sense of where Haven actually comes from and what her parents were like“, Rob says. But for now, Haven’s focus is on her 16th birthday. It will, however, be bitter-sweet. Since Haven was adopted, she and Shelly have been almost constantly by each other’s side. Every day they travel for an hour together to swimming practice, but Haven will soon be able to drive herself. “I think I'm going to call her on the way home just to hear her voice, because I love my mum.” When Haven reflects on her dramatic start in life, she says she feels no resentment towards her biological parents. She says she uses her extraordinary story of survival as an inspiration. “I definitely see that circumstance as a real reason why you shouldn’t just be moping around your whole life.” Built with Shorthand",Negative,1.262053e-09
"High-end fashion chain LK Bennett has called in administrators. The business, which has 39 shops and about 500 staff in the UK, signalled it was in difficulties last week after lining up EY as administrator if it could not find fresh financing. The company was founded by Linda Bennett in 1990, and counts the Duchess of Cambridge as a customer. EY said 55 jobs had already gone at the firm's headquarters and following the closure of five stores. The stores which have shut are Sheffield in the Meadowhall shopping centre, Bristol, Liverpool and two in London at Brent Cross and Westbourne Grove. The brand also trades out of 37 concessions in stores around the country. LK Bennett on brink of collapse Earlier today, its website had put up a notice indicating it had stopped taking orders. Callers to its customer service line are told that the offices are closed. Joint administrator Dan Hurd said that amid ""tough trading conditions"" for retailers, LK Bennett had been ""further impacted by significant rent increases and business rate rises"". He added: ""Linda and the management team therefore made the difficult decision to place the company into administration, to protect the future of the business."" The business had been put up for sale and the administrators hoped it would be ""attractive to prospective buyers"". Meanwhile, trading at the shops will continue as normal, although web sales will be temporarily suspended, to allow the administrators to work with the company so that customer orders can be processed and delivered as usual. The Duchess of Cambridge is known to be a fan of the LK Bennett fashion label Last week, Ms Bennett emailed staff saying she had ""fought as hard as I can, with all your help, to turn the business into the success that I know it deserves to be"". ""These are difficult and unstable times, and we are doing everything we can to identify the best way forward,"" she had said. Ms Bennett sold her majority stake in the chain to private equity firm Phoenix Equity Partners in 2008, but in 2017 returned to advise the business after the retailer started to struggle. She bought the company back a short time later. The chain reported an operating loss of nearly Â£6m in the year to the end of July 2017, the most recent results available for the firm. The accounts show that on her return, Ms Bennett invested about Â£11.2m into the business. EY said the company's international operations were not included in the administration process. When she founded the chain, Ms Bennett - who was awarded an OBE in 2006 - said her aim was to bring ""a bit of Bond Street luxury to the High Street"". The chain, which opened its first store in Wimbledon Village in south-west London,  became famed for its kitten-heel shoes. Maureen Hinton, global research director GlobalData, said LK Bennett had ""become expensive and it wasn't as compelling as distinctive as it had been originally. Therefore you're not going to get the turnover or volume of sales that you need to keep business going. ""It's a tough one because it's people's disposable income, they are being careful what they spend it on, especially when it's expensive and it's lost some of its cachet as a compelling brand. ""It's probably in quite expensive places as well, with business rates going up,"" she added. ""I think it might be taken into a group that might be able to consolidate all the back office... costs as well.""

"The Labour Party may have unlawfully discriminated against Jewish people, the UK's human rights watchdog says. The Equalities and Human Rights Commission said it was considering launching a formal investigation into anti-Semitism in the party. The Labour Party said: ""We completely reject any suggestion the party has acted unlawfully and will be co-operating fully with the EHRC."" The watchdog is asking the party to work with it to improve its processes. Once the EHRC's formal letter is received by Labour, the party will have 14 days to respond to the concerns raised. A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims Falconer pressured over anti-Semitism role Depending on the response, the commission can take enforcement action ranging from a voluntary agreement with the party to a full-blown investigation. If a formal investigation was launched, the EHRC would request interviews with key figures in the party and have the power to demand access to correspondence, emails and other information to determine how Labour dealt with allegations of anti-Semitic discrimination. The action comes in response to complaints from a number of organisations and individuals, including the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism. An Equality and Human Rights Commission spokesperson said: ""Having received a number of complaints regarding anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, we believe Labour may have unlawfully discriminated against people because of their ethnicity and religious beliefs. ""Our concerns are sufficient for us to consider using our statutory enforcement powers. ""As set out in our enforcement policy, we are now engaging with the Labour Party to give them an opportunity to respond."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

If the watchdog concludes Labour has a case to answer, it could launch an inquiry under section 20 of the Equalities Act, which would examine whether the party's internal processes were compliant with the law. The watchdogcarried out a similar inquiry into the Metropolitan Police in 2016,externalover allegations of unlawful harassment, discrimination and victimisation of black and minority ethnic, female and gay officers who made discrimination complaints. A Labour Party spokesman said: ""Labour is fully committed to the support, defence and celebration of the Jewish community and its organisations. ""Anti-Semitism complaints received since April 2018 relate to about 0.1% of our membership, but one anti-Semite in our party is one too many. We are determined to tackle anti-Semitism and root it out of our party."" Lord Falconer has been offered the job of reviewing the party's handling of anti-Semitism allegations The party wants former Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer to carry out a review of its handling of anti-Semitism claims. The Labour peer says he is considering whether to accept the offer, amid claims by prominent Jewish Labour MP that he is not independent enough. One of his critics, Dame Margaret Hodge welcomed the EHRC announcement, saying ""faith in Labour's complaints process is at rock bottom"" and it was ""essential the EHRC make all necessary inquiries"".

Gideon Falter, of the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism, said his group had been ""forced"" to ""seek an external, impartial investigation"" after calls from the Jewish community for tougher action from Labour officials had been ""persistently rebuffed"". ""The Labour Party has repeatedly failed to address its own anti-Semitism problem, resulting in MPs and members abandoning the party. ""It is a sad indictment that the once great anti-racist Labour Party is now being investigated by the equality and human rights regulator it established just a decade ago."" The Jewish Labour Movement said it made a submission to the EHRC in November last year, asking it to investigate the allegation that the Labour Party was ""institutionally anti-Semitic"". ""We did not take that decision lightly,"" it said in a statement. ""After years of anti-Jewish racism experienced by our members, and a long pattern of denial, obfuscation and inaction by those with the power and ability to do something about it, we felt there was little choice but to secure a fully independent inquiry, not encumbered by corrupted internal practices. ""Everything that has happened in the months since our referral supports our view that the Labour Party is now institutionally anti-Semitic."" Labour has been plagued by accusations of anti-Semitism since mid-2016. The party leadership has been accused of tolerating a culture of anti-Jewish prejudice by a number of its own MPs, some of whom have quit the party in protest. Leader Jeremy Corbyn insists he is getting to grips with the issue and has beefed-up the party's internal disciplinary procedures. Last week, Labour MP Chris Williamson was suspended after saying the party had been ""too apologetic"" and ""given too much ground"" to its critics.

The Labour Party said: ""We completely reject any suggestion the party has acted unlawfully and will be co-operating fully with the EHRC."" The watchdog is asking the party to work with it to improve its processes. Once the EHRC's formal letter is received by Labour, the party will have 14 days to respond to the concerns raised. A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims Falconer pressured over anti-Semitism role Depending on the response, the commission can take enforcement action ranging from a voluntary agreement with the party to a full-blown investigation. If a formal investigation was launched, the EHRC would request interviews with key figures in the party and have the power to demand access to correspondence, emails and other information to determine how Labour dealt with allegations of anti-Semitic discrimination. The action comes in response to complaints from a number of organisations and individuals, including the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism. An Equality and Human Rights Commission spokesperson said: ""Having received a number of complaints regarding anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, we believe Labour may have unlawfully discriminated against people because of their ethnicity and religious beliefs. ""Our concerns are sufficient for us to consider using our statutory enforcement powers. ""As set out in our enforcement policy, we are now engaging with the Labour Party to give them an opportunity to respond."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

If the watchdog concludes Labour has a case to answer, it could launch an inquiry under section 20 of the Equalities Act, which would examine whether the party's internal processes were compliant with the law. The watchdogcarried out a similar inquiry into the Metropolitan Police in 2016,externalover allegations of unlawful harassment, discrimination and victimisation of black and minority ethnic, female and gay officers who made discrimination complaints. A Labour Party spokesman said: ""Labour is fully committed to the support, defence and celebration of the Jewish community and its organisations. ""Anti-Semitism complaints received since April 2018 relate to about 0.1% of our membership, but one anti-Semite in our party is one too many. We are determined to tackle anti-Semitism and root it out of our party."" Lord Falconer has been offered the job of reviewing the party's handling of anti-Semitism allegations The party wants former Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer to carry out a review of its handling of anti-Semitism claims. The Labour peer says he is considering whether to accept the offer, amid claims by prominent Jewish Labour MP that he is not independent enough. One of his critics, Dame Margaret Hodge welcomed the EHRC announcement, saying ""faith in Labour's complaints process is at rock bottom"" and it was ""essential the EHRC make all necessary inquiries"".

Gideon Falter, of the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism, said his group had been ""forced"" to ""seek an external, impartial investigation"" after calls from the Jewish community for tougher action from Labour officials had been ""persistently rebuffed"". ""The Labour Party has repeatedly failed to address its own anti-Semitism problem, resulting in MPs and members abandoning the party. ""It is a sad indictment that the once great anti-racist Labour Party is now being investigated by the equality and human rights regulator it established just a decade ago."" The Jewish Labour Movement said it made a submission to the EHRC in November last year, asking it to investigate the allegation that the Labour Party was ""institutionally anti-Semitic"". ""We did not take that decision lightly,"" it said in a statement. ""After years of anti-Jewish racism experienced by our members, and a long pattern of denial, obfuscation and inaction by those with the power and ability to do something about it, we felt there was little choice but to secure a fully independent inquiry, not encumbered by corrupted internal practices. ""Everything that has happened in the months since our referral supports our view that the Labour Party is now institutionally anti-Semitic."" Labour has been plagued by accusations of anti-Semitism since mid-2016. The party leadership has been accused of tolerating a culture of anti-Jewish prejudice by a number of its own MPs, some of whom have quit the party in protest. Leader Jeremy Corbyn insists he is getting to grips with the issue and has beefed-up the party's internal disciplinary procedures. Last week, Labour MP Chris Williamson was suspended after saying the party had been ""too apologetic"" and ""given too much ground"" to its critics.

"Former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson is to face a fresh hearing over an allegation that he committed contempt of court. He was jailed in May last year for filming and broadcasting footage of people involved in a criminal trial. But that finding was quashed by the Court of Appeal in August after he won an appeal.

Recorder of London Nicholas Hilliard QC then referred the case to the Attorney General in October, after the judge received a statement from Mr Robinson.

"Police cordoned off Glin Ree Court after three bodies were found in a flat Police investigating three deaths in Newry, County Down, have begun a murder inquiry but are ""not currently seeking anyone else"" in the investigation. The bodies of a man, a woman and a teenage girl were found when officers ""forced entry"" to a flat in the city. Det Supt Jason Murphy said police went to the flat after a relative reported concerns that they had not been in contact with a family member for days. He added that police did not yet know how the three people died. This video can not be played PSNI Det Supt Jason Murphy says the force have begun a murder inquiry The bodies were discovered in the flat in Glin Ree Court off Downshire Road at about 11:00 GMT on Thursday. Mr Murphy told reporters the girl was aged about 15, the woman was about 37 and the man was about 38. They have not yet been formally identified and their nationalities have not been confirmed. Forensic investigators are examining the scene Mr Murphy said the investigation was still at a very early stage and police ""have no defined cause of death for those individuals"". However, he said he was satisfied to start a murder inquiry. ""At this stage, I don't believe that anybody else was involved in the deaths of those three individuals,"" he said.

"NI's chief medical officer said health professionals had seen an increase in the use of heroin Consideration should be given to providing rooms where people can safely inject themselves with illegal drugs, NI's chief medical officer has said. Dr Michael McBride told the BBC there was a ""significant problem"" with drug users injecting in public places. He said health professionals had seen a clear increase in the use of heroin among patients in recent years. However any decision to provide so-called consumption rooms would be for a Stormont minister, he added. ""My own view on this is that we need to look at all options that can reduce the harm associated with intravenous drug misuse,"" he said. ""Yes, we have reduced the risk of overdose through making available Naloxone, but we also need to look at whether or not there are other alternative models such as consumption rooms. ""Ultimately, decisions of that nature will be a matter for a minister in an executive in due course."" Naloxone reverses an overdose from opioids, including heroin PSNI Detective Superintendent Bobby Singleton said the PSNI was following the debate around safe drug rooms ""with a very keen interest"". ""Law enforcement clearly has a role to play in terms of restricting the availability of illicit and prescription drugs on the street in Northern Ireland. It is a priority for communities and consequently it is a priority for us,"" he said. ""We recognise the limitations of law enforcement when it comes to dealing with an addressing the harms associated with, in particular intravenous drug misuse."" On Monday, it emerged thatdrug-related deaths among males in Northern Ireland have almost doubled in the last 10 years. Asked about the likelihood of consumption rooms being introduced as a means of reducing deaths, Dr McBride explained that among health professionals, there were ""a range of views around the effectiveness of such an approach"" and that some fear it could encourage addicts to continue injecting. ""I don't think it's a problem that's going to go away any time soon,"" he said. ""We're beginning to make progress in some areas, but this is a complex issue, there are no simple solutions."" In a statement to the BBC, the British Medical Association (BMA) said it supported the introduction of a wider range of evidence-based interventions for treating illicit drug dependence - such as heroin-assisted treatment and supervised consumption rooms. The organisation said it believed there should be a ""refocusing to prioritise treatment and support over criminalisation and punishment of drug users"". Dr Michael McBride said so-called consumption rooms 'need to be considered as an option' Earlier in the week, the Department of Health said that over the past two years there had been a ""growing pressure"" on a range of alcohol and drug-related services, leading to the development of ""unacceptable waiting lists"" for some key services across Northern Ireland, but particularly in Belfast. It said this had been the focus of ""significant action and investment"" by the Department of Health, the Health and Social Care Board and the Belfast Trust. As a result, it said, average waiting times for substitution therapy in the Belfast Trust had fallen from 41 weeks in July 2017 to 15 weeks in December 2018. Dr McBride described the 2017 waiting times as ""clearly unacceptable"" and acknowledged an under-investment in drugs services in the past. However that investment had now been made available, he added, and the waiting times needed to come down even further. ""It's not because the service isn't trying hard enough,"" he said. ""It's a reflection of the demand on the services.""

"This video can not be played Sir Charlie Mayfield John Lewis has paid out its lowest bonus to staff since the 1950s as profits plunged last year amid ""challenging"" trading. The retail partnership - which includes Waitrose supermarkets - said staff would receive a 3% bonus, the lowest since 1953 when workers got no bonus. Profits at the partnership sank last year by more than 45% to Â£160m. It blamed poor home sales, discounting, higher IT costs and the cost of opening two new stores last year for the drop. John Lewis famously promises that it is ""never knowingly undersold"", meaning it matches its High Street rivals' prices. Four reasons John Lewis is under pressure John Lewis staff bonus in doubt The partnership said ""near constant discounting"" from rivals had hit profits, particularly in its department store shops. John Lewis' structure is unique. It is owned by its staff, known as partners. Typically in profitable years, staff at the 350 Waitrose and 51 John Lewis stores receive a share of the profits. In the very best years, these bonuses can add the equivalent of a few months' worth of pay. But the annual staff bonus has been reduced every year for the past six years due to difficult trading conditions. Sir Charlie Mayfield, chairman of the John Lewis Partnership, said the lower bonus would help the company to preserve cash and invest ""to cope with the continuing uncertainty facing consumers and the economy"". Analysis: Howard Mustoe, business reporter There are four key reasons the department store chain is struggling. It's ""Never Knowingly Undersold"" guarantee ties its hands on price as it matches the price of a product with competitors. There's also the general ""relevance problem"" of department stores, with the rise of online shopping. And there's the squeeze on incomes that is seeing consumers cut back on certain types of spending. And staying relevant costs money - John Lewis has had to invest in IT, as many other retailers have, to meet customer demand. Read more here There was brighter news from Waitrose - but it is closing five stores John Lewis said ""subdued demand, excess retail space and some other retailers' distress"" had led to big discounts by shops since last October. Like-for-like sales, which exclude sales from new stores, fell 1.4% in its department stores last year. It said weaker home sales in particular had contributed to the drop, with ""subdued"" consumer confidence hitting demand for ""big ticket and bespoke items"". The department store model has been under pressure for several years. BHS collapsed in 2016, while House of Fraser was bought out of administration by Sports Direct owner Mike Ashley last year. Earlier this week, struggling department store chainDebenhams issued its fourth profit warningin a little over a year as its sales continued to fall. Sir Charlie - who is stepping down next year - said the current High Street problems were ""an inevitable market adjustment which will require greater clarity on whether brands are competing on scale or difference."" Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Laith Khalaf said the fact that John Lewis was struggling showed how bad the situation was. ""If the bellwether John Lewis is creaking, you can be sure others are feeling the pain. ""In the short term, things don't look like getting much better, but further out, John Lewis may ultimately pick up market share from others who fall by the wayside. A larger slice of the pie could be the reward for staying the course, but what remains to be seen is just how big a pie is left after the current shift in retail washes through the system."" One brighter spot in the results was Waitrose. Like-for-like sales at the supermarket rose 1.3% last year, with profits up 18%. However, John Lewis said it had sold off five of its Waitrose stores to rival retailers, putting 440 roles at risk of redundancy. The firm said the shops were not ""commercially sustainable"" in the long term. The affected stores are: Ashbourne, Derbyshire (7,710 sq ft) Barry, Vale of Glamorgan (25,909 sq ft) Blaby, Leicestershire (6,773 sq ft) Teignmouth, Devon (19,374 sq ft) Torquay, Devon (12,508 sq ft) On Brexit, the partnership said it was ""in a good position for a managed transition"". But warned an unmanaged transition risked ""a strong fall in consumer confidence and the impact that has on trade"".

"Snack company Graze has recalled a product it labelled as suitable for vegans that actually contained milk. The Food Standards Agency said the Sea Salt and Vinegar Veg Crunchers also posed a ""health risk for anyone with an allergy or intolerance to milk"". The affected batches have best before dates of 20 June, 28 June and 2 July 2019, the FSA added. Graze apologised for the ""incorrect vegan claim"" andtold customers,externalwith allergies not to eat the product. ""The health and safety of our customers is of the utmost importance to us"", the company said, adding that no other products had been affected. In February, the London-based brand - which started out a decade ago as a snack box delivery service - was purchased by the conglomerate Unileverin a deal believed to be worth around Â£100m. Graze products are sold in shops such as Sainsbury's, Boots, WH Smith and Tesco, as well as online and direct to consumers. The BBC contacted Unilever for comment but is yet to receive a response. New food label law to stop allergy deaths Quarter of tested foods had allergens Supermarket bakeries 'unclear on allergies' Late last year, the FSA said undeclared allergens were found in a quarter of food samples from UK businesses - with 673 out of 2,862 tests since 2016 described as ""unsatisfactory"". And, earlier this year, stronger food labelling laws were proposed to prevent the deaths of people with allergies. It came afterthe death of Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, 15, of Fulham, west London, who suffered an allergic reaction to a Pret a Manger baguette in 2016. The inquest into Natasha's death heard the teenager was ""reassured"" by the lack of specific allergen information on the packaging when she bought the sandwich at Heathrow Airport. But the baguette contained sesame seeds, which caused her to go into cardiac arrest on a flight. The sandwich chain later said asecond customer was believed to have diedfrom an allergic reaction to a product containing a non-dairy yoghurt. The person died in 2017 after eating a ""super-veg rainbow flatbread"" which was supposed to be dairy-free. Pret said it was mis-sold a guaranteed dairy-free yoghurt, as it contained dairy protein. But the company who sold Pret the yoghurt denied that it was to blame and said the ""true cause"" is unknown. Marmite-owner snaps up snack brand Graze How snack food firm Graze cracked the US.

"Facebook has removed more than 130 accounts, pages and groups it says were part of a UK-based misinformation network.

The same group set up pages posing both as far-right outlets and anti-fascist activists. Facebook said it had shared its discovery,externalwith law enforcement and the government. The group was able to gain followers by setting up innocent-looking pages and groups. It later renamed them, and started posting politically-motivated content. MP Damian Collins, who chairs a committee investigating fake news, said it was the ""tip of the iceberg"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Facebook said about 175,000 people followed at least one of the fake pages, which included 35 profiles on Instagram. The company said the pages ""engaged in hate speech and spread divisive comments on both sides of the political debate in the UK"". ""They frequently posted about local and political news including topics like immigration, free speech, racism, LGBT issues, far-right politics, issues between India and Pakistan, and religious beliefs including Islam and Christianity. ""We're taking down these pages and accounts based on their behaviour, not the content they posted. In each of these cases, the people behind this activity coordinated with one another and used fake accounts to misrepresent themselves, and that was the basis for our action."" The BBC understands Facebook discovered the network of inauthentic accounts while investigating hate speech about the UK Home Secretary Sajid Javid. Facebook gave this example - a post by a group calling itself Politicalised - that had sought to create tensions by sharing genuine news reports it had sourced from elsewhere Another Facebook post tried to insult ""leftists"" Facebook said the pages had spent about $1,500 (Â£1,140) on advertising between them. The earliest advert was placed in December 2013, and the most recent in October 2018. Facebook said it had not completed its ""review of the organic content coming from these accounts"".

"This video can not be played Sir Charlie Mayfield John Lewis has paid out its lowest bonus to staff since the 1950s as profits plunged last year amid ""challenging"" trading. The retail partnership - which includes Waitrose supermarkets - said staff would receive a 3% bonus, the lowest since 1953 when workers got no bonus. Profits at the partnership sank last year by more than 45% to Â£160m. It blamed poor home sales, discounting, higher IT costs and the cost of opening two new stores last year for the drop. John Lewis famously promises that it is ""never knowingly undersold"", meaning it matches its High Street rivals' prices. Four reasons John Lewis is under pressure John Lewis staff bonus in doubt The partnership said ""near constant discounting"" from rivals had hit profits, particularly in its department store shops. John Lewis' structure is unique. It is owned by its staff, known as partners. Typically in profitable years, staff at the 350 Waitrose and 51 John Lewis stores receive a share of the profits. In the very best years, these bonuses can add the equivalent of a few months' worth of pay. But the annual staff bonus has been reduced every year for the past six years due to difficult trading conditions. Sir Charlie Mayfield, chairman of the John Lewis Partnership, said the lower bonus would help the company to preserve cash and invest ""to cope with the continuing uncertainty facing consumers and the economy"". Analysis: Howard Mustoe, business reporter There are four key reasons the department store chain is struggling. It's ""Never Knowingly Undersold"" guarantee ties its hands on price as it matches the price of a product with competitors. There's also the general ""relevance problem"" of department stores, with the rise of online shopping. And there's the squeeze on incomes that is seeing consumers cut back on certain types of spending. And staying relevant costs money - John Lewis has had to invest in IT, as many other retailers have, to meet customer demand. Read more here There was brighter news from Waitrose - but it is closing five stores John Lewis said ""subdued demand, excess retail space and some other retailers' distress"" had led to big discounts by shops since last October. Like-for-like sales, which exclude sales from new stores, fell 1.4% in its department stores last year. It said weaker home sales in particular had contributed to the drop, with ""subdued"" consumer confidence hitting demand for ""big ticket and bespoke items"". The department store model has been under pressure for several years. BHS collapsed in 2016, while House of Fraser was bought out of administration by Sports Direct owner Mike Ashley last year. Earlier this week, struggling department store chainDebenhams issued its fourth profit warningin a little over a year as its sales continued to fall. Sir Charlie - who is stepping down next year - said the current High Street problems were ""an inevitable market adjustment which will require greater clarity on whether brands are competing on scale or difference."" Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Laith Khalaf said the fact that John Lewis was struggling showed how bad the situation was. ""If the bellwether John Lewis is creaking, you can be sure others are feeling the pain. ""In the short term, things don't look like getting much better, but further out, John Lewis may ultimately pick up market share from others who fall by the wayside. A larger slice of the pie could be the reward for staying the course, but what remains to be seen is just how big a pie is left after the current shift in retail washes through the system."" One brighter spot in the results was Waitrose. Like-for-like sales at the supermarket rose 1.3% last year, with profits up 18%. However, John Lewis said it had sold off five of its Waitrose stores to rival retailers, putting 440 roles at risk of redundancy. The firm said the shops were not ""commercially sustainable"" in the long term. The affected stores are: Ashbourne, Derbyshire (7,710 sq ft) Barry, Vale of Glamorgan (25,909 sq ft) Blaby, Leicestershire (6,773 sq ft) Teignmouth, Devon (19,374 sq ft) Torquay, Devon (12,508 sq ft) On Brexit, the partnership said it was ""in a good position for a managed transition"". But warned an unmanaged transition risked ""a strong fall in consumer confidence and the impact that has on trade"".

"Bethan Colebourn was found dead at the family home in October 2017 A mother drowned her three-year-old daughter in a bath a month after separating from her husband, whom she believed was having an affair, a court has heard. Bethan Colebourn was found dead at the family home in Fordingbridge, Hampshire, in October 2017. Claire Colebourn, 36, had searched for websites about suicide and drowning before the death, Winchester Crown Court heard. She denies murder. Kerry Maylin, prosecuting, said Bethan was found lying on a wet bed at her home in Whitsbury Road on 19 October. Paramedics were unable to revive her. Ms Maylin said the cause of death was not certain but was ""very likely to be immersion in water"", according to a pathologist. ""Bethan had been put in the bath at home and held under the water,"" Ms Maylin told the jury. ""That act was completed by her mother."" Bethan died in hospital after being found at the family home in Whitsbury Road Ms Maylin said the defendant had an ""unfounded"" belief that her husband Michael, a company chief executive, was having an affair with his financial director at their marine interiors firm Trimline. She met the firm's chairman to express her concerns and told friends. The court was told of a Facebook post in which Ms Colebourn wrote: ""Michael walked out on his family on 7 September and we haven't seen him since. ""He has been having an affair with his financial director at work. Everything has been pre-planned. ""They are aiming to conquer the business and set up a new life together."" Ms Colebourn also changed her wi-fi password because she thought her husband was monitoring her over the internet, the jury heard. The court was told Ms Colebourn was suffering from a diabetic episode when Bethan was found. She described to police how she took her daughter to the bathroom after setting an alarm for 03:00, jurors heard. Ms Colebourn told officers: ""She woke up... she put her hands on my cheeks, told me she loved me and said 'I don't want a bath, mummy, I don't want a bath'."" A large police operation began at the home after the discovery of Bethan's body The jury heard she then drowned her daughter, telling police: ""I wanted to fight myself but I couldn't. She didn't fight... She had complete trust in me."" Ms Maylin said the defendant told friends she then tried to kill herself by hanging herself, stabbing herself in the stomach and taking a fatal overdose of insulin. Asked in a police interview why she had killed Bethan, the defendant replied: ""Because I didn't want her to go anywhere near her father."" Jurors heard the girl's body was found by Ms Colebourn's mother, Janet Fildew, who visited at 18:30 on 19 October. The defendant was in another bedroom and was found to have injected herself with 306 units of insulin that day - nearly 10 times her normal dose, the prosecutor said. In hospital, Ms Colebourn wrote a letter to a relative saying about Bethan: ""In my eyes, I saved her"", the court heard. Asked about the comment in a police interview, she replied: ""I can't be a liar... I'm going to have to go against legal advice. ""Bethan drowned because I was there. I held her under the water."" Giving evidence, Mr Colebourn said his wife had filed for divorce, claiming he was not interested in bringing up Bethan, which he was ""not happy with"". He described how he had met his wife at university in 2001 but said their relationship deteriorated quickly after Bethan's birth and he decided to leave in September 2017. ""The relationship wasn't working, there was a realisation that the best for both parties and for Bethan was to separate,"" he said. He told the court his wife had reluctantly allowed him to see their daughter alone a week before she died. Mr Colebourn said when he had returned his daughter ""she kissed me and hugged me and went in, she was fine, she was happy"". He told the court Mrs Colebourn became ""obsessed"" with his ex-partner who was his Facebook friend, causing him to close down his account. In cross-examination Mr Colebourn accepted his wife was ""devoted"" to their daughter. The trial continues.

"Kia Russell with her son Kamari Tributes have been paid to a ""lovely"" woman who died suddenly at home with her young son. Police were called to Swinburne Road in Ipswich at 17:00 GMT on Wednesday after the body of Kia Russell, 19, was found. Her son Kamari, two, was treated at the scene but died. Police have officially named the pair and confirmed there was ""no third party involvement"" in the deaths. A boy, 17, from Ipswich, arrested at the scene was released on police bail. Police say he was not being held on suspicion of murder or manslaughter. Lisa Horne, who lived next door until December, said news of the deaths was ""really shocking"". ""She was in the garden with her son, or when we were doing the car she was there with hers. She always said 'morning' or 'hello'."" Ms Horne added: ""She never had any issues and was quiet. I just feel at a loss, at such a young age for both of them - no life at all really."" Kia Russell posted this picture of Kamari on Facebook Another neighbour said Ms Russell was ""an absolutely brilliant mum"" to her son. ""She was always caring for him. Wherever she went, he went as well. ""Whenever I saw them, he was never screaming. He was always content."" Suffolk Police said next of kin had been informed Friends and family have been leaving floral tributes The Reverend Mary Sokanovic, the priest in charge of the parish of Whitton with Thurleston and Akenham, said the church would be open for people to ""find a quiet space or pray"".

"This video can not be played Karen Bradley says she's ""devastated"" to think she made pain worse for Troubles victims' families Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley has said she is determined to deliver for families hurt by comments she made about the Troubles. She said on Wednesday thatdeaths caused by the security forces in Northern Ireland were ""not crimes"". Speaking to the BBC's The View programme on Thursday, Mrs Bradley said she had ""said the wrong thing"". When asked about whether she would resign, she said she was determined to deliver for people in Northern Ireland. Is Northern Ireland secretary running out of road? Bradley 'did not understand' NI voting patterns ""What I do want to do now is make sure I deliver for those families, from all parts of the community, who have been so deeply affected by the Troubles,"" said Mrs Bradley. ""I know how raw that pain is and I'm devastated to think that I have made it worse."" There were no excuses for what she said in the House of Commons on Wednesday, she said, adding: ""It's not what I think, it's not what I mean."" ""I said something in response to an oral question and as soon as I realised what I had said I corrected the record. ""I am determined that those families who have been hurt by what I said will see justice."" This video can not be played 'They were people acting under orders' - Bradley Mrs Bradley has faced considerable criticism for the remarks she made on Wednesday. The Police Service of Northern Ireland's (PSNI) chief constable said on Thursday that a soldier or police officer should be investigated if they shot someone. ""Where people have lost their lives we should all be equal under the law,"" added George Hamilton. ""There should be a thorough and effective investigation."" Speaking at a high-profile Troubles-related inquest in Belfast, the leading barrister Michael Mansfield QC said Mrs Bradley had made ""entirely inappropriate observations"" on Wednesday. This video can not be played Simon Coveney: The comments have come at time of 'real sensitivity' The inquest is examining 10 people's deaths at Ballymurphy in August 1971, which followed three days of gunfire in west Belfast after the introduction of internment. Mr Mansfield is representing some of the victims' families and previously participated in the Bloody Sunday and Hillsborough inquiries and the Birmingham Six case. He told the coroner that Mrs Bradley clearly had ""no regard whatsoever for these proceedings"". After almost 24 hours of facing pressure to say sorry, Karen Bradley's statement may be too little, too late for some. Although she has acknowledged that her language was wrong, she will still face questions as to why she ever made the remark in the first place. Number 10 says it has full confidence in her as Northern Ireland secretary, who is a Theresa May loyalist. It is also unlikely she will face pressure in London to step down. The prime minister can hardly afford to lose another cabinet minister when she is in the throes of the last Brexit act. But some politicians and victims' campaigners in Belfast and Dublin have said Mrs Bradley's apology does not cut it. The TÃ¡naiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Simon Coveney welcomed Mrs Bradley's apology and said he thought she recognised ""the seriousness of the statement made yesterday"". ""I made it perfectly clear to the secretary of state last night that I believed her statement was wrong, that it was ill-advised and that it would cause deep offence to many people."" Lord Dannatt, the former head of the Army, said Mrs Bradley should consider apologising over the comments but should not quit her role. Lord Dannatt is a former head of the Army ""It would not be unreasonable for her to offer an apology,"" he said. ""I think it's unnecessary for her to resign - there's enough confusion in our political world at the present moment."" Attorney General Geoffrey Cox defended the Northern Ireland secretary, telling the Commons that he ""believed firmly"" that she had not intended any offence. The shadow Northern Ireland secretary Tony Lloyd called on Mrs Bradley to outline what the government ""plans to do around legacy cases in Northern Ireland"". Ulster Unionist MLA and former Army officer Doug Beattie said that politicians must be mindful about what they say about Troubles legacy issues. Politics had arrived at a ""major tipping point"", he added, and Mrs Bradley ""should have been alive"" to the fact thatan announcement is due to be made on whether or not former soldiers should be prosecuted in relation to Bloody Sunday. ""She has clearly put her foot in her mouth... and I think she knows that,"" he added. Mr Beattie said Mrs Bradley should apologise to the families of those who died on Bloody Sunday in Londonderry in January 1972. Thirteen people were killed on Bloody Sunday after troops opened fire, and another died of his injuries some months later. This video can not be played 'Her place now is untenable' But Mr Beattie differentiated those events from the SAS killings of eight IRA men who were preparing to bomb a police station in Loughgall, County Armagh, in 1987. ""If you take the likes of Loughgall, that was force on force and was absolutely right,"" he added. ""Bloody Sunday was not and if there is evidence against those people who killed those innocent civilians then the law must be seen to run its course."" Victims' families have called for Mrs Bradley to resign. John Kelly, whose teenage brother Michael was killed on Bloody Sunday, described her remarks as ""outrageous"". John Teggart,whose father was killed in the 1971 Ballymurphy shootings, also said she should quit.

"This video can not be played Video showed the women and men singing and dancing at a wedding, as Orla Guerin reported in 2012 The man at the centre of a campaign to expose one of Pakistan's most notorious ""honour killings"" cases has been shot dead nearly seven years after he brought it to national attention. M Ilyas Khan reports from Islamabad. A video showing two men dancing as four women sing a wedding song to the beat of clapping would pass as normal anywhere in the world. But this scene, filmed in 2011 in rural Pakistan, led to chilling consequences. The women in the video, and a young female member of the family who was also at the scene, are believed to have been killed by male relatives for ""breaching their honour"". Afzal Kohistani, a brother of the men in the video, has now been killed too. His death comes amid a blood feud that has also seen three of his other brothers killed. Mr Kohistani was shot dead in a busy commercial area of the north-western city of Abbottabad on Wednesday night, police said, quoting witnesses to the killing. He suffered multiple injuries and died on the spot, they said. Afzal Kohistani had warned his life was in danger In 2012, Mr Kohistani entered the public eye as one of the first Pakistanis to violate a local custom in remote northern Kohistan district whereby matters of family honour are settled in blood. Those perceived to have violated the code are killed with the mutual consent of families involved. About 1,000 ""honour-killings"" of women by relatives are recorded each year in Pakistan, say human rights campaigners. The real number is likely to be much higher. A much smaller number of men are murdered in such cases. According to the custom, the male family members of a woman suspected of an out-of-wedlock liaison should first kill the woman, and then go after the man. The family of the man would not oppose this action. Why do families kill their daughters? Tracing the life of a woman 'killed for honour' Disregarding this local code, Mr Kohistani brought the wedding video case to national attention in June 2012, when he claimed that the women in the video had been killed by their family a month earlier, and that the lives of his younger brothers, two of whom were seen dancing in the footage, were in danger. The pair were sent into hiding. At this point human rights groups had taken notice of the case and began lobbying the courts - prompting the Supreme Court to order an inquiry. But the investigators found no conclusive evidence of the so-called honour killings of the women, which are illegal under Pakistani law. They were presented with three women who family members said were proof that those who appeared in the video were alive. Farzana Bari, an activist and academic who took part in the inquiry, said she had suspicions that at least two of the women were ""imposters"", but the Supreme Court closed the case. Afzal Kohistani's decision to break the traditional codes - Kohistan is one of the most conservative and inaccessible parts of Pakistan - sparked a feud between his family and that of the women. This video can not be played The model and the mullah Three of his older brothers were killed in 2013 -  six men from the women's family were convicted in connection with the murders in what was seen as a landmark case in Kohistan. However they were acquitted by the high court in 2017. Family acquitted over Italy woman's killing Canadian 'honour killers' sent to India Amid the feud, Mr Kohistani's house was firebombed and destroyed but he did not relent. He moved home and continued to talk about what had happened to the women - lobbying police officers and courts and drawing attention from the media. ""He was a fearless voice in Pakistan,"" said Ms Bari. ""This is a man who has been struggling for the last seven years to get justice, and not justice only for him - for himself and his family - but he wanted justice for women not only in Kohistan but in the rest of the country."" Finally, in July 2018, the Supreme Court ordered a fresh police investigation, which led to five further arrests of men from the women's family. According to the police, the men admitted during interrogation that three of the four women seen in the video had been killed, but retracted their statement when they appeared before a magistrate. The case remains open but the killing of Afzal Kohistani deepens the tragedy - which started with a video of dancing and singing and has since spiralled into a bloody tale of Shakespearean proportions, with at least nine lives claimed. He had for years warned that his life was in danger, telling BBC Urdu in a recent interview that his family was living under constant threat. ""Justice will only be done when killers of the women and of my brothers will be sentenced. Only then can we expect an end to honour and reprisal killings in Kohistan."" Hours before his death, Afzal Kohistani told local journalists in Abbottabad that justice was closing in on those responsible for the murders and that he had been warned of an imminent threat to his life. It is the killing of a member of a family who is perceived to have brought dishonour upon relatives. Pressure group Human Rights Watch says the most common reasons are that the victim: refused to enter into an arranged marriage was the victim of a sexual assault or rape had sexual relations outside marriage, even if only alleged But killings can be carried out for more trivial reasons, like dressing in a way deemed inappropriate or displaying behaviour seen as disobedient.

He moved home and continued to talk about what had happened to the women - lobbying police officers and courts and drawing attention from the media. ""He was a fearless voice in Pakistan,"" said Ms Bari. ""This is a man who has been struggling for the last seven years to get justice, and not justice only for him - for himself and his family - but he wanted justice for women not only in Kohistan but in the rest of the country."" Finally, in July 2018, the Supreme Court ordered a fresh police investigation, which led to five further arrests of men from the women's family. According to the police, the men admitted during interrogation that three of the four women seen in the video had been killed, but retracted their statement when they appeared before a magistrate. The case remains open but the killing of Afzal Kohistani deepens the tragedy - which started with a video of dancing and singing and has since spiralled into a bloody tale of Shakespearean proportions, with at least nine lives claimed. He had for years warned that his life was in danger, telling BBC Urdu in a recent interview that his family was living under constant threat. ""Justice will only be done when killers of the women and of my brothers will be sentenced. Only then can we expect an end to honour and reprisal killings in Kohistan."" Hours before his death, Afzal Kohistani told local journalists in Abbottabad that justice was closing in on those responsible for the murders and that he had been warned of an imminent threat to his life. It is the killing of a member of a family who is perceived to have brought dishonour upon relatives. Pressure group Human Rights Watch says the most common reasons are that the victim: refused to enter into an arranged marriage was the victim of a sexual assault or rape had sexual relations outside marriage, even if only alleged But killings can be carried out for more trivial reasons, like dressing in a way deemed inappropriate or displaying behaviour seen as disobedient.

"Warnings that there is ""no need"" for patients to stockpile their own supply of drugs are being reiterated More warehouse capacity is being arranged by the Welsh Government to stockpile NHS products. The space, in south east Wales, will be used to hold medical supplies such as syringes, bandages and rubber gloves. Six weeks' additional stock has been arranged in case a no-deal Brexit leads to a disruption in supplies. The Welsh NHS has also identified ""alternative providers"" of these day-to-day items as part of its Brexit preparations. Some are concerned if the UK leaves the EU without a deal then extra checks at ports could lead to a backlog of lorries carrying essential items from Europe to the UK. MPs will once againvote on Theresa May's Brexit dealby next Tuesday at the latest. If it is rejected, the prime minister has promised to give MPs votes which could delay Brexit beyond the scheduled departure of 29 March. Despite the possible delay, First Minister Mark Drakeford said the Welsh Government will continue with no-deal Brexit preparations ""until we are completely sure that the only way we could leave the European Union is with a deal"". As part of its no-deal Brexit preparations for the Welsh NHS, the Welsh Government has been working on back-up plans for medical products and devices, following a review of the relevant supply chains by the accountancy firm Deloitte. About half the items bought within the Welsh NHS are from EU countries, according to the body that represents health boards in Wales. Vanessa Young, director of the Welsh NHS Confederation, said: ""We've gone out to suppliers and said to them to work with us to increase that supply and so through doing that we've identified a small number where there might be potential difficulties in getting those supplies and then putting in place plans to say, well, if we can't get that exact product - what's an alternative product we could source and secure?"" 'No need' to stockpile own drugs What preparations are being made for a no-deal? Drug firms fear 'wasting' money on Brexit Medical supplies are currently stored in Denbigh, Bridgend and Cwmbran The Welsh NHS stores much of its medical supplies in three big warehouses in Bridgend, Cwmbran and Denbigh. The Welsh Government and Welsh NHS Confederation confirmed to BBC Wales contracts are likely to be finalised in ""the next week or so"" for additional warehousing capacity in the south east. A source at Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board said they were ""highly confident that we will ensure continuity of supply and that there'll be no disruption to the clinical services that are being provided"". In response to a Freedom of Information request, Cardiff and the Vale University Health Board released notes from its Brexit No Deal Business Continuity Task and Finish Group, which highlighted the need for additional storage and raised particular concerns around the supply of medical goods. The notes, dated 15 November, said: ""A key risk which relates specifically to the UHB [University Health Board] relates to supplies of radio-pharmacy products, and products used in the provision of tertiary services - such as coils used in neurosurgery where there is a single supplier which is based in mainland Europe. ""It was confirmed that we hold the SE [south east] Wales contract for renal dialysis fluid products, and the supplier is based in Europe,"" it added. Ms Young said the NHS in Wales ""has done a lot of preparations"", including desk-based rehearsals and role-play exercises to deal with the possibility of disruption. She reiterated previous official warnings that there is ""no need"" forpatients to stockpile their own supply of drugs. Health Minister Vaughan Gething is hoping to raise any outstanding issues around Brexit preparations for the NHS at a meeting with the UK and Scottish health secretaries, provisionally booked in for next week.

"Left, Margaret Hanlon, right, murder victim Julie Reilly The mother of murdered Glasgow woman Julie Reilly has welcomed the discovery of her daughter's remains. Margaret Hanlon toldBBC Scotland's The Nineher family will now hold a funeral for Ms Reilly - and thanked her killer for revealing the location where she was buried to police. Ms Hanlon said she was ""happy that we've found all of Julie"". Andrew Wallace is serving at least 28 years in prison for killing Ms Reilly, 47, in her Govan flat in February 2018. Police investigating Ms Reilly's murder confirmed human remains were found in the back garden of a tenement block. Forensic teams made the discovery while searching the area at Lorne Street, Cessnock, on Wednesday. The back garden of a tenement block has been searched Andrew Wallace was given a mandatory life sentence for Julie Reilly's murder Ms Hanlon said: ""We only buried two parts of her and we can do a proper funeral now. ""We had the inspector this morning who told us they had found remains and said they were Julie. ""We asked if it was all of her, and he said yes."" Wallace, 42, cut off her legs with a knife and put the remains in plastic bags and suitcases, before burying them near her home. The convicted killer was arrested for Ms Reilly's murder after the discovery of two leg bones close to her home. Forensic teams have been searching at the property The High Court in Glasgow was told that Ms Reilly had a brain injury which caused problems with her memory, slowed her reactions and affected her speech. She was befriended by Wallace, and had allowed him to stay with her at her home in Shieldhall Road after he split up with his girlfriend in December 2017. She thought he would help to care for her, but the court heard he saw her as being ""easy to manipulate and rip off"". The last recorded sighting of Ms Reilly was on 6 February last year. Police cars outside the flats in Lorne Street The following day Wallace told a friend he needed ""to get rid of a body"". He also sent texts claiming that Ms Reilly had moved to the Penilee area of Glasgow. In the following days he was seen at the homes of two friends with heavy suitcases. Following the latest discovery, a Police Scotland spokesman said a post-mortem examination would take place, with further tests required to confirm formal identification.

"Tom Ballard and Daniele Nardi before their last contact with their team ""Silhouettes"" have been spotted on the passage taken by two missing climbers on a mountain in Pakistan. Briton Tom Ballard and Italian Daniele Nardi last made contact from Nanga Parbat in Pakistan at an altitude of about 20,700ft (6,300m), 11 days ago. The search has resumed despite reports the men were ""assumed to be dead"" following a ""huge avalanche"". Earlier, Spanish climber Alex Txikon saw the two ""shapes"" on the Mummery Spur trail that the men had taken. According to Mr Nardi's Facebook page,external, which is updated by his support team, Mr Txikon identified ""two silhouettes"" on the mountain from the base camp early on Thursday. A Pakistani army helicopter was due to investigate them further, but they were diverted for military purposes, according to Stefano Pontecorvo, the Italian ambassador to Pakistan. Mr Pontecorvo, who had earlier denied reports the search had ended, said it was a ""possibility"" the shapes are the two men. He has told the BBC that a helicopter search will probably resume on Friday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The two climbers went missing 11 days ago on what's known as the Killer Mountain and nothing has been heard from them since. The rescue mission was expected to finish on Wednesday and the base camp was dismantled. But members of the rescue team are now due to be taken high up the mountain by helicopter to look at areas they'd not searched previously.

"This video can not be played Video showed the women and men singing and dancing at a wedding, as Orla Guerin reported in 2012 The man at the centre of a campaign to expose one of Pakistan's most notorious ""honour killings"" cases has been shot dead nearly seven years after he brought it to national attention. M Ilyas Khan reports from Islamabad. A video showing two men dancing as four women sing a wedding song to the beat of clapping would pass as normal anywhere in the world. But this scene, filmed in 2011 in rural Pakistan, led to chilling consequences. The women in the video, and a young female member of the family who was also at the scene, are believed to have been killed by male relatives for ""breaching their honour"". Afzal Kohistani, a brother of the men in the video, has now been killed too. His death comes amid a blood feud that has also seen three of his other brothers killed. Mr Kohistani was shot dead in a busy commercial area of the north-western city of Abbottabad on Wednesday night, police said, quoting witnesses to the killing. He suffered multiple injuries and died on the spot, they said. Afzal Kohistani had warned his life was in danger In 2012, Mr Kohistani entered the public eye as one of the first Pakistanis to violate a local custom in remote northern Kohistan district whereby matters of family honour are settled in blood. Those perceived to have violated the code are killed with the mutual consent of families involved. About 1,000 ""honour-killings"" of women by relatives are recorded each year in Pakistan, say human rights campaigners. The real number is likely to be much higher. A much smaller number of men are murdered in such cases. According to the custom, the male family members of a woman suspected of an out-of-wedlock liaison should first kill the woman, and then go after the man. The family of the man would not oppose this action. Why do families kill their daughters? Tracing the life of a woman 'killed for honour' Disregarding this local code, Mr Kohistani brought the wedding video case to national attention in June 2012, when he claimed that the women in the video had been killed by their family a month earlier, and that the lives of his younger brothers, two of whom were seen dancing in the footage, were in danger. The pair were sent into hiding. At this point human rights groups had taken notice of the case and began lobbying the courts - prompting the Supreme Court to order an inquiry. But the investigators found no conclusive evidence of the so-called honour killings of the women, which are illegal under Pakistani law. They were presented with three women who family members said were proof that those who appeared in the video were alive. Farzana Bari, an activist and academic who took part in the inquiry, said she had suspicions that at least two of the women were ""imposters"", but the Supreme Court closed the case. Afzal Kohistani's decision to break the traditional codes - Kohistan is one of the most conservative and inaccessible parts of Pakistan - sparked a feud between his family and that of the women. This video can not be played The model and the mullah Three of his older brothers were killed in 2013 -  six men from the women's family were convicted in connection with the murders in what was seen as a landmark case in Kohistan. However they were acquitted by the high court in 2017.

"This video can not be played Sir Charlie Mayfield John Lewis has paid out its lowest bonus to staff since the 1950s as profits plunged last year amid ""challenging"" trading. The retail partnership - which includes Waitrose supermarkets - said staff would receive a 3% bonus, the lowest since 1953 when workers got no bonus. Profits at the partnership sank last year by more than 45% to Â£160m. It blamed poor home sales, discounting, higher IT costs and the cost of opening two new stores last year for the drop. John Lewis famously promises that it is ""never knowingly undersold"", meaning it matches its High Street rivals' prices. Four reasons John Lewis is under pressure John Lewis staff bonus in doubt The partnership said ""near constant discounting"" from rivals had hit profits, particularly in its department store shops. John Lewis' structure is unique. It is owned by its staff, known as partners. Typically in profitable years, staff at the 350 Waitrose and 51 John Lewis stores receive a share of the profits. In the very best years, these bonuses can add the equivalent of a few months' worth of pay. But the annual staff bonus has been reduced every year for the past six years due to difficult trading conditions. Sir Charlie Mayfield, chairman of the John Lewis Partnership, said the lower bonus would help the company to preserve cash and invest ""to cope with the continuing uncertainty facing consumers and the economy"". Analysis: Howard Mustoe, business reporter There are four key reasons the department store chain is struggling. It's ""Never Knowingly Undersold"" guarantee ties its hands on price as it matches the price of a product with competitors. There's also the general ""relevance problem"" of department stores, with the rise of online shopping. And there's the squeeze on incomes that is seeing consumers cut back on certain types of spending. And staying relevant costs money - John Lewis has had to invest in IT, as many other retailers have, to meet customer demand. Read more here There was brighter news from Waitrose - but it is closing five stores John Lewis said ""subdued demand, excess retail space and some other retailers' distress"" had led to big discounts by shops since last October. Like-for-like sales, which exclude sales from new stores, fell 1.4% in its department stores last year. It said weaker home sales in particular had contributed to the drop, with ""subdued"" consumer confidence hitting demand for ""big ticket and bespoke items"". The department store model has been under pressure for several years. BHS collapsed in 2016, while House of Fraser was bought out of administration by Sports Direct owner Mike Ashley last year. Earlier this week, struggling department store chainDebenhams issued its fourth profit warningin a little over a year as its sales continued to fall. Sir Charlie - who is stepping down next year - said the current High Street problems were ""an inevitable market adjustment which will require greater clarity on whether brands are competing on scale or difference."" Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Laith Khalaf said the fact that John Lewis was struggling showed how bad the situation was. ""If the bellwether John Lewis is creaking, you can be sure others are feeling the pain. ""In the short term, things don't look like getting much better, but further out, John Lewis may ultimately pick up market share from others who fall by the wayside. A larger slice of the pie could be the reward for staying the course, but what remains to be seen is just how big a pie is left after the current shift in retail washes through the system."" One brighter spot in the results was Waitrose. Like-for-like sales at the supermarket rose 1.3% last year, with profits up 18%. However, John Lewis said it had sold off five of its Waitrose stores to rival retailers, putting 440 roles at risk of redundancy. The firm said the shops were not ""commercially sustainable"" in the long term. The affected stores are: Ashbourne, Derbyshire (7,710 sq ft) Barry, Vale of Glamorgan (25,909 sq ft) Blaby, Leicestershire (6,773 sq ft) Teignmouth, Devon (19,374 sq ft) Torquay, Devon (12,508 sq ft) On Brexit, the partnership said it was ""in a good position for a managed transition"". But warned an unmanaged transition risked ""a strong fall in consumer confidence and the impact that has on trade"".

"Greggs - getting a taste for vegans Greggs has credited the fanfare around the launch of its vegan sausage roll for driving a sharp rise in sales. The bakery chain said the publicity the snack gained helped sales surge 9.6% in the seven weeks to 16 February. The snack, made from meat substitute quorn, launched at the start of the year, coinciding with Veganuary when many people go vegan for a month. The update on current trading came as the firm said annual sales had broken through Â£1bn for the first time. Chief executive Roger Whiteside said Greggs had spent ""millions of pounds"" transforming how people perceived the chain. ""We want people to reappraise us and understand we've moved on from being a pure bakery business to offering people food on the go,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. People wanting ""healthier food options"" could now find them at the chain, he said. Greggs and the 'sausage roll' masterstroke Mr Whiteside said the chain, which has already held one-off evening openings for events such as Valentine's Day, was also ""looking to move into the evening food market"". Greggs now has 1,953 stores across the UK, and Mr Whiteside said it planned to get to 2,000 stores by the end of the year. Pre-tax profit last year rose 15% to Â£82.6m, marking the fifth year in a row that profits have increased. The firms's shares have almost doubled in value since July last year. ""There's a lot to like about Greggs - it's a publicity machine, recession-proof, and has a knack for adapting to consumer habits,"" said Arlene Ewing, Investment Manager at Brewin Dolphin. Much of the chain's success has been driven by savvy marketing. The ad campaign for its vegan sausage roll has been called ""a master class in public relations"" by the industry magazine PR Week. Journalists were sent vegan rolls in mock iPhone packaging and stores sold sausage roll phone cases. Publicity surrounding the campaign exploded when Piers Morgan, presenter of ITV's Good Morning Britain, criticised the new snack, calling Greggs ""PC-ravaged clowns"" in a tweet. by Dominic O'Connell, Today business presenter When daytime TV host Piers Morgan poured scorn on the vegan sausage roll, Greggs' social media team was ready to roll. ""Oh hello Piers, we've been expecting you,"" was the immediate tweet, a James Bond-inspired, gently droll putdown that was the perfect riposte. Greggs marketing and social media may be quirky and fun, but there is a deadly serious intent behind it - to push customers into what the company calls a ""reappraisal"" - a realisation that Greggs is no longer just a bakery chain, but a fast-food and even dining proposition that competes with everyone from McDonald's to Patisserie Valerie. Come to try the vegan sausage roll, and come back when you realise the coffee is cheap and (hopefully) not disgusting. This hard work is evident in the results - a decent increase in pre-tax profits, and, best of all for investors, the prospect of a special extra dividend later in the year.

"This video can not be played Amber Rudd: Abuse is ""worst of all if you're a coloured woman"" Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd has apologised for using the word ""coloured"" in a BBC interview. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott criticised the use of the term, saying it was ""outdated"", ""offensive"" and a ""revealing choice of words"". During a discussion about MP abuse, Ms Rudd said: ""It's worst of all if you're a coloured woman. I know that Diane Abbott gets a huge amount of abuse."" In her apology, Ms Rudd said she was ""mortified at my clumsy language"". The prime minister's official spokeswoman said making an apology was ""absolutely the right thing to do"". Historically, the word is associated with segregation, especially in the US, where black people were kept separate from white people - on public transport, or at drinking fountains which were described as ""coloured-only"" for example. It is regarded as an offensive racial slur which recalls a time when casual racism was a part of everyday life. Why the term 'coloured' is offensive The exchange happened during an interview on BBC Radio 2's Jeremy Vine show. Host Jeremy Vine asked Ms Rudd: ""The question is, given that all people in the public eye seem to get terrible tweets from strangers, whether it's worse if you're a woman?"" Ms Rudd replied: ""It definitely is worse if you're a woman, it's worst of all if you're a coloured woman. ""I know that Diane Abbott gets a huge amount of abuse, that's something we need to call out."" But Ms Abbott responded on Twitter, saying it was a ""revealing choice of words"".

Separately, Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom has been criticised for her response to a question from Labour MP Naz Shah, about Islamophobia. The shadow women and equalities minister had called for a Commons debate, after the former Tory minister Baroness Warsi criticised the Conservatives over Islamophobia. Ms Shah added that the all-party parliamentary group on British Muslims had recently published a definition of Islamophobia. Mrs Leadsom replied that the Conservatives had an ""extremely robust and urgent"" response to Islamophobia but went on to suggest that, on the definition of Islamophobia, Ms Shah ""can discuss with Foreign Office ministers whether that would be a useful way forward"". Ms Shah said later: ""To say that British Muslims facing Islamophobia here in the UK is a 'Foreign Office' issue is truly baffling and horrifically alludes to British Muslims as foreigners. ""It just goes to show how out of touch the Tories are with a problem that their politicians and councillors are exacerbating."" A spokesman for the Commons Leader's office spokesman said: ""Islamophobia is unacceptable wherever it takes place. ""It was thought the MP for Bradford West was referring to a global definition of Islamophobia. ""International efforts to combat Islamophobia (and all forms of religious persecution and prejudice) are lead by the PM's special envoy on freedom of religion or belief, Lord Ahmad, at the Foreign & Commonwealth Office. ""Of course, any form of Islamophobia in the UK would be dealt with swiftly by the Home Office or Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government as appropriate.""

"Mosul was hit by bombing raids and retaken from IS The RAF killed or injured 4,315 enemy fighters in Iraq and Syria between September 2014 and January this year, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has said. Yet the MoD says only one civilian was killed in the airstrikes, according to figures released to the charity Action on Armed Violence (AOAV). Of those harmed, 4,013, or 93%, were killed, and 302, or 7%, were injured. The MoD said its data came from ""the best available post-strike analysis"" - video and photos taken from the air. The data from the MoD, obtained following a Freedom of Information request from AOAV, says: In Iraq, 2,994 were killed and 235 wounded In Syria, 1,019 died and 67 were hurt They were killed by bombing raids from Typhoons (37%) Tornados (31%) and Reapers (32%) But the AOAV, a research charity, says it believes civilian deaths have been under-reported, as 1,000 targets were hit by the RAF during its bombing campaign in the cities of Raqqa and Mosul. The US coalition, of which the UK is a member, say they conducted a total of 33,921 strikes between August 2014 and end of January 2019, and at least 1,257 civilians have been unintentionally killed by during this period. Airwars, an organisation which tracks civilian deaths, believes between 7,500 and 12,077 non-combatants are likely to have died over the same period. Allow Twitter content?

The one civilian casualty the UK has said it was responsible for would amount to just 0.09% of all of the coalition's civilian casualties. AOAV's executive director, Iain Overton, said: ""The RAF's claim of a ratio of one civilian casualty against 4,315 enemies must be a world record in modern conflict."" More should be done to improve transparency about casualties, he added. Lydia Wilson, research fellow at Oxford University's Centre for the Resolution of Intractable Conflict, said it is ""absurd"" to suggest only one civilian was killed ""given the pictures we have from the bombardment of Raqqa, Mosul, and other targets in the Islamic State."" Ms Wilson says Raqqa, which was the capital of the so-called Islamic State, is now ""simply rubble"". She said: ""I would ask how the RAF came at their numbers; that is, how they distinguish between fighters and civilians when buildings have collapsed on top of inhabitants, and on-the-ground, independent reporting is impossible."" RAF strikes on IS in Iraq 'may have killed civilians' MoD admits civilian died in RAF strike on Islamic State Have RAF air strikes killed civilians? After the caliphate: Has IS been defeated? By BBC Defence Correspondent Jonathan Beale These appear to be extraordinarily precise figures, given the limited intelligence and information the UK has had on the ground in both Iraq and Syria. The MoD says the information is based on the ""best available post-strike analysis"". That often means relying largely on video and photos taken by aircraft flying high above the battlefield. It's not an exact science. The imagery can provide a lot of detail, but it cannot eliminate uncertainties. Two people looking at the same imagery can come to different conclusions. Nor can aircraft sensors and cameras see through buildings. There have been a number of reported incidents when civilians have been killed hiding in buildings - unseen by the aircraft flying above. The RAF insists it's taken extreme care to avoid civilian casualties and that this has been the most ""precise"" air campaign in history. But history also suggests that ""body counts"" should be treated with caution. The UK took part in bombing against the group calling itself the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq as part of a coalition of 75 countries that came together in 2014. The coalition also included forces from Australia, Bahrain, France, Jordan, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. It carried out more than 33,000 air strikes. This video can not be played In 2017, the BBC's Jonathan Beale spoke to RAF crews about the challenges they face in avoiding civilian casualties in Iraq and Syria An MoD spokesperson said the air campaign had been the most ""transparent"" in history, with details of the more than 1,700 RAF air strikes, along with confirmation in March 2018 when a civilian was killed. They said each strike was reviewed in detail to ensure it achieved its objective, including whether there had been any civilian casualties. All missions complied with international humanitarian law and were carefully planned to minimise the effects on civilians, they added. They said: ""After every British airstrike we conduct detailed battle damage assessment, which thoroughly examines the outcome of the strike against its target, be it fighters, weapons, or bases.

"Left, Margaret Hanlon, right, murder victim Julie Reilly The mother of murdered Glasgow woman Julie Reilly has welcomed the discovery of her daughter's remains. Margaret Hanlon toldBBC Scotland's The Nineher family will now hold a funeral for Ms Reilly - and thanked her killer for revealing the location where she was buried to police. Ms Hanlon said she was ""happy that we've found all of Julie"". Andrew Wallace is serving at least 28 years in prison for killing Ms Reilly, 47, in her Govan flat in February 2018. Police investigating Ms Reilly's murder confirmed human remains were found in the back garden of a tenement block. Forensic teams made the discovery while searching the area at Lorne Street, Cessnock, on Wednesday. The back garden of a tenement block has been searched Andrew Wallace was given a mandatory life sentence for Julie Reilly's murder Ms Hanlon said: ""We only buried two parts of her and we can do a proper funeral now. ""We had the inspector this morning who told us they had found remains and said they were Julie. ""We asked if it was all of her, and he said yes."" Wallace, 42, cut off her legs with a knife and put the remains in plastic bags and suitcases, before burying them near her home. The convicted killer was arrested for Ms Reilly's murder after the discovery of two leg bones close to her home. Forensic teams have been searching at the property The High Court in Glasgow was told that Ms Reilly had a brain injury which caused problems with her memory, slowed her reactions and affected her speech. She was befriended by Wallace, and had allowed him to stay with her at her home in Shieldhall Road after he split up with his girlfriend in December 2017. She thought he would help to care for her, but the court heard he saw her as being ""easy to manipulate and rip off"". The last recorded sighting of Ms Reilly was on 6 February last year. Police cars outside the flats in Lorne Street The following day Wallace told a friend he needed ""to get rid of a body"". He also sent texts claiming that Ms Reilly had moved to the Penilee area of Glasgow. In the following days he was seen at the homes of two friends with heavy suitcases. Following the latest discovery, a Police Scotland spokesman said a post-mortem examination would take place, with further tests required to confirm formal identification.

"This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt: ""I am sure that that is what Theresa May will tell Nicola Sturgeon if she makes that request."" A senior UK government minister has said it would ""of course"" refuse to give permission for a second independence referendum. Speaking during a visit to Glasgow, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the answer to any request for another vote would be ""no"". First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in January she would give an update on her plans for a referendum ""in weeks"". But she has stressed that she will not hold a referendum without an agreement. The UK and Scottish governmentssigned an agreement in October 2012,externalwhich allowed the Scottish Parliament to legislate for the independence referendum to be held two years later. Ms Sturgeon told BBC Scotland on Thursday afternoon that she was ""not open to the possibility"" of another referendum being held without a similar agreement in place. UK 'will reject Sturgeon's Indyref2 calls' Indyref2 update 'even if Brexit delayed' There have been calls from some within the independence movement for an unofficial referendum to be held, similar to the one in Catalonia in 2017, if the UK government's position does not change. But Ms Sturgeon said: ""My view is clear and always has been clear. The legal basis of any future independence referendum should be the same as the referendum in 2014, which is the transfer of power under a section 30 order. ""Of course the only reason we're talking about this is because of the anti-democratic stance of the Conservatives, who I think are running so scared of the will of the Scottish people on independence. ""They refuse to acknowledge the democratic mandate that the Scottish government has."" This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: ""The legal basis for the next independence referendum should be the same as the basis for the last."" She was speaking after video footage emerged on the Broadcasting Scotland channel on Youtube of SNP deputy leader Keith Brown telling activists in Aberdeen last month that: ""If we want to have a referendum, then we decide we're going to have a referendum"". The Scottish Conservatives claimed it proves the SNP is ""planning for an illegal referendum"" - but Mr Brown said his comments had been misinterpreted. In a statement, he said: ""My position is clear - the deeply undemocratic stance of the UK government in denying the mandate for indyref and refusing a Section 30 order should not prevent the Scottish government seeking one and planning on the basis of winning that case."" A video of Mr Brown addressing independence activists in Aberdeen has been uploaded to Youtube Several sources told the BBC last monththat the UK government was preparing to reject any call from the Scottish government for the power to hold another referendum. Mr Hunt confirmed this was the case as he was asked by journalists during a visit to Glasgow University whether Mrs May's response should be ""yes or no"". The foreign secretary said: ""The answer of course would be no for the very simple reason that we think the Scottish government should be focusing on the concerns of Scottish voters, which is not to have another very divisive independence referendum but to focus on an education system which used to be the envy of the world and standards are now falling, to focus on long waits in the NHS. ""That's what Scottish voters want the Scottish government to focus on and I am sure that that is what Theresa May will tell Nicola Sturgeon if she makes that request."" Ms Sturgeon called for a new independence vote in the aftermath of the EU referendum, which saw 62% of Scottish voters back remain only for the UK as a whole to vote to leave. However, the SNP leader subsequently ""reset"" her timetable after her party lost 21 seats in the snap general election of 2017. Having previously said she must ""wait for the fog of Brexit to clear"" before settling on a new plan, Ms Sturgeon told MSPs on 17 January that she would outline her thoughts on the timing of a second independence referendum within ""weeks"" - even if Brexit was delayed. The SNP say its 2016 Holyrood election manifesto gives them the right to hold another vote. Ms Sturgeon's party won that election, with the manifesto including a commitment that another referendum could be held if there was a significant change in circumstances from 2014 - such as Scotland being taken out of the European Union against the wishes of voters north of the border.

"Tom Ballard and Daniele Nardi before their last contact with their team ""Silhouettes"" have been spotted on the passage taken by two missing climbers on a mountain in Pakistan. Briton Tom Ballard and Italian Daniele Nardi last made contact from Nanga Parbat in Pakistan at an altitude of about 20,700ft (6,300m), 11 days ago. The search has resumed despite reports the men were ""assumed to be dead"" following a ""huge avalanche"". Earlier, Spanish climber Alex Txikon saw the two ""shapes"" on the Mummery Spur trail that the men had taken. According to Mr Nardi's Facebook page,external, which is updated by his support team, Mr Txikon identified ""two silhouettes"" on the mountain from the base camp early on Thursday. A Pakistani army helicopter was due to investigate them further, but they were diverted for military purposes, according to Stefano Pontecorvo, the Italian ambassador to Pakistan. Mr Pontecorvo, who had earlier denied reports the search had ended, said it was a ""possibility"" the shapes are the two men. He has told the BBC that a helicopter search will probably resume on Friday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

On Wednesday, Karrar Haidri, from Pakistan's Alpine Club, saidit had been a ""painful decision""to end the search. However, Mr Pontecorvo strongly denied the rescue was over. Tom Ballard has been described as one of the world's best climbers He said: ""Until they tell me that there is no scope to continue I'd say that together with the family I'd encourage them to go forward. ""If we come to a point in which everything possible has been done and nothing has been found, at that point it will be up to the families - although advised by us - to call it off. We're not there yet."" Nanga Parbat, the ninth highest peak in the world, is known as ""Killer Mountain"" The rescue team in Pakistan is expected to make another attempt to scour the mountain for any trace of them. The two climbers went missing 11 days ago on what's known as the Killer Mountain and nothing has been heard from them since. The rescue mission was expected to finish on Wednesday and the base camp was dismantled. But members of the rescue team are now due to be taken high up the mountain by helicopter to look at areas they'd not searched previously. The BBC's been told they will take high resolution photographs and video which can then be analysed.

"Police forces in England and Wales must use their existing budgets to tackle knife crime, the chancellor has said. Senior officers and crime commissioners had called for more money to pay for extra officers. On Thursday, a teenager became the fifth person to be stabbed to death in London in the last week. But Philip Hammond said police must use money and officers from other parts of their forces to deal with the problem. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott told MPs the suggestion was ""monstrous"". During an urgent question on knife crime in the Commons on Thursday, Ms Abbott said it was ""an insult to grieving families"", and added: ""The police are under pressure in nearly every area. What we need is more resources for the police and we need them now."" A male in his late teensdied on Thursday afternoon,after being stabbed in West Kensington, London. According to the BBC's home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw, it is the Met Police's seventh murder investigation launched in the past seven days, with five of the victims having died from stab wounds. Two other people have been stabbed to death in the past week in England - a man in Oxford and Yousef Makki in Greater Manchester. Excluded pupils 'sucked into knife crime' Knife crime and the austerity question Treat knife crime like a disease - Javid The chancellor told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there had to be a ""surging of resources from other areas of policing activity into dealing with this spike in knife crime"". ""That's what you do in any organisation when you get a specific problem occurring in one area of the operation, you move resources to deal with that,"" he added. Yousef Makki and Jodie Chesney, both 17, were killed in separate knife attacks two days apart Earlier, he told LBC: ""If your house is on fire, you stop painting it and you go and get a bucket and start pouring water on the fire."" He said police commissioners and chief constables across the country needed to divert resources from ""lower priority areas of policing"". Asked what those ""lower priority areas"" were, he said ""it's not my job to define the operational priorities of individual police forces"". Home Secretary Sajid Javid,who held talks with police chiefs on Wednesday,said after the meeting it was important to ""always make sure the police have the resources they need"". The Home Office said it would not comment on Mr Hammond's comments. By BBC Home Affairs correspondent Danny Shaw There's clearly tension at the heart of government about whether forces in England and Wales should have extra money to tackle knife crime. Home Secretary Sajid Javid nailed his colours to the police mast on Wednesday saying their requests needed to be ""listened to"". There was quiet optimism amid senior officer ranks that additional funding would be made available. That's been thrown into doubt by Chancellor Philip Hammond's comments suggesting chief constables should use their existing budgets. His remarks are likely to reflect annoyance that police are asking for more just three months after he approved a financial settlement for 2019-20 which will enable forces to step up recruitment. Mr Hammond may also be sending wider signals to dampen expectations about government spending, ahead of next week's Spring Statement. But for many police officers his comments will be seen as confirmation that he doesn't understand the pressures they're working under. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said on Tuesdaythere was ""obviously"" a link between violent crime and falling police numbers,but Theresa May insisted there was ""no direct correlation"". Father of murdered teenager Jodie Chesney appeals for attacker to come forward - BBC News On Wednesday, Sara Thornton, chairwoman of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said tackling knife crime should be treated as an ""emergency"". She told the BBC: ""We just haven't got the capacity, we just haven't got the officers at the moment so we need some money now to pay for overtime to pay for mutual aid between forces."" Home Office minister Victoria Atkins told MPs the government had increased funding for the police.

Lib Dem MSP Alex Cole-Hamilton Lib Dem MSP Alex Cole-Hamilton reflects on the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh before being appointed to the Supreme Court of the US. The highest law officers on the planet, like the highest politicians on the planet, must be held to the highest standards he argues. If any of the qualities exhibited by Kavanaugh had been exhibited by a women, would she have got that job,  asks the Lib Dem MSP. He goes on to highlight the Gender-Based Pricing (Prohibition) Bill, legislation to tackle different pricing for products aimed at men and women brought forward by his colleague Christine Jardine MP. The struggle against sexism still exists today which we see in hearings like Brett Kavanaugh's, he states. This year's International Women's Day campaign has chosen the theme#BalanceforBetter,external, which encourages people around the world to take action towards accelerating gender balance. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez became the youngest woman elected to Congress in November 2018. The past 18 months have seen the women's movement reach an unprecedented scale. In October 2017, millions began using the hashtag #MeToo on social media to speak out against experiences of harassment and sexual assault, and to denounce their widespread prevalence. In 2018, the #MeToo conversation grew to a global scale, with countries such as India, France, China, and South Korea joining in the conversation to demand change. In the US a record number of women were elected in the midterm elections. In Ireland, citizens voted to repeal the eighth amendment of the constitution, paving the way for legalised abortion. Green MSP Andy Wightman Green MSP Andy Wightman says the continuing need for International Women's Day, calling for equality, is disappointing indeed. Mr Wightman says women nowhere in the world can claim to have the same rights as men and violence against women and girls persists. He points out women and girls remain among the most discriminated against human beings. The struggle for true equality between the sexes is the biggest social struggle and men have a part to play in addressing the issues he says. Ms Grant says to get equality, there must be equality at home as well as work. Women make up the majority of single parent households and they have been particularly badly hit by welfare changes made by the UK government, she notes. ""Is sexism so entrenched in our society that even our welfare system reflects this?"" Ms Grant says we need to teach boys to respect and we need to regulate online pornography. When a parent abuses their partner, they also abuse their child so they must be prevented from having access, the Labour MSP insists. An International Women's Day demonstration in Diyarbakir, Turkey in 2016 International Women's Day grew out of the labour movement to become a UN-recognised annual event. The seeds of it were planted in 1908, when 15,000 women marched through New York City demanding shorter working hours, better pay and the right to vote. It was the Socialist Party of America who declared the first National Woman's Day, a year later. The idea to make the day international came from a woman called Clara Zetkin. She suggested the idea in 1910 at an International Conference of Working Women in Copenhagen. There were 100 women there, from 17 countries, and they agreed on her suggestion unanimously. It was first celebrated in 1911, in Austria, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland. The centenary was celebrated in 2011, so this year we're technically celebrating the 108th International Women's Day. Read more here. Clara Zetkin founded International Women's Day in 1910 Labour MSP Rhoda Grant Labour MSP Rhoda Grant says if you are a man you are far more likely to be selected or elected, simply because you are a man. Ms Grant argues that people who say merit works now are really saying women have less merit. People with this view are sexist and they must change, she says. ""We all lose out if we don't hear women's voices."" Tory MSP Annie Wells highlights the girls are less likely to go into apprenticeships, and women still earn less than men. Systemic change is still needed, she says. Childcare is imperative to this as women are still faced with the societal expectation that they should lead on care giving, explains Ms Wells. I wholeheartedly support the purpose of International Women's Day and I hope we can inspire women and men to make the changes needed, the Tory MSP concludes. Friday 8 March is International Women's Day, an annual celebration of women's achievement socially, economically, politically and culturally. The first International Women's Day was honoured in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Denmark on 19 March 1911. One hundred and seven years on, the day is marked in hundreds of countries.

"Cern is the home of the Large Hadron Collider - the most powerful particle collider on Earth The European particle physics research centre Cern has cut ties with the scientist who said that women were less able at physics than men. Cern has decided not to extend Professor Alessandro Strumiaâs status of guest professor. The decision follows an investigation into comments, first reported by BBC News, made by Prof Strumia at a Cern workshop on gender equality. Prof Strumia told BBC News that he stood by his remarks. ""Some people hated hearing about higher male variance: this idea comes from Darwin, like other offensive ideas that got observational support,"" he told BBC News. ""Science is not about being offended when facts challenge ideas held as sacred"". He added that he believed that he had not been fairly treated. ""For months, Cern kept 'investigating' if my 30-minute talk might have violated Cern rules [requiring an] 'obligation to exercise reserve and tact in expressing personal opinions and communication to the public',"" Prof Strumia said. ""In such a case, they would have opened some procedure, where I would have been able [to defend] myself. This never happened."" Last September, Professor Strumia stated that âphysics was invented and built by men, it's not by invitation"" at a presentation at the Cern the workshop. Prof Alessandro Strumia is based at Pisa University in Italy He also showed cartoons deriding women campaigning for equality in science and presented the results of an analysis that he claimed showed that work conducted by female physicists was not as good as their male counterparts. First woman Physics Nobel winner in 55 years Seven trailblazing women in science 'We want to be accepted into the club' His analysis was quickly dismissed as being unscientific and incorrect by experts in the impact of research. But Profesor Strumia told BBC News that his analysis would eventually be proved correct if scientific journals would allow him to publish his research. ""Extra checks confirmed that my results are correct and in line with the specialised literature. ""This will be shown in a scientific paper, if it can appear"". In a statement Cern said: âThe incident was investigated in light ofthe internal Rules and Regulations and the Organisationâs Code of Conduct,external, which is based on Cernâs core values."" ""As a result of its own investigation and following the decision taken by the University of Pisa, Cern decided not to extend Professor Strumiaâs status of Guest Professor.â âCern reaffirms its commitment to the paramount importance of respect and diversity in the workplace.â Prof Strumia claimed there were examples where men were discriminated against Dr Jessica Wade, a physicist from Imperial College London who was at the workshop where Prof Strumia made his controversial remarks welcomed the decision. âThe recent statement is a powerful message for scientists all over the world; irrespective of your status, you will be held accountable for your actions,"" she said. ""Well-funded senior academics should not use their positions of power to attack colleagues or demean the work of women."" Prof Strumia analysed papers available in a database of particle physics research.  He produced a series of graphs which, he claimed, showed that women were hired over men whose research was cited more by other scientists in their publications, which is an indication of higher quality. He also presented data that he claimed showed that male and female researchers were equally cited at the start of their careers but men scored progressively better as their careers progressed. This evidence, he said indicated that men produced better research than women. But a group of physicists posted their take on the analysis atparticlesforjustice.org,externaland stated that they believed it to be ""fundamentally unsound"". They said the correlation was a reflection of the difficulties faced by women in research rather than their abilities. There are many more men in particle physics, and they tend to cite other male colleagues over women. Senior researchers, who are mostly men, often add their names to research conducted by their junior colleagues on the grounds that they supervised the work, although their contribution to the work can often be minimal or non-existent. And disproportionately higher rates of women leave the field. Those rebutting Prof Stumia's analysis said that ""Prof Strumia is not an expert on these topics and is misusing his physics credentials to put himself forward as one. Those among us who are familiar with the relevant literature know that Strumia's conclusions are in stark disagreement with those of experts. ""He frequently made the basic error of conflating correlation with causation, and while Strumia claimed to be proving that there is no discrimination against women, his arguments were rooted in a circumscribed, biased reading of the data available, to the point of promoting a perspective that is biased against women"".

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez became the youngest woman elected to Congress in November 2018. The past 18 months have seen the women's movement reach an unprecedented scale. In October 2017, millions began using the hashtag #MeToo on social media to speak out against experiences of harassment and sexual assault, and to denounce their widespread prevalence. In 2018, the #MeToo conversation grew to a global scale, with countries such as India, France, China, and South Korea joining in the conversation to demand change. In the US a record number of women were elected in the midterm elections. In Ireland, citizens voted to repeal the eighth amendment of the constitution, paving the way for legalised abortion. Green MSP Andy Wightman Green MSP Andy Wightman says the continuing need for International Women's Day, calling for equality, is disappointing indeed. Mr Wightman says women nowhere in the world can claim to have the same rights as men and violence against women and girls persists. He points out women and girls remain among the most discriminated against human beings. The struggle for true equality between the sexes is the biggest social struggle and men have a part to play in addressing the issues he says. Ms Grant says to get equality, there must be equality at home as well as work. Women make up the majority of single parent households and they have been particularly badly hit by welfare changes made by the UK government, she notes. ""Is sexism so entrenched in our society that even our welfare system reflects this?"" Ms Grant says we need to teach boys to respect and we need to regulate online pornography. When a parent abuses their partner, they also abuse their child so they must be prevented from having access, the Labour MSP insists. An International Women's Day demonstration in Diyarbakir, Turkey in 2016 International Women's Day grew out of the labour movement to become a UN-recognised annual event. The seeds of it were planted in 1908, when 15,000 women marched through New York City demanding shorter working hours, better pay and the right to vote. It was the Socialist Party of America who declared the first National Woman's Day, a year later. The idea to make the day international came from a woman called Clara Zetkin. She suggested the idea in 1910 at an International Conference of Working Women in Copenhagen. There were 100 women there, from 17 countries, and they agreed on her suggestion unanimously. It was first celebrated in 1911, in Austria, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland. The centenary was celebrated in 2011, so this year we're technically celebrating the 108th International Women's Day. Read more here. Clara Zetkin founded International Women's Day in 1910 Labour MSP Rhoda Grant Labour MSP Rhoda Grant says if you are a man you are far more likely to be selected or elected, simply because you are a man. Ms Grant argues that people who say merit works now are really saying women have less merit. People with this view are sexist and they must change, she says. ""We all lose out if we don't hear women's voices."" Tory MSP Annie Wells highlights the girls are less likely to go into apprenticeships, and women still earn less than men. Systemic change is still needed, she says. Childcare is imperative to this as women are still faced with the societal expectation that they should lead on care giving, explains Ms Wells. I wholeheartedly support the purpose of International Women's Day and I hope we can inspire women and men to make the changes needed, the Tory MSP concludes. Friday 8 March is International Women's Day, an annual celebration of women's achievement socially, economically, politically and culturally. The first International Women's Day was honoured in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Denmark on 19 March 1911. One hundred and seven years on, the day is marked in hundreds of countries. Here are the stories of eight young and successful women from across Scotland. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Public satisfaction with the NHS has fallen to its lowest level for over a decade, a long-running survey suggests. The British Social Attitudes poll of nearly 3,000 people found 53% of in England, Scotland and Wales were satisfied with services last year. That is a three percentage point drop since 2017 and the lowest level since 2007. A peak of 70% was seen in 2010. Experts said waiting times and a lack of staff were major concerns as ratings for GPs dropped to an all-time low. The findings of the surveyhave been released by the Nuffield Trust and King's Fund think tanks,external, which helped to provide analysis around the figures. Ruth Robertson, from the King's Fund, said the issues identified by the public were ""long-standing"" problems that the government had not yet managed to deal with. She pointed out the findings were even more interesting considering the public had been polled in the summer after the 70th anniversary of the creation of the NHS and at a time when the government had announced extra funding for the health service. ""There was no birthday bounce,"" she added.  If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. Of those who were not satisfied last year, 30% said they were actively dissatisfied, with virtually all the rest being neither satisfied or dissatisfied. Less than 1% said they could not answer. Being free at the point of use, the quality of care and the range of services and treatments available were the main reasons people expressed satisfaction. Despite the drop in satisfaction, the rating was still well above the all-time low of 34%, which was recorded in 1997. The survey started in 1983. The poll also provided breakdowns for individual services. It showed satisfaction with GPs was at it lowest level ever, at 63%, but that was still higher than dentistry and accident and emergency. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, of the Royal College of GPs, said GPs always wanted to provide the best care they could, so it was ""disappointing"" to see the drop. ""We know that general practice is currently facing intense resource and workforce pressures and while GPs are working incredibly hard to combat these, we understand that many patients are still waiting too long to see their doctor - something we find just as frustrating,"" she added. There were some encouraging signs, however, that when people did get to access hospital care, they were happy - as satisfaction ratings for outpatient services hit their highest levels ever, at 70%. Meanwhile, satisfaction levels with social care, which is run by councils not the health service, were down, at 26%. Although researchers said significant numbers - about one in 10 - did not express an opinion, suggesting people did not use these services or did not know what they were. Niall Dickson, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents health services, said: ""These findings show the inevitable consequence of starving the NHS of funding for the best part of a decade. ""We should be under no illusions about the scale of the task we face to restore public confidence in the health service."" A spokeswoman for England's Department of Health and Social Care said the recently announced long-term plan coupled with the extra money would ""safeguard"" the future of the NHS. Meanwhile, a Welsh government spokesman said other polling there showed satisfaction in Wales was higher- but, he added, there was ""always more to be done"".

"A total of 72 people were killed as a result of the fire in June 2017 Campaigners have reacted with frustration at news that criminal charges over the Grenfell Tower fire may not be considered until 2021. Scotland Yard said it would not hand a file to prosecutors until the end of a public inquiry into the disaster. Survivors' group Grenfell United said families were disheartened by a lack of official progress. But police said it ""would be wrong"" not to take into account evidence given to the independent hearing. A total of 72 people werekilled as a result of the firein June 2017. The first phase of the inquiry, which centred on the night of the fire, ended in December. Chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick said the second phase was unlikely to start until the end of 2019. Grenfell United chair Natasha Elcock said the news about criminal charges was ""extremely frustrating and disheartening"". ""We are living in a limbo with no individuals or organisations being held accountable and it is so painful for all of us who lost loved ones and our homes that night,"" she said. ""We wait month after month, our lives on hold, for some kind of justice and progress."" Grenfell Inquiry: What is happening? How the tragedy unfolded at Grenfell Tower Ms Elcock said the group, which represents survivors and bereaved relatives, had yet to be told details of the next stage of the inquiry. ""Vague reassurances are wearing thin,"" she said. ""Families need clear commitments to keep faith in this process"". The Met said it would be ""wrong"" not to wait for the final report from the Grenfell Tower Inquiry Lead investigator Det Supt Matt Bonner said the timelines of the inquiry and the police probe were ""inextricably linked"". He said officers must ""consider all relevant information"", including evidence and findings from the inquiry, for their investigation to be ""considered thorough and complete"". At the close of the inquiry's first phase last year, Sir Martin said 200,000 documents had yet to be disclosed to the inquiry - a process set to take until this autumn. Scotland Yard said: ""The Met's assessment is that any file submission to the Crown Prosecution Service is unlikely to be sooner than the latter part of 2021."" Det Supt Bonner said officers were in regular contact with Grenfell survivors and bereaved families and had informed them of the timeline. ""I know this is longer than some might have anticipated, but the police must ensure all the available evidence is considered before any file is submitted to the CPS,"" he added. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said while the delay would be ""distressing"" for families and survivors, he could understand why the police would ""want to make sure there is a proper investigation"".

"Yousef Makki and Jodie Chesney, both 17, were killed in separate knife attacks two days apart Theresa May is being warned that a ""broken"" system of support for troubled and excluded youngsters lies at the heart of a rise in knife crime. Police commissioners and London's mayor have written to the PM saying pupils, both formally and informally excluded, are being ""sucked into criminality"". The letter says cuts to school funds and youth services mean ""interventions"" for needy youngsters are not happening. The government said permanent exclusions should be a ""last resort"". A spokesperson added that pupil referral units, where children excluded from mainstream school are taught, had a legal duty to safeguard children from dangers such as exploitation, abuse and gang activity. The letter also called for the system of off-rolling, which sees pupils disappear from school registers without having been formally excluded, to be banned. It comes a day after high-level talks between the home secretary and police chiefs and follows a spate of fatal teenage stabbings. On Wednesday, Mrs May said the deaths of young people were ""appalling"" and announced a summit on knife crime. Treat knife crime like a disease - Javid Knife crime deaths at highest level since WW2 How I got help for my disruptive son The letter to Mrs May - signed by Mayor of London Sadiq Khan and eight police and crime commissioners from England and Wales - said tackling the issue was their top priority, but added there were limits to what they could do. ""There is growing evidence to show that our vulnerable children are more likely to be excluded or off-rolled from school,"" it said. ""And additionally that excluded children are at much greater risk of becoming either perpetrators or victims of serious youth violence."" Permanent school exclusions in England have been rising since 2013, and so has the number of children being arrested for knife offences. Almost a quarter of children who said they'd carried a knife in the previous year had been expelled or suspended from school compared with 3% of other children according to figures for England compiled by the Ministry of Justice. Research commissioned by the Home Office found children in pupil referral units were being targeted by drug gangs. This doesn't mean school exclusion in itself is causing knife crime though - there are lots of other common factors in these children's lives. Four times as many knife offenders, and seven times as many excluded children, had a special educational needs statement as the rest of the pupil population. Young knife offenders in England are about four times as likely to be claiming free school meals. And the rate of permanent exclusion in the most deprived 10% of schools is double that of the least deprived. Researchers have suggested rising numbers of children with complex needs may partly explain the rise in exclusions. Read more:Have school exclusions caused knife crime wave? The letter comes as disagreements continue over the connection between police funding and violent crime. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said on Tuesdaythere ""must be some link between crime and police numbers"". And theChairwoman of the National Police Chiefs' Council, Sara Thornton, said emergency funding was needed to increase police working hours and tackle the rise in knife crime. This video can not be played Metropolitan Police chief Cressida Dick: ""There must be some link"" The London mayor also called on the government to ""give us the resources we need to bear down on this issue"". ""We've fewer officers now than [at] any time since 2003, fewer community support officers, fewer police staff,"" Mr Khan told BBC Breakfast. ""Youth centres have closed down as well. The government doesn't appear to be realising that cuts have consequences."" Knife crime and the austerity question But Chancellor the Exchequer Philip Hammond told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the knife crime problem ""isn't just about money"". ""I'm not saying that resources don't have anything to do with this challenge, but what we need to see now is a surging of resources from other areas of policing activity into dealing with this spike in knife crime"" ""That's what you do in any organisation when you get a specific problem occurring in one area of the operation, you move resources to deal with that."" This video can not be played Knife Crime: âItâs an issue of inequality, not raceâ The letter about exclusions from Mr Khan and the police commissioners said: ""We firmly believe it is unacceptable that young people can be ejected from the formal education process in this way when we know how vulnerable they become to being sucked into criminality as a result. ""Our schools are facing significant funding pressures and many interventions for our most vulnerable children are being cut. ""This cannot be right and schools must have the necessary resources to deliver good interventions and support to those at risk of exclusion."" The letter highlighted that in two of the country's knife crime hot spots, London and the West Midlands, permanent exclusions rose by 62% and 40% respectively since 2013-14. It added: ""Clearly, the way the education system deals with excluded young people is broken. ""It cannot be right that so many of those who have committed offences have been excluded from school or were outside of mainstream education."" May 'has not listened' on knife crime How Scotland stemmed the tide of knife crime It said it was time to act urgently by giving the responsibilities over all school exclusions back to local authorities. The National Association of Head Teachers disagreed with this call, saying heads needed to be able to exclude violent pupils in order to keep others safe. But its general secretary Paul Whiteman said he agreed with much of the letter. ""School budgets are at breaking point and many interventions for our most vulnerable young people are being cut. ""As the letter says, this cannot be right, and schools must have the necessary resources to support young people at risk of exclusion. ""The letter goes on to say that the apparent rise in violent crime amongst young people is the result of deep-seated problems of poverty, inequality, social alienation, cuts to police, local authority and school funding, and a lack of opportunities for young people."" Rona Epstein, research fellow at Coventry Law School, said in a recent study that parents of children with special educational needs often found there was ""little or no support available"" and faced ""extremely long waits for diagnoses which could help get that support"". ""Some parents had even been asked to keep their children at home because schools said they could not meet their needs,"" she said. Last November, Unison highlighted how youth centres have been affected by funding cuts. A Freedom of Information request by the union revealed how at least 760 youth centres had closed in England since 2012 - leading to the loss of 4,500 youth work jobs. The government says every England local authority has been given more money for every pupil An Ofsted spokesman said it had seen no convincing evidence that exclusions, in and of themselves, lead to knife crime or gang violence. It was, however, likely that exclusions are caused by the same underlying factors as violent crime, and therefore affect many of the same young people. ""Exclusions made in accordance with statutory guidance and leading to placement in a good quality, registered alternative provider should help keep all children safe,"" he said. A government spokesperson said excluded children should still be able to engage in high-quality education and Â£4m had been committed to improve outcome for children outside mainstream schools, including in pupil referral units. ""Since 2017, the UK government has given every local authority in England more money for every pupil in every school,"" the spokesperson added.

"Police Scotland has committed to preventing sex discrimination after a female officer took them to a tribunal over flexible working hours. The force has come to an agreement with the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) who were concerned it was in breach of equality laws. It followed the case of Fiona Mair, an officer and mother who wanted to work full time but on a flexible basis. Police Scotland said it wanted to ensure workers had a work-life balance. On Thursday, the force announced it had signed an agreement which will last for 16 months. During that time the force will implement the steps set out in the joint action plan, and report back to the EHRC on its progress. This includes ensuring that any applications for flexible working hours are monitored to prevent discrimination and that staff making decisions are aware of any implications of their rulings. Deputy Chief Constable Fiona Taylor, lead for professionalism at Police Scotland, said: ""Our officers and staff are our greatest asset and as an organisation we are committed to ensuring that we support our workforce to achieve a work life balance. ""The policing family is diverse, as are the needs of all those who work for us. Police Scotland is committed to balancing the needs of our people while ensuring that we continue to effectively police Scotland and keep people safe. ""Signing this agreement with the EHRC signals our ongoing commitment to supporting our officers and staff and to mainstreaming equality in our day-to-day decision making."" Ms Mair initially requested flexible hours so she could look after her child. However, Police Scotland refused because divisional practice was that officers should start and finish within core hours. In October 2017 an employment tribunal found in her favour, saying her employer had unjustifiably discriminated against her on the grounds of her sex, under section 19 of the Equality Act 2010. Officials said Police Scotland had applied a rule which disproportionately affects single parents - the majority of whom in Scotland are women. Ex-undercover officer wins case against Police Scotland Police Scotland to put 400 officers on 'Brexit duty' The hearing concluded: ""We found the respondent's decision to be disproportionate. ""This was a relatively minor adjustment to make to accommodate the claimant's needs as a single parent, given the resources of the respondent. ""The respondents could have made a slight adjustment which would have pertained for only a limited period of time, and retained a long-serving police officer."" Ms Mair resigned following the tribunal's outcome. Despite this, the EHRC then notified Police Scotland that the findings of the tribunal had not been fully acted on. Lynn Welsh, Head of Legal, EHRC Scotland, said: ""Flexible working is intended to give carers in particular the flexibility that they need to provide care for children or older people without having to leave their jobs. ""We are heartened that Police Scotland have now recognised that not supporting flexible working could impact on female officer's progression and pay.""

"Tom Ballard and Daniele Nardi before their last contact with their team ""Silhouettes"" have been spotted on the passage taken by two missing climbers on a mountain in Pakistan. Briton Tom Ballard and Italian Daniele Nardi last made contact from Nanga Parbat in Pakistan at an altitude of about 20,700ft (6,300m), 11 days ago. The search has resumed despite reports the men were ""assumed to be dead"" following a ""huge avalanche"". Earlier, Spanish climber Alex Txikon saw the two ""shapes"" on the Mummery Spur trail that the men had taken. According to Mr Nardi's Facebook page,external, which is updated by his support team, Mr Txikon identified ""two silhouettes"" on the mountain from the base camp early on Thursday. A Pakistani army helicopter was due to investigate them further, but they were diverted for military purposes, according to Stefano Pontecorvo, the Italian ambassador to Pakistan. Mr Pontecorvo, who had earlier denied reports the search had ended, said it was a ""possibility"" the shapes are the two men. He has told the BBC that a helicopter search will probably resume on Friday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

On Wednesday, Karrar Haidri, from Pakistan's Alpine Club, saidit had been a ""painful decision""to end the search. However, Mr Pontecorvo strongly denied the rescue was over. Tom Ballard has been described as one of the world's best climbers He said: ""Until they tell me that there is no scope to continue I'd say that together with the family I'd encourage them to go forward. ""If we come to a point in which everything possible has been done and nothing has been found, at that point it will be up to the families - although advised by us - to call it off. We're not there yet."" Nanga Parbat, the ninth highest peak in the world, is known as ""Killer Mountain"" The rescue team in Pakistan is expected to make another attempt to scour the mountain for any trace of them. The two climbers went missing 11 days ago on what's known as the Killer Mountain and nothing has been heard from them since. The rescue mission was expected to finish on Wednesday and the base camp was dismantled. But members of the rescue team are now due to be taken high up the mountain by helicopter to look at areas they'd not searched previously. The BBC's been told they will take high resolution photographs and video which can then be analysed. The team leader, a Spanish climber, is to leave the area soon to return to his winter expedition on K2. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Greggs - getting a taste for vegans Greggs has credited the fanfare around the launch of its vegan sausage roll for driving a sharp rise in sales. The bakery chain said the publicity the snack gained helped sales surge 9.6% in the seven weeks to 16 February. The snack, made from meat substitute quorn, launched at the start of the year, coinciding with Veganuary when many people go vegan for a month. The update on current trading came as the firm said annual sales had broken through Â£1bn for the first time. Chief executive Roger Whiteside said Greggs had spent ""millions of pounds"" transforming how people perceived the chain. ""We want people to reappraise us and understand we've moved on from being a pure bakery business to offering people food on the go,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. People wanting ""healthier food options"" could now find them at the chain, he said. Greggs and the 'sausage roll' masterstroke Mr Whiteside said the chain, which has already held one-off evening openings for events such as Valentine's Day, was also ""looking to move into the evening food market"". Greggs now has 1,953 stores across the UK, and Mr Whiteside said it planned to get to 2,000 stores by the end of the year. Pre-tax profit last year rose 15% to Â£82.6m, marking the fifth year in a row that profits have increased. The firms's shares have almost doubled in value since July last year. ""There's a lot to like about Greggs - it's a publicity machine, recession-proof, and has a knack for adapting to consumer habits,"" said Arlene Ewing, Investment Manager at Brewin Dolphin. Much of the chain's success has been driven by savvy marketing. The ad campaign for its vegan sausage roll has been called ""a master class in public relations"" by the industry magazine PR Week. Journalists were sent vegan rolls in mock iPhone packaging and stores sold sausage roll phone cases. Publicity surrounding the campaign exploded when Piers Morgan, presenter of ITV's Good Morning Britain, criticised the new snack, calling Greggs ""PC-ravaged clowns"" in a tweet. by Dominic O'Connell, Today business presenter When daytime TV host Piers Morgan poured scorn on the vegan sausage roll, Greggs' social media team was ready to roll. ""Oh hello Piers, we've been expecting you,"" was the immediate tweet, a James Bond-inspired, gently droll putdown that was the perfect riposte. Greggs marketing and social media may be quirky and fun, but there is a deadly serious intent behind it - to push customers into what the company calls a ""reappraisal"" - a realisation that Greggs is no longer just a bakery chain, but a fast-food and even dining proposition that competes with everyone from McDonald's to Patisserie Valerie. Come to try the vegan sausage roll, and come back when you realise the coffee is cheap and (hopefully) not disgusting. This hard work is evident in the results - a decent increase in pre-tax profits, and, best of all for investors, the prospect of a special extra dividend later in the year.

"The Labour Party may have unlawfully discriminated against Jewish people, the UK's human rights watchdog says. The Equalities and Human Rights Commission said it was considering launching a formal investigation into anti-Semitism in the party. The Labour Party said: ""We completely reject any suggestion the party has acted unlawfully and will be co-operating fully with the EHRC."" The watchdog is asking the party to work with it to improve its processes. Once the EHRC's formal letter is received by Labour, the party will have 14 days to respond to the concerns raised. A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims Falconer pressured over anti-Semitism role Depending on the response, the commission can take enforcement action ranging from a voluntary agreement with the party to a full-blown investigation. If a formal investigation was launched, the EHRC would request interviews with key figures in the party and have the power to demand access to correspondence, emails and other information to determine how Labour dealt with allegations of anti-Semitic discrimination. The action comes in response to complaints from a number of organisations and individuals, including the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism. An Equality and Human Rights Commission spokesperson said: ""Having received a number of complaints regarding anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, we believe Labour may have unlawfully discriminated against people because of their ethnicity and religious beliefs. ""Our concerns are sufficient for us to consider using our statutory enforcement powers. ""As set out in our enforcement policy, we are now engaging with the Labour Party to give them an opportunity to respond."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Police forces in England and Wales must use their existing budgets to tackle knife crime, the chancellor has said. Senior officers and crime commissioners had called for more money to pay for extra officers. On Thursday, a teenager became the fifth person to be stabbed to death in London in the last week. But Philip Hammond said police must use money and officers from other parts of their forces to deal with the problem. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott told MPs the suggestion was ""monstrous"". During an urgent question on knife crime in the Commons on Thursday, Ms Abbott said it was ""an insult to grieving families"", and added: ""The police are under pressure in nearly every area. What we need is more resources for the police and we need them now."" A male in his late teensdied on Thursday afternoon,after being stabbed in West Kensington, London. According to the BBC's home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw, it is the Met Police's seventh murder investigation launched in the past seven days, with five of the victims having died from stab wounds. Two other people have been stabbed to death in the past week in England - a man in Oxford and Yousef Makki in Greater Manchester. Excluded pupils 'sucked into knife crime' Knife crime and the austerity question Treat knife crime like a disease - Javid The chancellor told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there had to be a ""surging of resources from other areas of policing activity into dealing with this spike in knife crime"". ""That's what you do in any organisation when you get a specific problem occurring in one area of the operation, you move resources to deal with that,"" he added. Yousef Makki and Jodie Chesney, both 17, were killed in separate knife attacks two days apart Earlier, he told LBC: ""If your house is on fire, you stop painting it and you go and get a bucket and start pouring water on the fire."" He said police commissioners and chief constables across the country needed to divert resources from ""lower priority areas of policing"". Asked what those ""lower priority areas"" were, he said ""it's not my job to define the operational priorities of individual police forces"". Home Secretary Sajid Javid,who held talks with police chiefs on Wednesday,said after the meeting it was important to ""always make sure the police have the resources they need"". The Home Office said it would not comment on Mr Hammond's comments. By BBC Home Affairs correspondent Danny Shaw There's clearly tension at the heart of government about whether forces in England and Wales should have extra money to tackle knife crime. Home Secretary Sajid Javid nailed his colours to the police mast on Wednesday saying their requests needed to be ""listened to"". There was quiet optimism amid senior officer ranks that additional funding would be made available. That's been thrown into doubt by Chancellor Philip Hammond's comments suggesting chief constables should use their existing budgets. His remarks are likely to reflect annoyance that police are asking for more just three months after he approved a financial settlement for 2019-20 which will enable forces to step up recruitment. Mr Hammond may also be sending wider signals to dampen expectations about government spending, ahead of next week's Spring Statement. But for many police officers his comments will be seen as confirmation that he doesn't understand the pressures they're working under. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said on Tuesdaythere was ""obviously"" a link between violent crime and falling police numbers,but Theresa May insisted there was ""no direct correlation"". Father of murdered teenager Jodie Chesney appeals for attacker to come forward - BBC News On Wednesday, Sara Thornton, chairwoman of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said tackling knife crime should be treated as an ""emergency"". She told the BBC: ""We just haven't got the capacity, we just haven't got the officers at the moment so we need some money now to pay for overtime to pay for mutual aid between forces."" Home Office minister Victoria Atkins told MPs the government had increased funding for the police.

"Tom Ballard and Daniele Nardi before their last contact with their team ""Silhouettes"" have been spotted on the passage taken by two missing climbers on a mountain in Pakistan. Briton Tom Ballard and Italian Daniele Nardi last made contact from Nanga Parbat in Pakistan at an altitude of about 20,700ft (6,300m), 11 days ago. The search has resumed despite reports the men were ""assumed to be dead"" following a ""huge avalanche"". Earlier, Spanish climber Alex Txikon saw the two ""shapes"" on the Mummery Spur trail that the men had taken. According to Mr Nardi's Facebook page,external, which is updated by his support team, Mr Txikon identified ""two silhouettes"" on the mountain from the base camp early on Thursday. A Pakistani army helicopter was due to investigate them further, but they were diverted for military purposes, according to Stefano Pontecorvo, the Italian ambassador to Pakistan. Mr Pontecorvo, who had earlier denied reports the search had ended, said it was a ""possibility"" the shapes are the two men.

On Wednesday, Karrar Haidri, from Pakistan's Alpine Club, saidit had been a ""painful decision""to end the search. However, Mr Pontecorvo strongly denied the rescue was over. Tom Ballard has been described as one of the world's best climbers He said: ""Until they tell me that there is no scope to continue I'd say that together with the family I'd encourage them to go forward. ""If we come to a point in which everything possible has been done and nothing has been found, at that point it will be up to the families - although advised by us - to call it off. We're not there yet."" Nanga Parbat, the ninth highest peak in the world, is known as ""Killer Mountain"" The rescue team in Pakistan is expected to make another attempt to scour the mountain for any trace of them. The two climbers went missing 11 days ago on what's known as the Killer Mountain and nothing has been heard from them since. The rescue mission was expected to finish on Wednesday and the base camp was dismantled. But members of the rescue team are now due to be taken high up the mountain by helicopter to look at areas they'd not searched previously. The BBC's been told they will take high resolution photographs and video which can then be analysed.

"Cern is the home of the Large Hadron Collider - the most powerful particle collider on Earth The European particle physics research centre Cern has cut ties with the scientist who said that women were less able at physics than men. Cern has decided not to extend Professor Alessandro Strumiaâs status of guest professor. The decision follows an investigation into comments, first reported by BBC News, made by Prof Strumia at a Cern workshop on gender equality. Prof Strumia told BBC News that he stood by his remarks. ""Some people hated hearing about higher male variance: this idea comes from Darwin, like other offensive ideas that got observational support,"" he told BBC News. ""Science is not about being offended when facts challenge ideas held as sacred"". He added that he believed that he had not been fairly treated. ""For months, Cern kept 'investigating' if my 30-minute talk might have violated Cern rules [requiring an] 'obligation to exercise reserve and tact in expressing personal opinions and communication to the public',"" Prof Strumia said. ""In such a case, they would have opened some procedure, where I would have been able [to defend] myself. This never happened."" Last September, Professor Strumia stated that âphysics was invented and built by men, it's not by invitation"" at a presentation at the Cern the workshop. Prof Alessandro Strumia is based at Pisa University in Italy He also showed cartoons deriding women campaigning for equality in science and presented the results of an analysis that he claimed showed that work conducted by female physicists was not as good as their male counterparts. First woman Physics Nobel winner in 55 years Seven trailblazing women in science 'We want to be accepted into the club' His analysis was quickly dismissed as being unscientific and incorrect by experts in the impact of research. But Profesor Strumia told BBC News that his analysis would eventually be proved correct if scientific journals would allow him to publish his research. ""Extra checks confirmed that my results are correct and in line with the specialised literature. ""This will be shown in a scientific paper, if it can appear"". In a statement Cern said: âThe incident was investigated in light ofthe internal Rules and Regulations and the Organisationâs Code of Conduct,external, which is based on Cernâs core values."" ""As a result of its own investigation and following the decision taken by the University of Pisa, Cern decided not to extend Professor Strumiaâs status of Guest Professor.â âCern reaffirms its commitment to the paramount importance of respect and diversity in the workplace.â Prof Strumia claimed there were examples where men were discriminated against Dr Jessica Wade, a physicist from Imperial College London who was at the workshop where Prof Strumia made his controversial remarks welcomed the decision. âThe recent statement is a powerful message for scientists all over the world; irrespective of your status, you will be held accountable for your actions,"" she said. ""Well-funded senior academics should not use their positions of power to attack colleagues or demean the work of women."" Prof Strumia analysed papers available in a database of particle physics research.  He produced a series of graphs which, he claimed, showed that women were hired over men whose research was cited more by other scientists in their publications, which is an indication of higher quality. He also presented data that he claimed showed that male and female researchers were equally cited at the start of their careers but men scored progressively better as their careers progressed. This evidence, he said indicated that men produced better research than women. But a group of physicists posted their take on the analysis atparticlesforjustice.org,externaland stated that they believed it to be ""fundamentally unsound"". They said the correlation was a reflection of the difficulties faced by women in research rather than their abilities. There are many more men in particle physics, and they tend to cite other male colleagues over women. Senior researchers, who are mostly men, often add their names to research conducted by their junior colleagues on the grounds that they supervised the work, although their contribution to the work can often be minimal or non-existent. And disproportionately higher rates of women leave the field. Those rebutting Prof Stumia's analysis said that ""Prof Strumia is not an expert on these topics and is misusing his physics credentials to put himself forward as one. Those among us who are familiar with the relevant literature know that Strumia's conclusions are in stark disagreement with those of experts. ""He frequently made the basic error of conflating correlation with causation, and while Strumia claimed to be proving that there is no discrimination against women, his arguments were rooted in a circumscribed, biased reading of the data available, to the point of promoting a perspective that is biased against women"".

"Police forces in England and Wales must use their existing budgets to tackle knife crime, the chancellor has said. Senior officers and crime commissioners had called for more money to pay for extra officers. On Thursday, a teenager became the fifth person to be stabbed to death in London in the last week. But Philip Hammond said police must use money and officers from other parts of their forces to deal with the problem. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott told MPs the suggestion was ""monstrous"". During an urgent question on knife crime in the Commons on Thursday, Ms Abbott said it was ""an insult to grieving families"", and added: ""The police are under pressure in nearly every area. What we need is more resources for the police and we need them now."" A male in his late teensdied on Thursday afternoon,after being stabbed in West Kensington, London. According to the BBC's home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw, it is the Met Police's seventh murder investigation launched in the past seven days, with five of the victims having died from stab wounds. Two other people have been stabbed to death in the past week in England - a man in Oxford and Yousef Makki in Greater Manchester. Excluded pupils 'sucked into knife crime' Knife crime and the austerity question Treat knife crime like a disease - Javid The chancellor told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there had to be a ""surging of resources from other areas of policing activity into dealing with this spike in knife crime"". ""That's what you do in any organisation when you get a specific problem occurring in one area of the operation, you move resources to deal with that,"" he added. Yousef Makki and Jodie Chesney, both 17, were killed in separate knife attacks two days apart Earlier, he told LBC: ""If your house is on fire, you stop painting it and you go and get a bucket and start pouring water on the fire."" He said police commissioners and chief constables across the country needed to divert resources from ""lower priority areas of policing"". Asked what those ""lower priority areas"" were, he said ""it's not my job to define the operational priorities of individual police forces"". Home Secretary Sajid Javid,who held talks with police chiefs on Wednesday,said after the meeting it was important to ""always make sure the police have the resources they need"". The Home Office said it would not comment on Mr Hammond's comments. By BBC Home Affairs correspondent Danny Shaw There's clearly tension at the heart of government about whether forces in England and Wales should have extra money to tackle knife crime. Home Secretary Sajid Javid nailed his colours to the police mast on Wednesday saying their requests needed to be ""listened to"". There was quiet optimism amid senior officer ranks that additional funding would be made available. That's been thrown into doubt by Chancellor Philip Hammond's comments suggesting chief constables should use their existing budgets. His remarks are likely to reflect annoyance that police are asking for more just three months after he approved a financial settlement for 2019-20 which will enable forces to step up recruitment. Mr Hammond may also be sending wider signals to dampen expectations about government spending, ahead of next week's Spring Statement. But for many police officers his comments will be seen as confirmation that he doesn't understand the pressures they're working under. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said on Tuesdaythere was ""obviously"" a link between violent crime and falling police numbers,but Theresa May insisted there was ""no direct correlation"". Father of murdered teenager Jodie Chesney appeals for attacker to come forward - BBC News On Wednesday, Sara Thornton, chairwoman of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said tackling knife crime should be treated as an ""emergency"". She told the BBC: ""We just haven't got the capacity, we just haven't got the officers at the moment so we need some money now to pay for overtime to pay for mutual aid between forces."" Home Office minister Victoria Atkins told MPs the government had increased funding for the police.

"EOD carried out a controlled explosion Counter terrorism police officers have said the suspect package found at Glasgow University is linked with devices discovered around London. Bomb disposal officers detonated the item after it was found in the mailroom on Wednesday morning. Police Scotland is now ""working closely together"" with officers investigating finds at Heathrow and London City airports and Waterloo station. Staff and students were evacuated from buildings and no-one was injured. Classes were expected to return to normal on Thursday. A controlled explosion took place on a suspect device found at Glasgow University Assistant Chief Constable Steve Johnson of Police Scotland said: ""The package sent to the university was not opened and no-one was injured. A controlled explosion of the device was carried out this afternoon by EOD. ""There are similarities in the package, its markings and the type of device that was recovered in Glasgow to those in London. ""Therefore, we are now treating it as being linked to the three packages being investigated by the Met in London and both investigations are being run in tandem. ""Our inquiries into the Glasgow package are at an early stage but there is no ongoing risk to the public."" He added: ""Anyone who sees something suspicious should report it to the police immediately."" University of Glasgow evacuated over suspect package Suspicious package sees University of Essex evacuated Lectures and tutorials were cancelled and roads cordoned off The university,externalsaid it was acting under advice from Police Scotland as it closed a number of buildings, cancelled classes and sent staff home. The package was discovered just one hour before another suspicious item was discovered at the University of Essex. A 100m cordon was placed around a section of the university whileEssex Police launched an investigation. On Tuesday three ""small improvised explosive devices"" were found at sites across London, the Metropolitan Police said. Scotland Yard said the packages were all A4-sized white postal bags containing yellow Jiffy bags. One caught fire when opened by staff at Heathrow. The airport said it would support the police investigation into the ""criminal act"". The device sent to Heathrow Airport caught fire when staff opened it The force's Counter Terrorism Command is treating it as a ""linked series"" and ""keeping an open mind"" about motives. Irish police are assisting the Met as the Heathrow and Waterloo packages had Republic of Ireland stamps. Met Deputy Assistant Commissioner Dean Haydon said officers had found ""nothing to indicate motivation of the sender"". London explosive packages: Police 'can't confirm' Irish terror link A number of police cordons in and around University Avenue in the west end of Glasgow remain in place until further notice. Police made clear, however, there was no ongoing risk to the public. A number of buildings at the University of Glasgow were closed off including the Boyd Orr Building, the mailroom, OTC, Wolfson Medical Building and Bower Building. Others sites that were later closed included the Isabella Elder Building, James McCune Smith Learning Hub, the Joseph Black Building, the Kelvin Building and University Gardens. Classes in these buildings were cancelled with hundreds of students affected. Staff members were later sent home. University Gardens and part of University Avenue were cordoned off by police. However, at about 16:00, the university tweeted that police had advised the incident was ""now over"". The tweet read: ""Minor restrictions will remain in place around the Isabella Elder building and Botany Gate while the Mailroom will remain closed for now. All other buildings are being reopened."" A spokesman confirmed all university buildings, except the mailroom, were operating as normal. Earlier on Wednesday the Royal Bank of Scotland HQ at Gogarburn in Edinburgh was also evacuated after a similar report. However, Police Scotland confirmed that the package posed no risk to the public and contained promotional goods.

"This video can not be played Karen Bradley says she's ""devastated"" to think she made pain worse for Troubles victims' families Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley has said she is determined to deliver for families hurt by comments she made about the Troubles. She said on Wednesday thatdeaths caused by the security forces in Northern Ireland were ""not crimes"". Speaking to the BBC's The View programme on Thursday, Mrs Bradley said she had ""said the wrong thing"". When asked about whether she would resign, she said she was determined to deliver for people in Northern Ireland. Is Northern Ireland secretary running out of road? Bradley 'did not understand' NI voting patterns ""What I do want to do now is make sure I deliver for those families, from all parts of the community, who have been so deeply affected by the Troubles,"" said Mrs Bradley. ""I know how raw that pain is and I'm devastated to think that I have made it worse."" There were no excuses for what she said in the House of Commons on Wednesday, she said, adding: ""It's not what I think, it's not what I mean."" ""I said something in response to an oral question and as soon as I realised what I had said I corrected the record. ""I am determined that those families who have been hurt by what I said will see justice."" This video can not be played 'They were people acting under orders' - Bradley Mrs Bradley has faced considerable criticism for the remarks she made on Wednesday. The Police Service of Northern Ireland's (PSNI) chief constable said on Thursday that a soldier or police officer should be investigated if they shot someone. ""Where people have lost their lives we should all be equal under the law,"" added George Hamilton. ""There should be a thorough and effective investigation."" Speaking at a high-profile Troubles-related inquest in Belfast, the leading barrister Michael Mansfield QC said Mrs Bradley had made ""entirely inappropriate observations"" on Wednesday. This video can not be played Simon Coveney: The comments have come at time of 'real sensitivity' The inquest is examining 10 people's deaths at Ballymurphy in August 1971, which followed three days of gunfire in west Belfast after the introduction of internment. Mr Mansfield is representing some of the victims' families and previously participated in the Bloody Sunday and Hillsborough inquiries and the Birmingham Six case. He told the coroner that Mrs Bradley clearly had ""no regard whatsoever for these proceedings"". After almost 24 hours of facing pressure to say sorry, Karen Bradley's statement may be too little, too late for some. Although she has acknowledged that her language was wrong, she will still face questions as to why she ever made the remark in the first place. Number 10 says it has full confidence in her as Northern Ireland secretary, who is a Theresa May loyalist. It is also unlikely she will face pressure in London to step down. The prime minister can hardly afford to lose another cabinet minister when she is in the throes of the last Brexit act. But some politicians and victims' campaigners in Belfast and Dublin have said Mrs Bradley's apology does not cut it. The TÃ¡naiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Simon Coveney welcomed Mrs Bradley's apology and said he thought she recognised ""the seriousness of the statement made yesterday"". ""I made it perfectly clear to the secretary of state last night that I believed her statement was wrong, that it was ill-advised and that it would cause deep offence to many people."" Lord Dannatt, the former head of the Army, said Mrs Bradley should consider apologising over the comments but should not quit her role. Lord Dannatt is a former head of the Army ""It would not be unreasonable for her to offer an apology,"" he said. ""I think it's unnecessary for her to resign - there's enough confusion in our political world at the present moment."" Attorney General Geoffrey Cox defended the Northern Ireland secretary, telling the Commons that he ""believed firmly"" that she had not intended any offence. The shadow Northern Ireland secretary Tony Lloyd called on Mrs Bradley to outline what the government ""plans to do around legacy cases in Northern Ireland"". Ulster Unionist MLA and former Army officer Doug Beattie said that politicians must be mindful about what they say about Troubles legacy issues. Politics had arrived at a ""major tipping point"", he added, and Mrs Bradley ""should have been alive"" to the fact thatan announcement is due to be made on whether or not former soldiers should be prosecuted in relation to Bloody Sunday. ""She has clearly put her foot in her mouth... and I think she knows that,"" he added. Mr Beattie said Mrs Bradley should apologise to the families of those who died on Bloody Sunday in Londonderry in January 1972. Thirteen people were killed on Bloody Sunday after troops opened fire, and another died of his injuries some months later. This video can not be played 'Her place now is untenable' But Mr Beattie differentiated those events from the SAS killings of eight IRA men who were preparing to bomb a police station in Loughgall, County Armagh, in 1987. ""If you take the likes of Loughgall, that was force on force and was absolutely right,"" he added. ""Bloody Sunday was not and if there is evidence against those people who killed those innocent civilians then the law must be seen to run its course."" Victims' families have called for Mrs Bradley to resign. John Kelly, whose teenage brother Michael was killed on Bloody Sunday, described her remarks as ""outrageous"". John Teggart,whose father was killed in the 1971 Ballymurphy shootings, also said she should quit.

"NI's chief medical officer said health professionals had seen an increase in the use of heroin Consideration should be given to providing rooms where people can safely inject themselves with illegal drugs, NI's chief medical officer has said. Dr Michael McBride told the BBC there was a ""significant problem"" with drug users injecting in public places. He said health professionals had seen a clear increase in the use of heroin among patients in recent years. However any decision to provide so-called consumption rooms would be for a Stormont minister, he added. ""My own view on this is that we need to look at all options that can reduce the harm associated with intravenous drug misuse,"" he said. ""Yes, we have reduced the risk of overdose through making available Naloxone, but we also need to look at whether or not there are other alternative models such as consumption rooms. ""Ultimately, decisions of that nature will be a matter for a minister in an executive in due course."" Naloxone reverses an overdose from opioids, including heroin PSNI Detective Superintendent Bobby Singleton said the PSNI was following the debate around safe drug rooms ""with a very keen interest"". ""Law enforcement clearly has a role to play in terms of restricting the availability of illicit and prescription drugs on the street in Northern Ireland. It is a priority for communities and consequently it is a priority for us,"" he said. ""We recognise the limitations of law enforcement when it comes to dealing with an addressing the harms associated with, in particular intravenous drug misuse."" On Monday, it emerged thatdrug-related deaths among males in Northern Ireland have almost doubled in the last 10 years. Asked about the likelihood of consumption rooms being introduced as a means of reducing deaths, Dr McBride explained that among health professionals, there were ""a range of views around the effectiveness of such an approach"" and that some fear it could encourage addicts to continue injecting. ""I don't think it's a problem that's going to go away any time soon,"" he said. ""We're beginning to make progress in some areas, but this is a complex issue, there are no simple solutions."" In a statement to the BBC, the British Medical Association (BMA) said it supported the introduction of a wider range of evidence-based interventions for treating illicit drug dependence - such as heroin-assisted treatment and supervised consumption rooms. The organisation said it believed there should be a ""refocusing to prioritise treatment and support over criminalisation and punishment of drug users"". Dr Michael McBride said so-called consumption rooms 'need to be considered as an option' Earlier in the week, the Department of Health said that over the past two years there had been a ""growing pressure"" on a range of alcohol and drug-related services, leading to the development of ""unacceptable waiting lists"" for some key services across Northern Ireland, but particularly in Belfast. It said this had been the focus of ""significant action and investment"" by the Department of Health, the Health and Social Care Board and the Belfast Trust. As a result, it said, average waiting times for substitution therapy in the Belfast Trust had fallen from 41 weeks in July 2017 to 15 weeks in December 2018. Dr McBride described the 2017 waiting times as ""clearly unacceptable"" and acknowledged an under-investment in drugs services in the past. However that investment had now been made available, he added, and the waiting times needed to come down even further. ""It's not because the service isn't trying hard enough,"" he said. ""It's a reflection of the demand on the services.""

"Mahamed Hashi, Gwenton Sloley and Ken Hinds all say they have been targeted by the Met Police Three prominent, black community advisers have claimed they have been wrongfully searched or arrested by the Metropolitan Police. The men work with police in London on youth violence but said their treatment harmed race relations with the force. It comes 20 years after the MacPherson report said the Met was ""institutionally racist"" over its handling ofStephen Lawrence's murder. The force has denied allegations of racial profiling. It said the officers in the men's cases acted appropriately. About 14% of Met officers are from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds. While this was the highest proportion in England and Wales,external, the 2011 census showed a far higher proportion of Londoners, 40.2%, identify as BAME. As a result the force has said it wants torecruit 250 extra BAME officers a year. Ken Hinds was convicted of an assault that was later found not to have happened Ken Hinds, the chair of the Haringey Independent Stop and Search Advisory Committee, has worked for decades to promote community cohesion. In April, he was arrested after intervening in the search of a young black man near his home in north London. He told the BBC: ""This officer pushed me out of the way. I asked him not to put his hands on me. ""The next thing I know I'm under arrest for obstruction and assault, accused of head-butting."" Mr Hinds was convicted of an assault that was later found not to have happened Mr Hinds was charged and found guilty of assault. But his conviction was quashed nine months later by an appeal judge who said the assault did not take place. He said: ""The community was so incensed by my arrest that we held a public meeting and decided we weren't going to deal with the police until my case was settled. ""As soon as I got arrested the whole establishment washed their hands of me. ""Being a black man in this area, it fits the racial profiling that we're the victims and perpetrators of violent crime."" The Metropolitan Police said it had reached out to Mr Hinds, who is in the process of pursuing legal action. In 2009 Mr Hinds won Â£22,000 compensationafter he was arrested by British Transport Police,externalfor watching a stop and search procedure. Gwenton Sloley said police were ""desperate to take me down"" Gwenton Sloley has won awards for helping young people escape violent lifestyles. Mr Sloley said his home in Lewisham was raided by detectives last October, while he was an adviser to the Met Police - the officers were looking for a previous occupant who was involved in drug dealing. ""They totally destroyed the property, ripped off my air-vent, stole money from me, took my children's stuff, phones, earrings, parking tickets, letters, bank statements, pictures of me. ""They know I live here because they invoice me to the same property - the same people who searched the house."" Mr Sloley says the Met Police have raided his home ""twice in three months"" After the raids, Mr Sloley said officers tarnished his reputation by telling his clients about the warrant, which resulted in them cancelling valuable contracts with him. ""The police are trying to stitch me up,"" he said. ""They've raided me twice in three months, desperate to take me down, telling people I'm too big for my boots.""

"Mahamed Hashi, Gwenton Sloley and Ken Hinds all say they have been targeted by the Met Police Three prominent, black community advisers have claimed they have been wrongfully searched or arrested by the Metropolitan Police. The men work with police in London on youth violence but said their treatment harmed race relations with the force. It comes 20 years after the MacPherson report said the Met was ""institutionally racist"" over its handling ofStephen Lawrence's murder. The force has denied allegations of racial profiling. It said the officers in the men's cases acted appropriately. About 14% of Met officers are from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds. While this was the highest proportion in England and Wales,external, the 2011 census showed a far higher proportion of Londoners, 40.2%, identify as BAME. As a result the force has said it wants torecruit 250 extra BAME officers a year. Ken Hinds was convicted of an assault that was later found not to have happened Ken Hinds, the chair of the Haringey Independent Stop and Search Advisory Committee, has worked for decades to promote community cohesion. In April, he was arrested after intervening in the search of a young black man near his home in north London. He told the BBC: ""This officer pushed me out of the way. I asked him not to put his hands on me. ""The next thing I know I'm under arrest for obstruction and assault, accused of head-butting."" Mr Hinds was convicted of an assault that was later found not to have happened Mr Hinds was charged and found guilty of assault. But his conviction was quashed nine months later by an appeal judge who said the assault did not take place. He said: ""The community was so incensed by my arrest that we held a public meeting and decided we weren't going to deal with the police until my case was settled. ""As soon as I got arrested the whole establishment washed their hands of me. ""Being a black man in this area, it fits the racial profiling that we're the victims and perpetrators of violent crime."" The Metropolitan Police said it had reached out to Mr Hinds, who is in the process of pursuing legal action. In 2009 Mr Hinds won Â£22,000 compensationafter he was arrested by British Transport Police,externalfor watching a stop and search procedure. Gwenton Sloley said police were ""desperate to take me down"" Gwenton Sloley has won awards for helping young people escape violent lifestyles. Mr Sloley said his home in Lewisham was raided by detectives last October, while he was an adviser to the Met Police - the officers were looking for a previous occupant who was involved in drug dealing. ""They totally destroyed the property, ripped off my air-vent, stole money from me, took my children's stuff, phones, earrings, parking tickets, letters, bank statements, pictures of me. ""They know I live here because they invoice me to the same property - the same people who searched the house."" Mr Sloley says the Met Police have raided his home ""twice in three months"" After the raids, Mr Sloley said officers tarnished his reputation by telling his clients about the warrant, which resulted in them cancelling valuable contracts with him. ""The police are trying to stitch me up,"" he said. ""They've raided me twice in three months, desperate to take me down, telling people I'm too big for my boots.""

"Huawei's Rotating Chairman Guo Ping Huawei has filed a lawsuit against the US government over a ban that restricts federal agencies from using its products. It said the US failed to provide evidence to support the ban, and the firm also rejected claims it had links to the Chinese government. The US has restricted the use of Huawei products over national security concerns. It has also been lobbying allies to shun the Chinese telecoms firm. Huawei is one of the world's largest telecommunications equipment and services providers. The lawsuit is part of a wider push by the company in recent months to challenge claims its products pose security risks. ""The US Congress has repeatedly failed to produce any evidence to support its restrictions on Huawei products. We are compelled to take this legal action as a proper and last resort,"" Huawei Rotating Chairman Guo Ping said in a statement. The storm over Huawei The US cannot crush us, says Huawei boss Should we worry about Huawei? ""This ban not only is unlawful, but also restricts Huawei from engaging in fair competition, ultimately harming US consumers."" Speaking at a press conference in Shenzhen, Mr Ping also accused the US government of misleading the public about Huawei and of hacking its servers. Huawei's cyber security chief John Suffolk said it was ""the most open [and] transparent company in the world"". But the company was later criticised for cutting the live feed of its conference before journalists could begin asking questions. Huawei is challenging the constitutionality of Section 889 of the National Defense Authorisation Act. The complaint has been filed in a US federal court in Texas. Huawei also rejected claims it had any links to the state, saying in a statement the firm was ""not owned, controlled, or influenced"" by the Chinese government. Several governments around the world, including Australia and New Zealand, have blocked telecoms companies from using Huawei gear in next-generation 5G mobile networks, citing security concerns. This video can not be played Australia's former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on why Huawei was barred from 5G network Analysis: John Sudworth, BBC News, Shenzhen Huawei is beginning its fight back. It is not just the company's reputation that is at stake, but perhaps the future of the global internet too. The US argues that the political realities in China mean all companies are beholden to the will of the Chinese Communist Party which could use Huawei to spy on, or to disrupt, critical next generation mobile networks. Huawei's case is that there is no evidence that it has ever done anything to harm the interests of its consumers. In the end, it may come down to how much latitude the courts decide the US Congress has in defining national security interests. The case, if it proceeds, could pass through a series of appeals and take many months. As China continues to push out into the world, the big question is to what extent the unreformed system of Leninist control back home should be a concern. In addition to restricting the purchase of Huawei products, the US is alsopursuing criminal charges against the firm and its chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou. Ms Meng, who is the daughter of Huawei's founder Ren Zhengfei, was arrested in Canada in December, at the request of the US. She was detained on suspicion of fraud and breaching US sanctions on Iran, and faces extradition to the US. Last week, Ms Mengfiled a civil claim against Canada's government, border agency and police for ""serious breaches"" of her civil rights. Meng Wanzhou's next court hearing is set for 8 May Mr Ren recently told the BBC thathis daughter's arrest was politically-motivated. That possibility was also raised by Ms Meng's lawyer in her scheduled court appearance in Vancouver on Wednesday. US President Donald Trump said in Decemberhe could intervene in Ms Meng's caseif it helped to avoid a further decline in US relations with China. The lawsuit is part of a broader, more aggressive strategy by the Chinese tech giant to counter what it sees as an American ""smear"" campaign. It has taken outads in the foreign pressand invited foreign journalists to visit its campuses as part of new public relations push. In perhaps its most striking move, it appealed to the American public in afull-page ad in the Wall Street Journal, telling them not to ""believe everything you hear.""

It comes hours after R. Kelly tearfully and angrily denied allegations of sexual abuse in a TV interview.

"GPs are urging women not to be alarmed by research linking long-term hormone replacement therapy (HRT) use with a small increased risk of Alzheimer's. They say HRT is an effective and safe treatment for most women with menopause symptoms and the risk is ""extremely low"". TheBMJ research,externallooked at data on 170,000 women in Finland over 14 years. It found a 9%-17% increased risk for Alzheimer's, particularly in women taking HRT for more than 10 years. This equates to between nine and 18 extra cases of the disease per year in every 10,000 women aged between 70 and 80, the researchers said. But the study was observational and, as a result, it cannot be said for certain that other factors had not affected the results. Other studies have found thatHRT actually improves brain function. Menopause a 'hideous' experience Kirsty Wark: 'Let's talk about the menopause' The Royal College of GPs said the research does not prove that HRT causes Alzheimer's disease, and women currently taking it should continue to do so. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, chairwoman of the College, said: ""Hormone replacement therapy can be of greatest benefit to many women who are suffering from some of the unpleasant side-effects of the menopause, such as hot flushes and night sweats - and there is a large body of evidence that shows it is an effective and safe treatment for most women. ""We would urge patients not to be alarmed by this research - as the researchers state, any risk is extremely low - and if they are currently taking HRT, to continue doing so as prescribed by their doctor. "" However, she said there were risks with any medication and it was important that women were aware of them. ""To minimise any risk, best practice for most women is to prescribe the lowest possible dose of hormones for the shortest possible time in order to achieve satisfactory relief of symptoms,"" Prof Stokes-Lampard said. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is a treatment used to relieve symptoms of the menopause. These can include hot flushes, night sweats, mood swings and reduced sex drive. HRT replaces hormones, like oestrogen, that are at a lower level as women stop having periods. It can also help prevent weakening of the bones, which is common after the menopause. The average age of menopause in the UK is 51. Around one million women in the UK use HRT for their menopausal symptoms, according to NICE, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. And most women experience menopause symptoms for around four years, while one in 10 can suffer for up to 12 years. NICEguidelines,externalsay that the risks of HRT are small and are usually outweighed by the benefits. NHS advice,externalexplains the small potential risks of HRT for breast cancer and stroke. Alzheimer's charities said the BMJ research was inconclusive and women should not be worried about taking HRT for a short period of time. Dr David Reynolds, chief scientific officer for Alzheimer's Research UK, said: ""Women who require hormone therapy should not be put off by these results, and anyone concerned about the effects of this treatment should speak to their doctor."" The BMJ study could not account for other risk factors for Alzheimer's such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and a family history of the disease.

"A deal confirmed between the UK government and the wind industry will ensure 30% of electricity comes from offshore wind by 2030. The move will help the UK towards an aim of securing almost all its power from low-carbon sources by 2030. It is the latest in a series of agreements with sectors of the economy that are likely to create jobs. But environmentalists are wondering where the other 70% of the UKâs clean electricity will come from. That is because, for several years, government economists have foreseen a three-pronged energy policy by 2030. It will create jobs for coastal regions - from the north of Scotland through Norfolk and Suffolk right to the Isle of Wight. First power from world's biggest wind farm So what are the future energy sources? Offshore wind generated just 6.2% of the UK power needs in 2017. This will rise to over 10% by 2020. The coming boom in offshore wind has been fuelled by a fall in costs that has astonished even supporters of the technology. Civil servants have projected that 30% of electricity would come from offshore wind, 30% from nuclear and 30% from gas power stations fitted with technology to capture their carbon emissions and bury them. But here is the reality - it is now confirmed that wind will fulfil its part by 2030. But plans to expand nuclear are foundering; indeed the UK may end up at worst with just one new nuclear station - at Hinkley - instead of the planned six. As for gas with carbon capture, there is only a single such power plant planned at commercial scale. And that is stuck in the proposal stage. The government promises it will meet pledges to keep the lights on and cut emissions. Its commitment is for offshore wind to produce 30 gigawatts (GW) by 2030, creating thousands of so-called âgreen collarâ jobs in the process. Young people are especially attracted to jobs in the environment sector. But green groups believe much more is needed â probably half as much again (45GW). What do environmentalists say? The UK could end up with just one new nuclear station - at Hinkley - instead of the planned six John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said: ""Now the government's plans for a fleet of new nuclear reactors has collapsed, it leaves Britain with a big energy gap in future. âIt means the latest offshore wind target of 30GW by 2030 is woefully inadequate. âWind and solar must be tripled between now and 2030, with offshore wind the future backbone of the UK's energy system.â Rachel Reeves, chair of the Commons business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) committee said: ""Investment decisions over nuclear plants such as Moorside and Wylfa have left the UK facing a giant hole in its energy policy. âGiven that dirty coal is due to go off-line, and the prospects for nuclear looking uncertain, itâs vital the government comes forward with a Plan B to plug the energy gap.â Prof Jim Watson, director of the UK Energy Research Centre, told us green groups were right to press the government on delivering clean power by 2030. But he warned: ""Going further on offshore wind is one way to balance the uncertainty about carbon capture and nuclear - but it won't be enough on its own. ""It would need to be implemented alongside more investment in other technologies like onshore wind; and much more emphasis on energy storage, interconnections and flexible demand."" The RSPB and The Wildlife Trusts welcomed the wind deal but called for more action to reduce impacts of offshore wind on wildlife. It's hard to assess the total of bird deaths caused by wind farms at sea because the creatures' bodies are immediately lost. Joan Edwards from The Wildlife Trusts said: ""We must ensure that impacts are appropriately assessed. We believe that there is space for the right technology, in the right place, but our advances to produce green energy should not be at the expense of our wildlife."" Are there alternatives? Some analysts are more relaxed. Richard Black from the think-tank Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) thinks three new nuclear plants are likely â and he believes the market will sort out the 2030 problem. He told BBC News: ""Delivery of new nuclear stations at Hinkley, Sizewell and Bradwell, which looks likely, would provide about 20% of electricity demand. ""Gas will be providing about 15%, and there'll be a bit of biomass on the system too. ""As for the rest - new onshore wind needs no subsidy, and offshore wind and solar are at the tipping point of being subsidy-free. So it's reasonable to expect all three to be built through the open market.""

"Staff and students had to leave the university Classes have returned to normal at the University of Glasgow after a controlled explosion was carried out in its mailroom. Bomb disposal officers detonated a suspect package which had been found on Wednesday morning. Many of the university's buildings were evacuated and teaching was disrupted. Specialist police officers investigating the incidenthave linked it with devices found at three London locations. The university,externalsaid it was acting under advice from Police Scotland when it closed a number of buildings, cancelled classes and sent staff home on Wednesday. EOD carried out a controlled explosion The Boyd Orr Building, the mailroom, OTC, Wolfson Medical Building and Bower Building were among the areas closed off. Others sites that were later closed included the Isabella Elder Building, James McCune Smith Learning Hub, the Joseph Black Building, the Kelvin Building and University Gardens. Classes in these buildings were cancelled with hundreds of students affected. Confirming the link with the incidents in London, Assistant Chief Constable Steve Johnson of Police Scotland said anyone who sees anything suspicious should report it immediately. He said: ""The package sent to the university was not opened and no-one was injured. A controlled explosion of the device was carried out this afternoon by EOD. ""There are similarities in the package, its markings and the type of device that was recovered in Glasgow to those in London. ""Therefore, we are now treating it as being linked to the three packages being investigated by the Met in London and both investigations are being run in tandem."" On Tuesday three ""small improvised explosive devices"" were found at sites across London, the Metropolitan Police said.

"Warnings that there is ""no need"" for patients to stockpile their own supply of drugs are being reiterated More warehouse capacity is being arranged by the Welsh Government to stockpile NHS products. The space, in south east Wales, will be used to hold medical supplies such as syringes, bandages and rubber gloves. Six weeks' additional stock has been arranged in case a no-deal Brexit leads to a disruption in supplies. The Welsh NHS has also identified ""alternative providers"" of these day-to-day items as part of its Brexit preparations. Some are concerned if the UK leaves the EU without a deal then extra checks at ports could lead to a backlog of lorries carrying essential items from Europe to the UK. MPs will once againvote on Theresa May's Brexit dealby next Tuesday at the latest. If it is rejected, the prime minister has promised to give MPs votes which could delay Brexit beyond the scheduled departure of 29 March. Despite the possible delay, First Minister Mark Drakeford said the Welsh Government will continue with no-deal Brexit preparations ""until we are completely sure that the only way we could leave the European Union is with a deal"". As part of its no-deal Brexit preparations for the Welsh NHS, the Welsh Government has been working on back-up plans for medical products and devices, following a review of the relevant supply chains by the accountancy firm Deloitte. About half the items bought within the Welsh NHS are from EU countries, according to the body that represents health boards in Wales. Vanessa Young, director of the Welsh NHS Confederation, said: ""We've gone out to suppliers and said to them to work with us to increase that supply and so through doing that we've identified a small number where there might be potential difficulties in getting those supplies and then putting in place plans to say, well, if we can't get that exact product - what's an alternative product we could source and secure?"" 'No need' to stockpile own drugs What preparations are being made for a no-deal? Drug firms fear 'wasting' money on Brexit Medical supplies are currently stored in Denbigh, Bridgend and Cwmbran The Welsh NHS stores much of its medical supplies in three big warehouses in Bridgend, Cwmbran and Denbigh. The Welsh Government and Welsh NHS Confederation confirmed to BBC Wales contracts are likely to be finalised in ""the next week or so"" for additional warehousing capacity in the south east. A source at Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board said they were ""highly confident that we will ensure continuity of supply and that there'll be no disruption to the clinical services that are being provided"". In response to a Freedom of Information request, Cardiff and the Vale University Health Board released notes from its Brexit No Deal Business Continuity Task and Finish Group, which highlighted the need for additional storage and raised particular concerns around the supply of medical goods. The notes, dated 15 November, said: ""A key risk which relates specifically to the UHB [University Health Board] relates to supplies of radio-pharmacy products, and products used in the provision of tertiary services - such as coils used in neurosurgery where there is a single supplier which is based in mainland Europe. ""It was confirmed that we hold the SE [south east] Wales contract for renal dialysis fluid products, and the supplier is based in Europe,"" it added. Ms Young said the NHS in Wales ""has done a lot of preparations"", including desk-based rehearsals and role-play exercises to deal with the possibility of disruption. She reiterated previous official warnings that there is ""no need"" forpatients to stockpile their own supply of drugs. Health Minister Vaughan Gething is hoping to raise any outstanding issues around Brexit preparations for the NHS at a meeting with the UK and Scottish health secretaries, provisionally booked in for next week.

"Mahamed Hashi, Gwenton Sloley and Ken Hinds all say they have been targeted by the Met Police Three prominent, black community advisers have claimed they have been wrongfully searched or arrested by the Metropolitan Police. The men work with police in London on youth violence but said their treatment harmed race relations with the force. It comes 20 years after the MacPherson report said the Met was ""institutionally racist"" over its handling ofStephen Lawrence's murder. The force has denied allegations of racial profiling. It said the officers in the men's cases acted appropriately. About 14% of Met officers are from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds. While this was the highest proportion in England and Wales,external, the 2011 census showed a far higher proportion of Londoners, 40.2%, identify as BAME. As a result the force has said it wants torecruit 250 extra BAME officers a year. Ken Hinds was convicted of an assault that was later found not to have happened Ken Hinds, the chair of the Haringey Independent Stop and Search Advisory Committee, has worked for decades to promote community cohesion. In April, he was arrested after intervening in the search of a young black man near his home in north London. He told the BBC: ""This officer pushed me out of the way. I asked him not to put his hands on me. ""The next thing I know I'm under arrest for obstruction and assault, accused of head-butting."" Mr Hinds was convicted of an assault that was later found not to have happened Mr Hinds was charged and found guilty of assault. But his conviction was quashed nine months later by an appeal judge who said the assault did not take place. He said: ""The community was so incensed by my arrest that we held a public meeting and decided we weren't going to deal with the police until my case was settled. ""As soon as I got arrested the whole establishment washed their hands of me. ""Being a black man in this area, it fits the racial profiling that we're the victims and perpetrators of violent crime."" The Metropolitan Police said it had reached out to Mr Hinds, who is in the process of pursuing legal action. In 2009 Mr Hinds won Â£22,000 compensationafter he was arrested by British Transport Police,externalfor watching a stop and search procedure. Gwenton Sloley said police were ""desperate to take me down"" Gwenton Sloley has won awards for helping young people escape violent lifestyles. Mr Sloley said his home in Lewisham was raided by detectives last October, while he was an adviser to the Met Police - the officers were looking for a previous occupant who was involved in drug dealing. ""They totally destroyed the property, ripped off my air-vent, stole money from me, took my children's stuff, phones, earrings, parking tickets, letters, bank statements, pictures of me. ""They know I live here because they invoice me to the same property - the same people who searched the house."" Mr Sloley says the Met Police have raided his home ""twice in three months"" After the raids, Mr Sloley said officers tarnished his reputation by telling his clients about the warrant, which resulted in them cancelling valuable contracts with him. ""The police are trying to stitch me up,"" he said. ""They've raided me twice in three months, desperate to take me down, telling people I'm too big for my boots."" Scotland Yard said the Directorate of Professional Standards was investigating. Mahamed Hashi says the police should apologise for ""targeting"" people like him Mahamed Hashi is a Labour councillor for Stockwell and a recentwinner of a Community Champion award,externalfor his work to support vulnerable young people. In 2017, he said he was stopped by police officers who surrounded his car in Brixton. ""They asked me 'have you been taking any drugs mate? Your eyes look glazed', and I said 'I don't smoke, I don't take drugs'."" ""They put cuffs on me because they thought I was a threat. I said 'what part of me constitutes a threat?' And they said 'your size'."" 'I've been stopped and searched 400 times' Why 56 black men are posing in hoodies Young black men 'shatter' stereotypes Mr Hashi has raised his concerns with the deputy mayor of policing. ""It feels like we're being targeted as specific people. I feel there should be apologies you know,"" he said. ""We're standing in Brixton where we've had four riots because of police action, and on one side we're trying to heal those rifts but it's being eroded by officers who don't seem to know any better."" Commander for community engagement Mark McEwan said the Met Police had not engaged in racial profiling Met Police commander for community engagement Mark McEwan said he did not agree Mr Hinds and Mr Hashi had been racially profiled. ""They were dealt with due to the circumstances the officers perceived at the time and they acted appropriately,"" he said. ""I'm sorry that relationships have been damaged but this is not a case of right or wrong. ""Policing is a human endeavour and we will at times find ourselves in these situations. ""What's important is how we respond to that and reach out to the individuals involved."" Despite their concerns, Mr Hashi and Mr Sloley are still working with the Met, while Mr Hinds told the BBC now his appeal had been upheld he would engage with the police again.

"Train operator Northern's six-carriage long services in and out of Leeds station have been delayed by two years, BBC News has learned. The longer trains were to be introduced at the end of this year but will now not enter service until late 2021. The delay is because longer platforms at Leeds will not be ready in time After a disastrous 2018, Northern is under pressure to improve the reliability of its services and deal with overcrowding. Rail user satisfaction at 10-year low Northern rail 'number one priority' It has now emerged that the much longer services into Leeds on the busiest routes at peak times, which were planned as part of a timetable shake-up for this December, will not materialise until the end of 2021. But Northern still plans to start phasing in a Â£500m fleet of new short trains from this spring. And despite much scepticism amongst passengers, the company still insists it will get rid of its hugely unpopular and rickety Pacer trains, which date back to the early 1980s, by the end of this year. It will not be possible to bring the longer services in sooner because several platforms at Leeds station will not be lengthened in time to accommodate the longer trains. The work is part of a Â£160m upgrade to the station, carried out by Network Rail, which also includes the creation of an entirely new platform '0'. Network Rail says it committed to the project back in 2014. Initial estimates said the project would be finished by the end of this year, in time to accommodate Northern's long trains. However in 2017, Network Rail decided that the redevelopment of Leeds and the longer platforms could not be finished until the end of 2021. What is now in dispute is when Northern knew that Leeds would not be able to accommodate its six carriage services for an additional two years. The Department for Transport (DfT) says Northern was told in September 2017. It points out that the change was contained in areport by Network Rail which was published online,external. However, the BBC has learnt that a letter was sent to the managing director of Northern a year later, in September of last year. The letter, from the Rail North Partnership (a partnership between the DfT and its regional equivalent, Transport for the North) also signed on behalf of the Secretary of State for Transport, Chris Grayling, ""confirmed"" that a list of infrastructure projects, including Leeds station ""will not be available for use at the December 2019 timetable change"". It went on to ask what the impact would be on Northern, and how the train company would respond ""as a result of the delay of the availability of these outputs"". A spokesperson for the Department for Transport said the letter was a ""contractual requirement"" and the idea that Northern was not aware of the change at a much earlier date was ""simply false"". However Northern believes the decision was only confirmed when it arrived, from its political master, in writing. The latest figures from the rail regulator, the Office of Rail and Road (ORR), showed Northern's punctuality on its trains fell to an eight-year low in the third quarter of last year. The delay means long-suffering passengers on services into Leeds will not benefit from much longer trains for an additional two years. The introduction of shorter new trains should not be affected. And six-carriage services will run from end of this year on other parts of Northern's network, just not through Leeds. However, the dispute and the sequence of events shines a light on the failings of an overly complicated rail system, which a government-commissioned review is looking to fix. It makes the case for better integration of the management of trains and rail infrastructure. It also adds weight to the argument that there needs to be much more regional control. And it plays into a growing consensus that the vastly complicated, and rigid, franchising system we have today has to change. All are issues high-up in the mind of the former British Airways boss, Keith Williams, whose rail review will conclude in the autumn. A spokesperson at the DfT said it was committed to working with Northern to provide an extra two thousand weekly services, creating space for ""31,000 extra passengers on Northern trains.""

"Police Scotland has committed to preventing sex discrimination after a female officer took them to a tribunal over flexible working hours. The force has come to an agreement with the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) who were concerned it was in breach of equality laws. It followed the case of Fiona Mair, an officer and mother who wanted to work full time but on a flexible basis. Police Scotland said it wanted to ensure workers had a work-life balance. On Thursday, the force announced it had signed an agreement which will last for 16 months. During that time the force will implement the steps set out in the joint action plan, and report back to the EHRC on its progress. This includes ensuring that any applications for flexible working hours are monitored to prevent discrimination and that staff making decisions are aware of any implications of their rulings. Deputy Chief Constable Fiona Taylor, lead for professionalism at Police Scotland, said: ""Our officers and staff are our greatest asset and as an organisation we are committed to ensuring that we support our workforce to achieve a work life balance. ""The policing family is diverse, as are the needs of all those who work for us. Police Scotland is committed to balancing the needs of our people while ensuring that we continue to effectively police Scotland and keep people safe. ""Signing this agreement with the EHRC signals our ongoing commitment to supporting our officers and staff and to mainstreaming equality in our day-to-day decision making."" Ms Mair initially requested flexible hours so she could look after her child. However, Police Scotland refused because divisional practice was that officers should start and finish within core hours. In October 2017 an employment tribunal found in her favour, saying her employer had unjustifiably discriminated against her on the grounds of her sex, under section 19 of the Equality Act 2010. Officials said Police Scotland had applied a rule which disproportionately affects single parents - the majority of whom in Scotland are women. Ex-undercover officer wins case against Police Scotland Police Scotland to put 400 officers on 'Brexit duty' The hearing concluded: ""We found the respondent's decision to be disproportionate. ""This was a relatively minor adjustment to make to accommodate the claimant's needs as a single parent, given the resources of the respondent. ""The respondents could have made a slight adjustment which would have pertained for only a limited period of time, and retained a long-serving police officer."" Ms Mair resigned following the tribunal's outcome. Despite this, the EHRC then notified Police Scotland that the findings of the tribunal had not been fully acted on. Lynn Welsh, Head of Legal, EHRC Scotland, said: ""Flexible working is intended to give carers in particular the flexibility that they need to provide care for children or older people without having to leave their jobs. ""We are heartened that Police Scotland have now recognised that not supporting flexible working could impact on female officer's progression and pay.""

"Staff and students had to leave the university Classes have returned to normal at the University of Glasgow after a controlled explosion was carried out in its mailroom. Bomb disposal officers detonated a suspect package which had been found on Wednesday morning. Many of the university's buildings were evacuated and teaching was disrupted.

"Jeremy Hunt met cyber security experts during his visit to Glasgow University Cyber-attacks could turn elections into ""tainted exercises"" that undermine Western democracies, the foreign secretary has said. In a speech in Glasgow, Jeremy Hunt said authoritarian regimes view democratic elections as ""key vulnerabilities"" to be targeted. But he stressed there was no evidence of successful interference in UK polls. Mr Hunt called for economic and diplomatic sanctions to be part of the response to attacks. He added that the government was expanding its network of ""cyber attaches"" - diplomats working with governments around the world to address the problem. The risks of cyber-conflict with Russia UK cyber-centre thwarts hostile hackers US issues sanctions for Russian 'hacking' Russia, China, Iran and North Korea have all been accused of being behind various hacks and online campaigns in recent years. Last year,the UK blamed Russia's GRU intelligence agency for a number of high-profile cyber attacks, including the hacking of Democratic National Committee emails in the run-up to the 2016 US elections. Speaking at Glasgow University, Mr Hunt said it was a ""material fact"" that Russia had tried to ""subvert democracy"", the implications of which were ""profoundly disturbing"". ""At a minimum, trust in the democratic process is seriously undermined,"" he said. ""But in a worst-case scenario, elections could become tainted exercises, robbing the governments they produce of legitimacy. ""And the greatest risk of all is that a hostile state might succeed in casting a permanent cloud of doubt over an entire democratic system."" Mr Hunt said in the cyber era, hostile states no longer need to fight wars to subvert democracy. Using cyber experts, they could, at minimal cost, use propaganda to influence swing voters during election campaigns, he said. ""In a country with an electronic voting system, they could potentially manipulate the result itself."" Mr Hunt called for an improved strategy in the fight against cyber attacks directed at democracies, arguing there should be a ""doctrine of deterrence"". This should involve making states pay a ""price"" for carrying out malicious cyber activity. Nations responsible should be ""named and shamed"" and their methods exposed so that the cyber-security industry can develop protective measures. Mr Hunt also said perpetrators must be made to believe that they run a ""credible risk"" of facing economic and diplomatic penalties. Those responsible for cyber crime should also be prosecuted, he said, and international allies should consider what further steps could be taken, in international law, to deter further attacks. ""We can no longer afford to wait until an authoritarian regime demonstrably succeeds in changing the outcome of an election and weakening trust in the integrity of democracy itself,"" Mr Hunt added. ""The risk is that after just a few cases, a pall of suspicion would descend over a democratic process - and once that happens, the damage would be difficult, perhaps impossible, to repair.""

"Kate McClure (left) and homeless man Johnny Bobbitt pleaded guilty in federal court A homeless man and a New Jersey woman have admitted concocting a hoax feel-good story that drew more than $400,000 (Â£300,000) in GoFundMe donations. US military veteran Johnny Bobbitt, 36, pleaded guilty in court to conspiracy to commit money laundering. Katelyn McClure, 28, admitted wire fraud. They claimed Bobbitt gave McClure his last $20 when her car ran out of petrol near Philadelphia in November 2017. More than 14,000 people from across the world donated money. Act of kindness that raised $400,000 'a lie' Homeless man's $400,000 online fund 'gone' The bogus Good Samaritan story was posted by McClure and her then-boyfriend Mark D'Amico, 39. Bobbitt, McClure and D'Amico still face additional state charges of theft by deception and conspiracy to commit theft. The couple had become acquainted with Bobbitt about a month before the hoax during their trips to a casino, investigators said. From left: Johnny Bobbitt, Katelyn McClure, and Mark D'Amico The story melted hearts around the world, but began to unravel once the trio began media appearances, gushing about the outpouring of online support for Bobbitt. McClure sent a text message to a friend acknowledging the story was ""completely made up"". Instead of using the money to help Bobbitt, officials say the couple spent it on a BMW, a New Year's trip to Las Vegas, visits to Disney theme parks and designer hand bags. The couple allegedly withdrew over $85,000 at casinos in Las Vegas, Atlantic City and a Philadelphia suburb. Bobbitt, a homeless drug addict, later sued the couple, saying he did not get his fair share of the donations. He said he only received $75,000, including an $18,000 trailer bought for him and parked at the couple's home. The lawsuit spurred prosecutors to take a closer look, and led to the criminal charges. McClure is facing 33 months in prison, while Bobbitt could face a custodial term of between six and 30 months,according to the Philadelphia Inquirer,external. Bobbitt will learn his sentence later this week from a drug court, which allows addicts to receive rehabilitation rather than a criminal sentence. Mark D'Amico is also facing charges of criminal trespass after McClure's family accused him of refusing to leave the home they shared after their romantic break-up last August.

"Mahamed Hashi, Gwenton Sloley and Ken Hinds all say they have been targeted by the Met Police Three prominent, black community advisers have claimed they have been wrongfully searched or arrested by the Metropolitan Police. The men work with police in London on youth violence but said their treatment harmed race relations with the force. It comes 20 years after the MacPherson report said the Met was ""institutionally racist"" over its handling ofStephen Lawrence's murder. The force has denied allegations of racial profiling. It said the officers in the men's cases acted appropriately. About 14% of Met officers are from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds. While this was the highest proportion in England and Wales,external, the 2011 census showed a far higher proportion of Londoners, 40.2%, identify as BAME. As a result the force has said it wants torecruit 250 extra BAME officers a year. Ken Hinds was convicted of an assault that was later found not to have happened Ken Hinds, the chair of the Haringey Independent Stop and Search Advisory Committee, has worked for decades to promote community cohesion. In April, he was arrested after intervening in the search of a young black man near his home in north London. He told the BBC: ""This officer pushed me out of the way. I asked him not to put his hands on me. ""The next thing I know I'm under arrest for obstruction and assault, accused of head-butting."" Mr Hinds was convicted of an assault that was later found not to have happened Mr Hinds was charged and found guilty of assault. But his conviction was quashed nine months later by an appeal judge who said the assault did not take place. He said: ""The community was so incensed by my arrest that we held a public meeting and decided we weren't going to deal with the police until my case was settled. ""As soon as I got arrested the whole establishment washed their hands of me. ""Being a black man in this area, it fits the racial profiling that we're the victims and perpetrators of violent crime."" The Metropolitan Police said it had reached out to Mr Hinds, who is in the process of pursuing legal action. In 2009 Mr Hinds won Â£22,000 compensationafter he was arrested by British Transport Police,externalfor watching a stop and search procedure. Gwenton Sloley said police were ""desperate to take me down"" Gwenton Sloley has won awards for helping young people escape violent lifestyles. Mr Sloley said his home in Lewisham was raided by detectives last October, while he was an adviser to the Met Police - the officers were looking for a previous occupant who was involved in drug dealing. ""They totally destroyed the property, ripped off my air-vent, stole money from me, took my children's stuff, phones, earrings, parking tickets, letters, bank statements, pictures of me. ""They know I live here because they invoice me to the same property - the same people who searched the house."" Mr Sloley says the Met Police have raided his home ""twice in three months"" After the raids, Mr Sloley said officers tarnished his reputation by telling his clients about the warrant, which resulted in them cancelling valuable contracts with him. ""The police are trying to stitch me up,"" he said. ""They've raided me twice in three months, desperate to take me down, telling people I'm too big for my boots."" Scotland Yard said the Directorate of Professional Standards was investigating. Mahamed Hashi says the police should apologise for ""targeting"" people like him Mahamed Hashi is a Labour councillor for Stockwell and a recentwinner of a Community Champion award,externalfor his work to support vulnerable young people. In 2017, he said he was stopped by police officers who surrounded his car in Brixton. ""They asked me 'have you been taking any drugs mate? Your eyes look glazed', and I said 'I don't smoke, I don't take drugs'."" ""They put cuffs on me because they thought I was a threat. I said 'what part of me constitutes a threat?' And they said 'your size'."" 'I've been stopped and searched 400 times' Why 56 black men are posing in hoodies Young black men 'shatter' stereotypes Mr Hashi has raised his concerns with the deputy mayor of policing. ""It feels like we're being targeted as specific people. I feel there should be apologies you know,"" he said. ""We're standing in Brixton where we've had four riots because of police action, and on one side we're trying to heal those rifts but it's being eroded by officers who don't seem to know any better."" Commander for community engagement Mark McEwan said the Met Police had not engaged in racial profiling Met Police commander for community engagement Mark McEwan said he did not agree Mr Hinds and Mr Hashi had been racially profiled. ""They were dealt with due to the circumstances the officers perceived at the time and they acted appropriately,"" he said. ""I'm sorry that relationships have been damaged but this is not a case of right or wrong. ""Policing is a human endeavour and we will at times find ourselves in these situations. ""What's important is how we respond to that and reach out to the individuals involved."" Despite their concerns, Mr Hashi and Mr Sloley are still working with the Met, while Mr Hinds told the BBC now his appeal had been upheld he would engage with the police again.

"The most awful political truth about the flare-up in knife crime is that it is so familiar. From time to time, a flurry of terrible attacks emerges, the public is alarmed and politicians debate what can be done. Frankly then, many of the solutions that are often put forward are familiar too. And for a time, genuinely trying to focus on this kind of violence is a prominent political priority. But also familiar is the narrative where that focus then fades over time and the political grip is loosened. What's difficult for politicians grappling with it this time round is not just that the real solutions might take a long time to pursue and make real - that's a familiar truth. But this government has a different problem too - maybe it's not, beyond Brexit, quite sure what it wants to be. It's not so long ago that the prime minister proclaimed that austerity, the code name for years of squeeze on the public sector, was coming to an end. Having made such a commitment you might imagine that when the Home Office asks for more money to help tackle knife crime because of what appears an acute political problem, it would be forthcoming. But money is still tight, and the Treasury is reluctant to open the cheque book, not least because the Home Office had a cash top-up for various things not so long ago. May 'has not listened' on knife crime How Scotland stemmed the tide of knife crime Of course governments of a Conservative stripe will always try to keep a lid on public spending. But there is frustration across Whitehall as ministers try to work out if the prime minister really has concluded that the government ought to be allowing public spending to go up, and deliberately so. Or, if the size and shape of the public purse is roughly the right one. As one insider puts it ""what actually is the theory? Is austerity actually over? We need some clear direction"". The one exception of course on that is the NHS which has been promised billions over the long term. But other ministers point out, if there aren't increases for other departments alongside that huge commitment, lopsided public finances will end up with other departments being deprived. Part of this if, of course, the shadow of uncertainty over Brexit. The lack of resolution over those enormous decisions makes it extremely hard for anyone to know simply, how much money there would be to spend. And in a minority government, the chances of any tax rises passing Parliament are minuscule. So if the chancellor is to spend more, and he has the chance to do so when he announces the Spring Statement next week setting departments budgets, it has to come from the proceeds of a healthier than expected economy - which seems to be his direction of travel - or borrowing which he's always reluctant to do. There is uncertainty over the timing and length of the next spending review But the other way of closing down some of the uncertainty would be actually to hold the promised Spending Review. Those are the moments when governments set out the ""envelope"", to use the terrible jargon, of how much cash departments are likely to have to spend over a longer-term period. And that review, or 'SR' as it's known in Whitehall, seems to be adrift. Multiple ministers have told me they don't believe the process will properly get going until the autumn. One told me the process is ""dead"". One senior official says they are now ""planning for the autumn"". Another minister suggested that no one wanted to engage properly in the process by now because there might be a different prime minister and chancellor in place by the time the review actually got going, with very different priorities. There are also whispers that any review is likely only to plan ahead for one year, rather than three, because there is so much uncertainty around. Other government insiders tell me it's still absolutely possible that the review could get going by the summer as normal, and maybe, just maybe, things are about to settle down. (let's see about that!) Whenever the review comes though, and whoever is in charge, the Tories have some big questions to answer and not just what they want to do about leaving the EU.

"Mr Zuckerberg said he wanted to develop Facebook into a network focused around privacy Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg has said he believes secure, private messaging services will become more popular than open platforms. In a blog,external, Mr Zuckerberg outlined his vision to transform Facebook into a ""privacy-focused platform."" Facebook owns Messenger and WhatsApp, but message encryption limits its ability to make money through targeted adverts. The social media giant has come under fire for a series of privacy scandals. Facebook revamps its privacy controls WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger to 'merge' In 2018, it emerged that the data of about 50 million users had been harvested and passed on to a political consultancy. Some critics see the proposed changes as a way of Facebook perhaps abandoning its responsibilities, says the BBC's North America technology reporter Dave Lee. If what happens on Facebook is more private and temporary, he says, it may be harder to hold the site accountable for any perceived misdeeds. ""Facebook and Instagram have helped people connect with friends, communities, and interests in the digital equivalent of a town square,"" said the billionaire founder of Facebook. ""But people increasingly also want to connect privately in the digital equivalent of the living room."" In response, Mr Zuckerberg said he wanted to develop the social media network into one focused around privacy, reducing permanence, and secure data storage. As part of his privacy goals, he said Facebook would not ""store sensitive data in countries with weak records on human rights like privacy and freedom of expression."" ""Upholding this principle may mean that our services will get blocked in some countries, or that we won't be able to enter others anytime soon. That's a tradeoff we're willing to make,"" he continued. Mr Zuckerberg added that encrypted messaging will also create scope for new business tools, especially ones around online payments and commerce. He did not offer a firm timeline for his vision, but said changes would take place ""over the next few years"". ""I believe we should be working towards a world where people can speak privately and live freely knowing that their information will only be seen by who they want to see it and won't all stick around forever. "" ""If we can help move the world in this direction, I will be proud of the difference we've made,"" Mr Zuckerberg wrote. What we are seeing is potentially a very new direction for Facebook. You could argue that it is finally listening to what its users want and responding to their changing habits, rather than introducing its own ideas and then responding to the influx of feedback afterwards - seeking forgiveness rather than permission is not uncommon in the tech sector. Or you could more cynically point out the looming threat of social network regulation coming its way from various governments around the world, and suggest that this new hands-off approach to data (we won't store it, we won't even be able to see it) might help it survive a clampdown on how it uses people's information. The shift to more intimate communications between smaller groups, making those conversations private even from Facebook itself, and no longer keeping data for a long period of time is no doubt designed to address the tech giant's poor track record on privacy in recent times. As Mark Zuckerberg himself notes: ""Frankly we don't currently have a strong reputation for building privacy protective services"". Facebook has been sharply criticised in the past over lack of user privacy and the spread of offensive content and ""fake news"". Close to $80bn (Â£61bn) was wiped offFacebook's share value in just dayslast March over the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The UK-based consultancy was accused of misusing the data of millions of US Facebook members. Cambridge Analytica denied using the data to aid US President Donald Trump's election campaign in 2016, and claims it had deleted the information in line with Facebook's policies. However, the company's chief executive was soon suspendedfollowing further allegations. Despite the scandal, Facebook  says its user numbers have continued to grow. According to Facebook, the number of people who logged into its site at least once a month jumped 9% last year to 2.32 billion people. User numbers in the US - its second-largest market - have fallen by 15m since 2017 however, according to market research firm Edison Research.
