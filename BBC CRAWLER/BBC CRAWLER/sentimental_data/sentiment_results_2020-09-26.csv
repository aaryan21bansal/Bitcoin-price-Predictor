"A man and woman wear masks in Cardiff, which will see stricter rules from Sunday More than a quarter of the UK population is set to be under stricter coronavirus rules, as new measures come into force this weekend. From Saturday in England, households in Leeds, Wigan, Stockport and Blackpool are banned from mixing in each other's homes or gardens. In Wales,Llanelli became subject to new rules at 18:00 BST, with Cardiff and Swansea to follow 24 hours later. It comes as the rate at which the virus is spreading appears to be speeding up. There have been 6,042 new coronavirus infections in the UK over the past 24 hours, according to the latest government figures - and 34 deaths among those who tested positive for Covid-19 in the past 28 days. It marks the fourth consecutive day that new infections across the UK have topped 6,000. Which areas are under local lockdown?,external What are the UK's coronavirus rules? Scotland recorded 714 cases on Saturday, 156 more than on Friday and itshighest number of cases confirmedin a single day since the start of the outbreak. In Northern Ireland,where meeting other households indoors is also not allowed,319 new cases have seta new daily record, up from Friday's 273. However mass testing was not available during the spring, when deaths were at their peak. Wales reported370 new caseson Saturday. The R number - which indicates how many people someone with coronavirus infects - has risen in the last week andis now estimated to be between 1.2 and 1.5.,externalA number above 1 means the virus is spreading within the community. Meanwhile, London Mayor Sadiq Khan said ""immediate action"" was needed to get coronavirus back under control in the capital, amid a ""sharp rise"" in cases, hospital admissions and patients in intensive care units. On Friday, Londonwas added to the government's Covid-19 watch-list- with all boroughs classed as areas of concern. This video can not be played People in Leeds respond to the tighter rules In England, the ""rule of six"" and a 22:00 closing time for pubs and restaurants applies nationally. But extra restrictions are also in place in large parts of north-east and north-west England,West Yorkshireand the Midlands - where the infection rate is higher. The latest rules for Leeds, Wigan, Stockport and Blackpool came into force at midnight and ban different households from mixing inside private homes or gardens. Support bubbles are not affected and friends and family can still provide informal childcare for children under 14. People are also advised not to socialise with people they do not live with in any other settings, including bars, shops and parks. On Saturday, Wales - where the R number is between 0.7 and 1.2 -saw its first town-only lockdown,with people in Llanelli in Carmarthenshire banned from leaving town or mixing indoors with anyone outside of their household. The same rules will be brought in for Wales' two biggest cities - Cardiff and Swansea - at 18:00 on Sunday. People will not be able to enter or leave the areas without a reasonable excuse, the Welsh government has said. It means by the end of the weekend, about half of Wales' population will be under lockdown - 1.5 million people. And the total number of people across the UK living under stricter rules will stand at 17 million. Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford urged people in Cardiff to behave as if the new restrictions were in place until they came into force on Sunday. Health Minister Vaughan Gething told Today restrictions were more focused on transmission in the home than the pub. ""We have good evidence it is contact in people's homes that is driving it primarily. That is then leaking into other areas where people have contact, including licensed premises,"" he said. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he recognised ""the burden and impact these additional measures have on our daily lives but we must act collectively and quickly to bring down infections"". Meanwhile,students have spoken of their worry and frustrationat being made to isolate in university accommodation, with little notice or guidance. Up to 1,700 students at Manchester Metropolitan University were told to self-isolate for two weeks in their student halls, after a spate of positive tests for Covid-19. In a bid to stop the virus spreading in Scotland, students have been toldnot to socialise with anyone outside of their accommodation or go to pubs, parties or restaurants this weekend.

"Dame Carolyn will step down as CBI boss in November A post-Brexit trade deal ""can and must be made"", the organisation representing British businesses has said ahead of further UK-EU trade talks on Monday. Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, the boss of the Confederation of British Industry, said it was the time for ""the spirit of compromise to shine through"". The Brexit transition period, in which the UK has kept to EU trading rules, ends on 31 December. The UK and EU are yet to agree a deal that will govern their future trade. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said a trade agreement with the EU must be done by 15 October if it is going to be ready for the start of 2021. But despite this, talks have run into problems. There are still key points of disagreement - including, for example, on fishing. The next official round of talks - the ninth since March - begins on 28 September. Why does the UK need another Brexit deal? What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Seven things that will change on 1 January The CBI carried out a survey of 648 companies which found only 4% said they would prefer no deal to be agreed on trade. And half of firms said the impact of dealing with the coronavirus had negatively affected their preparations for next year, when the transition period ends. ""Next week Brexit talks enter the 11th hour,"" said Dame Carolyn. ""Now must be the time for political leadership and the spirit of compromise to shine through on both sides. A deal can and must be made. ""Businesses face a hat-trick of unprecedented challenges - rebuilding from the first wave of Covid-19, dealing with the resurgence of the virus and preparing for significant changes to the UK's trading relationship with the EU."" This video can not be played Why is it so hard to reach a Brexit deal? She added: ""A good deal will provide the strongest possible foundation as countries build back from the pandemic. ""It would keep UK firms competitive by minimising red tape and extra costs, freeing much-needed time and resource to overcome the difficult times ahead."" According to BBC Europe editor Katya Adler,one EU diplomat said the two sides were ""90% there"" on agreeing technical issues. The diplomat said the ""remaining 10% is political"" and ""if that can't be solved, then the 90% is irrelevant"". Analysis: So near and yet so far What trade deals has the UK done? Any trade agreement will aim to eliminate tariffs and reduce other trade barriers. It will also aim to cover both goods and services. If negotiators fail to reach a deal, the UK faces the prospect of trading with the EU under the basic rules set by the World Trade Organization (WTO). If the UK has to trade under WTO rules, tariffs will be applied to most goods which UK businesses send to the EU. This would make UK goods more expensive and harder to sell in Europe. The UK could also do this to EU goods, if it chooses to. What trade deals has the UK done so far? What happens now that a deal's been done? What is the Brexit transition period?

"Restrictions will now apply in Wales' capital city Wales' two biggest cities have gone into lockdown, which started at 18:00. The changed status of Swansea and Cardiff took the number of Welsh local authority areas under heightened Covid restrictions to eight. It follows the first localised lockdown in Wales, in the town of Llanelli in Carmarthenshire, which came into force on Saturday evening. It means 1.5 million people - about half of Wales' population -are now under lockdown. Earlier on Sunday, it was confirmed that three other council areas -Neath Port Talbot, Torfaen and the Vale of Glamorgan- will face the same measures from 18:00 BST on Monday. The restrictions are the same as those affecting people living in Merthyr Tydfil, Bridgend, Blaenau Gwent, Newport, Rhondda Cynon Taf and Caerphilly, which were already in lockdown. When asked if Wales could see a national lockdown, First Minister Mark Drakeford told the BBC'sPolitics Walesprogramme: ""We couldn't possibly rule it out. ""We're trying to do it in a way that balances both the health and the economic needs of Wales,"" he said. Swansea hit a seven-day rate of 56 new cases of coronavirus per 100,000 on Friday, while Cardiff reached 38 cases per 100,000. Wales' first town-only lockdown takes effect Lockdowns for Cardiff, Swansea and Llanelli But the number in Llanelli was 152 cases per 100,000 - which is why the Welsh Government decided to bring in restrictions there a day earlier. The whole of Carmarthenshire was not put into lockdown because the rate in the rest of the local authority area was 18. Llanelli town is in the top three places with the highest weekly infections rates, alongside Blaenau Gwent on 202 per 100,000 and Merthyr Tydfil at 169 per 100,000. Rhossili and other Gower beauty spots are out of bounds for anyone from outside Swansea Under the rules, nobody is able to enter or leave the affected areas without a ""reasonable excuse"". People are allowed to travel outside their area for a limited number of reasons. These include going to work if they are not able to work from home, to go to school, give care and buy food or medical supplies. How are the rules affecting you?

"Marcus Rashford said he is disappointed by the government response to his calls for more action on child food poverty. The footballer said a letter from Education Secretary Gavin Williamson showed ""a lack of empathy... towards protecting our most vulnerable"". Mr Williamson said the government was committed to supporting those in need, but did not fully back his Child Food Poverty taskforce. Rashford, 22, is pressing MPs to go further in tackling hunger in families. The Manchester United forwardsuccessfully campaigned to extend free school meals this summer, prompting a government U-turn on the issue. This video can not be played ""You should feel free, if you want to ask for help, to ask for help"" - Rashford speaks to BBC Breakfast's Sally Nugent Earlier this month, he continued his campaign, establishing a taskforce with some of the UK's biggest food retailers such as Tesco, Asda and the charity FareShare. The taskforce is calling for three policy changes - recommended by the National Food Strategy review - to be funded by the government as soon as possible. In a written response, Gavin Williamson highlighted existing government schemes to combat food poverty, including food parcels, voucher schemes and a summer food fund. But the education secretary stopped short of throwing government support behind calls to expand free school meals to all households on Universal Credit - and two other key recommendations. 'I recognise that you and the Child Food Poverty Taskforce are supporting three of the recommendations in the National Food Strategy relating to food for lower income families. ""The government will carefully consider each of the recommendations in the report as we approach the next spending review."" Rashford, who showed Mr Williamson's letter to the BBC, said: ""I am disappointed by the lack of empathy shown in recent weeks towards protecting our most vulnerable, the future of this country. ""I didn't have the education of a politician, I have never claimed to have all of the answers - but I have a voice and I will continue to use it for the millions who are not being heard. 'We go hungry so we can feed our children' 'Bare cupboards' as food bank use rises in pandemic 'Emergency food' for families with nothing to eat ""The drive of myself and the Child Food Poverty taskforce to see these three government policies implemented without delay is stronger than ever. ""I have no interest in party politics. Letting millions of children in the UK go hungry at night is only an issue of humanity. ""We need to do better."" Allow Twitter content?

Conservative MP Robert Halfon, chair of the education select committee, described the government response to child food poverty as ""a lot of clothes pegs without a washing line"" - claiming individual food programmes, though welcome, were not enough - and a national strategy was required. ""What Marcus Rashford is doing is incredibly important because he is putting this issue into the national consciousness,"" he told BBC Breakfast. Asked if the government response was too slow, Mr Halfon said: ""It's a major social injustice that childhood hunger is going on in our country. ""The government needs to treat this with a real seriousness and make it a priority."" He urged the government immediately to extend free school meals across the school holidays, saying funds from the sugar tax would cover the cost and no additional money would be required. The Child Food Poverty taskforce is pushing the government to fund three policy recommendations by the National Food Strategy: Expanding free school meals to every child from a household on Universal Credit or equivalent, reaching an additional 1.5m children aged seven to 16 Expanding an existing school holiday food and activities programme to support all children on free school meals in all areas of England instead of the current 50,000 children that are helped Increasing the value of the Healthy Start vouchers - which help parents with children under the age of four and pregnant women buy some basic foods - from Â£3.10 to Â£4.25 per week, and expanding it to all those on Universal Credit or equivalent, reaching an additional 290,000 people Mr Rashford has previously described his successful summer campaign to extend free school meals as a ""short-term solution"" to stopping children going hungry, but said it ""wasn't going to work in the long run"". ""We have to think about the best way to do it, to think about how these families can eat long term and not have any issues,"" he said. During the coronavirus lockdown in the spring, the government provided vouchers to families whose children qualify for free meals, but had insisted this would not continue into the summer holidays. It prompted England footballer Rashford, who has spoken about his own experiences of using a food voucher scheme as a child, to write to MPs in June, calling on the government to reverse its decision. The U-turn enabled about 1.3m children in England to claim vouchers over the holidays, with the support working out as about Â£15 a week for each child. By Reality Check The Department of Health defines food poverty, also referred to as food insecurity, as the inability to afford, or have access to food to make up a healthy diet Last year, the government announced that it would start measuring food insecurity through itsFamily Resources Survey,externaland that data would be available from 2021 Earlier this year, a YouGov poll commissioned by the Food Foundation suggestedthat 2.4 million (17%) children are living in food-insecure households.,external Poor nutrition is acknowledged to be a factor in children's performance at school and pupils whose parents receive certain benefits are eligible forFree School Meals.,external In England, around 1.3 million children claimed Free School Meals in 2019 - about 15% of state-educated pupils.

"Matt Ratana moved to the UK in 1989 and joined the Met Police two years later Police investigating the fatal shooting of a police officer in south London say four crime scenes are being searched. Sgt Matiu Ratana, from New Zealand, died in hospital on Friday after being shot in Croydon as a handcuffed suspect was being taken into custody. Residents near one of the search areas reported hearing a loud explosion as a 23-year-old suspect, who is thought to have shot himself, remains in hospital. The Met commissioner said 54-year-old Sgt Ratana would be ""sorely missed"". Speaking at the National Police Memorial in central London, Dame Cressida Dick said she ""hadn't been surprised at all"" by the number of tributes paid to him. London's mayor, the Met Police's commissioner and the home secretary laid wreaths ""Matt was an extraordinary person... He had a wonderful personality and he was very good at his job,"" she said, adding that he was also a ""proud kiwi"". The commissioner also laid a wreath at the National Police Memorial in central London alongside Home Secretary Priti Patel and London's Mayor Sadiq Khan. Sgt Ratana will be remembered at theNational Police Memorial Day,externalService, alongside the six other officers who have died on duty in the past 12 months. The Reverend Cannon David Wilbraham, who is leading the service - taking place online this year - said the event will show their ""sacrifice is not forgotten""  and allow the public ""to recognise the dedication to duty and the courage displayed"". Respects were paid at East Grinstead Rugby Club during two separate minute's silence Silences have also been held at a number of rugby clubs, including at East Grinstead where the 54-year-old was head coach. The West Sussex club's Vice Chairman Matt Marriot said they had to arrange two separate minute's silences because the ""interest has been pretty enormous"", with ""people coming from all over the country"". He said Sgt Ratana ""wasn't just our coach... he was a role model, a mentor and often a father figure"". ""We're going to mourn him as a family member,"" he added. PC Sarah D'Silva, who plays for the club's women's team as well as working at Croydon Police Station, said it felt ""extremely poignant"" joining the minute's silence. She wore her police uniform to pay her respects to the 54-year-old, who she described as ""an absolutely fantastic character, full of life, with the biggest smile you've ever seen"". The 54-year-old was a keen rugby union coach as well as being a fan of performance motorcycles and weight-training Sgt Ratana was shot in the chest at Croydon Custody Centre at about 02:15 BST on Friday. On Saturday evening, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Stuart Cundy said the police were focusing on four crime scenes. Residents near one of the search areas, in Banstead, Surrey, reported hearing a loud explosion on Saturday morning. People living near the address in Park Road were woken by noises at about 05:40 BST. Police guarded the entrance to a property on Park Road in Banstead The BBC's Daniel De Simone said the Banstead address is down a long driveway and its land contains a series of concrete bunkers. Multiple police officers, including armed officers, were visible in the area and people had been informed that a controlled explosion had taken place, the BBC was told. A marked police car has been guarding the entrance to the property. Police confirmed the other scenes undergoing searches are Croydon Custody Centre, where the shooting occurred, an area of London Road in Pollards Hill, where the suspect was initially arrested, and an address in Southbrook Road, Norbury. Describing how the investigation was progressing, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Cundy said: ""We have recovered the gun from the custody suite where Matt was shot. ""We also have CCTV from that custody suite which shows the events, and we have body-worn video of our police officers who were involved in the circumstances surrounding the arrest of the suspect."" The murder investigation is expected to focus on the motive for the killing. The suspect remains in a critical condition is hospital. A rugby ball and police helmet are among the tributes which have been left outside the custody centre The suspect had initially been arrested for an alleged drugs offence and possession of ammunition. The shots were fired as officers prepared to search the suspect - who was still handcuffed - with a metal detector, according to watchdog the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). ""Several crime scenes"" were established on Friday and a cordon also remains in place around the Anderson Heights building in Norbury, south-west London, the Met has said. A concierge in the building told the BBC the 23-year-old suspect did not live in the block but was arrested outside it. An area of London Road in Pollards Hill has been searched by forensic officers The Met previously said the shooting was not terror-related. It is believed the suspect was known to counter-terrorism police and his background may feature prominently in police inquiries, BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said. The suspect had been referred to the anti-extremism government's Prevent programme, aimed to stop people joining extremist groups and carrying out terrorist activities. As part of the IOPC investigation it is examining CCTV and police bodycam footage to establish how the shootings took place. The watchdog said the suspect was in handcuffs, with his hands behind his back. A key part of that IOPC investigation will be to find out how thoroughly the suspect was searched before he was taken into custody. The Met's chief said Sgt Ratana was ""highly respected"" among her officers Sgt Ratana came to the UK in his early 20s in 1989 and joined the Met Police two years later. He was originally from the Hawke's Bay area of New Zealand and was educated at Palmerston North Boys' High School, north of the capital, Wellington. Sgt Ratana, who had a partner and an adult son from a previous relationship, would have been eligible for retirement in two months. Mourners pay tribute Boris Johnson was among those who paid tribute to the officer, tweeting: ""My deepest condolences go to the family, friends and colleagues of the police officer who was killed in Croydon last night. ""We owe a huge debt to those who risk their own lives to keep us safe.""

New Zealand Police - where Sgt Ratana worked between 2003 and 2008 before returning to the UK - also sent their condolences, adding: ""Policing is a family."" Tributes including a police helmet were laid at East Grinstead Rugby Club When he was not working, Sgt Ratana was heavily involved in rugby coaching. England Rugbypaid tribute,externalto the 54-year-old, saying he ""gave so much for our sport"".

A minute's silence was also held before the London derby between Millwall and Brentford. A minute's silence was held before Crystal Palace's match against Everton Neil Donohue, a friend of Sgt Ratana who runs a gym he used to attend, described him as ""inspirational"" and ""the nicest, most generous man you could meet"". He told the BBC the 54-year-old had gone into ""the custody side [of policing] purely because he had had enough out on the streets and he thought it was his safest option, just to see him through to his retirement"".

"The government has fixed a problem with its new NHS coronavirus app in England and Wales which meant many positive test results were not being logged. Users were unable to record a positive test result, if they had booked a test elsewhere and not via the app. But the Department of Health said everyone who tests positive can now log it, however they booked the test. However, people who test negative are still unable to share their result if they did not book it via the app. How does the NHS Covid-19 app work? Anyone who books a test via the app has their result automatically logged whether it is positive or negative, according to the government. But tests taken as a result of Office for National Statistics surveys, and those processed by a NHS Hospital or Public Health England lab, were initially not able to be shared on the app, regardless of the result. However, on Saturday, the Department of Health said anyone who accesses a test elsewhere will, if they test positive, receive a code to input to the app. However a code is only received if the test is positive. Those who enter that they have symptoms without entering a result find a self-isolation countdown begins. The spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Social Care said now ""everyone who receives a positive test result can log their result on the app"". ""A minority of people, such as hospital patients, who were unable to log their positive result can now request a code when contacted by NHS Test and Trace to input on their app,"" the spokeswoman said. The ability to log a negative result is being looked into, she added, after user feedback suggested people wanted the ability to do so. People who have been using the app since its launch on Thursday, and who had already booked tests before downloading it, have found that they are unable to stop the self-isolation countdown after reporting symptoms if they then get a negative result, because it does not come with a code they can share. Prof Deborah Ryan, who originally contacted the BBC, said: ""That's so confusing as the app doesn't tell you that can't enter a negative test booked outside it. ""And the app still tells you to quarantine if you entered symptoms. So this means I can't turn off the self-isolation alert in the app?"" The self-isolation alert cannot be de-activated in this situation. In Wales, lab test results come with notification tokens for the app, Ifan Evans, health director for digital technology and transformation,tweeted,external. The Department of Health has said that using the app is ""entirely voluntary"" and advice to get a test or self-isolate cannot be enforced. Tests booked via the app will have the results automatically shared with it, it said. According to the data analyst App Annie, the NHS Covid-19 app has been downloaded around 4m times so far. ""By downloading this app you are helping protect yourself and others. If you book your test via the app then the results will be automatically recorded in the app and the isolation countdown will be updated,"" said a DHSC spokesman. If you are asked to self-isolate for 14 days because you have been in close contact with somebody who has tested positive, you are advised by health officials to do so even if you later test negative yourself.

"Karl Robinson said the club had endured a difficult week - even before their coach wouldn't start Alcohol spray used on a football club's coach to protect against coronavirus left the driver unable to take players and staff to an away match. Oxford United had to change at their hotel and travel to their game at Accrington Stanley by car. It is thought some of the spray in the air was picked up by a device that stops the coach driver starting the vehicle if alcohol has been consumed. The club started the game at the bottom of League One on Saturday. Karl Robinson, the club's head coach, told BBC Radio Oxford before the match: ""Our coach has just broken down so we've just had to get changed at the hotel and make our way. ""This week has certainly been sent to test us. We had four players test for Covid-19 on Thursday."" He added that they also have ""flu going round"". Oxford eventuallywon the match 4-1. BBC Radio Oxford's Nathan Cooper said: ""[Oxford have] got quite a technical bus that not many at this level have got. ""When you get on board it sprays a sort of alcohol gel - a fine mist spray - which obviously helps with the current situation, so it sterilises the bus. Somehow that ended up affecting the bus itself."" He added: ""It's a crazy thing to happen but first of all you've got to say hats off to the club for trying. Not every club at this level has been doing that."" Testing players for coronavirus is not mandatory in the Football League. However,Grimsby's away match against CheltenhamandLeyton Orient's away match against Walsallhave been postponed after players tested positive.

"Public health teams are dealing with a number of large outbreaks among students in Scotland More than 700 new cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed in Scotland in the last 24 hours. Scotland's National Clinical Director Jason Leitch said the pandemic was now ""accelerating"" in Scotland. The daily total of 714 is the highest number of cases confirmed in a day since mass testing began, and 156 more than Friday's figure. The Scottish government said 11.5% of those newly tested in the past 24 hours had been positive for Covid-19. The number of people in hospital with recently confirmed Covid-19 has also risen by 10 to 99. There were no further deaths reported in the past 24 hours, but one death was confirmed from the previous day, bringing the total to 2,511. Covid-19 in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? Extra police patrols as bar curfew begins New Covid-19 cases confirmed in Western isles Mr Leitch said the trend in Scotland would now be for rises of ""300 to 400 to 600"" in the number of cases, rather than smaller increases. ""Our pandemic in Scotland is presently accelerating - and we need to manage it,"" he told the BBC. Around 3500 new cases have been confirmed in Scotland over the past seven days. The current focus of Scotland's outbreak appears to be in Glasgow, which recorded a weekly case rate of 162.5 per 100,000 people on Thursday. The rate is more than twice that of North Lanarkshire, which has the second highest rate among local authorities. It is also the highest seen in Scotland since the start of the outbreak in March. The number of tests being carried out is far higher than at the peak of Scotland's outbreak in April - meaning more positive cases will be detected - but the percentage of positive tests is also rising. Mr Leitch saidrestrictions on households mixing indoors, which were extended across the whole of Scotland on Tuesday, would take a while to have an affect. ""It's two, three weeks before you show any difference,"" he said. ""And we've now had universities and colleges back and you can see we now have hundreds of cases inside those institutions."" Public health teams in Scotland are currently dealing with a number of large outbreaks among students living in shared accommodation. More than 170 students have tested positivein halls of residence at the University of Glasgow and there have been other outbreaks in Dundee, Aberdeen and Edinburgh. Meanwhile, NHS Fife has confirmed seven workers from Kettle Produce in Balmalcolm in Fife, have tested positive for Covid-19. It said all confirmed cases had mild symptoms and were currently isolating at home. RULES:What are the restrictions in Scotland?

"Matt Ratana moved to the UK in 1989 and joined the Met Police two years later Police investigating the fatal shooting of a police officer in south London say four crime scenes are being searched. Sgt Matiu Ratana, from New Zealand, died in hospital on Friday after being shot in Croydon as a handcuffed suspect was being taken into custody. Residents near one of the search areas reported hearing a loud explosion as a 23-year-old suspect, who is thought to have shot himself, remains in hospital. The Met commissioner said 54-year-old Sgt Ratana would be ""sorely missed"". Speaking at the National Police Memorial in central London, Dame Cressida Dick said she ""hadn't been surprised at all"" by the number of tributes paid to him. London's mayor, the Met Police's commissioner and the home secretary laid wreaths ""Matt was an extraordinary person... He had a wonderful personality and he was very good at his job,"" she said, adding that he was also a ""proud kiwi"". The commissioner also laid a wreath at the National Police Memorial in central London alongside Home Secretary Priti Patel and London's Mayor Sadiq Khan. Sgt Ratana will be remembered at theNational Police Memorial Day,externalService, alongside the six other officers who have died on duty in the past 12 months. The Reverend Cannon David Wilbraham, who is leading the service - taking place online this year - said the event will show their ""sacrifice is not forgotten""  and allow the public ""to recognise the dedication to duty and the courage displayed"". Respects were paid at East Grinstead Rugby Club during two separate minute's silence Silences have also been held at a number of rugby clubs, including at East Grinstead where the 54-year-old was head coach. The West Sussex club's Vice Chairman Matt Marriot said they had to arrange two separate minute's silences because the ""interest has been pretty enormous"", with ""people coming from all over the country"". He said Sgt Ratana ""wasn't just our coach... he was a role model, a mentor and often a father figure"". ""We're going to mourn him as a family member,"" he added. PC Sarah D'Silva, who plays for the club's women's team as well as working at Croydon Police Station, said it felt ""extremely poignant"" joining the minute's silence. She wore her police uniform to pay her respects to the 54-year-old, who she described as ""an absolutely fantastic character, full of life, with the biggest smile you've ever seen"". The 54-year-old was a keen rugby union coach as well as being a fan of performance motorcycles and weight-training Sgt Ratana was shot in the chest at Croydon Custody Centre at about 02:15 BST on Friday. On Saturday evening, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Stuart Cundy said the police were focusing on four crime scenes. Residents near one of the search areas, in Banstead, Surrey, reported hearing a loud explosion on Saturday morning. People living near the address in Park Road were woken by noises at about 05:40 BST. Police guarded the entrance to a property on Park Road in Banstead The BBC's Daniel De Simone said the Banstead address is down a long driveway and its land contains a series of concrete bunkers. Multiple police officers, including armed officers, were visible in the area and people had been informed that a controlled explosion had taken place, the BBC was told. A marked police car has been guarding the entrance to the property. Police confirmed the other scenes undergoing searches are Croydon Custody Centre, where the shooting occurred, an area of London Road in Pollards Hill, where the suspect was initially arrested, and an address in Southbrook Road, Norbury. Describing how the investigation was progressing, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Cundy said: ""We have recovered the gun from the custody suite where Matt was shot. ""We also have CCTV from that custody suite which shows the events, and we have body-worn video of our police officers who were involved in the circumstances surrounding the arrest of the suspect."" The murder investigation is expected to focus on the motive for the killing. The suspect remains in a critical condition is hospital. A rugby ball and police helmet are among the tributes which have been left outside the custody centre The suspect had initially been arrested for an alleged drugs offence and possession of ammunition. The shots were fired as officers prepared to search the suspect - who was still handcuffed - with a metal detector, according to watchdog the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). ""Several crime scenes"" were established on Friday and a cordon also remains in place around the Anderson Heights building in Norbury, south-west London, the Met has said. A concierge in the building told the BBC the 23-year-old suspect did not live in the block but was arrested outside it. An area of London Road in Pollards Hill has been searched by forensic officers The Met previously said the shooting was not terror-related. It is believed the suspect was known to counter-terrorism police and his background may feature prominently in police inquiries, BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said. The suspect had been referred to the anti-extremism government's Prevent programme, aimed to stop people joining extremist groups and carrying out terrorist activities. As part of the IOPC investigation it is examining CCTV and police bodycam footage to establish how the shootings took place. The watchdog said the suspect was in handcuffs, with his hands behind his back. A key part of that IOPC investigation will be to find out how thoroughly the suspect was searched before he was taken into custody. The Met's chief said Sgt Ratana was ""highly respected"" among her officers Sgt Ratana came to the UK in his early 20s in 1989 and joined the Met Police two years later. He was originally from the Hawke's Bay area of New Zealand and was educated at Palmerston North Boys' High School, north of the capital, Wellington. Sgt Ratana, who had a partner and an adult son from a previous relationship, would have been eligible for retirement in two months. Mourners pay tribute Boris Johnson was among those who paid tribute to the officer, tweeting: ""My deepest condolences go to the family, friends and colleagues of the police officer who was killed in Croydon last night. ""We owe a huge debt to those who risk their own lives to keep us safe.""

New Zealand Police - where Sgt Ratana worked between 2003 and 2008 before returning to the UK - also sent their condolences, adding: ""Policing is a family."" Tributes including a police helmet were laid at East Grinstead Rugby Club When he was not working, Sgt Ratana was heavily involved in rugby coaching. England Rugbypaid tribute,externalto the 54-year-old, saying he ""gave so much for our sport"".

A minute's silence was also held before the London derby between Millwall and Brentford. A minute's silence was held before Crystal Palace's match against Everton Neil Donohue, a friend of Sgt Ratana who runs a gym he used to attend, described him as ""inspirational"" and ""the nicest, most generous man you could meet"". He told the BBC the 54-year-old had gone into ""the custody side [of policing] purely because he had had enough out on the streets and he thought it was his safest option, just to see him through to his retirement"".

"Michelle Morgan Davies elected to have a C-section to ensure her partner Darren would not miss the birth Some pregnant women are so worried partners will not make it to the birth due to Covid-19 restrictions, they are opting for elective caesarean sections. According to Wales' coronavirus rules, a birthing partner can still only attend during""active"",externallabour. But some mums-to-be say the unpredictability of labour may mean partners do not reach hospital in time. The Welsh Government said individual circumstances can be taken into account. Michelle Morgan Davies, from Abergavenny, had baby Finn Morgan by caesarean section on Tuesday, with father Darren standing by. ""A lot of dads and birthing partners are sleeping in their cars and waiting for days in the hospital grounds, scared they will miss the birth if they travel home to be called back too late,"" she said. In July,rules stopping women from being accompanied to appointments and scans were eased, but not to include early labour. There are campaigns against this decision, with pregnant women feeling it is unfair people can go to pubs while they must experience parts of birth alone. Ms Morgan Davies said: ""When you compare the maternity restrictions with other activities that are available to us, it makes very little sense. ""The pubs are full, kids are in school in bubbles of 30, a pregnant teacher could be exposed to all those households but can't have her one birth partner in hospital for early labour."" Finn is Ms Morgan Davies' second child - she also has a three-year-old, Greg Ms Morgan Davies, who described the care she received in hospital as ""faultless"", said frontline staff were doing their best to support women in difficult circumstances - and the problem lay with the restrictions themselves. ""We were extremely lucky that Darren was able to be with me all through the pre-op process, in theatre and then for five hours afterwards as the ward was too busy to accept me,"" she said. ""I had been told by staff the previous day that Darren could only be with us for half an hour in recovery before being sent home so that extra time really was a rare and precious thing. ""I know other women aren't getting it and it's devastating."" The early stages of labour can last for days, and women are usually encouraged to stay home for as long as possible. When a woman is in active labour, the contractions are usually regular and strong and the cervix dilated by at least 4cm and this stage usually lasts a few hours. However, it can be unpredictable and even last just minutes before a woman experiences the urge to push - meaning some women are worried they could have the baby without their birth partner or the child's father present. A C-section, which is major surgery, involves risks including infections, excessive bleeding, blood clots or bladder damage. Recovery can take several weeks. Catrin Davies, 34, who is due to give birth in October, said she too had considered a C-section in case a fast active labour meant her fiance, Luke ,would not make it in time. However Ms Davies, from Aberystwyth, was also concerned Luke would not be able to stay with her for long after the birth - with women who have C-sections usually advised to stay in hospital for at least 48 hours. She said Covid-19 has taken the shine off every aspect of this pregnancy. ""I received a phone call from my midwife saying that the appointments will be over the phone, which, of course, I understand but I was disappointed. ""This pregnancy feels a little forgotten and underwhelming. I cannot stop comparing this pregnancy with my first and feel guilty."" Catrin Davies, who has a two-year-old, says the restrictions have put a dampener on her pregnancy Ms Davies said her biggest fear had been potentially receiving bad news during scans, which she had before restrictions eased to allow partners to be present. ""Walking into the empty hospital was scary to say the least,"" she said. ""Afterwards there was no big hug and smiles, just me staring at this scan photo. ""The signal is so poor that I couldn't phone him, I sent him a message saying all is well and a picture... all shared excitement is lost."" When it came to considering birth options, Ms Davies said all she could see were ""the cons due to covid"". ""An elective C-section has the con of Luke not being able stay with us for very long after. I would also be in hospital away from him and Sam [her two-year-old son] for over 24 hours with our newborn, taking away another experience of the pregnancy and birth. ""A vaginal birth, if this goes well I am only in for six to 12 hours and this is preferable but again I would not have Luke there as a support until active labour. ""I have heard of some [partners] having to sit in their cars for hours on end, this is not ideal but our best option that I can see. ""I know how lucky me and Luke are having another baby, however, covid has put a downer on the experience."" 'Covid meant I missed my daughter's birth' 'It's a girl' - father told of baby's sex in car Is the risk from Covid-19 higher during pregnancy? Partners allowed to antenatal appointments Hannah Albrighton, from south west Wales, started a petition to allow birth partners to be present throughout the pregnancy journey. ""It is unfair that new families can stand two metres apart from complete strangers in a shop, but cannot have their partner or birthing partner there because of covid,"" she said. Ms Albrighton added she had heard anecdotes of partners almost missing a birth which progressed quicker than expected, and even women finding out they had miscarried without their partners there to support them. A campaign to ease labour restrictions -Pregnant Then Screwed,external- is being supported by Plaid Cymru MS Bethan Sayed. ""I understand first-hand how frightening and lonely it can be to be without your birthing partner in early labour and recovery,"" Ms Sayed said. Bethan Sayed is supporting a campaign to allow birth partners to be present throughout ""Partners play a vital role as advocates during the birth process, as well as providing emotional support. ""Too many fathers have also missed out on early bonding moments with their children and we must act now to avoid any further detrimental impact on new families across Wales.""

"An airline union official says he believes that EasyJet is ""hanging by a thread"". In a leaked recording obtained by BBC News, Martin Entwisle said the company was in a ""really, really dire situation."" Mr Entwisle made the comment after a meeting with the airline's chief financial officer, Andrew Findlay. EasyJet denies that Mr Entwisle's claims in the recording reflect what EasyJet or its finance officer said. The meeting between Mr Entwisle, three other representatives of the pilots' union Balpa and senior EasyJet management took place two weeks ago. In a subsequent presentation to EasyJet pilots, Mr Entwisle, an EasyJet captain and union rep, said, ""I think the easiest way to put it is that the company is hanging by a thread. The situation is dire. ""If we don't have a good summer next summer and make a considerable amount of money, we really are going to be out of a job."" The recording comes from the presentation, which was given by the union officials to their members as part of a process to encourage them to take up the airline's offer of part-time working in order to save jobs. The language used by union rep Martin Entwisle is stark. However his presentation to fellow pilots at Easyjet, which was recorded and leaked to the BBC, is a pitch. EasyJet and Balpa were, at the time, in the process of thrashing out a deal to mitigate redundancies. After a prior meeting with Easyjet management, Mr Entwisle's overall message to colleagues is that these are such extreme times, that a deal, which would have seemed inconceivable six months ago, is their best bet. The recording does shine a light on just how bleak this winter will be for Easyjet. But there is nothing to suggest that the airline's predicament is any worse than that of any of its competitors. Every airline has been burning cash for months and no-one can say when international travel will truly recover. They've all restructured and flight schedules have been dramatically scaled back in the short to medium term. It is vital for all of them that, by next summer, the situation has dramatically improved. Like all airlines, EasyJet had to take drastic measures in response to the pandemic. It placed around 80% of its pilots on the government's furlough scheme, and secured a Â£600m loan from the Treasury's emergency coronavirus fund.In May it announcedthat it planned to lay off up to 4,500 staff across Europe. But the recording highlights other measures that EasyJet has apparently taken. The airline, which at the start of the pandemic owned over 80% of its aircraft according to Mr Entwisle, has sold over 30% of them, and leased them back, to plough money into the company, and ""more aircraft are about to be sold"". EasyJet was forced to ground its entire fleet at the height of the pandemic Mr Entwisle also said the winter is looking ""dire"" and will result in the airline cutting back significantly on its schedule. He claims that peak flying each day during the winter ""is not going to exceed 90 aircraft in the UK."" The aircraft have all been allocated to bases but ""some of it is absolutely horrendous - some bases are looking at in excess of 50 - 60% cuts, possibly this winter."" EasyJet has previously said it was closing its bases at Newcastle and two London airports, Southend and Stansted. Balpa announced on Friday that it had reached agreement with EasyJet to avoid any compulsory redundancies.  Sixty pilots have left voluntarily, while 1,500 have opted for part-time working, around 75% of all pilots at the airline. EasyJet employees protesting following the airline's decision to close its Stansted operations In a statement EasyJet said: ""The recording does not reflect what EasyJet or its chief financial officer said. We have been clear the whole industry has been impacted by the pandemic, however, EasyJet has taken a prudent approach to capacity and the right actions on cash preservation. ""The airline continues to keep all liquidity options under review, but no decisions have been taken. ""Winter flying is always significantly lower than summer and EasyJet will continue with its prudent and dynamic approach to capacity over the winter.  No decisions have been taken and we will update the market in due course."" EasyJet plans to close bases and cut staff EasyJet plans up to 4,500 job cuts as virus hits EasyJet increases flights to cope with demand Virus drives airlines to 'worst' year on record 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them? 2024 first year to pass 1.5C global warming limit Pop star Chappell Roan wins BBC Sound Of 2025 The Papers: 'Lost Angeles' and 'Musk seeks plan to oust Starmer' 'I paid fake doctor thousands for fillers - now I look like a gargoyle' The 20 child abuse inquiry proposals - what has happened so far?

"Mustapha Adib said he did not want to head a cabinet ""that was bound to fail"" Lebanon's prime minister designate Mustapha Adib has abandoned efforts to form a new government amid popular demands for reform. Stepping down, Mr Adib gave no details but reports say difficulties centred on Shia parties seeking to control the finance ministry and pick ministers. Lebanon - long split along sectarian lines - is in an acute economic crisis. It is reeling from last month's huge explosion in Beirut which killed at least 190 people and injured 6,000. 'This can never be allowed to happen again' The inferno and the mystery ship Beirut blast raises fears for other 'ticking time bombs' Country profile The previous Lebanese government resigned amid widespread anger over the blast, which devastated swathes of the capital. The cause of the disaster was the detonation of 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate that had been stored unsafely in a warehouse at the city's port for six years. The World Bank has estimated that the explosion caused as much as $4.6bn (Â£3.4bn) in damage to buildings and infrastructure. This video can not be played Starting with the epicentre, we follow how the 4 August blast ripped through the city, bringing life to a halt French President Emmanuel Macron has been urging Lebanon's political factions to quickly form a new government. Mr Macron has offered to host an aid conference in mid-October to help. Mustapha Adib, Lebanon's former ambassador to Germany, was nominated to the post on 31 August. He set out saying he wanted an immediate start to reforms and an International Monetary Fund rescue package. But the Sunni Muslim politician appears to have hit a stumbling block with the main Shia Muslim blocs in Lebanon's parliament. By Lina Sinjab, BBC Middle East correspondent, Beirut Mustapha Adib's resignation comes as no surprise. He had the support of a majority of parliament and the endorsement of Emmanuel Macron. But Shia parties - specifically the Amal movement and Hezbollah  - still have the upper hand in politics and the economy in Lebanon, due to their influence in many key sectors including security and finance, and the lack of an equally strong Sunni bloc. Their critics say that, despite the economic downfall of the country and a nearly bankrupt state, both Shia movements still care more about protecting their own interests. Many believe that without international pressure and the threat of freezing assets of Lebanese politicians abroad, no-one here will make concessions for a real change. Mr Adib reportedly insisted on forming a cabinet of technocrats, whilst political factions wanted to have the right to nominate ministers. After meeting President Michel Aoun on Saturday, Mr Adib said he was ""excusing"" himself from the task of forming a government. He apologised to the Lebanese people for his ""inability to realise its aspirations for a reformist team"" to save the country, but added that he did not want to head a cabinet which ""was bound to fail"". An unnamed source close to the French president told Reuters news agency France would not let Lebanon down. ""Adib stepping down amounts to a 'collective betrayal' by Lebanese political parties,"" the source added. Anti-government demonstrators have staged mass rallies for nearly a year, calling for a complete overhaul of the political system. Power is largely based on sectarian interests in the country, and successive governments have been accused of ineffective and elitist leadership. Political appointments and many jobs depend on belonging to one of Lebanon's myriad religious communities, a situation which has led to patronage, cronyism and endemic corruption. Even before last month's explosion, the country was in dire financial trouble as the currency collapsed, unemployment soared and poverty grew. Refugees left feeling helpless - again - by Beirut blast Beirut explosion: Before-and-after images What we know about the blast The French president visited Lebanon at the start of this month and put pressure on political parties to agree on a non-political cabinet that would begin the task of rebuilding the country and tackling corruption. Mr Macron also said that he would consider withholding financial aid or imposing sanctions on the ruling elite if there were no real change within the next three months. He called for credible commitments from party leaders, including a timetable for implementing reforms and parliamentary elections within six to 12 months. The French leader had fully supported Mr Adib. After Saturday's announcement, top Sunni politician and former prime minister Saad al-Hariri warned ""those who applaud the collapse of French President Emmanuel Macron's initiative"" would ""bite your fingers in regret"". Lebanon came under French control 100 years ago after the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War One. The country declared its independence in 1943.

"This video can not be played The orcas repeatedly rammed the yacht A Scottish yacht owner has described how his boat was attacked by three killer whales off the coast of Spain. Graeme Walker, his wife Moira and their friend Stephen Robinson were targeted early on Tuesday morning. Mr Walker, from Helensburgh in Argyll and Bute, felt a sudden jolt as he was at the helm of the 48ft yacht, before spotting one of the orcas. The retired chief financial officer told BBC Scotland: ""We realised they were after the boat."" During their 45-minute ordeal, off Cape Finisterre, they prepared the life raft as the Promise 3 was rocked and spun round. They later discovered a 1.5sq ft chunk had been bitten out of the fibreglass rudder. Speaking from La Coruna, where the yacht is undergoing repairs, Mr Walker said: ""I felt a thump on the boat and the helm was pulled out my hand. ""I was not really sure what was happening, then one of the animals broke the surface, on the left hand side of the boat, for breath."" The yacht's rudder was badly damaged by the whales Mr Walker admitted he had been worried because ""you never know how these things are going to play out"". He added: ""None of us have ever been through anything like this before."" He believes two juvenile orcas were responsible for the initial attack but a third one, which was ""a lot bigger"", soon arrived on the scene. Mr Walker called the Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centre (MRCC) in Finisterre who advised him to ensure the sail was down and the engine off. The operator said the orcas would probably lose interest after 10 minutes - but they continued to attack the 12 tonne boat for 45 minutes. Mr and Mrs Walker feared they might have to leave the yacht on a life raft Mr Walker said: ""The boat would literally spin through 90 degrees when the animals came in. It was as pronounced as that. ""When they actually bit on the rudder and started shaking the rudder the wheel was spinning from side to side. ""You could not have touched it. You would have broken your arms."" His main fear was that a broken rudder could potentially have put a hole in the boat and resulted in it taking on water. Mr Walker added: ""The good thing was it was light. ""If it had happened two hours earlier it would have been pitch dark, which would have been even more unpleasant."" The yacht is currently being repaired in La Coruna He said everyone on board stayed calm and ""there was no screaming or bawling or anything like that."" At the time of the attack, the Walkers and Mr Robinson were 720 miles into a 1,600 mile journey from Almerimar in southern Spain  to the Clyde coast of Scotland. Orcas are normally in the area where the attack happened to feed off tuna - but this is the first year they have been know to target boats. Mr Walker said he first became aware of the problem after reading an article inThe Guardian,externalbut did not realise the incidents had been so frequent. On Tuesday the Spanish transport ministry banned boats of 15m or less from sailing close to the coast between Cape PrioriÃ±o Grande and Estaca de Bares point in Galicia for a week. Despite the restrictions he has been delayed in any event as his yacht will take a week to repair. When asked if, borrowing a famous line from Jaws, he now needs a ""bigger boat"", Mr Walker laughed and said it had crossed his mind. He added: ""If I can get one that is steel then that might be the way to go.""

"NHS staff hand out test kits to students at Glasgow University, where there has been a Covid-19 outbreak Students have spoken of their worry and confusion at being locked down in their university halls, in a situation described by unions as ""shambolic"". Up to1,700 students at Manchester Metropolitan Universityand hundreds at other institutions, including in Edinburgh and Glasgow, are self-isolating following Covid-19 outbreaks. In Manchester, students are being prevented from leaving by security. Universities UK said the wellbeing of students was ""the first priority"". Robert Halfon, the conservative chairman of the Education Select Committee, said 3,000 students were in lockdown at universities from Dundee to Exeter. He called for the government and its scientific advisers to reassure students and families by setting out the policy for England - and warned having students in lockdown at Christmas would cause ""huge anguish"". Mr Halfon said universities should also consider discounts to students who were not being taught face-to-face. 'Donât scapegoat students over Covid outbreaks' Scottish students: 'Why have they sent us here?' Manchester Met said it had introduced a 14-day self-isolation period at its accommodation at Birley and Cambridge Halls after 127 students tested positive for the virus. Some students there said they were getting ready to go out on Friday night when they looked outside to see security guards and police, who told them they could not leave. First-year Joe Byrne said: ""We have had no warning, support or advice from the university about how we get food etc, and instead have been left completely in the dark and practically locked up against our will."" Megan Tingey said she was not contacted by the university about the lockdown before police turned up outside her Birley Vine accommodation. ""It was quite scary and confusing,"" she said. ""No one's really told us much and then the police turn up as well with security outside."" This video can not be played Student Joe Gallagher believes the outbreak was ""inevitable"" Another student, Ellie Jackson, told BBC News she had read about the halls lockdown in the local newspaper before receiving an email about it - and stressed the need for ""more guidance"" from the university. For Ellie, it is the second period of self-isolation she and her five housemates have had to undertake. ""My course is all online - I haven't even been into university,"" she said. ""I could have done this at home. I don't think it's worth the money at the moment."" In a statement, Manchester Met said it had communicated with students ""as soon as we could but it was not possible to give significant advanced notice due to the requirement to implement the isolation almost immediately"". ""The communications we sent included details about how to access food and other provisions and we have been working with other partners, including local supermarkets, throughout the day to provide additional support,"" the statement said. ""Our security teams will increase patrols to support the lockdown and we will take disciplinary action against any students found to have breached requirements."" Students in some halls are confined to their flats at Manchester Metropolitan University Meanwhile, students across all of Scotland have been told not togo to pubs, parties or restaurants over the weekendand Universities Scotland has said students who socialise with anyone outside of their householdrisk losing their place at university,external. Hundreds of students are isolating at Glasgow University because of two coronavirus clusters. The university said itwould offer a four-week rent rebateto all students in university residences in recognition of the ""difficult circumstances"" under which they were living. It said those students would also be given Â£50 each to spend on food and it would invite local mobile food outlets to come to residences. A mobile testing unit has been set up at Murano Street Student Village in Glasgow Reese Chamberlain, an international student at the University of Edinburgh, said his entire block at Holland House was ""locked down"" after a student tested positive. ""The situation is dire,"" he said. ""I already self-isolated when I arrived here and even then it was so difficult getting basic supplies."" He said there had been an ""exodus of students"" during the night on Friday, with more than 50 leaving the building. A spokesperson for the university said it was ""not asking for whole halls of student accommodation to self-isolate"" but there were currently ""a small number of positive cases"" and the university was providing care and support to those self-isolating. A sign reading ""students not criminals"" was displayed at Murano Street Student Village in Glasgow University and College Union general secretary Jo Grady described the lockdown at Manchester Met as ""the latest catastrophe in a week where wholly predictable - and predicted - Covid outbreaks have caused havoc"". There was ""no point encouraging students to come to university to self-isolate for a fortnight"", she added. And the National Union of Students (NUS) said students should be able to return to their families because being ""trapped"" in university accommodation would only add to their anxiety at an already difficult time. It called for universities to support students with food deliveries and provide access to mental health services. ""We must remember this is happening because the government and universities told students to return to campus and this shambolic situation now demands flexibility,"" the union said. Students ""must be able to leave rental contracts, access online learning or defer, and do what it takes to prioritise their safety"", the statement added. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? SOCIAL LIFE:Is it safe to go to the pub? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? The Department for Education said the government was working closely with universities in England to ensure they were prepared for the return of students. A spokesman said: ""Students should follow the latest health advice, just like the wider public, which means they should stay at university in the event that they have symptoms; have to isolate; there are additional restrictions imposed locally; or there is an outbreak on campus or in their accommodation."" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said students were ""not to blame"" for coronavirus outbreaks but backed universities taking disciplinary action as a ""last resort"" against those who broke the rules. Universities UK, which represents 139 institutions, said the health andâ¯wellbeingâ¯ofâ¯students, staff and local communities was the first priority for universities, which would continue to follow government guidance.

"The attack happened outside the former offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo Seven people have been detained in connection with an attack outside the former offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris, officials say. A man armed with a meat cleaver wounded two people in the attack on Friday. The main suspect, identified as an 18-year-old man of Pakistani origin, was arrested near the scene. Police said six others were in custody and being questioned. The attack is being treated as a terrorist incident. Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin said it was ""clearly an act of Islamist terrorism"". He said police had underestimated the threat level in the area. The attack came as a high-profile trial was under way of 14 people accused of helping two jihadists carry out the 2015 attack on Charlie Hebdo, in which 12 people were killed. Charlie Hebdo vacated its offices after the 2015 attack, and the building is now used by a television production company. The two victims of Friday's attack have not been officially named but police said they were a man and woman who worked at the production company. Prime Minister Jean Castex told reporters at the scene - near Boulevard Richard-Lenoir - that their lives were not in danger. Charlie Hebdo's head of HR 'forced out of home' Charlie Hebdo is now run from a secret location. In an interview with state broadcaster France 2 late on Friday, Mr Darmanin described the stabbing as ""a new bloody attack against our country, against journalists"". ""It's the street where Charlie Hebdo used to be. This is the way the Islamist terrorists operate,"" the interior minister said. He said he had ordered security to be stepped up around synagogues this weekend for Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar. The main suspect has not been named, but Mr Darmanin said he arrived in the country three years ago ""as an isolated minor"" of Pakistani nationality. The minister added that the suspect was not known for being radicalised, but had a previous arrest for carrying a screwdriver - and gave no details. Colleagues of the victims said they had been outside the Premieres Lignes news production agency smoking a cigarette when they were attacked. The firm has offices Rue Nicolas Appert, a street off Boulevard Richard-Lenoir where Charlie Hebdo's offices used to be located. A mural honouring those killed in the January 2015 attack is nearby. ""I went to the window and saw a colleague, bloodied, being chased by a man with a machete,"" one employee, who asked not to be named, said. ""They were both very badly wounded,"" Paul Moreira, the founder and co-head of Premieres Lignes, told AFP news agency. A local trader, who took this photo of a victim being treated, said there was panic outside his store Police quickly sealed off the area and a blade - described as a machete or a meat cleaver - was recovered nearby. The main suspect was arrested on the nearby Place de la Bastille. Shortly afterwards a 33-year-old Algerian national was also taken into custody over possible links to the attack. Five others - born between 1983 and 1996 and said to be of Pakistani origin - were later detained during the search of property north of Paris believed to be the home of the main suspect, officials say. French Prime Minister Jean Castex visited the scene flanked by Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo In a tweet, Charlie Hebdo expressed its ""support and solidarity with its former neighbours... and the people affected by this odious attack"". Charlie Hebdo marked the start of the trial earlier this month by reprinting its controversial cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. The original cartoons had sparked anger and protests in several Muslim majority countries. In response to the reprinting, the militant group al-Qaeda - which claimed the 2015 attack - renewed its threat against the magazine. The magazine's head of human resources said earlier this week thatshe had moved out of her home after receiving death threats. The defendants are also accused of helping another jihadist carry out related attacks, killing four people. The 17 victims were killed over a period of three days. All three attackers were killed by police. The killings marked the beginning of a wave of jihadist attacks across France that left more than 250 people dead. On 7 January that year, two French Muslim gunmen - brothers ChÃ©rif and SaÃ¯d Kouachi - stormed the Charlie Hebdo offices Rue Nicolas-Appert before opening fire on its staff. The editor, StÃ©phane Charbonnier, better known as Charb, was among four celebrated cartoonists who were killed. A mural in tribute to those killed in the Charlie Hebdo attack was erected on the Rue Nicolas-Appert The gunmen were eventually killed by security forces after a manhunt. Their victims were eight journalists, two police officers, a caretaker and a visitor. In a related attack just days later, jihadist gunman Amedy Coulibaly killed three customers and an employee in a hostage siege at the Hyper Cacher Jewish supermarket in the east of Paris. He had earlier shot dead a policewoman in the city. Security forces eventually stormed the supermarket before killing him and freeing the remaining hostages.

"Dennis Skinner was an ever-present in British politics for the best part of five decades A song about a former Labour MP has been topping the Amazon download charts ahead of Lady Gaga, Kylie Minogue and Bruce Springsteen. Dennis Skinner, the so-called Beast of Bolsover, lost the seat he had held since 1970, in December. The track Tony Skinner's Lad, by musician Robb Johnson, is a tribute to the acerbic politician, who grew up in Derbyshire. Mr Johnson said he had always ""admired"" the ex-MP and trade unionist. By Friday evening the track remained at number one in the Amazon best sellers, ahead of Magic by Kylie Minogue and Ghosts by Bruce Springsteen. It also reached number 37 on Apple's iTunes chart and 19 in theOfficial Singles Download Chart,external. However, the fact that download sales account for only about 4.8% of the overall music market might explain why the song did not feature at all in theOfficial Singles Chart Top 100,external. The song is a mix of Mr Skinner's speeches and quips, and lyrics referring to his parents and upbringing in Derbyshire, before his arrival at parliament 50 years ago. ""We thought it would be lovely to get Dennis Skinner into the charts,"" Mr Johnson said. ""I suppose it's done so well because that's an indication of the great respect he is held in. ""On many levels I've admired him as a principled people's delegate to parliament. I've admired his politics and admired him even more that he enjoys singing."" Robb Johnson said the success is down to Mr Skinner's own popularity Mr Skinner underwent hip surgery ahead ofthe overnight count in his Derbyshire constituency, in December. Film maker Daniel Draper who made Dennis Skinner: Nature of the Beast, a 2017 documentary about the life and times of the ex-MP, produced the track's video. ""It's a catchy little ditty,"" he said. ""I speak to [Skinner's] partner Lois quiet regularly. He seems to be doing well. ""The family have all been in touch about the song and its video. I know Dennis has seen it and Lois said he really likes it."" Mr Skinner is known for his support for the miners throughout the 1984-85 strike and fighting for their pension rights. He was also suspended from the House of Commons numerous times for what was deemed ""unparliamentary language"".

"Matt Ratana moved to the UK in 1989 and joined the Met Police two years later Police investigating the fatal shooting of a police officer in south London say four crime scenes are being searched. Sgt Matiu Ratana, from New Zealand, died in hospital on Friday after being shot in Croydon as a handcuffed suspect was being taken into custody. Residents near one of the search areas reported hearing a loud explosion as a 23-year-old suspect, who is thought to have shot himself, remains in hospital. The Met commissioner said 54-year-old Sgt Ratana would be ""sorely missed"". Speaking at the National Police Memorial in central London, Dame Cressida Dick said she ""hadn't been surprised at all"" by the number of tributes paid to him. London's mayor, the Met Police's commissioner and the home secretary laid wreaths ""Matt was an extraordinary person... He had a wonderful personality and he was very good at his job,"" she said, adding that he was also a ""proud kiwi"". The commissioner also laid a wreath at the National Police Memorial in central London alongside Home Secretary Priti Patel and London's Mayor Sadiq Khan. Sgt Ratana will be remembered at theNational Police Memorial Day,externalService, alongside the six other officers who have died on duty in the past 12 months. The Reverend Cannon David Wilbraham, who is leading the service - taking place online this year - said the event will show their ""sacrifice is not forgotten""  and allow the public ""to recognise the dedication to duty and the courage displayed"". Respects were paid at East Grinstead Rugby Club during two separate minute's silence Silences have also been held at a number of rugby clubs, including at East Grinstead where the 54-year-old was head coach. The West Sussex club's Vice Chairman Matt Marriot said they had to arrange two separate minute's silences because the ""interest has been pretty enormous"", with ""people coming from all over the country"". He said Sgt Ratana ""wasn't just our coach... he was a role model, a mentor and often a father figure"". ""We're going to mourn him as a family member,"" he added. PC Sarah D'Silva, who plays for the club's women's team as well as working at Croydon Police Station, said it felt ""extremely poignant"" joining the minute's silence. She wore her police uniform to pay her respects to the 54-year-old, who she described as ""an absolutely fantastic character, full of life, with the biggest smile you've ever seen"". The 54-year-old was a keen rugby union coach as well as being a fan of performance motorcycles and weight-training Sgt Ratana was shot in the chest at Croydon Custody Centre at about 02:15 BST on Friday. On Saturday evening, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Stuart Cundy said the police were focusing on four crime scenes. Residents near one of the search areas, in Banstead, Surrey, reported hearing a loud explosion on Saturday morning. People living near the address in Park Road were woken by noises at about 05:40 BST. Police guarded the entrance to a property on Park Road in Banstead The BBC's Daniel De Simone said the Banstead address is down a long driveway and its land contains a series of concrete bunkers. Multiple police officers, including armed officers, were visible in the area and people had been informed that a controlled explosion had taken place, the BBC was told. A marked police car has been guarding the entrance to the property. Police confirmed the other scenes undergoing searches are Croydon Custody Centre, where the shooting occurred, an area of London Road in Pollards Hill, where the suspect was initially arrested, and an address in Southbrook Road, Norbury. Describing how the investigation was progressing, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Cundy said: ""We have recovered the gun from the custody suite where Matt was shot. ""We also have CCTV from that custody suite which shows the events, and we have body-worn video of our police officers who were involved in the circumstances surrounding the arrest of the suspect."" The murder investigation is expected to focus on the motive for the killing. The suspect remains in a critical condition is hospital. A rugby ball and police helmet are among the tributes which have been left outside the custody centre The suspect had initially been arrested for an alleged drugs offence and possession of ammunition. The shots were fired as officers prepared to search the suspect - who was still handcuffed - with a metal detector, according to watchdog the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). ""Several crime scenes"" were established on Friday and a cordon also remains in place around the Anderson Heights building in Norbury, south-west London, the Met has said. A concierge in the building told the BBC the 23-year-old suspect did not live in the block but was arrested outside it. An area of London Road in Pollards Hill has been searched by forensic officers The Met previously said the shooting was not terror-related. It is believed the suspect was known to counter-terrorism police and his background may feature prominently in police inquiries, BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said. The suspect had been referred to the anti-extremism government's Prevent programme, aimed to stop people joining extremist groups and carrying out terrorist activities. As part of the IOPC investigation it is examining CCTV and police bodycam footage to establish how the shootings took place. The watchdog said the suspect was in handcuffs, with his hands behind his back. A key part of that IOPC investigation will be to find out how thoroughly the suspect was searched before he was taken into custody. The Met's chief said Sgt Ratana was ""highly respected"" among her officers Sgt Ratana came to the UK in his early 20s in 1989 and joined the Met Police two years later. He was originally from the Hawke's Bay area of New Zealand and was educated at Palmerston North Boys' High School, north of the capital, Wellington. Sgt Ratana, who had a partner and an adult son from a previous relationship, would have been eligible for retirement in two months. Mourners pay tribute Boris Johnson was among those who paid tribute to the officer, tweeting: ""My deepest condolences go to the family, friends and colleagues of the police officer who was killed in Croydon last night. ""We owe a huge debt to those who risk their own lives to keep us safe."" This video can not be played Dame Cressida Dick paid tribute to Sgt Ratana, saying he was ""big in stature, big in heart"" New Zealand PM Ms Ardern previously released a statement saying: ""To all Matiu's whanau (Maori for extended family) across the world, we share your sorrow and have all our condolences."" New Zealand Police - where Sgt Ratana worked between 2003 and 2008 before returning to the UK - also sent their condolences, adding: ""Policing is a family."" Tributes including a police helmet were laid at East Grinstead Rugby Club When he was not working, Sgt Ratana was heavily involved in rugby coaching. England Rugbypaid tribute,externalto the 54-year-old, saying he ""gave so much for our sport"".

A minute's silence was also held before the London derby between Millwall and Brentford. A minute's silence was held before Crystal Palace's match against Everton Neil Donohue, a friend of Sgt Ratana who runs a gym he used to attend, described him as ""inspirational"" and ""the nicest, most generous man you could meet"". He told the BBC the 54-year-old had gone into ""the custody side [of policing] purely because he had had enough out on the streets and he thought it was his safest option, just to see him through to his retirement"". ""It's just absolutely tragic,"" he said.
