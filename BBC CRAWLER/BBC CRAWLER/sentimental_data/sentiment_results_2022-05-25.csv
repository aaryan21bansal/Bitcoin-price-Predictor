"Long-promised Irish language and Ulster Scots legislation has taken its first step at Westminster. Legislation on a cultural package had been expectedbefore the end of the last assembly mandate. It was part of the 2020 New Decade, New Approach deal that restored Stormont's institutions. The bill will provide ""recognition and protection"" of Irish language and the Ulster-British tradition. It has begun its legislative passage in the House of Lords first, but it is understood it will not be fast tracked. It is scheduled for its second reading early next month. The legislation will give the Irish language official status, allow the use of Irish in courts and see the appointment of Irish and Ulster Scots/Ulster British commissioners. The Identity and Language (Northern Ireland) Bill,externalwill also establish an Office of Identity and Cultural Expression. Experts take long-term look at Irish and Ulster-Scots Speaking ahead of its introduction, Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said it represented a ""significant milestone"" for Northern Ireland. ""This legislation is carefully balanced, as negotiated by all parties, to ensure everyone in Northern Ireland benefits,"" he added. ""Not only will the legislation faithfully deliver on the measures within New Decade, New Approach, it will also, importantly, ensure the principles of respect and tolerance, as stated in the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement, continue to be realised."" He will have ""step in"" powers to appoint commissioners if an executive is not in place by the time the bill becomes law. This video can not be played Irish speakers react to news that the legislation has taken its first step at Westminster It will also allow the secretary of state to intervene in areas relating to the decisions of commissioners, if power sharing is not restored. Irish language group Conradh na Gaeilge has cautiously welcomed the development Its advocacy manager, ConchÃºr Ã Muadaigh, said it was an emotional and historic day. However, he added: ""We're not naÃ¯ve. This is only the beginning of a legislative journey for this bill. ""And our own painful experience with the British government taught us to take nothing for granted here. ""After this becomes enacted they must appoint a commissioner who can develop best practice standards, because this will now become the immediate litmus test for the British government. ""Having legislation is one thing, acting on it is the real test - without the immediate action this legislation won't be worth the paper it's written on."" Anne Smyth, chair of the Ulster Scots Language Society, says the bill does not support their language The legislation has been delayed for months with the government initially agreeing to pass the bill at Westminster last autumn, to resolve a Stormont split on the issue. Anne Smyth, chair of the Ulster Scots Language Society, says the bill does not support their language. She believes Ulster Scots to be at a disadvantage because of a lack of investment in and engagement with native Ulster Scots speakers. ""It [the bill] actually adds another layer of sectarianism to Ulster politics and Ulster society,"" she said. ""They are basically trying to hand responsibility over to academics and civil servants. ""I don't see us having a voice in that group and we haven't had a voice for quite some time.""

"Tony and Sara on their wedding day ""I wish I hadn't followed the rules, I'd have taken the fine,"" Sara said, adding she would have given anything to spend more time with her dying husband. She told BBC Radio 5 Live she followed the rules because she thought the government was doing the right thing. Like many of those bereaved by Covid she is angry at the revelations inthe Sue Gray report,externalinto Westminster parties during lockdown. Boris Johnson said he took ""full responsibility"" and was ""humbled"". Sara, who is from Surrey but asked us not to use her full name, said she had been unable to go with her husband Tony, 59, when he was rushed to hospital during the first lockdown, back in 2020. While she was able to visit him briefly, the rules at the time meant she had to leave after a few hours and he died when she was not with him. ""I'd have taken the fine because that's what [Mr Johnson] appears to be doing,"" she said. ""He didn't follow the rules, his staff didn't follow the rules, they've taken the fine."" Sara, 60, said she had been ""distraught"" but had listened to the government's messages and followed the rules. ""I did and I wish I hadn't,"" she said. ""Neither of my kids could be there, they had to Facetime their father. Their last memory of their father was to Facetime him and my last memory is him saying to me 'I'll see you tomorrow morning'. ""One of the events - on 20 May when they had the 'bring your own beer' [event] - was the day I buried my husband and I had just my kids with me. And it's just not fair. ""I'd have given anything for extra time to have been with him and it's just not fair."" She added it was not just about a few drinks but about the credibility of the government - and said Downing Street and the office of the prime minister had been brought into disrepute.

Group spokesman Lobby Akinnola, whose father Olufemi Akinnola died as a result of coronavirus in April 2020 aged 60, said: ""When they were texting colleagues about getting away with it, we were having to text our families telling them they couldn't come to their loved ones' funerals. ""The messages in the report show they knew how disrespectful they were being to the families they were failing, but that didn't bother them. ""Not content with partying whilst he failed to protect our loved ones, the prime minister has now spent months ignoring and lying to us."" Safiah Ngah, 29, called for Mr Johnson to resign over the ""raucous and savage behaviour"" in Downing Street. She told the PA news agency restrictions in place last February meant she was unable to say a final goodbye in person to her 68-year-old father Zahari Ngah. Safiah Ngah, whose father died last February, says the prime minister should resign over ""raucous and savage behaviour"" in Westminster Her family had to settle for a video call as their last contact while government officials were ""cheers-ing"", partying and joking about getting away with it, she said. ""It's disgusting. It makes me embarrassed to be British,"" she said. Lyndsay Greenwood, who lost her father to Covid in January 2021, described Ms Gray's report as ""a bit of a farce"", saying it does not hold Mr Johnson to account. ""I didn't expect anything more, didn't expect any resignations,"" she said. ""He's using the energy crisis as a distraction tactic - it's always distractions, but actually this is something that needs looking at too."" ""Yes I lost my dad, but it's not just about that. It's the ongoing impacts of the pandemic, especially financially with people having to have gone on furlough."" She said there was ""no leadership"" and said the prime minister should have stepped down. But not everyone has put the blame at the prime minister's door. Mary Smith, whose husband Terry died during the pandemic, said the report was all ""what we've heard before"" and said she did not have any confidence that Labour would have done better in power. ""He's a buffoon, he did wrong. But personally I think the other issues he's handling well,"" she said. ""I'm pretty fed up of hearing about it."" She added: ""I don't bear any grudges about how [husband] Terry died but I am angry about people not wearing masks on the bus that he caught it from.""

"Households in England, Scotland and Wales are set to have hundreds of pounds knocked off energy bills as part of a package worth billions to help people cope with soaring prices. The government is to scrapa plan to give people Â£200 off bills from Octoberwhich would be repaid over five years. Instead, the BBC understands that sum will be increased and possibly doubled, and will not need to be paid back. Additional help for those on the lowest incomes is also expected. The support, to be announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak later, is expected to be largely funded by a windfall tax on oil and gas firms that could raise Â£7bn. It comes a day afterSue Gray's critical report into lockdown parties in Downing Streetand follows intense pressure on the government to do more to help people with the cost of living crisis. Live: Millions await new help for cost-of-living squeeze How high could my energy bills go? 'She won't ask me for money for sanitary products' Earlier this week the UK's energy regulator Ofgem said the typical household energy bill was set to rise by Â£800 in October, bringing the typical household bill to Â£2,800 a year. Bills had already risen on average by Â£700 in April. Ofgem warned it meant 12 million households could be placed into fuel poverty. Most people living in homes in England in council tax bands A-D have already received a Â£150 rebate on their bills. Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said the ""bulk"" of government support needed to go to those on the lowest incomes ""who are suffering the most severe consequences of this cost of living crisis"". She told the BBC the charity was now helping more than 750 people every day with food bank vouchers. ""We have got people in this country who cannot put food on the table, they cannot keep their lights on and the heating on,"" she said. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said offering a universal payment would mean a lot of the money would go to households who ""don't desperately need it"". He also warned putting billions of pounds into the economy at a time when prices were rising quickly ""could stoke additional demand and make inflation much more permanent"". Opposition parties have repeatedly called for a windfall tax on energy companies that have made bumper profits, in large part because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But until now the government had resisted calls to impose the one-off levy, with some senior members of the cabinet arguing it could deter energy firms from investing in the UK. However, it is understood the prime minister has now sided with Mr Sunak, who had been pushing for the tax. Government set to U-turn on windfall tax Which countries are doing the most to tackle bills? But proposals to tax income from other electricity producers, such as some older windfarms and nuclear plants which have also seen windfall gains, have been shelved. And companies that increase investment in the UK could earn a discount on the additional tax. The Treasury said the government understood ""that people are struggling with rising prices"" and that Mr Sunak had been ""clear that as the situation evolves, so will our response"". David Thompson is one of those struggling to pay the bills. The 46-year-old has five children and four grandchildren and gets Universal Credit - which he calls ""Universal Crisis"". David Thompson says food, energy and clothing are all costing more ""It is getting worse and worse, but you have just got to make do with what you have got. It is a struggle. You are worrying before you get paid, then when you get paid you worry how far it is going to go,"" he said, ""It is supposed to last a month, but you are skint after a week or two."" As typical household energy bills are rising, and areset to go up again in October, he said that any extra support given by the government was never going to match the rate of price rises at the moment. ""This is one of the worst times. I remember when the shipyards went down, and the miners' strikes. People are more well-off now than the 80s and the 90s, but things are a lot more expensive,"" he said. Read more about people struggling with bills Energy firms have made huge profits following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Shell reported a record Â£7bn profit in the first three months of this year while BP made Â£5bn, the highest for 10 years. But Offshore Energies UK, which represents the offshore oil and gas industry, said a windfall tax on energy firms would see higher prices and do long-term damage to the oil and gas industry. Deirdre Michie, chief executive of the body, said: ""This is an industry that thinks and plans long-term, so sudden new costs, like this proposed tax, will disrupt planning and investment and, above all, undermine investor confidence."" Higher energy bills are pushing prices to rise at the fastest rate for 40 years, with fuel and food costs also biting into household budgets. Ofgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley said conditions in the global gas market had worsened after Russia's invasion and warned that the price cap could rise beyond Â£2,800 if Moscow decided to disrupt supplies. Europe gets about 40% of its natural gas from Russia, so sudden supply cuts could have a huge economic impact. While the UK would not be directly impacted by supply disruption - as it imports less than 5% of its gas from Russia - it would be affected by prices rising on global markets as demand in Europe increased.

"The Northern Ireland Assembly sitting in January 2020 Sinn FÃ©in has tabled a petition to recall the assembly in a bid to elect a new Stormont speaker. The party's chief whip Pat Sheehan said the Democratic Unionist Party ""needs to stop"" blocking the formation of an executive. The DUP hasrefused to support a new speaker or first and deputy first ministerbeing nominated until there is""action"" on Brexit trade arrangements. A petition requires the signatures of 30 assembly members to pass. It is not clear yet if other parties will support the bid. Calls to re-establish executive after Sinn FÃ©in success Is the DUP's defiance starting to soften? How does power-sharing work in Northern Ireland? Mr Sheehan said he had tabled the recall petition to ""allow parties to get to work"". ""The DUP need to stop blocking an executive being formed, so we can give workers and families that help right away,"" he said. ""People want an executive now."" Two weeks ago the DUP refused to support the election of a new assembly speaker. That is the first act that must happen after an election before the assembly can carry out any other business. It requires cross-community support from a majority of nationalists and unionists. Under the protocol, checks are required on goods coming into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK The DUP - Northern Ireland's second-largest party by assembly seats after the 5 May election - said it would not nominate ministers to form a new executive until its concerns about the Northern Ireland Protocol - the post-Brexit trading arrangements for Northern Ireland - are resolved. The protocol is under fresh scrutiny following the elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly. The elections cemented a majority for assembly members who accept the protocol, including the new largest party, the republican party Sinn FÃ©in. The protocol, part of the government's Brexit deal with the European Union, was designed to ensure free trade could continue across the Irish land border by keeping Northern Ireland aligned with the bloc's single market for goods. However, it has faced criticism from some unionists who argue it has undermined Northern Ireland's position in the UK by placing additional checks on some goods crossing the Irish Sea. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has said he believes the pressure his party is bringing to bear on the issue of the protocol was beginning to have an impact. Last week, No 10 announced it would introducea law to change the trade deal. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, who visited Northern Ireland on Wednesday, said issues around the protocol were""soluble"" but could not be allowed to drift. Is the DUP's defiance starting to soften?

"Russia has flattened large areas of Severodonetsk during weeks of bombardment A senior figure in eastern Ukraine has denied reports that a vital road linking Ukrainian-controlled areas in the east has been blocked from the rest of the country by Russian forces. ""Luhansk has not been cut off,"" said the region's military administration head, Serhiy Haidai. Fighting has reached the outskirts of the big city of Severodonetsk, a key Russian target. If they capture the road to Bakhmut then the city could be surrounded. Mr Haidai said that while the route to the south-west of Severodonetsk had come under fire, humanitarian aid was still getting through. Things were far bleaker in Severodonetsk itself, which was being shelled 24 hours a day and Russian forces were close enough to use mortar rounds as well as artillery and aerial bombing, he told the BBC. Six people were killed in Russian bombardment on Tuesday, he said on his Telegram feed. If Russia captures the neighbouring town of Lysychansk then the whole Luhansk region will be in its hands. The Luhansk regional head accused Russian forces of bombarding civilian infrastructure while 15,000 civilians remained in Severodonetsk, mainly in shelters. ""They can't take the city so they have decided to try to destroy it, and to make our troops leave the city,"" Mr Haidai said. Mr Haidai published a picture on his Telegram feed indicating damage to the road to Bakhmut, which he said was still open American volunteer combat medic Dallas Anthony Casey, who has helped evacuate civilians from Severodonetsk, said shelling of civilian areas was constant. ""Two days ago one of the volunteer ladies was hit when going door to door. She lost the lower half of her leg and lost a lot of blood before we could get to her. We had to do CPR, but we were unsuccessful,"" he told the BBC. Three months after Russia launched its invasion, its war aims are currently focused on seizing Ukraine's eastern regions in the industrial heartland of Donbas. Russia has sustained heavy losses on the battlefield and for the first time since the war began state TV showed President Vladimir Putin visiting casualties at a Moscow hospital. In the very brief clip filmed for a weekend TV programme, the Russian leader could be heard telling a man ""your father will be proud of you"". The Russian leader was said to have visited Mandryk central military hospital in Moscow President Volodymyr Zelensky has described conditions in eastern Ukraine as extremely difficult while prominent Russian figures have indicated they are prepared for a protracted conflict. Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev said Russia was not chasing deadlines and Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu has admitted the pace of the offensive is slowing down. The Ukrainian leader appealed to European countries to show unity in the face of Russian aggression and Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called on the West to ""kill Russian exports"" by stopping all trade. As well as bombarding towns and cities in the east, Russia launched its biggest missile attack yet on the southern city of Zaporizhzhia at dawn on Wednesday, killing one person and damaging more than 60 homes and a shopping centre. In a clear statement of intent that Russia's long-term plans extend across the south, as well as eastern Ukraine, President Putin signed a decree making it easier for citizens in Russian-occupied areas of the south to get Russian passports. While the region of Kherson is under Russian occupation, only parts of the neighbouring region of Zaporizhzhia are in Russian hands. A Russian-appointed official in occupied Zaporizhzhia, Vladimir Rogov, declared on Wednesday that the entire region should become a fully-fledged part of Russia, rather than a so-called people's republic. Occupied areas of Donetsk and Luhansk became proxy republics after they were captured in 2014 and Russia has already handed out 800,000 passports there.

"A rail workers' union has said its demands for a pay rise are ""not unreasonable"", after its members voted to hold a national strike. The RMT Union said some railway workers have had their pay frozen for three years. On Tuesday, RMTmembers at track operator Network Rail and 13 train operating firmsvoted overwhelmingly in favour of strike action. The Department for Transport said strikes should be the last resort. A spokesperson said: ""It is hugely disappointing and premature that the RMT is calling for industrial action before even entering discussions."" The prospect of a national strike threatens major summer travel disruption across the UK. Rail workers' union votes for national strike Rail strike would bring country to a halt - union Rail union to ballot over 'derisory' pay offer Eddie Dempsey, assistant general secretary at RMT, told the BBC that some of their members ""are in the third year of a pay freeze this year"". ""Don't forget we kept this country moving during the pandemic, we've tightened our belts, we haven't had a pay rise. At the same time, the private companies made bumper profits,"" he said. Mr Dempsey said the union is calling for a pay rise, job security and no compulsory redundancies. ""That's not unreasonable in the current day and age is it,"" he said. Will there be a national rail strike? Tony Miles, a writer for Modern Railways magazine, told the BBC that there may be some public sympathy for RMT members if no pay rise is offered, especially given the cost of living crisis. But he warned that sympathy might have limits. ""If the RMT's members are offered something that sounds acceptable, and they end up holding out a lot longer, I think that won't play well with the public, especially when you consider there will be passengers who haven't also hadn't had pay increases or are also struggling to pay bills,"" he said. ""If it looks like unions are trying to hold country to ransom, public mood might turn sour very quickly."" National strike action could cause widespread travel disruption over the summer The strike ballot of National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers saw 89% vote in favour of a strike and 11% against. Some 71% of RMT's 40,000 members voted. Workers at Network Rail, which maintains the UK's railway infrastructure, have not taken part in a national strike since 1994. The union said the company planned to shed 2,500 maintenance jobs as it tried to make Â£2bn of savings over the next two years. The RMT union has said its leaders will meet to discuss a timetable for strike action from mid-June. Mr Dempsey said he hoped a deal could still be reached, adding that the union ""urgently"" needed to sit down with industry and with the government. ""The quicker we do that, the quicker we can get a settlement, and hopefully we won't have to take the next step of announcing strike action."" The Department for Transport said the railways were ""still on life support"" and warned that anything that drives more passengers away ""risks killing services and jobs"". A spokesperson said: ""We urge the RMT to reconsider and accept the invitation of industry talks, so we can find a solution that delivers for workers, passengers and taxpayers alike."" If Network Rail staff, which include signallers, walk out, it will affect both passenger services and the movement of goods by train, including bulk consignments of fuel and some food, experts say. Trains might only run for part of the day, such as from 07:00 to 19:00 BST and only on main lines. Services could also be reduced to around a fifth of the normal weekday timetable, they add. There are warnings that any potential strikes could have a major impact on rail freight and the sector's ability to move goods around the UK. John Smith, chief executive of GB Railfreight, said if the disruption ends up being long term, the effects would be ""dramatic"". ""It will crystallise in various ways, whether it be shortage of fuel at the pumps, whether it be production being stopped in factories of cars, whether it be electricity generation or Drax having to switch off and not being able to generate electricity,"" he said. Trade body UKHospitality has also warned that a national rail strike could jeopardise the hospitality industry's recovery from the pandemic. Its chief executive Kate Nicholls said: Strikes would inevitably damage our already fragile hospitality businesses, which would have a negative knock-on effect to the wider UK economy."" She added: ""A lack of commuter trains bringing people into towns and cities will further set back the recovery of our high streets and will also deter people from going out in the evening - especially women and vulnerable people who may rely on trains to get them home and feel safe late at night.""

"This video can not be played Undercover filming by Wales Investigates shows the five men discussing the spot-fixing with journalists A footballer has been secretly filmed helping to recruit players to spot-fix matches. A BBC undercover investigation showed former Llanelli footballer Emile N'Goy, his brother Hermes N'Goy and three European players discussing the illegal activity with undercover journalists. Spot-fixing sees players manipulate moments in games, such as red cards, so criminals can defraud bookmakers. Hermes N'Goy has denied he and the other four planned to spot-fix. Emile N'Goy and the three European players - Idris Laib, Jean-Francois Mbuba and Julien Vercauteren - have been approached individually but have not responded. Emile and Hermes N'Goy are originally from the Democratic Republic of Congo and grew up in France. BBC Wales Investigates secretly filmed four meetings over a 20-month period Emile  N'Goy is currently without a team but has played in lower league clubs across the UK, including Llanelli Town AFC, Stranraer FC, Brechin City FC and Dorchester Town FC as well as clubs in Portugal and Italy. There is no suggestion spot-fixing took place at any of these clubs, nor that any other players at these clubs were involved.

Emile is currently without a team but has played in lower league clubs across the UK Emile was first approached by an undercover journalist at a Llanelli match and told he was looking for investment opportunities for illicit, black market funds. Emile said he would talk to his brother about it. At a later meeting, Hermes tells the undercover reporter: ""But you know that is not legal... so you have to be very cautious when you do this kind of thing."" He then suggested recruiting three players - a defender, midfielder and a striker. He later suggested recruiting another two players and two members of staff to help run the operation - including a man who once worked for Italy's newly-crowned champions AC Milan, who he said had fixed before. Asked if that man had ever fixed at AC Milan, Hermes said: ""No, he did the fixing with another club."" He added the man did not yet know about the spot-fixing plans being discussed. Hermes said he would find the players in the lower leagues of Europe where there was less scrutiny. At a later meeting in a Kent hotel, Hermes brought along his brother Emile and three other players from domestic league clubs in France and Belgium. BBC Wales Investigates filmed four meetings over a 20-month period Idris Laib, Jean-Francois Mbuba and Julien Vercauteren all told the journalists they had spot-fixed before. One of the journalists told them: ""We're not trying to push or force anyone. So, if anybody's not happy, we don't want them to be involved."" All decided to stay and discussed taking part in a spot-fixing scheme that Hermes would manage. Hermes told the journalists they should expect to pay the players an annual salary of 20,000-25,000 Euros (Â£17,000-Â£21,400) each. One player asked if he would be paid for the fixes in cash. At a later meeting, he said the undercover journalists would need to pay an additional 500 Euros (Â£430) for every throw-in, corner or free kick they caused. He said red and yellow cards would be more expensive: 1,000 Euros (Â£850) for a yellow and 2,000 Euros (Â£1,700) for a red. Hermes added: ""It's not like, 'you have to lose this match'. It's not like big match-fixing. It's a small thing, very invisible."" All players apart from Emile said they had taken part in spot-fixing before but Hermes reassured the journalists his brother Emile would be involved. Investigator Terry Steans said spot-fixing could be very hard to detect Terry Steans, who worked as an investigator for Fifa with responsibility for rooting out corruption and fixing across the world, was shown the undercover footage. ""The fact they're there, they're listening and they're agreeing to what has been proposed... they shouldn't be there and they shouldn't be even listening to that kind of chat. ""So that's evidence in itself, that they're in the room, that they're willing to take part. ""And he's got players on board, like-minded that will do what he wants them to do, already. So I think he's deadly serious."" He said spot-fixing could be very hard to detect as it was hard to investigate without the full weight of a police force. Hermes was approached on the street by BBC reporter Wyre Davies Hermes was expecting to meet the undercover journalists again to complete the deal. Instead, he was approached by BBC reporter Wyre Davies. He denied any wrongdoing, saying: ""I don't know nothing about that. I don't know what you're talking about"", before walking away. He later contacted the BBC and said his brother Emile and the three other players also strongly denied doing anything illegal. Kevin Carpenter is a lawyer specialising in sports integrity If the plan had gone ahead and they and been caught, the consequences would have been serious. ""You're talking long bans, years... seven years for a first time match-fixing offence, so essentially, the end of their career,"" said Kevin Carpenter, a lawyer specialising in sports integrity. He said corruption had always been around football. ""Top-tier football is a billion-dollar industry with players earning millions, but the other end of the scale, at the lower league clubs, players are paid just a few hundred pounds a game. ""Obviously, you only hear about things at the top level of the sport. But actually, when you get further down the levels, that's where the real corruption seems to happen."" People are able to place bets on almost anything in football matches, such as the number of yellow cards, if a player will be sent off, the number of corners in the first half or how many throw-ins there will be in the first five minutes of the game. Spot-fixing sees criminal gangs pay players or officials to do exactly what they want - known as fixing. They then place bets, already knowing what is about to happen.

"Russia has flattened large areas of Severodonetsk during weeks of bombardment A senior figure in eastern Ukraine has denied reports that a vital road linking Ukrainian-controlled areas in the east has been blocked from the rest of the country by Russian forces. ""Luhansk has not been cut off,"" said the region's military administration head, Serhiy Haidai. Fighting has reached the outskirts of the big city of Severodonetsk, a key Russian target. If they capture the road to Bakhmut then the city could be surrounded. Mr Haidai said that while the route to the south-west of Severodonetsk had come under fire, humanitarian aid was still getting through. Things were far bleaker in Severodonetsk itself, which was being shelled 24 hours a day and Russian forces were close enough to use mortar rounds as well as artillery and aerial bombing, he told the BBC. Six people were killed in Russian bombardment on Tuesday, he said on his Telegram feed. If Russia captures the neighbouring town of Lysychansk then the whole Luhansk region will be in its hands. The Luhansk regional head accused Russian forces of bombarding civilian infrastructure while 15,000 civilians remained in Severodonetsk, mainly in shelters. ""They can't take the city so they have decided to try to destroy it, and to make our troops leave the city,"" Mr Haidai said. Mr Haidai published a picture on his Telegram feed indicating damage to the road to Bakhmut, which he said was still open American volunteer combat medic Dallas Anthony Casey, who has helped evacuate civilians from Severodonetsk, said shelling of civilian areas was constant. ""Two days ago one of the volunteer ladies was hit when going door to door. She lost the lower half of her leg and lost a lot of blood before we could get to her. We had to do CPR, but we were unsuccessful,"" he told the BBC. Three months after Russia launched its invasion, its war aims are currently focused on seizing Ukraine's eastern regions in the industrial heartland of Donbas. Russia has sustained heavy losses on the battlefield and for the first time since the war began state TV showed President Vladimir Putin visiting casualties at a Moscow hospital. In the very brief clip filmed for a weekend TV programme, the Russian leader could be heard telling a man ""your father will be proud of you"". The Russian leader was said to have visited Mandryk central military hospital in Moscow President Volodymyr Zelensky has described conditions in eastern Ukraine as extremely difficult while prominent Russian figures have indicated they are prepared for a protracted conflict. Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev said Russia was not chasing deadlines and Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu has admitted the pace of the offensive is slowing down. The Ukrainian leader appealed to European countries to show unity in the face of Russian aggression and Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called on the West to ""kill Russian exports"" by stopping all trade. As well as bombarding towns and cities in the east, Russia launched its biggest missile attack yet on the southern city of Zaporizhzhia at dawn on Wednesday, killing one person and damaging more than 60 homes and a shopping centre. In a clear statement of intent that Russia's long-term plans extend across the south, as well as eastern Ukraine, President Putin signed a decree making it easier for citizens in Russian-occupied areas of the south to get Russian passports. While the region of Kherson is under Russian occupation, only parts of the neighbouring region of Zaporizhzhia are in Russian hands. A Russian-appointed official in occupied Zaporizhzhia, Vladimir Rogov, declared on Wednesday that the entire region should become a fully-fledged part of Russia, rather than a so-called people's republic. Occupied areas of Donetsk and Luhansk became proxy republics after they were captured in 2014 and Russia has already handed out 800,000 passports there.

"Prince Charles visited a centre distributing food and clothes to refugees The Prince of Wales has arrived in Romania to show his support for Ukrainian refugees and to see first-hand the assistance being provided. It's the first visit from a senior royal to the region since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The latest figures show almost a million Ukrainians have already crossed the border into Romania. Prince Charles visited a centre near Bucharest, which supports a rising number of refugees. ""It's a nightmare situation,"" the prince said to Ukrainian families who were collecting supplies of food and clothing. He said to ""keep praying"" and told them he was ""full of admiration for the Ukrainian people - their extraordinary courage and resilience"". A million Ukrainians have come to Romania since the outbreak of war Aid workers explained the scale of the pressures. More than six million people have left Ukraine in the three months of the war. In the past week alone, a further 40,000 people are estimated to have crossed into Romania. Prince Charles has been strongly outspoken about the war, attacking the ""brutal aggression"" inflicted on Ukraine. Having travelled to Bucharest, about 150 miles from the Ukraine border - this is also the closest a senior British royal has come to the conflict. The prince also has a long-standing connection with Romania, having set up a charitable foundation in the country and restored a traditional farmhouse. Charles visits Ukrainian community in London Royals don't hide colours over Ukraine war Where have Ukrainian refugees fled? Ukraine risks being 'pulverised', royals told The visit comes as figures from the UNHCR show 966,000 Ukrainians have entered Romania since the start of the war, with only Poland taking in more refugees. ""I've not seen anything so big and so fast. By any measure it's a major movement of people,"" says Mike Weickert, global rapid response director for World Vision, a charity supporting Ukrainian refugees in Romania. Lisa, a refugee from Ukraine, is helping as an interpreter for new arrivals ""It's going to be increasingly difficult for refugees and for the hosting countries,"" said Mr Weickert, whose aid agency is working in the Romexpo centre, visited by Prince Charles and Margareta, head of Romania's royal family. The conference centre site is helping more than 1,000 people a day, with Romanian authorities and international agencies providing food, clothing and advice services. Among those helping with the international effort at the centre is Stephen Noble of the Salvation Army. He spent the pandemic helping with a food bank in Scarborough, and there are some similarities to the services being offered here, with food parcels available and racks of second-hand clothing. Help is available for refugees arriving in Bucharest's train station There are soft toys for children and pet food for the dogs and cats that some families brought with them. Mr Noble has been struck by the dignity of those arriving, who had to leave everything behind - and says that for those in the UK who have made donations it is ""absolutely worthwhile"". He says one of the most practical ways of supporting refugees has been to give them vouchers, worth about Â£10, to use in local supermarkets, which allows them to buy for their individual needs. One of the translators is herself a refugee. Lisa has gone from being a sales manager in Odessa to helping disorientated new arrivals. Stephen Noble is part of the international effort visited by Prince Charles ""At first it's a shock. You don't believe it. Then you realise you have to stay."" So many people have left Ukraine that in some villages there is only one person left, she says. For those refugees continuing to stream across the border into Romania, by car, bus or train, there is still a generous reception. At Bucharest's Gara de Nord train station there are volunteers and support workers waiting to help families escaping the war. Romania has given Ukrainian refugees free travel on its railways, with women and children the great majority of new arrivals. On the station concourse there are tents ready to provide immediate shelter and first aid. The prince met families using the support services This is a refugee crisis in a highly-mobile, urban setting. Many are moving on to other countries, some will try to return to Ukraine, and those that stay in Romania are mostly in the bigger cities, with spaces having to be found in hostels, private houses, public buildings or hotel rooms. As well as emergency needs, such as food and shelter, aid workers say they will need to provide longer-term support for refugees. Children will need schools, adults will need jobs to have an income, older people with health problems will need access to medical support and there will be mental health problems from such a traumatic uprooting. The longer refugees are out of their homes the more they risk ""running out money, running out of options"", says Mr Weickert.

"The cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk in the Donbas region have come under intense bombardment as Russia tries to encircle them A defence ministry spokesman says the army still controlled the main road into the two cities, despite fighting in the area Russia says it will allow ships carrying food out of blockaded ports if sanctions are lifted Ukraine is a major grain producer and the EU accuses Russia of weaponising food The UK has warned prices will only increase if the stand-off isn't resolved President Putin signs a decree making it easier for Ukrainians in occupied areas to become Russian citizens Edited by Chris Giles and George Wright We are pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for now. We'll be back in the morning, Ukraine time. A young boy sits in front of a damaged building after a strike in Kramatorsk in the Donbas region But before we go, here's a recap of the day's main developments: Olga IvshinaBBC Russian senior correspondent The Russian parliament has passed a law raising the age limit for people signing up to the army to 50. It follows ongoing attempts by Russian officials to recruit more soldiers as Russian
casualties in Ukraine mount. Under current
legislation, only Russians aged 18 to 40 and foreigners aged 18 to 30 can enlist as
professional soldiers in the Russian military. âHighly
professional specialists are needed to use high-precision weapons and operate
weapons and military equipmentâ and such specialists may be aged 40 to 45, said
a note accompanying the draft bill. According to the
new law Russian citizens and foreigners up to the age of 50 will be able
to sign a contract with the military. The note said the
amendment would also help attract those in civilian professions to join the
army, including medics, engineers and communications experts. Since the start of
the war in Ukraine, the Russian Ministry of Defence and the so-called Wagner private
military company have launched a vast and persistent campaign to recruit new
soldiers both officially and unofficially. Based on open
sources, BBC Russian has identified at least 46 Russians aged over 45 who have been killed in Ukraine after the start of the invasion. This includes a 63-year-old retired general, who was shot down operating a Su-25 fighter
jet. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia Russia's plan to make it easier for Ukrainians living in Russian-controlled regions of Ukraine to receive Russian citizenship violates international law, Kyiv says. The government accused the Kremlin of ""criminal"" behaviour. President Vladimir Putin has issued an order to simplify the procedure of handing Russian citizenship to residents of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions in Ukraine's south. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia. ""The illegal issuing of passports... is a flagrant violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as norms and principles of international humanitarian law,"" the Ukrainian foreign ministry said in a statement.  Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv âQuantity has a quality of its own.â Itâs said these words were
used by Joseph Stalin to describe the Soviet approach to war. Throw enough
bodies at a conflict and eventually you will overwhelm the enemy. It worked for
the Red Army against the Nazis and the Finnish. In both wars they lost more
men, but eventually came out on top They are words that also
apply today. Vladimir Putinâs army is
finally finding some success, as his forces make breakthroughs in the eastern
Donbas region. Over the last few days they have captured a number of towns and
villages, forcing the Ukrainians to retreat to more defensible positions. They are doing it with sheer
weight of numbers. Not just men, but artillery, armour and air power. This morning the Governor of
Luhansk region described the numbers they were coming up against as âinsaneâ.
President Zelensky told ABC News his men were outnumbered 7-to-1 in the region. The current Russian targets
are the twin cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. There are thought to be
thousands of Ukrainian forces there, dug in and prepared for a long battle.
But, they are facing the prospect of being cut offâ¦ then destroyed by the sheer
weight of the Russian forces. If that happens, some of
Ukraineâs best troops will be taken out of the war. But, not all is lost for the
Ukrainians. They have huge quantities of international military support, both
promised and en route, much of it far more advanced than that currently on
display in the Donbas. The question is, can they
bring that quality to bear, before the Russian quantity overwhelms them? Russia has flattened large areas of Severodonetsk during weeks of bombardment A senior figure in eastern Ukraine has denied reports that a vital road linking Ukrainian-controlled areas in the east has been blocked from the rest of the country by Russian forces. ""Luhansk has not been cut off,"" said the region's military administration head, Serhiy Haidai. Fighting has reached the outskirts of the big city of Severodonetsk, a key Russian target. If they capture the road to Bakhmut then the city could be surrounded.  Haidai said that while the route to the south-west of Severodonetsk had come under fire, humanitarian aid was still getting through. Things were far bleaker in Severodonetsk itself, which was being shelled 24 hours a day and Russian forces were close enough to use mortar rounds as well as artillery and aerial bombing, he told the BBC. Six people were killed in Russian bombardment on Tuesday, he said on his Telegram feed. If Russia captures the neighbouring town of Lysychansk then the whole Luhansk region will be in its hands.

It's the first meeting of its kind since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The meetings took place at Moscow's Mandryka military hospital. Putin shook hands with the men and asked one soldier about his baby son, telling him: ""He will be proud of his dad."" ""These are people who are risking their health and lives for the sake of the people and children of Donbas, for the sake of Russia. They are all heroes,"" he told officials after meeting the wounded men. Sean CoughlanReporting from Bucharest Romanian President Klaus Iohannis (L) welcomes Britain's Prince Charles during their official meeting at Cotroceni Presidential Palace in Bucharest This
is the closest to the conflict in Ukraine that any senior member of the British Royal Family has come so far. Prince Charles has travelled to Romania to show solidarity for the refugeesand the
aid agencies trying to help them. Itâs a cause close
to his heart and heâs visiting a convention centre outside Bucharest being used
to distribute food, clothes and advice. Heâs in a
country with a war on its doorstep. Almost a million refugees have
come across the border into Romania. Thousands more are
arriving every single day and aid workers have been emphasising the sheer scale
of this mass migration. More than six million people have left Ukraine in three
months. Itâs also a refugee
crisis in a modern European setting. Many are keeping moving, stopping
temporarily in neighbouring Romania before heading further afield. Those that are
staying are not in camps or rows of tents - but in hostels, hotels, peopleâs
houses, spaces in public buildings. Thereâs been a
generous effort to welcome these displaced people, with volunteers meeting
arrivals at the railway station. But if international
interest wanes, and compassion fatigue sets in, it will be when the pressures
are even greater to support rising numbers of people facing a long-term
separation from their homes. George WrightBBC News Casey, seen here in a village near Kharkiv, has been in Ukraine for two months More now on Severodonetsk - a strategically vital city in the eastern Donbas region that is being bombarded by Russian forces. Dallas Anthony Casey is an American combat medic who has been volunteering in Ukraine for more than two months. He has been carrying out various roles including giving medical training to Ukrainian forces. He is currently in Dnipro after returning from Severodonetsk, where he has been helping evacuate people remaining in the besieged city. Shelling of the city is ""constant"", he tells me. ""Never a moment where there wasnât. Weâd be driving down the road to one location and watch a building get hit. We'd stop and run into the building and see if anyone could be saved,"" Casey says. ""Two days ago one of the volunteer ladies was hit when going door to door. She lost the lower half of her leg and lost a lot of blood before we could get to her. We had to do CPR, but we were unsuccessful,"" he adds. Despite the constant shelling and complete devastation of the city, many civilians remain. ""When weâd drive through youâd see people on their bikes or on a stroll while the building right next to them gets blown up. No rush or hurry, theyâd just carry on with what they were doing."" The people remaining roughly fall into two groups, Casey says. ""Some think the Russians will come and take over and their life will be much better,"" he says. ""We convinced some people to come with us and theyâd be shamed on their way out of the shelter."" ""Then the other group of people are in complete shock. You go to their door, ask them if they want to be evacuated and theyâd be too scared to leave their homes,"" he says. ""Theyâd tell you: 'This is all I have, where am I going to go?'"" Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has said Russia is trying to ""blackmail"" the international community by raising the possibility of unblocking Black Sea ports in return for a relaxation of sanctions. Writing onTwitter,externalhe wrote ""Any foreign politician or official who may think of accepting this game should first visit the graves of killed Ukrainian children and talk to their parents."" Earlier the Interfax news agency cited Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Rudenko as saying Moscow is ready to provide a humanitarian corridor for vessels carrying food to leave Ukraine, in return for the lifting of some sanctions. Ukraine's Black Sea ports have been blocked since the beginning of Russia's invasion began on 24 February. More than 20 million tonnes of grain is currently stuck in silos in the country. Russian forces are seeking to take control of Severodonetsk Ukraine is battling to remain in control
of a key highway to the front-line city of Severodonetsk, the country's defence ministry says. Defence ministry spokesman Oleksandr Motuzyanyk told a
briefing that alternative routes existed to supply Ukrainian
units in Severodonetsk, which is surrounded on three sides by
Russian forces. Russia's aim is to fully surround
Ukrainian units in the city, as well as in nearby Lysychansk, he added. Russian forces are seeking to take control of Severodonetsk, Lyschansk, and Rubizhne in order to place the whole of the Luhansk area under Russian occupation. Luhansk makes up half of the eastern Donbas region, where Moscow has re-focused its war effort. Many believe President Putin could claim victory in the war if Russia takes control of Donbas. Jessica ParkerReporting from Brussels The EU is struggling to reach an agreement on its sixth
sanctions package against Russia, with Hungary vocal in its opposition to an
oil embargo. But while talks go on, thereâs also work to tighten up the
existing rules. The European Commission wants to make violating sanctions an
EU-wide crime. So if someone, for example, tried to flout an export ban to
Russia or hide sanctioned assets, it would, in theory, become easier to
prosecute them. The proposed measures wouldnât just cover oligarchs but
complicit lawyers and bankers too. The plans also look at broadening the blocâs
ability to seize, and even sell, assets that are linked to oligarchs as well as
organised crime. Yachts, helicopters and
works of art belonging to Russian or Belarusian individuals and companies are
among possessions seized so far. Britain's Defence Secretary Ben

Wallace adds his voice to those calling on Russia to let Ukraine export its

grain. He says it would help countries where grain scarcity could trigger

hunger. Russia must ""do the right thing"", Wallace tells reporters in Madrid, where he's been meeting Spanish defence minister Margarita Robles. But he rejected Russia's demand to lift sanctions in order for it to free up exports. He suggests instead that Black Sea nations, like Turkey, could escort Ukrainian grain

shipments. It would be ""premature"" to consider a prisoner swap with Kyiv before Ukrainian soldiers who have surrendered stand trial, Russia's deputy foreign minister says. In comments reported by Russian news agency Interfax, Andrei Rudenko, said Moscow would consider a prisoner swap with Kyiv after the surrendered Ukrainian fighters were ""appropriately convicted, sentenced"". ""Before that, all talk of an exchange is premature,"" he said. It comes after Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said late on Monday that Kyiv was ready for an exchange of prisoners and urged international allies to pressure Moscow. The fate remains unclear of hundreds of Ukrainian fighters from the besieged steelworks in the southern city of Mariupol who were taken to Russian-controlled areas last week.  This video can not be played Ros Atkins on... Russia's food war The West has accused the Russian military of holding food supplies hostage for millions around the world. War has blocked Ukraine's main ports on the Black sea, severely impacting food supply chains around the world. The country is a major exporter of wheat, but now millions of tonnes of grain are stuck - impacting the countries that can least afford it. Russia denies it is weaponising food supplies, claiming that Ukraine's attempts to mine the Black sea and sanctions are to blame, as the BBC's Ros Atkins explains. As we reported earlier, there have been Russian missile strikes on the southern city of Zaporizhzhia in what is being seen as the biggest attack on the city so far. At least one person has died and three others wounded. Ukrainian officials say Russia has gathered three of its battalion tactical groups at Vasylivka around 50km (30 miles) south of the city, but it is not yet clear whether they plan to launch an offensive on Zaporizhzhia. The area is important because it is a major transport hub, especially for railways. It is home to lots of heavy industry including a steelworks and several defence companies, including the Motor Sich factory which makes engines for planes and helicopters which the Russians claim to have hit and a radar manufacturer. Earlier in the conflict many people from Mariupol made their way to the town which had, up until now, been thought to have been relatively safe. Zaporizhzhia is also close to the site of a nuclear power station, which is Europe's biggest, on the southern bank of the Dnieper river. Russian troops are occupying the sprawling site, and while Ukrainian staff are operating it, the Russians have sent their own nuclear experts to monitor their work. Normally the plant generates more than half of Ukraine's nuclear power and 20% of the country's total electricity supply. You can read more about it here. This photo taken at the end of April showed damage close to the sea port in Mariupol The port of Mariupol has been completely cleared of mines and has begun to function again, according to Russia's defence ministry. Igor Konashenkov, a representative of the ministry, said that the demining and demilitarisation of the port had been completed, Russian media reported. Tass news agency quoted the Russian defence ministry as saying more than 12,000 explosive items and weapons  been found and defused. Yesterday, Mikhail Mizintsev, head of the Russian National Defense Control Center, said a ""humanitarian corridor"" from Mariupol towards the Black Sea 115 miles (185km) long and 2 miles (3.2km) wide was being arranged. But there has been no word from Ukraine, and it is not clear whether a risk of mines remains in the corridor. The Kremlin's deputy foreign minister said earlier that Russia was ready to provide a safe route out of Ukraine if sanctions were lifted and if Kyiv de-mined nearby waters. Sweden is not funding or arming terrorist organisations, Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson has said, in response to Turkish claims that it is a ""hatchery"" for terrorist organisations. Turkey is opposing Sweden and Finland's bids to join Nato, accusing them of harbouring members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group it views as a terrorist organisation, and followers of Fethullah Gulen, who Ankara accuses of orchestratinga 2016 coup attempt. ""We are not sending money to terrorist organisations, of course, nor any weapons,"" Andersson told a Stockholm press conference. Representatives of Sweden and Finland are meeting Turkish officials today for talks about their applications to join Nato. They need the support of all 30 Nato members, but Turkey has so far objected to their bids. Hugo BachegaBBC News, Dnipro Ukrainians, from those in power to the man in the street,
are adamant that the country will not cede any territory in order to make
Russia end its invasion, and all the suffering and destruction that come with
it. From President
Zelensky to opinion polls, the message has been clear. Many are furious that
such idea is even being suggested. They are quick to remember that the war
started not in February but in 2014, with Russiaâs invasion and annexation of
Crimea and support for pro-Russian separatists in the east. If you make a deal
with them today, the general view goes, they will come for more later. Kseniia, 37, came to
Dnipro to bury her brother, a member of Ukraineâs special forces in the east
who was killed earlier this month in a Russian missile attack. âI personally donât
think they should accept any ceasefire conditions from Russia because so many
people have been killed,â she said. âWe should fight for our right to exist,
for our sovereignty. Thatâs why my brother was fighting. We should fight to push
the Russians out.â Alex, 21, said: âI
adore my country. I donât want Russia to take any part of it,â he said. âThatâs
the opinion of everyone who loves Ukraine.â With the fighting now
focused on the east, he was concerned about the fate of his grandmother, who
lives in Severodonetsk. The city, the largest under Ukrainian control in the
province of Luhansk, has come under intense artillery and missile fire from
Russian forces, and there are growing concerns over the conditions for
thousands of civilians who are still there. âI hope weâll be able
to hold this area,â he told me. As he said this, the air raid sirens went off,
a reminder that danger for people here is never really far away.  President Vladimir Putin has issued an order to simplify the procedure of handing Russian citizenship to residents of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions in Ukraine's south. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia. Zaporizhzhia is still under Ukrainian control, but many surrounding areas are under Russian occupation. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk in the Donbas region have come under intense bombardment as Russia tries to encircle them A defence ministry spokesman says the army still controlled the main road into the two cities, despite fighting in the area Russia says it will allow ships carrying food out of blockaded ports if sanctions are lifted Ukraine is a major grain producer and the EU accuses Russia of weaponising food The UK has warned prices will only increase if the stand-off isn't resolved President Putin signs a decree making it easier for Ukrainians in occupied areas to become Russian citizens Edited by Chris Giles and George Wright We are pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for now. We'll be back in the morning, Ukraine time. A young boy sits in front of a damaged building after a strike in Kramatorsk in the Donbas region But before we go, here's a recap of the day's main developments: Olga IvshinaBBC Russian senior correspondent The Russian parliament has passed a law raising the age limit for people signing up to the army to 50. It follows ongoing attempts by Russian officials to recruit more soldiers as Russian
casualties in Ukraine mount. Under current
legislation, only Russians aged 18 to 40 and foreigners aged 18 to 30 can enlist as
professional soldiers in the Russian military. âHighly
professional specialists are needed to use high-precision weapons and operate
weapons and military equipmentâ and such specialists may be aged 40 to 45, said
a note accompanying the draft bill. According to the
new law Russian citizens and foreigners up to the age of 50 will be able
to sign a contract with the military. The note said the
amendment would also help attract those in civilian professions to join the
army, including medics, engineers and communications experts. Since the start of
the war in Ukraine, the Russian Ministry of Defence and the so-called Wagner private
military company have launched a vast and persistent campaign to recruit new
soldiers both officially and unofficially. Based on open
sources, BBC Russian has identified at least 46 Russians aged over 45 who have been killed in Ukraine after the start of the invasion. This includes a 63-year-old retired general, who was shot down operating a Su-25 fighter
jet. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia Russia's plan to make it easier for Ukrainians living in Russian-controlled regions of Ukraine to receive Russian citizenship violates international law, Kyiv says. The government accused the Kremlin of ""criminal"" behaviour. President Vladimir Putin has issued an order to simplify the procedure of handing Russian citizenship to residents of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions in Ukraine's south. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia. ""The illegal issuing of passports... is a flagrant violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as norms and principles of international humanitarian law,"" the Ukrainian foreign ministry said in a statement.  Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv âQuantity has a quality of its own.â Itâs said these words were
used by Joseph Stalin to describe the Soviet approach to war. Throw enough
bodies at a conflict and eventually you will overwhelm the enemy. It worked for
the Red Army against the Nazis and the Finnish. In both wars they lost more
men, but eventually came out on top They are words that also
apply today. Vladimir Putinâs army is
finally finding some success, as his forces make breakthroughs in the eastern
Donbas region. Over the last few days they have captured a number of towns and
villages, forcing the Ukrainians to retreat to more defensible positions. They are doing it with sheer
weight of numbers. Not just men, but artillery, armour and air power. This morning the Governor of
Luhansk region described the numbers they were coming up against as âinsaneâ.
President Zelensky told ABC News his men were outnumbered 7-to-1 in the region. The current Russian targets
are the twin cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. There are thought to be
thousands of Ukrainian forces there, dug in and prepared for a long battle.
But, they are facing the prospect of being cut offâ¦ then destroyed by the sheer
weight of the Russian forces. If that happens, some of
Ukraineâs best troops will be taken out of the war. But, not all is lost for the
Ukrainians. They have huge quantities of international military support, both
promised and en route, much of it far more advanced than that currently on
display in the Donbas. The question is, can they
bring that quality to bear, before the Russian quantity overwhelms them? Russia has flattened large areas of Severodonetsk during weeks of bombardment A senior figure in eastern Ukraine has denied reports that a vital road linking Ukrainian-controlled areas in the east has been blocked from the rest of the country by Russian forces. ""Luhansk has not been cut off,"" said the region's military administration head, Serhiy Haidai. Fighting has reached the outskirts of the big city of Severodonetsk, a key Russian target. If they capture the road to Bakhmut then the city could be surrounded.  Haidai said that while the route to the south-west of Severodonetsk had come under fire, humanitarian aid was still getting through. Things were far bleaker in Severodonetsk itself, which was being shelled 24 hours a day and Russian forces were close enough to use mortar rounds as well as artillery and aerial bombing, he told the BBC. Six people were killed in Russian bombardment on Tuesday, he said on his Telegram feed. If Russia captures the neighbouring town of Lysychansk then the whole Luhansk region will be in its hands. Read more here. Russian President Vladimir Putin has met with soldiers wounded in Moscow's military campaign in Ukraine and hailed them as heroes. It's the first meeting of its kind since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The meetings took place at Moscow's Mandryka military hospital. Putin shook hands with the men and asked one soldier about his baby son, telling him: ""He will be proud of his dad."" ""These are people who are risking their health and lives for the sake of the people and children of Donbas, for the sake of Russia. They are all heroes,"" he told officials after meeting the wounded men. Sean CoughlanReporting from Bucharest Romanian President Klaus Iohannis (L) welcomes Britain's Prince Charles during their official meeting at Cotroceni Presidential Palace in Bucharest This
is the closest to the conflict in Ukraine that any senior member of the British Royal Family has come so far. Prince Charles has travelled to Romania to show solidarity for the refugeesand the
aid agencies trying to help them. Itâs a cause close
to his heart and heâs visiting a convention centre outside Bucharest being used
to distribute food, clothes and advice. Heâs in a
country with a war on its doorstep. Almost a million refugees have
come across the border into Romania. Thousands more are
arriving every single day and aid workers have been emphasising the sheer scale
of this mass migration. More than six million people have left Ukraine in three
months. Itâs also a refugee
crisis in a modern European setting. Many are keeping moving, stopping
temporarily in neighbouring Romania before heading further afield. Those that are
staying are not in camps or rows of tents - but in hostels, hotels, peopleâs
houses, spaces in public buildings. Thereâs been a
generous effort to welcome these displaced people, with volunteers meeting
arrivals at the railway station. But if international
interest wanes, and compassion fatigue sets in, it will be when the pressures
are even greater to support rising numbers of people facing a long-term
separation from their homes. George WrightBBC News Casey, seen here in a village near Kharkiv, has been in Ukraine for two months More now on Severodonetsk - a strategically vital city in the eastern Donbas region that is being bombarded by Russian forces. Dallas Anthony Casey is an American combat medic who has been volunteering in Ukraine for more than two months. He has been carrying out various roles including giving medical training to Ukrainian forces. He is currently in Dnipro after returning from Severodonetsk, where he has been helping evacuate people remaining in the besieged city. Shelling of the city is ""constant"", he tells me. ""Never a moment where there wasnât. Weâd be driving down the road to one location and watch a building get hit. We'd stop and run into the building and see if anyone could be saved,"" Casey says. ""Two days ago one of the volunteer ladies was hit when going door to door. She lost the lower half of her leg and lost a lot of blood before we could get to her. We had to do CPR, but we were unsuccessful,"" he adds. Despite the constant shelling and complete devastation of the city, many civilians remain. ""When weâd drive through youâd see people on their bikes or on a stroll while the building right next to them gets blown up. No rush or hurry, theyâd just carry on with what they were doing."" The people remaining roughly fall into two groups, Casey says. ""Some think the Russians will come and take over and their life will be much better,"" he says. ""We convinced some people to come with us and theyâd be shamed on their way out of the shelter."" ""Then the other group of people are in complete shock. You go to their door, ask them if they want to be evacuated and theyâd be too scared to leave their homes,"" he says. ""Theyâd tell you: 'This is all I have, where am I going to go?'"" Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has said Russia is trying to ""blackmail"" the international community by raising the possibility of unblocking Black Sea ports in return for a relaxation of sanctions. Writing onTwitter,externalhe wrote ""Any foreign politician or official who may think of accepting this game should first visit the graves of killed Ukrainian children and talk to their parents."" Earlier the Interfax news agency cited Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Rudenko as saying Moscow is ready to provide a humanitarian corridor for vessels carrying food to leave Ukraine, in return for the lifting of some sanctions. Ukraine's Black Sea ports have been blocked since the beginning of Russia's invasion began on 24 February. More than 20 million tonnes of grain is currently stuck in silos in the country. Russian forces are seeking to take control of Severodonetsk Ukraine is battling to remain in control
of a key highway to the front-line city of Severodonetsk, the country's defence ministry says. Defence ministry spokesman Oleksandr Motuzyanyk told a
briefing that alternative routes existed to supply Ukrainian
units in Severodonetsk, which is surrounded on three sides by
Russian forces. Russia's aim is to fully surround
Ukrainian units in the city, as well as in nearby Lysychansk, he added. Russian forces are seeking to take control of Severodonetsk, Lyschansk, and Rubizhne in order to place the whole of the Luhansk area under Russian occupation.

"This video can not be played Undercover filming by Wales Investigates shows the five men discussing the spot-fixing with journalists A footballer has been secretly filmed helping to recruit players to spot-fix matches. A BBC undercover investigation showed former Llanelli footballer Emile N'Goy, his brother Hermes N'Goy and three European players discussing the illegal activity with undercover journalists. Spot-fixing sees players manipulate moments in games, such as red cards, so criminals can defraud bookmakers. Hermes N'Goy has denied he and the other four planned to spot-fix. Emile N'Goy and the three European players - Idris Laib, Jean-Francois Mbuba and Julien Vercauteren - have been approached individually but have not responded. Emile and Hermes N'Goy are originally from the Democratic Republic of Congo and grew up in France. BBC Wales Investigates secretly filmed four meetings over a 20-month period Emile  N'Goy is currently without a team but has played in lower league clubs across the UK, including Llanelli Town AFC, Stranraer FC, Brechin City FC and Dorchester Town FC as well as clubs in Portugal and Italy. There is no suggestion spot-fixing took place at any of these clubs, nor that any other players at these clubs were involved. The pop star, the football club and the Mafia Grassroots football projects to receive funding FAW begins wide-ranging reforms Following a tip-off that Emile N'Goy may have links with professional match fixers, undercover journalists forBBC Wales Investigatessecretly filmed four meetings over a 20-month period with him and Hermes. Emile is currently without a team but has played in lower league clubs across the UK Emile was first approached by an undercover journalist at a Llanelli match and told he was looking for investment opportunities for illicit, black market funds. Emile said he would talk to his brother about it. At a later meeting, Hermes tells the undercover reporter: ""But you know that is not legal... so you have to be very cautious when you do this kind of thing."" He then suggested recruiting three players - a defender, midfielder and a striker. He later suggested recruiting another two players and two members of staff to help run the operation - including a man who once worked for Italy's newly-crowned champions AC Milan, who he said had fixed before. Asked if that man had ever fixed at AC Milan, Hermes said: ""No, he did the fixing with another club."" He added the man did not yet know about the spot-fixing plans being discussed. Hermes said he would find the players in the lower leagues of Europe where there was less scrutiny. At a later meeting in a Kent hotel, Hermes brought along his brother Emile and three other players from domestic league clubs in France and Belgium. BBC Wales Investigates filmed four meetings over a 20-month period Idris Laib, Jean-Francois Mbuba and Julien Vercauteren all told the journalists they had spot-fixed before. One of the journalists told them: ""We're not trying to push or force anyone. So, if anybody's not happy, we don't want them to be involved."" All decided to stay and discussed taking part in a spot-fixing scheme that Hermes would manage. Hermes told the journalists they should expect to pay the players an annual salary of 20,000-25,000 Euros (Â£17,000-Â£21,400) each. One player asked if he would be paid for the fixes in cash. At a later meeting, he said the undercover journalists would need to pay an additional 500 Euros (Â£430) for every throw-in, corner or free kick they caused. He said red and yellow cards would be more expensive: 1,000 Euros (Â£850) for a yellow and 2,000 Euros (Â£1,700) for a red. Hermes added: ""It's not like, 'you have to lose this match'. It's not like big match-fixing. It's a small thing, very invisible."" All players apart from Emile said they had taken part in spot-fixing before but Hermes reassured the journalists his brother Emile would be involved. Investigator Terry Steans said spot-fixing could be very hard to detect Terry Steans, who worked as an investigator for Fifa with responsibility for rooting out corruption and fixing across the world, was shown the undercover footage. ""The fact they're there, they're listening and they're agreeing to what has been proposed... they shouldn't be there and they shouldn't be even listening to that kind of chat. ""So that's evidence in itself, that they're in the room, that they're willing to take part. ""And he's got players on board, like-minded that will do what he wants them to do, already. So I think he's deadly serious."" He said spot-fixing could be very hard to detect as it was hard to investigate without the full weight of a police force. Hermes was approached on the street by BBC reporter Wyre Davies Hermes was expecting to meet the undercover journalists again to complete the deal. Instead, he was approached by BBC reporter Wyre Davies. He denied any wrongdoing, saying: ""I don't know nothing about that. I don't know what you're talking about"", before walking away. He later contacted the BBC and said his brother Emile and the three other players also strongly denied doing anything illegal. Kevin Carpenter is a lawyer specialising in sports integrity If the plan had gone ahead and they and been caught, the consequences would have been serious. ""You're talking long bans, years... seven years for a first time match-fixing offence, so essentially, the end of their career,"" said Kevin Carpenter, a lawyer specialising in sports integrity. He said corruption had always been around football. ""Top-tier football is a billion-dollar industry with players earning millions, but the other end of the scale, at the lower league clubs, players are paid just a few hundred pounds a game. ""Obviously, you only hear about things at the top level of the sport. But actually, when you get further down the levels, that's where the real corruption seems to happen."" People are able to place bets on almost anything in football matches, such as the number of yellow cards, if a player will be sent off, the number of corners in the first half or how many throw-ins there will be in the first five minutes of the game. Spot-fixing sees criminal gangs pay players or officials to do exactly what they want - known as fixing. They then place bets, already knowing what is about to happen.

"Energy bills have been rising for households across Europe as prices have been driven up by worries about gas and oil supplies after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Individual countries, and the European Union (EU), have announced support schemes for consumers. Here's what they're doing: In 2021, the EU imported 40% of its gas from Russia - so many of its member states are exposed to high energy prices. In response, the EU is introducing: A cap on gas prices if they exceed â¬180 per megawatt hour for three days running, from February 2022. A ""solidarity levy"" - a windfall tax - on excess profits made by oil, gas, coal and refinery companies in 2022. A cap on the revenues of electricity companies which produce energy from wind, solar and nuclear. These revenues have risen as the price of electricity from these sources is linked to soaring gas prices - the cap is expected to raise â¬140 billion (Â£121bn). A mandatory reduction of electricity consumption in peak hours by 5% across the EU, until March 2023. A voluntary reduction of 10% of overall electricity consumption - individual countries will decide how to to this. In October, the German parliament approved a ""defensive shield"" package worth â¬200bn (Â£175bn). It includesa cap on gas and electricity prices for households and some businessesfrom early next year. The government will pay December's monthly gas bill for all households and small-to-medium businesses. In September and October, all taxpayers received a one-off energy payment â¬300. There has been extra help for people on benefits. Public transport tickets are being subsidised. Germany is trying tocut energy consumption,externalby: Heating public buildings to a maximum of 19C, with exceptions for places like hospitals Turning off hot water for washing hands in public buildings Lighting limits for buildings, monuments and advertising A windfall tax on energy companies will be applied from December 2022 to the end of June 2023. In January, the government forced the state-owned energy provider, ÃlectricitÃ© de France (EDF), to cap price rises at 4% for a year. It says it will cap rises in gas and electricity at 15% for 2023, as part of a â¬45bn (Â£39bn) scheme to support households and businesses. France had already announced a one-off â¬100 (Â£84) payment last year to 5.8 million households receiving energy vouchers. The government plans to reduce energy consumption by 10% by: Capping indoor temperatures at 19C for public buildings Cutting the temperature of public sports facilities by 2C and in public swimming pools by 1C Paying civil servants an extra â¬2.88 per day to work from home, if this allows government buildings to close Speed limits on ski lifts and producing less artificial snow The government is planning a windfall tax on energy companies in the 2023 budget. France is cutting the temperature in public swimming polls by 1C Italy is expecting to spend about â¬49.5bn (Â£42bn). Its measures include a â¬200 (Â£169) one-off payment to people earning â¬35,000 (Â£29,600) a year or less, and a 20% tax credit for all energy-intensive companies experiencing a 30% rise in prices. The Italian government is also trying to reduce gas consumption by: Asking people to turn central heating down by 1C and turn it off for an extra hour every day Limiting heating in public buildings, with exceptions for hospitals, nurseries and some industries The government is planning a windfall tax on energy companies in 2023. Since November, electricity and gas prices for households have been capped at January 2022 levels - up to a certain amount of consumption. Any extra use will be charged at market rates. The government is also offering a discount of â¬190 on energy bills in November and December to all households. There is a one-off energy allowance of â¬1,300 to those on lower incomes. VAT on energy bills and tax on petrol and diesel have also been cut. The Dutch government is also introducing: a higher minimum wage lower income tax higher benefits and allowances (such as child benefit, student grants and tax credits) It is expecting to spend â¬15.5bn (Â£13.5bn) on these measures. The Dutch government isadvising households and business,externalto cut consumption, including by turning down heating by 1C. The government is planning a windfall tax on energy companies. Spain has cut VAT on energy bills and reduced tax on electricity. Spain and Portugal have introduced a price cap for gas - which will last for one year and aims to halve gas bills for 40% of customers in the two countries. There is also a one-off payment of â¬200 euros for people in Spain who earn less than â¬14,000 a year and are not already receiving benefits. Spain's measures are expected to cost about â¬27bn (Â£23bn). The government has an energy-saving plan which includes limiting air conditioning in public buildings and shops in the summer and keeping heating to 19C in the winter. It wants shops to close their doors when the heating is on and says they should switch off lights after 22:00. The government is introducing a windfall tax on energy companies and banks over the next two years. It has announced plans for an energy price support package for households, worth 26.8bn zlotys (Â£4.8bn). It incudes freezing energy prices for 2023 at this year's level, with a limit of 2,000 kWh per year for most households. There will be higher thresholds for households with people with disabilities and for families with three or more children. The government has abolished VAT on food, gas and fertilizer and reduced it on petrol, diesel and energy bills. There is also a new mandatory 10% electricity saving for national and local government public administrations. Households that reduce electricity use by 10% in 2023 compared with 2022, will be rewarded with an additional discount. Norway has set a maximum price that households should pay for their energy - anything over this, the government will pay 80% of the bill. A new package of loans and subsidies for businesses was announced in September. This will cover companies that spend more than 3% of revenue on power costs. The government has also proposed new taxes on onshore wind and hydropower energy, to redistribute some of the huge increase in profits over the past year. The UK government has brought in a cap on the price of a unit of energy until April 2023, which will mean the typical household bill for gas and electricity will be Â£2,500 a year. This is being extended to April 2024, but typical bills will be capped at Â£3,000 a year. There will be more support for those on benefits and for pensions households. How does the energy price cap work? What is the windfall tax on oil and gas companies? Energy advice: Sunak to expand tips campaign to lower bills The government brought in a windfall tax on UK oil and gas firms' profits which is expected to raise Â£5bn a year. This is being increased and extended. Previously, the government introduced anenergy bill discount of Â£400for every household with some extra support for people on benefits. The UK government launched a public information campaign on how to save energy in November, which was later than other countries in Europe.

"Family-run Cash Inn pawnbrokers says it has seen an increase in business As the cost of living crisis continues, people are looking at new ways to save money. A social supermarket and pawn shops in Norfolk and Suffolk say they are seeing more people walk through their doors. Those using and running the sites have spoken to the BBC about the reality of living through the crisis. A free and cut-price supermarket run by the Salvation Army has opened in Great Yarmouth for people struggling on low incomes The Sally Store in Peggotty Road Community Centre in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, is staffed by Salvation Army volunteers and aims to give people more choice than a foodbank. It sells food at low prices, as well as giving some away for free. The store opened last month and people living in certain postcode areas are able to sign up to shop there. Some 240 people have already registered and organisers say they can feed a family for a weekend for just Â£10. Capt Marie Burr of the Salvation Army says Sally's Store is an alternative from the support offered by food banks, allowing people ""greater dignity and choice"". ""An elderly lady also came in recently,"" she says. ""She had some free fruit and veg and when she chose what else she wanted, she spent Â£7.80. ""She said that meant she could put Â£20 on her fuel card. ""The results really are very encouraging."" Kelly Lee says she is struggling with her finances due to the increase in energy prices and inflation Kelly Lee has three teenage children and is trying to pay off existing debts, as well as find money for shopping and household bills. She says Sally's Store is a lifeline. ""What do I do - electric or food?,"" she says. ""I've had to sell items to get through to pay for the electric never mind food. ""So when you've got somewhere like this to come to, the amount of money you can save, it gives you that bit of hope."" On her visit she spent Â£5.70 and managed to also get four lettuces and tomatoes for free. Ms Lee says she feels the store is ""less of a hand out"" than a food bank. ""You've got that independence to choose what you want,"" she says. ""It's not a pot luck. It's amazing."" Ms Lee says the store offers reassurance that she will ""always"" be able to feed her family. ""I know now that if I've only got a couple of quid in my purse, I can come down here and get a shop that will tide me over until I get paid,"" she says. ""Some of that stress has gone, now I know you've got a fighting chance. ""If you're skint, you can just get the free stuff."" 'I would rather feed my dog than myself' 'People heating one room with firewood' Millionaires at Davos say 'tax us more' Ms Lee says the free and discounted store allows her to buy extra food, put the electric on and buy ""the odd treat"" for her children. She says the cost of living crisis has hit her family hard. ""I've never had to calculate what I've got to spend here and there, and then scrimp. ""I've always been good with my money."" 'Professionals visiting pawnbrokers' Pawnshop owner Connor Smith and manager Tracey have seen more people coming to pawn items for cash to pay for energy and food A few miles along from Great Yarmouth is the coastal town of Lowestoft in Suffolk. The cost of living crisis is seeing pawnbrokers in these towns become busier as food, energy and petrol and diesel costs increase. Connor Smith is the owner of the Cash Inn which has branches in Yarmouth, Lowestoft and Beccles. He says the economic situation is pushing people to try and raise cash from their possessions. ""Sometimes it's quite difficult to hear their stories,"" he says. Mr Smith says footfall is up across all social groups. ""We're finding more professional people come by, such as business owners looking for short-term money to pay suppliers, and certainly a higher volume of those who are just trying to get by,"" he says. ""The only way I can see things easing for people is for prices to go down in terms of food prices and electricity, just the bare necessities of living. ""Unless these things go down, I don't see it easing for people."" Manager of the Lowestoft branch, Tracey, agrees the demographic of people coming in is expanding. She says it is common for people to leave the shop crying since they do not really want to part with their heirlooms and sentimental items. Tracey says often people just need to talk to someone, and she is willing to listen and help direct them to other sources of help, such as food banks. ""It is hard and I think we're going see more and more hardship,"" she says. Find BBC News: East of England onFacebook,external,Instagram,externalandTwitter,external.

"The cost of a family fry-up with toast, eggs, sausages, bacon and beans has risen 40p since last year, research suggests. Picking up all the supplies for the fried breakfast now sets you back Â£6.83, says research company Kantar. It found UK grocery prices were rising at their fastest rate since 2009. Grocery prices were up 7% in the past four weeks compared with a year ago, leaving people increasingly worried about the cost of the weekly shop. Food, fuel and energy costs have jumped recently in part due to the Ukraine war and it is squeezing household finances. Food prices are now the second most important concern to families after spiralling energy bills, Kantar said. Energy bills push price rises to 40-year high Bank chief in 'apocalyptic' warning on food prices Why are prices rising so quickly? Are you changing shopping habits? Get in touch,external According to Kantar, 22% of households now describe themselves as ""struggling"" to make ends meet, with the rising price of the weekly shop a concern for over nine in 10 of these people. Prices are going up fastest for products such as dog food, savoury snacks and fresh beef, it said, although they are falling for alcoholic spirits. ""People are really feeling the squeeze at the supermarket tills and they're having to stretch their budgets further to accommodate rising prices,"" said Fraser McKevitt, Kantar's head of retail and consumer insight. He said the ""significant"" rise in cost for a family fry-up puts the numbers into context. Mog Grant is changing the way she cooks due to rising prices Single mum Mog Grant says she's cooking in bulk to try and save on costs. She's also changing recipes to make her meals go further. ""We're trying to do more batch cooking and putting things into the freezer,"" she says. ""And I'll add in extra items such as sweet potato, to bulk it up."" Ms Grant, who is a teacher in Westray, has an eight year old daughter and twins who are seven. She says they don't eat fry-ups and have cut down on meat to save money. ""We have porridge every morning,"" she says. ""I'm having to be thrifty."" Other choices she's making include buying store-bought birthday cakes for her children, which, she says, works out cheaper than baking them herself. ""This year was my first time ever not baking birthday cakes for my twins,"" she says. ""It would've cost more to bake them, with things like butter going up, plus you have to factor in rising energy prices as well."" The latest inflation figures showed thatUK prices are rising at their fastest rate for 40 years. Inflation is the increase in the price of something over time. For example, if a loaf of bread costs Â£1 one year and Â£1.09 the next year, then that is an annual inflation rate of 9%. The Bank of England has warned inflation might reach 10% within months. The headline inflation rate is an average, and prices rise for different goods at different rates. One food industry boss has warned thatfood prices could rise by up to 15% this year. It comes as separate research from YouGov found that two in five Britons have been forced to reduce or stop spending on clothes, eating out, non-essential food items and takeaways over the last six months. Meanwhile, one in five has cut or stopped spending on day trips, holidays and fuel. Despite these pressures, the UK was still set to splash out on food and drink over the Platinum Jubilee bank holiday weekend, Mr McKevitt said. He said that the four-day bank holiday weekend was likely to boost supermarket sales as people celebrated with friends and families and bought alcohol, soft drinks, barbeque foods and desserts. According to Kantar, UK grocery sales fell by 4.4% in the 12 weeks to 15 May compared with the same period last year, when stay-at-home rules boosted sales. Discounter Lidl was the fastest growing grocery chain, with its sales increasing by 6% in the period. That was just ahead of rival Aldi whose sales were up 5.8%. Tesco remained the UK's biggest supermarket, expanding its market share share for the 17th month in a row to 27.4%.

"Energy firms are warning that an attempt to extend a windfall tax to renewable energy would threaten the government's entire energy strategy. Industry sources told the BBC it could destroy investor confidence ahead of key auctions for licences to develop new wind and solar projects. Shares in firms that could be affected fell sharply on Tuesday, with Centrica down 11% and SSE 9% lower. An announcement on windfall taxes could come as soon as Thursday. However, the Treasury said no decisions had yet been made. Oil and gas prices have soared over the past year, partly because demand has increased as the world emerges from the Covid pandemic and because of supply concerns due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The possibility that a windfall tax could also hit electricity generators, including renewable energy operators,was first reported by the Financial Times,external. Sources close to the Treasury's thinking on how to impose a windfall tax point out that renewable and nuclear energy generators have also enjoyed windfall profits as electricity prices have also surged and they have enjoyed extra profits as they are not dependent on expensive gas to produce power. ""Power producers whose costs haven't risen with the price of gas have enjoyed a windfall as well. It is logical and credible for them to be taxed on their excess profits as well,"" said one source. How would a windfall tax on energy firms work? What's in the UK's new energy strategy? Energy experts also point out that there is no reason future investment in renewables should suffer, as they would be exempt from any windfall tax as projects are now auctioned with a fixed price for the power they ultimately produce and therefore it would be impossible for the companies to make excess profits if prices for electricity rise. Any windfall tax would be levied on older existing renewable income. However, the boss of one of the UK's biggest investors in renewables said his profits from renewable energy generation were in the low hundreds of millions for a whole year, compared to the Â£7bn made by Shell and the Â£5bn made by BP in the first three months of this year alone. ""Going after renewables is total and utter nonsense,"" he said. The government's energy strategy, which was announced last month, aimed to boost UK energy independence and tackle rising prices. Under the plans, up to eight more nuclear reactors could be approved on existing sites, and the strategy also aims to increase wind, hydrogen and solar production. What's in the UK's new energy strategy? What is the windfall tax on oil and gas firms?

"Households in England, Scotland and Wales are set to have hundreds of pounds knocked off energy bills as part of a package worth billions to help people cope with soaring prices. The government is to scrapa plan to give people Â£200 off bills from Octoberwhich would be repaid over five years. Instead, the BBC understands that sum will be increased and possibly doubled, and will not need to be paid back. Additional help for those on the lowest incomes is also expected. The support, to be announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak later, is expected to be largely funded by a windfall tax on oil and gas firms that could raise Â£7bn. It comes a day afterSue Gray's critical report into lockdown parties in Downing Streetand follows intense pressure on the government to do more to help people with the cost of living crisis. Live: Millions await new help for cost-of-living squeeze How high could my energy bills go? 'She won't ask me for money for sanitary products' Earlier this week the UK's energy regulator Ofgem said the typical household energy bill was set to rise by Â£800 in October, bringing the typical household bill to Â£2,800 a year. Bills had already risen on average by Â£700 in April. Ofgem warned it meant 12 million households could be placed into fuel poverty. Most people living in homes in England in council tax bands A-D have already received a Â£150 rebate on their bills. Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said the ""bulk"" of government support needed to go to those on the lowest incomes ""who are suffering the most severe consequences of this cost of living crisis"". She told the BBC the charity was now helping more than 750 people every day with food bank vouchers. ""We have got people in this country who cannot put food on the table, they cannot keep their lights on and the heating on,"" she said. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said offering a universal payment would mean a lot of the money would go to households who ""don't desperately need it"". He also warned putting billions of pounds into the economy at a time when prices were rising quickly ""could stoke additional demand and make inflation much more permanent"". Opposition parties have repeatedly called for a windfall tax on energy companies that have made bumper profits, in large part because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But until now the government had resisted calls to impose the one-off levy, with some senior members of the cabinet arguing it could deter energy firms from investing in the UK. However, it is understood the prime minister has now sided with Mr Sunak, who had been pushing for the tax. Government set to U-turn on windfall tax Which countries are doing the most to tackle bills? But proposals to tax income from other electricity producers, such as some older windfarms and nuclear plants which have also seen windfall gains, have been shelved. And companies that increase investment in the UK could earn a discount on the additional tax. The Treasury said the government understood ""that people are struggling with rising prices"" and that Mr Sunak had been ""clear that as the situation evolves, so will our response"". David Thompson is one of those struggling to pay the bills. The 46-year-old has five children and four grandchildren and gets Universal Credit - which he calls ""Universal Crisis"". David Thompson says food, energy and clothing are all costing more ""It is getting worse and worse, but you have just got to make do with what you have got. It is a struggle. You are worrying before you get paid, then when you get paid you worry how far it is going to go,"" he said, ""It is supposed to last a month, but you are skint after a week or two."" As typical household energy bills are rising, and areset to go up again in October, he said that any extra support given by the government was never going to match the rate of price rises at the moment. ""This is one of the worst times. I remember when the shipyards went down, and the miners' strikes. People are more well-off now than the 80s and the 90s, but things are a lot more expensive,"" he said. Read more about people struggling with bills Energy firms have made huge profits following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Shell reported a record Â£7bn profit in the first three months of this year while BP made Â£5bn, the highest for 10 years. But Offshore Energies UK, which represents the offshore oil and gas industry, said a windfall tax on energy firms would see higher prices and do long-term damage to the oil and gas industry. Deirdre Michie, chief executive of the body, said: ""This is an industry that thinks and plans long-term, so sudden new costs, like this proposed tax, will disrupt planning and investment and, above all, undermine investor confidence."" Higher energy bills are pushing prices to rise at the fastest rate for 40 years, with fuel and food costs also biting into household budgets. Ofgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley said conditions in the global gas market had worsened after Russia's invasion and warned that the price cap could rise beyond Â£2,800 if Moscow decided to disrupt supplies. Europe gets about 40% of its natural gas from Russia, so sudden supply cuts could have a huge economic impact. While the UK would not be directly impacted by supply disruption - as it imports less than 5% of its gas from Russia - it would be affected by prices rising on global markets as demand in Europe increased.

"Marks & Spencer says it is moving away from town centres, as it saw online sales for clothes and homeware jump. The chain said the shift to online shopping during the pandemic had ""increased the imperative"" to reduce its clothing and home trading space. Many town centres had ""lost impetus"" due to ""failed local authority or government policy"", M&S said. It said it was now relocating some shops from older, multi-floor buildings with poor access and parking. ""As a result, a high proportion, but not all, of our relocations are to the edge of town,"" the retail giant said. M&S said it was planning around 15 new full-line stores and 40 new food stores over the next three years. The company said it was investing in a number of stores which had been relocated to the edges of towns, including to former Debenhams sites in Leamington Spa and Thurrock. It is part of a long-term plan to overhaul its large stores. The shake-up will eventually see the closure of some 110 main stores as it focuses on fewer but better locations. A total of 68 of these main-line stores have already shut and the retailer confirmed another 32 will go over the next three years. Boss Steve Rowe told reporters M&S was ""moving with the customer, where the customer is working and shopping"". He said the chain had ""some fabulous city and town centre stores"" but it had to ensure its portfolio was ""balanced"" and there would be more of a bias towards food in the future. M&S warns online sales tax will damage High Street M&S says recovery plan boosting sales and profits Announcing its results for last year, M&S, which is turning its business around after years of decline, said it had seen strong performance in its clothing and home operation. This was driven by a 55.6% surge in online sales. However, in-store sales fell by 11.2%. Meanwhile, its food sales were up by 10.1%. Overall, the company reported pre-tax profits of Â£392m for the year to 2 April - up from a loss of Â£209m the previous year. However, M&S said it expected sales growth to slow due to rising costs and increased pressure on customer budgets. The company said it was facing increased food costs, driven by global supply issues and labour shortages, while factory, transport and freight costs, as well as continued supply issues in China, were putting pressure on its clothing and home business. Julie Palmer, a retail expert at Begbies Traynor, said the typical M&S customer tended to be wealthier and less hard hit by rising costs ""but they could still choose to economise"" . ""How long cash-strapped shoppers will feel comfortable splashing out on M&S's upmarket foods remains to be seen,"" she added. Household budgets are being squeezed by rising food, energy and fuel bills,with inflation, the rate at which prices rise, hitting 9% in April- the highest level for 40 years. Also on Wednesday, online grocer Ocado warned that its joint venture with M&S will see earnings and sales weighed down by growing pressure on customers' spending. Ocado Retail, an online retail business which is owned 50-50 by the two companies, said consumers are ordering ""one or two fewer items per shop"" against the backdrop of a growing cost of living crisis. Chief executive Steve Rowe is handing over the reins today after 40 years at M&S, starting as a Saturday boy in Croydon. The business is certainly in better shape now than when he started the top job in 2016. Reviving the fortunes of this household name is still a work in progress, though. Although M&S has managed to finally arrest the decline in clothing and home sales, fashion sales in its shops are still 25% below where they were four years ago. M&S wants fewer and better big stores as we shop more online and has already been making some big changes. Today it said it was shifting away from town centre shops to more modern edge-of-town sites, taking a swipe at what it calls ""failed local authority and government policy"". This new focus will likely send a shudder through the High Streets set to be affected. The new leadership team at M&S will also have to steer the business through the cost of living crisis with soaring inflation and consumers tightening their belts. The company also announced it would pull out of Russia altogether, resulting in a Â£31m cost. M&S, which was criticised for not leaving the country at the start of the war in Ukraine, stopped shipments to Russia in March but previously said complex franchise deals prevented it from withdrawing completely. The retailer opened its first store in Russia in 2005. Its Russian arm is run by Turkish company FiBA, which operates 48 shops under the M&S banner in the country with 1,200 employees. Chief executive Mr Rowe is handing over leadership of M&S to Stuart Machin and Katie Bickerstaffe after running the company's turnaround for the past six years. The cost-cutting programme saw the closure of a number of M&S's clothing and homeware shops, with others converted into food stores, after disappointing fashion sales. In 2020 the company also announced thousands of jobs cutsafter the business was hit by Covid lockdowns.

"The cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk in the Donbas region have come under intense bombardment as Russia tries to encircle them A defence ministry spokesman says the army still controlled the main road into the two cities, despite fighting in the area Russia says it will allow ships carrying food out of blockaded ports if sanctions are lifted Ukraine is a major grain producer and the EU accuses Russia of weaponising food The UK has warned prices will only increase if the stand-off isn't resolved President Putin signs a decree making it easier for Ukrainians in occupied areas to become Russian citizens Edited by Chris Giles and George Wright We are pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for now. We'll be back in the morning, Ukraine time. A young boy sits in front of a damaged building after a strike in Kramatorsk in the Donbas region But before we go, here's a recap of the day's main developments: Olga IvshinaBBC Russian senior correspondent The Russian parliament has passed a law raising the age limit for people signing up to the army to 50. It follows ongoing attempts by Russian officials to recruit more soldiers as Russian
casualties in Ukraine mount. Under current
legislation, only Russians aged 18 to 40 and foreigners aged 18 to 30 can enlist as
professional soldiers in the Russian military. âHighly
professional specialists are needed to use high-precision weapons and operate
weapons and military equipmentâ and such specialists may be aged 40 to 45, said
a note accompanying the draft bill. According to the
new law Russian citizens and foreigners up to the age of 50 will be able
to sign a contract with the military. The note said the
amendment would also help attract those in civilian professions to join the
army, including medics, engineers and communications experts. Since the start of
the war in Ukraine, the Russian Ministry of Defence and the so-called Wagner private
military company have launched a vast and persistent campaign to recruit new
soldiers both officially and unofficially. Based on open
sources, BBC Russian has identified at least 46 Russians aged over 45 who have been killed in Ukraine after the start of the invasion. This includes a 63-year-old retired general, who was shot down operating a Su-25 fighter
jet. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia Russia's plan to make it easier for Ukrainians living in Russian-controlled regions of Ukraine to receive Russian citizenship violates international law, Kyiv says. The government accused the Kremlin of ""criminal"" behaviour. President Vladimir Putin has issued an order to simplify the procedure of handing Russian citizenship to residents of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions in Ukraine's south. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia. ""The illegal issuing of passports... is a flagrant violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as norms and principles of international humanitarian law,"" the Ukrainian foreign ministry said in a statement.  Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv âQuantity has a quality of its own.â Itâs said these words were
used by Joseph Stalin to describe the Soviet approach to war. Throw enough
bodies at a conflict and eventually you will overwhelm the enemy. It worked for
the Red Army against the Nazis and the Finnish. In both wars they lost more
men, but eventually came out on top They are words that also
apply today. Vladimir Putinâs army is
finally finding some success, as his forces make breakthroughs in the eastern
Donbas region. Over the last few days they have captured a number of towns and
villages, forcing the Ukrainians to retreat to more defensible positions. They are doing it with sheer
weight of numbers. Not just men, but artillery, armour and air power. This morning the Governor of
Luhansk region described the numbers they were coming up against as âinsaneâ.
President Zelensky told ABC News his men were outnumbered 7-to-1 in the region. The current Russian targets
are the twin cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. There are thought to be
thousands of Ukrainian forces there, dug in and prepared for a long battle.
But, they are facing the prospect of being cut offâ¦ then destroyed by the sheer
weight of the Russian forces. If that happens, some of
Ukraineâs best troops will be taken out of the war. But, not all is lost for the
Ukrainians. They have huge quantities of international military support, both
promised and en route, much of it far more advanced than that currently on
display in the Donbas. The question is, can they
bring that quality to bear, before the Russian quantity overwhelms them? Russia has flattened large areas of Severodonetsk during weeks of bombardment A senior figure in eastern Ukraine has denied reports that a vital road linking Ukrainian-controlled areas in the east has been blocked from the rest of the country by Russian forces. ""Luhansk has not been cut off,"" said the region's military administration head, Serhiy Haidai. Fighting has reached the outskirts of the big city of Severodonetsk, a key Russian target. If they capture the road to Bakhmut then the city could be surrounded.  Haidai said that while the route to the south-west of Severodonetsk had come under fire, humanitarian aid was still getting through. Things were far bleaker in Severodonetsk itself, which was being shelled 24 hours a day and Russian forces were close enough to use mortar rounds as well as artillery and aerial bombing, he told the BBC. Six people were killed in Russian bombardment on Tuesday, he said on his Telegram feed. If Russia captures the neighbouring town of Lysychansk then the whole Luhansk region will be in its hands. Read more here. Russian President Vladimir Putin has met with soldiers wounded in Moscow's military campaign in Ukraine and hailed them as heroes. It's the first meeting of its kind since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The meetings took place at Moscow's Mandryka military hospital. Putin shook hands with the men and asked one soldier about his baby son, telling him: ""He will be proud of his dad."" ""These are people who are risking their health and lives for the sake of the people and children of Donbas, for the sake of Russia. They are all heroes,"" he told officials after meeting the wounded men. Sean CoughlanReporting from Bucharest Romanian President Klaus Iohannis (L) welcomes Britain's Prince Charles during their official meeting at Cotroceni Presidential Palace in Bucharest This
is the closest to the conflict in Ukraine that any senior member of the British Royal Family has come so far. Prince Charles has travelled to Romania to show solidarity for the refugeesand the
aid agencies trying to help them. Itâs a cause close
to his heart and heâs visiting a convention centre outside Bucharest being used
to distribute food, clothes and advice. Heâs in a
country with a war on its doorstep. Almost a million refugees have
come across the border into Romania. Thousands more are
arriving every single day and aid workers have been emphasising the sheer scale
of this mass migration. More than six million people have left Ukraine in three
months. Itâs also a refugee
crisis in a modern European setting. Many are keeping moving, stopping
temporarily in neighbouring Romania before heading further afield. Those that are
staying are not in camps or rows of tents - but in hostels, hotels, peopleâs
houses, spaces in public buildings. Thereâs been a
generous effort to welcome these displaced people, with volunteers meeting
arrivals at the railway station. But if international
interest wanes, and compassion fatigue sets in, it will be when the pressures
are even greater to support rising numbers of people facing a long-term
separation from their homes. George WrightBBC News Casey, seen here in a village near Kharkiv, has been in Ukraine for two months More now on Severodonetsk - a strategically vital city in the eastern Donbas region that is being bombarded by Russian forces. Dallas Anthony Casey is an American combat medic who has been volunteering in Ukraine for more than two months. He has been carrying out various roles including giving medical training to Ukrainian forces. He is currently in Dnipro after returning from Severodonetsk, where he has been helping evacuate people remaining in the besieged city. Shelling of the city is ""constant"", he tells me. ""Never a moment where there wasnât. Weâd be driving down the road to one location and watch a building get hit. We'd stop and run into the building and see if anyone could be saved,"" Casey says. ""Two days ago one of the volunteer ladies was hit when going door to door. She lost the lower half of her leg and lost a lot of blood before we could get to her. We had to do CPR, but we were unsuccessful,"" he adds. Despite the constant shelling and complete devastation of the city, many civilians remain. ""When weâd drive through youâd see people on their bikes or on a stroll while the building right next to them gets blown up. No rush or hurry, theyâd just carry on with what they were doing."" The people remaining roughly fall into two groups, Casey says. ""Some think the Russians will come and take over and their life will be much better,"" he says. ""We convinced some people to come with us and theyâd be shamed on their way out of the shelter."" ""Then the other group of people are in complete shock. You go to their door, ask them if they want to be evacuated and theyâd be too scared to leave their homes,"" he says. ""Theyâd tell you: 'This is all I have, where am I going to go?'"" Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has said Russia is trying to ""blackmail"" the international community by raising the possibility of unblocking Black Sea ports in return for a relaxation of sanctions. Writing onTwitter,externalhe wrote ""Any foreign politician or official who may think of accepting this game should first visit the graves of killed Ukrainian children and talk to their parents."" Earlier the Interfax news agency cited Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Rudenko as saying Moscow is ready to provide a humanitarian corridor for vessels carrying food to leave Ukraine, in return for the lifting of some sanctions. Ukraine's Black Sea ports have been blocked since the beginning of Russia's invasion began on 24 February. More than 20 million tonnes of grain is currently stuck in silos in the country. Russian forces are seeking to take control of Severodonetsk Ukraine is battling to remain in control
of a key highway to the front-line city of Severodonetsk, the country's defence ministry says. Defence ministry spokesman Oleksandr Motuzyanyk told a
briefing that alternative routes existed to supply Ukrainian
units in Severodonetsk, which is surrounded on three sides by
Russian forces. Russia's aim is to fully surround
Ukrainian units in the city, as well as in nearby Lysychansk, he added. Russian forces are seeking to take control of Severodonetsk, Lyschansk, and Rubizhne in order to place the whole of the Luhansk area under Russian occupation. Luhansk makes up half of the eastern Donbas region, where Moscow has re-focused its war effort. Many believe President Putin could claim victory in the war if Russia takes control of Donbas. Jessica ParkerReporting from Brussels The EU is struggling to reach an agreement on its sixth
sanctions package against Russia, with Hungary vocal in its opposition to an
oil embargo. But while talks go on, thereâs also work to tighten up the
existing rules. The European Commission wants to make violating sanctions an
EU-wide crime. So if someone, for example, tried to flout an export ban to
Russia or hide sanctioned assets, it would, in theory, become easier to
prosecute them. The proposed measures wouldnât just cover oligarchs but
complicit lawyers and bankers too. The plans also look at broadening the blocâs
ability to seize, and even sell, assets that are linked to oligarchs as well as
organised crime. Yachts, helicopters and
works of art belonging to Russian or Belarusian individuals and companies are
among possessions seized so far. Britain's Defence Secretary Ben

Wallace adds his voice to those calling on Russia to let Ukraine export its

grain. He says it would help countries where grain scarcity could trigger

hunger. Russia must ""do the right thing"", Wallace tells reporters in Madrid, where he's been meeting Spanish defence minister Margarita Robles. But he rejected Russia's demand to lift sanctions in order for it to free up exports. He suggests instead that Black Sea nations, like Turkey, could escort Ukrainian grain

shipments. It would be ""premature"" to consider a prisoner swap with Kyiv before Ukrainian soldiers who have surrendered stand trial, Russia's deputy foreign minister says. In comments reported by Russian news agency Interfax, Andrei Rudenko, said Moscow would consider a prisoner swap with Kyiv after the surrendered Ukrainian fighters were ""appropriately convicted, sentenced"". ""Before that, all talk of an exchange is premature,"" he said. It comes after Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said late on Monday that Kyiv was ready for an exchange of prisoners and urged international allies to pressure Moscow. The fate remains unclear of hundreds of Ukrainian fighters from the besieged steelworks in the southern city of Mariupol who were taken to Russian-controlled areas last week.  This video can not be played Ros Atkins on... Russia's food war The West has accused the Russian military of holding food supplies hostage for millions around the world. War has blocked Ukraine's main ports on the Black sea, severely impacting food supply chains around the world. The country is a major exporter of wheat, but now millions of tonnes of grain are stuck - impacting the countries that can least afford it. Russia denies it is weaponising food supplies, claiming that Ukraine's attempts to mine the Black sea and sanctions are to blame, as the BBC's Ros Atkins explains. As we reported earlier, there have been Russian missile strikes on the southern city of Zaporizhzhia in what is being seen as the biggest attack on the city so far. At least one person has died and three others wounded. Ukrainian officials say Russia has gathered three of its battalion tactical groups at Vasylivka around 50km (30 miles) south of the city, but it is not yet clear whether they plan to launch an offensive on Zaporizhzhia. The area is important because it is a major transport hub, especially for railways. It is home to lots of heavy industry including a steelworks and several defence companies, including the Motor Sich factory which makes engines for planes and helicopters which the Russians claim to have hit and a radar manufacturer. Earlier in the conflict many people from Mariupol made their way to the town which had, up until now, been thought to have been relatively safe. Zaporizhzhia is also close to the site of a nuclear power station, which is Europe's biggest, on the southern bank of the Dnieper river. Russian troops are occupying the sprawling site, and while Ukrainian staff are operating it, the Russians have sent their own nuclear experts to monitor their work. Normally the plant generates more than half of Ukraine's nuclear power and 20% of the country's total electricity supply. You can read more about it here. This photo taken at the end of April showed damage close to the sea port in Mariupol The port of Mariupol has been completely cleared of mines and has begun to function again, according to Russia's defence ministry. Igor Konashenkov, a representative of the ministry, said that the demining and demilitarisation of the port had been completed, Russian media reported. Tass news agency quoted the Russian defence ministry as saying more than 12,000 explosive items and weapons  been found and defused. Yesterday, Mikhail Mizintsev, head of the Russian National Defense Control Center, said a ""humanitarian corridor"" from Mariupol towards the Black Sea 115 miles (185km) long and 2 miles (3.2km) wide was being arranged. But there has been no word from Ukraine, and it is not clear whether a risk of mines remains in the corridor. The Kremlin's deputy foreign minister said earlier that Russia was ready to provide a safe route out of Ukraine if sanctions were lifted and if Kyiv de-mined nearby waters. Sweden is not funding or arming terrorist organisations, Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson has said, in response to Turkish claims that it is a ""hatchery"" for terrorist organisations. Turkey is opposing Sweden and Finland's bids to join Nato, accusing them of harbouring members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group it views as a terrorist organisation, and followers of Fethullah Gulen, who Ankara accuses of orchestratinga 2016 coup attempt. ""We are not sending money to terrorist organisations, of course, nor any weapons,"" Andersson told a Stockholm press conference. Representatives of Sweden and Finland are meeting Turkish officials today for talks about their applications to join Nato. They need the support of all 30 Nato members, but Turkey has so far objected to their bids. Hugo BachegaBBC News, Dnipro Ukrainians, from those in power to the man in the street,
are adamant that the country will not cede any territory in order to make
Russia end its invasion, and all the suffering and destruction that come with
it. From President
Zelensky to opinion polls, the message has been clear. Many are furious that
such idea is even being suggested. They are quick to remember that the war
started not in February but in 2014, with Russiaâs invasion and annexation of
Crimea and support for pro-Russian separatists in the east. If you make a deal
with them today, the general view goes, they will come for more later. Kseniia, 37, came to
Dnipro to bury her brother, a member of Ukraineâs special forces in the east
who was killed earlier this month in a Russian missile attack. âI personally donât
think they should accept any ceasefire conditions from Russia because so many
people have been killed,â she said. âWe should fight for our right to exist,
for our sovereignty. Thatâs why my brother was fighting. We should fight to push
the Russians out.â Alex, 21, said: âI
adore my country. I donât want Russia to take any part of it,â he said. âThatâs
the opinion of everyone who loves Ukraine.â With the fighting now
focused on the east, he was concerned about the fate of his grandmother, who
lives in Severodonetsk. The city, the largest under Ukrainian control in the
province of Luhansk, has come under intense artillery and missile fire from
Russian forces, and there are growing concerns over the conditions for
thousands of civilians who are still there. âI hope weâll be able
to hold this area,â he told me. As he said this, the air raid sirens went off,
a reminder that danger for people here is never really far away.  President Vladimir Putin has issued an order to simplify the procedure of handing Russian citizenship to residents of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions in Ukraine's south. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia. Zaporizhzhia is still under Ukrainian control, but many surrounding areas are under Russian occupation. Â© 2025 BBC.

It is the deadliest shooting at a US elementary school since 20 children and six adults died at Sandy Hook school a decade ago. There were two pairs of cousins among the children killed in the attack. Some parents were at the school hours before the shooting, watching with pride as their children held up their honour roll certificates at an awards ceremony. Hours later, they were back there. One of them wasAlexandria Aniyah Rubio, in the fourth grade, who had earned an A certificate. ""We told her we loved her and would pick her up after school,"" her mother Kimberly wrote on Facebook.

"Marks & Spencer says it is moving away from town centres, as it saw online sales for clothes and homeware jump. The chain said the shift to online shopping during the pandemic had ""increased the imperative"" to reduce its clothing and home trading space. Many town centres had ""lost impetus"" due to ""failed local authority or government policy"", M&S said. It said it was now relocating some shops from older, multi-floor buildings with poor access and parking. ""As a result, a high proportion, but not all, of our relocations are to the edge of town,"" the retail giant said. M&S said it was planning around 15 new full-line stores and 40 new food stores over the next three years. The company said it was investing in a number of stores which had been relocated to the edges of towns, including to former Debenhams sites in Leamington Spa and Thurrock. It is part of a long-term plan to overhaul its large stores. The shake-up will eventually see the closure of some 110 main stores as it focuses on fewer but better locations. A total of 68 of these main-line stores have already shut and the retailer confirmed another 32 will go over the next three years. Boss Steve Rowe told reporters M&S was ""moving with the customer, where the customer is working and shopping"". He said the chain had ""some fabulous city and town centre stores"" but it had to ensure its portfolio was ""balanced"" and there would be more of a bias towards food in the future. M&S warns online sales tax will damage High Street M&S says recovery plan boosting sales and profits Announcing its results for last year, M&S, which is turning its business around after years of decline, said it had seen strong performance in its clothing and home operation. This was driven by a 55.6% surge in online sales. However, in-store sales fell by 11.2%. Meanwhile, its food sales were up by 10.1%. Overall, the company reported pre-tax profits of Â£392m for the year to 2 April - up from a loss of Â£209m the previous year. However, M&S said it expected sales growth to slow due to rising costs and increased pressure on customer budgets. The company said it was facing increased food costs, driven by global supply issues and labour shortages, while factory, transport and freight costs, as well as continued supply issues in China, were putting pressure on its clothing and home business. Julie Palmer, a retail expert at Begbies Traynor, said the typical M&S customer tended to be wealthier and less hard hit by rising costs ""but they could still choose to economise"" . ""How long cash-strapped shoppers will feel comfortable splashing out on M&S's upmarket foods remains to be seen,"" she added. Household budgets are being squeezed by rising food, energy and fuel bills,with inflation, the rate at which prices rise, hitting 9% in April- the highest level for 40 years. Also on Wednesday, online grocer Ocado warned that its joint venture with M&S will see earnings and sales weighed down by growing pressure on customers' spending. Ocado Retail, an online retail business which is owned 50-50 by the two companies, said consumers are ordering ""one or two fewer items per shop"" against the backdrop of a growing cost of living crisis. Chief executive Steve Rowe is handing over the reins today after 40 years at M&S, starting as a Saturday boy in Croydon. The business is certainly in better shape now than when he started the top job in 2016. Reviving the fortunes of this household name is still a work in progress, though. Although M&S has managed to finally arrest the decline in clothing and home sales, fashion sales in its shops are still 25% below where they were four years ago. M&S wants fewer and better big stores as we shop more online and has already been making some big changes. Today it said it was shifting away from town centre shops to more modern edge-of-town sites, taking a swipe at what it calls ""failed local authority and government policy"". This new focus will likely send a shudder through the High Streets set to be affected. The new leadership team at M&S will also have to steer the business through the cost of living crisis with soaring inflation and consumers tightening their belts. The company also announced it would pull out of Russia altogether, resulting in a Â£31m cost. M&S, which was criticised for not leaving the country at the start of the war in Ukraine, stopped shipments to Russia in March but previously said complex franchise deals prevented it from withdrawing completely. The retailer opened its first store in Russia in 2005. Its Russian arm is run by Turkish company FiBA, which operates 48 shops under the M&S banner in the country with 1,200 employees. Chief executive Mr Rowe is handing over leadership of M&S to Stuart Machin and Katie Bickerstaffe after running the company's turnaround for the past six years. The cost-cutting programme saw the closure of a number of M&S's clothing and homeware shops, with others converted into food stores, after disappointing fashion sales. In 2020 the company also announced thousands of jobs cutsafter the business was hit by Covid lockdowns.

"Chelsea won the Premier League five times and the Champions League twice during Abramovich's ownership The government has approved the Â£4.25bn takeover of Chelsea by a consortium led by LA Dodgers co-owner Todd Boehly. The London club wasput up for salein March before owner Roman Abramovich wassanctioned over his links to Russian president Vladimir Putin. On Tuesday, the Premier Leaguesaid the consortiumhad passed its owners' and directors' test. Chelsea have been operating under a special government licence which expires on 31 May. ""Late last night the UK government reached a position where we could issue a licence that permits the sale of Chelsea,"" a government spokesperson said in a statement on Wednesday. Who are the key people behind consortium buying club? What are the pressing issues for the Chelsea's new owners? The government does not want Abramovich to receive any of the proceeds from the sale, which will instead go into a frozen bank account to be donated to charity. The statement added: ""Following the sanctioning of Roman Abramovich, the government has worked hard to ensure Chelsea has been able to continue to play football. But we have always been clear that the long-term future of the club could only be secured under a new owner. ""Following extensive work, we are now satisfied that the full proceeds of the sale will not benefit Roman Abramovich or any other sanctioned individual. We will now begin the process of ensuring the proceeds of the sale are used for humanitarian causes in Ukraine, supporting victims of the war. ""The steps today will secure the future of this important cultural asset and protect fans and the wider football community. We have been in discussions with relevant international partners for necessary licences required and we thank them for all their cooperation."" Earlier this month the deal hadseemed close to collapseover concerns proceeds would not reach good causes as promised by Abramovich. Abramovichdenied that he had asked for his Â£1.5bn loanto Chelsea be repaid when the club was sold. Several parties expressed an interest but Chelsea agreed to sell to the Boehly-led consortiumearlier in May. The consortium is led by Boehly, but Clearlake Capital - a Californian private equity firm - would own a majority of the shares in Chelsea. Other investors include US billionaire Mark Walter, also a co-owner of the LA Dodgers, and Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss. Chelsea finished the Premier League season in third place, losing both the EFL Cup and FA Cup finals to Liverpool on penalties, and going out of the Champions League in the quarter-finals. Sports minister Nigel Huddleston tweeted: ""This is a big day for Chelsea and one of great relief to fans who I thank for your patience. ""I'm confident of a bright future with the new owners."" Former Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the move would be a ""complete relief"" for everyone connected to the club. ""Today's announcement will be complete relief that [Chelsea] can get on with business as usual and do what is needed to ensure the team is best prepared for next season,"" said Kenyon. ""We've got a very short transfer window and plans will have been made before. ""They have already lost some players through not being able to re-sign them so I think everybody - the squad and the management - will be relieved they can get on with the job they're employed to do."" BBC sports editor Dan Roan With the final hurdle to the takeover of Chelsea finally overcome, and one of the biggest deals in sports history able to be completed, this was the news Chelsea fans had been desperate for after several weeks of unprecedented uncertainty. Time had been running out for the club to be issued with the licences needed to play next season, so government officials will also be relieved that the future of the European champions has been secured in the nick of time after a highly complicated sales process. Approval by European authorities is still required, but that is now regarded as a formality. With the Abramovich era drawing to a close, attention will now turn to the extent to which the new owners invest in the club and back Thomas Tuchel in the transfer market. And with Chelsea, Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester United all now US-owned, it will be fascinating to see what influence these clubs try to bring to the future direction of the Premier League. 24 February:Russia invades Ukraine 26 February:Roman Abramovichgives ""stewardship and care""of club to charitable foundation 2 March:The Chelsea ownersays he plans to sell the club 10 March:The UK governmentsanctions Abramovich 5 May:Abramovichdenies he has requesteda Â£1.5bn loan he made to Chelsea is repaid 7 May:Todd Boehlyagrees a Â£4.25bn dealfor the club 16 May:Government insider says thedeal is close to collapse 24 May:Premier League approves takeover 25 May:Government approves takeover Our coverage of Chelsea is bigger and better than ever before - here'severything you need to knowto make sure you never miss a moment Everything Chelsea - go straight to all the best content BBC Sport Premier League Chelsea official site Potter 'excitement' short lived - but West Ham find 'positives' Moyes in talks with Everton over return to club Glasgow beat Racing to seal Champions Cup knockout spot Dragonsâ Den returns with a new line-up of celebrity guests Can a fresh batch of entrepreneurs secure the deal of a lifetime?

"Prince Charles visited a centre distributing food and clothes to refugees The Prince of Wales has arrived in Romania to show his support for Ukrainian refugees and to see first-hand the assistance being provided. It's the first visit from a senior royal to the region since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The latest figures show almost a million Ukrainians have already crossed the border into Romania. Prince Charles visited a centre near Bucharest, which supports a rising number of refugees. ""It's a nightmare situation,"" the prince said to Ukrainian families who were collecting supplies of food and clothing. He said to ""keep praying"" and told them he was ""full of admiration for the Ukrainian people - their extraordinary courage and resilience"". A million Ukrainians have come to Romania since the outbreak of war Aid workers explained the scale of the pressures. More than six million people have left Ukraine in the three months of the war. In the past week alone, a further 40,000 people are estimated to have crossed into Romania. Prince Charles has been strongly outspoken about the war, attacking the ""brutal aggression"" inflicted on Ukraine. Having travelled to Bucharest, about 150 miles from the Ukraine border - this is also the closest a senior British royal has come to the conflict. The prince also has a long-standing connection with Romania, having set up a charitable foundation in the country and restored a traditional farmhouse. Charles visits Ukrainian community in London Royals don't hide colours over Ukraine war Where have Ukrainian refugees fled? Ukraine risks being 'pulverised', royals told The visit comes as figures from the UNHCR show 966,000 Ukrainians have entered Romania since the start of the war, with only Poland taking in more refugees. ""I've not seen anything so big and so fast. By any measure it's a major movement of people,"" says Mike Weickert, global rapid response director for World Vision, a charity supporting Ukrainian refugees in Romania. Lisa, a refugee from Ukraine, is helping as an interpreter for new arrivals ""It's going to be increasingly difficult for refugees and for the hosting countries,"" said Mr Weickert, whose aid agency is working in the Romexpo centre, visited by Prince Charles and Margareta, head of Romania's royal family. The conference centre site is helping more than 1,000 people a day, with Romanian authorities and international agencies providing food, clothing and advice services. Among those helping with the international effort at the centre is Stephen Noble of the Salvation Army. He spent the pandemic helping with a food bank in Scarborough, and there are some similarities to the services being offered here, with food parcels available and racks of second-hand clothing. Help is available for refugees arriving in Bucharest's train station There are soft toys for children and pet food for the dogs and cats that some families brought with them. Mr Noble has been struck by the dignity of those arriving, who had to leave everything behind - and says that for those in the UK who have made donations it is ""absolutely worthwhile"". He says one of the most practical ways of supporting refugees has been to give them vouchers, worth about Â£10, to use in local supermarkets, which allows them to buy for their individual needs. One of the translators is herself a refugee. Lisa has gone from being a sales manager in Odessa to helping disorientated new arrivals. Stephen Noble is part of the international effort visited by Prince Charles ""At first it's a shock. You don't believe it. Then you realise you have to stay."" So many people have left Ukraine that in some villages there is only one person left, she says. For those refugees continuing to stream across the border into Romania, by car, bus or train, there is still a generous reception. At Bucharest's Gara de Nord train station there are volunteers and support workers waiting to help families escaping the war. Romania has given Ukrainian refugees free travel on its railways, with women and children the great majority of new arrivals. On the station concourse there are tents ready to provide immediate shelter and first aid. The prince met families using the support services This is a refugee crisis in a highly-mobile, urban setting. Many are moving on to other countries, some will try to return to Ukraine, and those that stay in Romania are mostly in the bigger cities, with spaces having to be found in hostels, private houses, public buildings or hotel rooms. As well as emergency needs, such as food and shelter, aid workers say they will need to provide longer-term support for refugees. Children will need schools, adults will need jobs to have an income, older people with health problems will need access to medical support and there will be mental health problems from such a traumatic uprooting. The longer refugees are out of their homes the more they risk ""running out money, running out of options"", says Mr Weickert.

"As the US reels from another school shooting, more details are emerging of the horror that unfolded in Texas near the border with Mexico. Witnesses have described traumatised children covered in blood being hugged by parents. Others had to come to terms with devastating news of the deaths of loved ones. But Tuesday began much like any other weekday in May in Uvalde, about 80 miles (130km) west of San Antonio. Around 08:00 local time, near the centre of the town, some 600 students aged seven to 10 were arriving at Robb Elementary School. The summer holidays were fast approaching and many children were savouring their final days in middle school before graduation. That morning on the other side of town Salvador Ramos fired the opening shots of one of America's deadliest mass shootings. Described as a loner, from a ""fraught home life"", and bullied over a speech impediment - the 18-year-old shot his grandmother in the face before fleeing the scene in a battered truck carrying guns and copious ammunition. According to CBS News, Ramos' grandmother, who survived but is in a critical condition, was only discovered after the shooting at the school, when officers arrived at her home to investigate. After driving erratically across town Ramos eventually crashed his car into a ditch near Robb Elementary School at around 11:30am, police said. Some bystanders approached the car to offer assistance. ""People thought that he was in trouble and so they jumped out to help him and he came out of his vehicle and started shooting at them,"" one person told the Spanish language network Telemundo. A police officer who works at the school was also in the vicinity although there are conflicting accounts over whether Ramos and the officer exchanged fire. Ramos did fire on two arriving Uvalde police department officers, according to the Associated Press quoting Travis Considine, a state official. The two police officers were reported injured from the encounter. Texas victims: 'The sweetest little boy I've ever known' NBA coach's tearful plea after school shooting Gun deaths were the leading killer of US children in 2020 Video shared on social media showed a person clad in black jogging toward a side door of the school carrying what appeared to be a rifle. State official Chris Olivarez told CNN that Ramos then forced his way into a fourth-grade classroom. As police arrived at the scene, Ramos barricaded himself in the classroom and prepared for a showdown with law enforcement officials. It was there that children were ""shot and killed horrifically, incomprehensibly"", according to Texas Governor Greg Abbott. Mr Abbott said 17 people suffered non-life-threatening injuries. The wounded included ""multiple children"" who survived the gunfire in their classroom, local authorities reported. All 21 people killed by the gunman were later found in the room. The gunman was in the school for roughly one hour, police said. Ramos is believed to have purchased two semi-automatic rifles immediately after turning 18 last week. Officials later confirmed that he had legally bought two rifles and 375 rounds of ammunition in the days leading up to the shooting. After the gunman entered the school, police surrounded the building, smashing windows to allow children and staff to escape. Witnesses reported seeing children clambering out of nearby windows and seeking shelter at a funeral home nearby as the shooting began. Others, led by two teachers, escaped from the building and hid behind some trees at the rear of the school. Marcela Cabralez, a local pastor, told the Washington Post that her nine-year-old granddaughter was eating her lunch with other students when she heard noise coming from outside, including shots and breaking glass. Teachers shepherded children behind a curtain, where they all hid, desperately trying to avoid attracting the shooter's attention. Ms Cabralez's granddaughter hid in a bathroom. Another teacher, Eva Mireles, was shot and killed by the gunman while trying to protect her students. Adolfo Hernandez told the New York Times that his nephew had been in a classroom near where the shooting had taken place. ""He actually witnessed his little friend get shot in the face,"" Mr Hernandez said. The friend, he said, ""got shot in the nose and he just went down, and my nephew was devastated"". According to witnesses, onlookers had urged officers to enter the building soon after the attack had begun. Javier Cazares, the father of fourth grader Jacklyn Cazares who was killed, said he was upset that officers had not moved in after he arrived at the school and saw police gathering outside. ""There were more of them. There was just one of him,"" he said. Steve McCraw, the director of the Texas Department of Public Safety said that officers did engage immediately and contain Ramos in the classroom. ""The bottom line is law enforcement was there,"" he said. Speaking to reporters he also said that a tactical team engaged Ramon 40 to 60 minutes after the gunman's initial encounter with the school police officer. On the condition of anonymity, an official familiar with the investigation has said that Border Patrol agents had difficulty breaching the classroom and had to get a member of staff to open the door with a key. The massacre finally came to an end shortly after 13:00, when a Border Patrol officer shot Ramos in the head. State officials said officers had contained the gunman inside adjoining classrooms, and eventually were able to breach the room he was in. Seven 30-round magazines belonging to the teenager were later found at the school. Children were rushed to a local community centre about a mile from the school and Mr Sotelo said he saw several teachers and children emerging sobbing and injured. ""We saw a little girl full of blood and the parents were screaming, it was an ugly scene,"" Derek Sotelo, a resident who runs a local auto-repair shop shop, told the Washington Post. ""They were just little kids."" As police began investigating, a frantic scene was emerging at the school as parents arrived seeking news. Journalists at the scene reported hearing cries and sobs as family members who gathered there received the devastating news that their children had been killed. Angel Garza wrote on Facebook that his 10-year old daughter Amerie had been killed. ""My little love is now flying high with the angels above. Please don't take a second for granted. Hug your family. Tell them you love them,"" he wrote on Facebook. And Lisa Garter mourned the death of her 10-year-old son Xavier Javier Lopez. Allow Twitter content?

""He was just a loving 10-year-old little boy, just enjoying life, not knowing that this tragedy was going to happen today,"" she said. Others, left in limbo by the chaos surrounding the events, were asked to give DNA samples to help identify some of the young victims. Jesse Rodriguez told the San Antonio Express that he was still waiting for information about his daughter after hearing she could have been taken to hospital. ""I was waiting for more info. Nobody called me back,"" he said. ""The hospital's closing me out right now."" Later, as night fell in Uvalde, police stood watch in the pouring rain outside a community centre where families had earlier gathered to seek news of their loved ones. Just blocks away, a small vigil was taking place. Karla Bohman's voice cracked as she told the group about a family friend whose young daughter, a student at the school, was among those still unaccounted for. ""They don't know if she's in surgery or one of the fatalities, but they know she's a victim of some sort because she's missing,"" Bohman cried. ""I can't believe this."" Cheryl Juhasz, a lifelong resident of Uvalde, quietly wept during the prayer. ""You can't comprehend evil like this. No matter where it happens, but it's harder when it happens at home."" Uvalde residents gathered for a vigil on Tuesday evening Texas primary school shooting leaves 21 dead Guns the leading cause of death of US children NBA coach's tearful plea after school shooting.

"The National Rifle Association (NRA) is holding its annual meeting in Indianapolis, with former US President Donald Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis due to address delegates. The meeting is taking place amid increasing calls for tighter US gun laws in the wake ofa record number of mass shootings in 2023. According to theGun Violence Archive,external, there have been 146 mass shootings in the country since January. Founded in 1871 as a recreational group designed to ""promote and encourage rifle shooting"", the National Rifle Association has grown into one of the most powerful political organisations in the US. It lobbies heavily against all forms of gun control and argues aggressively that more guns make the country safer. It relies on, and staunchly defends, a disputed interpretation of the Second Amendment to the US Constitution, which it argues gives US citizens the rights to bear arms. It directly funds US politicians and lawmakers who support its aims. Chief executive Wayne LaPierre has run the NRA since 1991. The group is currently in legal difficulties, having been locked in a court battle with New York's Attorney General since 2020. Letitia Jamesalleges that in the past the organisation diverted millions of dollarsto leaders including Mr LaPierre for their personal use. She is suing Mr LaPierre for millions of dollars he has been paid by the NRA, and wants the organisation to face financial monitoring. The NRA has described her lawsuit as a ""baseless, premeditated attack"". Estimates of the NRA's membership vary widely. The association claimed that membership rose to nearly to five million in response to the mass shooting at Sandy Hook school in 2012. However, some analysts put the figure at closer to three million. There are frequent protests outside the NRA's headquarters in Virginia Current NRA members include former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, and actors Tom Selleck and Whoopi Goldberg. Former vice-president Mike Pence is expected to join Mr Trump and Mr DeSantis in Indianapolis for the 2023 meeting. In 2022, the NRAreceived $97m (Â£78m) from membership dues,external. That is down by more than 40% from its peak year, 2018. The organisation blamed the Covid pandemic for the fall. However, the NRA still has a substantial budget which it uses to try and influence US politicians on gun policy. In 2021, itspent $4.2m on lobbying,external, according to non-partisan US research firm OpenSecrets. OpenSecrets' figures suggest that since 2010, the NRA has directed more than $140m to pro-gun election candidates. The NRA also has considerable influence via its membership, many of whom will vote for a candidate based solely on their stance on guns. It grades members of Congress from A to F on their perceived friendliness to gun rights. Those ratings can cost pro-gun control candidates their seats. For decades, the NRA has aggressively opposed measures which would restrict gun ownership, despite a series of high profile mass shootings, including many in schools. The late actor Charlton Heston - a former NRA president - famously held a rifle over his head following the 1999 Columbine High School mass shooting, telling gun control advocates they would have to take  the weapon ""from my cold, dead hands"". Actor Charlton Heston was a long-serving NRA president On 27 March,six people including three children were killed at a school in Nashville. The NRA responded bycalling for more security in schools,external, rather than restrictions on gun ownership. The Nashville attack was the worst mass shooting at a US school since 19 children and two adults were killedin Uvalde, Texas, in May 2022. The NRA held its 2022 meeting in nearby Houston only days after the Uvalde attack, despite widespread calls to cancel the event. In 2018, it backed a call by then-president Donald Trump toarm teachers and other members of staff,externalto deter gun attacks - although many teachers do not want to be armed.

"Relatives of children at the school gathered at a nearby civic centre to wait for news Nineteen young children and two adults have died in a shooting at a primary school in south Texas. The gunman opened fire at Robb Elementary School - which teaches children aged seven to 10 - in the city of Uvalde before he was killed by law enforcement, officials said. The 18-year-old suspect had a handgun, an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle and high-capacity magazines, investigators say. The teenager is suspected of shooting his grandmother before the rampage. Local media report he may have been a high school student in the area. Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District Chief of Police Pete Arredondo said the shooting began at 11:32 local time on Tuesday, and that investigators believe the attacker ""did act alone during this heinous crime"". LIVE - latest updates, reaction and analysis TIMELINE - how a sunny school day ended in bloodshed â¢VICTIMS - tributes to children and teacher killed Texas Governor Greg Abbott said the shooter, whom he named as Salvador Ramos, abandoned a vehicle before entering the school to ""horrifically, incomprehensibly"" open fire. An Uvalde school district police officer, who worked at the school, saw Ramos emerge from the vehicle carrying a rifle and wearing body armour, according to Erick Estrada from the Texas Department of Public Safety, who was speaking to CNN. The officer ""engaged"" the suspect but was unable to stop him, Mr Estrada said. Two more officers from Uvalde Police Department also attempted to stop Ramos but were unable to do so, and called for back-up. Several of the children who died have been identified. Family members confirmed the deaths of 10-year-olds Xavier Lopez and Amerie Jo Garza in statements on Tuesday night. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Angel Garza said on Facebook that his daughter Amerie had been killed. ""My little love is now flying high with the angels above. Please don't take a second for granted. Hug your family. Tell them you love them,"" he said. The two adults who died were both teachers - Irma Garcia and Eva Mireles. According to the school district's website, Mrs Garcia is a mother-of-four and had been a teacher for 23 years. The same website says that Ms Mireles had been a teacher for 17 years, has a daughter in college and loved running and hiking. Nearly 500 pupils are enrolled in the predominantly Hispanic school around 85 miles (135km) west of the city of San Antonio. This video can not be played Biden: When ""are we going to stand up to the gun lobby?"" The Associated Press news agency reports that a US Border Patrol official who was nearby when the shooting began rushed into the school and shot and killed the gunman, who was behind a barricade. Border Patrol is a federal agency that guards US ports of entry. Uvalde, which is fewer than 80 miles from the border with Mexico, is home to a Border Patrol station. Two border agents were reportedly shot in an exchange with the gunman. One agent was shot in the head, officials say, adding that both were now in a stable condition in hospital. According to CBS News, the attacker was wearing body armour as he carried out the attack. Another 18-year-old who is suspected of attacking a grocery store in Buffalo, New York, on 14 May was also wearing body armour and carrying a semi-automatic rifle - both of which are commercially available in the US. The Uvalde Memorial Hospital posted on Facebook earlier that 13 children had been taken to hospital ""via ambulances or buses"". A 66-year-old woman and a 10-year-old girl were in a critical condition at a hospital in San Antonio, University Health hospital officials said. This is a profoundly shocking tragedy, yet in America it is also depressingly familiar. The grief and sympathy being expressed around the country is genuine. But no one is genuinely surprised that this could happen. There have already been 27 school shootings this year alone. Young school children routinely rehearse what to do if a gunman enters their classroom. It's only 10 days since 10 people were killed in a mass shooting in New York. Politicians recognise this a problem almost unique to America, where guns have overtaken car crashes as the leading cause of death for children and teenagers. But it's a problem that politics seem incapable of solving. Deeply entrenched views on gun control are not changed in response to events like the tragedy in Uvalde. ""Why do we keep letting this happen?"" asked President Biden. ""Why are we willing to live with this carnage?"" But there is no sign that Democrats will get any closer to passing tighter gun control legislation. Some Republicans are already accusing them of using this latest school shooting to cynically further their own political objectives. Robb Elementary School will join the roll call of school shootings along with Sandy Hook and the Parkland shooting. The killing of innocent schoolchildren has reignited the debate over guns in America, but has not brought it any closer to a resolution. As evening fell police remained outside the community centre in Uvalde braving an intense rainstorm. Earlier, cries and sobs could be heard from outside as family members who gathered there received the devastating news that their children had been killed. Others were asked to give DNA samples to help identify some of the young victims. Just a few blocks from the Robb Elementary school, a small vigil was held for the victims and survivors of the attack. Karla Bohman's voice cracked as she told the group about a family friend whose young daughter, a student at the school, was among those still unaccounted for. ""They don't know if she's in surgery or one of the fatalities, but they know she's a victim of some sort because she's missing,"" Bohman cried. ""I can't believe this."" Cheryl Juhasz, a lifelong resident of Uvalde, quietly wept during the prayer. ""You can't comprehend evil like this. No matter where it happens, but it's harder when it happens at home."" School district superintendent Hal Harrell said the school year had been ended early in the wake of the shooting. Community members wept at a vigil on Tuesday night In a speech from the White House, US President Joe Biden said he was ""sick and tired"" of responding to mass shootings, as he called for gun control. ""How many scores of little children who witnessed what happened - see their friends die, as if they're in a battlefield, for God's sake,"" he said. ""They'll live with it the rest of their lives."" He ordered that flags at the White House and other US federal buildings be flown at half-mast in honour of the victims in Uvalde. School shootings have become recurring emergencies in the US, with 26 recorded last year, according to EdWeek, an education trade publication. This video can not be played Watch: Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr condemns gun violence in the US Active shooter lockdown drills are a common part of the school curriculum, from primary to high school. The 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut was the deadliest such attack. Twenty of the 26 victims were between the ages of five and six. Speaking on the floor of the US Senate in Washington DC on Tuesday, Connecticut Democratic Senator Chris Murphy begged his colleagues to pass gun control legislation. ""These kids weren't unlucky,"" he said. ""This only happens in this country. Nowhere else, nowhere else do little kids go to school thinking that they might be shot that day."" But Texas Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican, rejected the calls for gun control. He said restricting the rights of ""law-abiding citizens... doesn't work. It's not effective. It doesn't prevent crime."" Guns overtook car crashes to become theleading cause of death for US children and teenagers in 2020, according to data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) last month. On Monday, an FBI report found that ""active shooter"" rampage attacks have doubled since the coronavirus began in 2020. Were you in the area? Did you witness the incident?

"Old versus new: Leah's mum says the new one, pictured right, has given her renewed hope her daughter might be found Missing persons posters and billboards have been revamped, with experts turning to science and technology to make them more memorable. The charity Missing People hopes the changes will make the public more likely to engage and take action The posters carry a 3D image of the person and a QR code which shows them laughing and smiling when scanned. The mother of missing Leah Croucher called the new posters ""amazing"" and said they give them renewed hope. Leah was 19 when she went missing from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, on 15 February, 2019. Her mother, Claire Croucher, said ""One of the many challenges as a parent of a missing person is trying to communicate who you've lost. ""We feel that if the public were to understand who our daughter is, they are more likely to remember seeing or meeting her."" It is hoped that the 3D images and smiling faces will humanise the missing person and the aminated characteristics and gestures will make them more memorable to passers-by. The idea is that people might notify friends on social media and share relevant details like background maps of where the person was last seen. One of the most noticeable differences between the new and the old posters is the absence of the word ""missing"". This has been replaced with the more active phrase ""help find"" which the behavioural scientists behind the posters say is more likely to get people to take action. The posters will appear on billboards across London on 25 May to mark Missing Children's Day, and the new format will be used by the charity for all new posters after that. Finn Layland-Stratfield was 17 when he went missing from Tintagel, Cornwall, in 2017 The research for the new posters was compiled by experts Influence at Work, led by Steve Martin, the director of behavioural science at Columbia University's Graduate Business School. ""It takes a village to find a missing person,"" said Mr Martin. ""So, even if a couple of dozen extra people see that image, they connect with it, they feel some empathy towards it, that could make the difference."" Jo Youle, chief executive of Missing People, said their appeals were a hugely important way to reach the public, to help find children. ""By embracing innovation, we hope the new appeals will have an even greater impact and lead to those featured being found safely.""

"A rail workers' union has said its demands for a pay rise are ""not unreasonable"", after its members voted to hold a national strike. The RMT Union said some railway workers have had their pay frozen for three years. On Tuesday, RMTmembers at track operator Network Rail and 13 train operating firmsvoted overwhelmingly in favour of strike action. The Department for Transport said strikes should be the last resort. A spokesperson said: ""It is hugely disappointing and premature that the RMT is calling for industrial action before even entering discussions."" The prospect of a national strike threatens major summer travel disruption across the UK. Rail workers' union votes for national strike Rail strike would bring country to a halt - union Rail union to ballot over 'derisory' pay offer Eddie Dempsey, assistant general secretary at RMT, told the BBC that some of their members ""are in the third year of a pay freeze this year"". ""Don't forget we kept this country moving during the pandemic, we've tightened our belts, we haven't had a pay rise. At the same time, the private companies made bumper profits,"" he said. Mr Dempsey said the union is calling for a pay rise, job security and no compulsory redundancies. ""That's not unreasonable in the current day and age is it,"" he said. Will there be a national rail strike? Tony Miles, a writer for Modern Railways magazine, told the BBC that there may be some public sympathy for RMT members if no pay rise is offered, especially given the cost of living crisis. But he warned that sympathy might have limits. ""If the RMT's members are offered something that sounds acceptable, and they end up holding out a lot longer, I think that won't play well with the public, especially when you consider there will be passengers who haven't also hadn't had pay increases or are also struggling to pay bills,"" he said. ""If it looks like unions are trying to hold country to ransom, public mood might turn sour very quickly."" National strike action could cause widespread travel disruption over the summer The strike ballot of National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers saw 89% vote in favour of a strike and 11% against. Some 71% of RMT's 40,000 members voted. Workers at Network Rail, which maintains the UK's railway infrastructure, have not taken part in a national strike since 1994. The union said the company planned to shed 2,500 maintenance jobs as it tried to make Â£2bn of savings over the next two years. The RMT union has said its leaders will meet to discuss a timetable for strike action from mid-June. Mr Dempsey said he hoped a deal could still be reached, adding that the union ""urgently"" needed to sit down with industry and with the government. ""The quicker we do that, the quicker we can get a settlement, and hopefully we won't have to take the next step of announcing strike action."" The Department for Transport said the railways were ""still on life support"" and warned that anything that drives more passengers away ""risks killing services and jobs"". A spokesperson said: ""We urge the RMT to reconsider and accept the invitation of industry talks, so we can find a solution that delivers for workers, passengers and taxpayers alike."" If Network Rail staff, which include signallers, walk out, it will affect both passenger services and the movement of goods by train, including bulk consignments of fuel and some food, experts say. Trains might only run for part of the day, such as from 07:00 to 19:00 BST and only on main lines. Services could also be reduced to around a fifth of the normal weekday timetable, they add. There are warnings that any potential strikes could have a major impact on rail freight and the sector's ability to move goods around the UK. John Smith, chief executive of GB Railfreight, said if the disruption ends up being long term, the effects would be ""dramatic"". ""It will crystallise in various ways, whether it be shortage of fuel at the pumps, whether it be production being stopped in factories of cars, whether it be electricity generation or Drax having to switch off and not being able to generate electricity,"" he said. Trade body UKHospitality has also warned that a national rail strike could jeopardise the hospitality industry's recovery from the pandemic. Its chief executive Kate Nicholls said: Strikes would inevitably damage our already fragile hospitality businesses, which would have a negative knock-on effect to the wider UK economy."" She added: ""A lack of commuter trains bringing people into towns and cities will further set back the recovery of our high streets and will also deter people from going out in the evening - especially women and vulnerable people who may rely on trains to get them home and feel safe late at night.""

"Chelsea won the Premier League five times and the Champions League twice during Abramovich's ownership The government has approved the Â£4.25bn takeover of Chelsea by a consortium led by LA Dodgers co-owner Todd Boehly. The London club wasput up for salein March before owner Roman Abramovich wassanctioned over his links to Russian president Vladimir Putin. On Tuesday, the Premier Leaguesaid the consortiumhad passed its owners' and directors' test. Chelsea have been operating under a special government licence which expires on 31 May. ""Late last night the UK government reached a position where we could issue a licence that permits the sale of Chelsea,"" a government spokesperson said in a statement on Wednesday. Who are the key people behind consortium buying club? What are the pressing issues for the Chelsea's new owners? The government does not want Abramovich to receive any of the proceeds from the sale, which will instead go into a frozen bank account to be donated to charity. The statement added: ""Following the sanctioning of Roman Abramovich, the government has worked hard to ensure Chelsea has been able to continue to play football. But we have always been clear that the long-term future of the club could only be secured under a new owner. ""Following extensive work, we are now satisfied that the full proceeds of the sale will not benefit Roman Abramovich or any other sanctioned individual. We will now begin the process of ensuring the proceeds of the sale are used for humanitarian causes in Ukraine, supporting victims of the war. ""The steps today will secure the future of this important cultural asset and protect fans and the wider football community. We have been in discussions with relevant international partners for necessary licences required and we thank them for all their cooperation."" Earlier this month the deal hadseemed close to collapseover concerns proceeds would not reach good causes as promised by Abramovich. Abramovichdenied that he had asked for his Â£1.5bn loanto Chelsea be repaid when the club was sold. Several parties expressed an interest but Chelsea agreed to sell to the Boehly-led consortiumearlier in May. The consortium is led by Boehly, but Clearlake Capital - a Californian private equity firm - would own a majority of the shares in Chelsea. Other investors include US billionaire Mark Walter, also a co-owner of the LA Dodgers, and Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss. Chelsea finished the Premier League season in third place, losing both the EFL Cup and FA Cup finals to Liverpool on penalties, and going out of the Champions League in the quarter-finals. Sports minister Nigel Huddleston tweeted: ""This is a big day for Chelsea and one of great relief to fans who I thank for your patience. ""I'm confident of a bright future with the new owners."" Former Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the move would be a ""complete relief"" for everyone connected to the club. ""Today's announcement will be complete relief that [Chelsea] can get on with business as usual and do what is needed to ensure the team is best prepared for next season,"" said Kenyon. ""We've got a very short transfer window and plans will have been made before. ""They have already lost some players through not being able to re-sign them so I think everybody - the squad and the management - will be relieved they can get on with the job they're employed to do."" BBC sports editor Dan Roan With the final hurdle to the takeover of Chelsea finally overcome, and one of the biggest deals in sports history able to be completed, this was the news Chelsea fans had been desperate for after several weeks of unprecedented uncertainty. Time had been running out for the club to be issued with the licences needed to play next season, so government officials will also be relieved that the future of the European champions has been secured in the nick of time after a highly complicated sales process. Approval by European authorities is still required, but that is now regarded as a formality. With the Abramovich era drawing to a close, attention will now turn to the extent to which the new owners invest in the club and back Thomas Tuchel in the transfer market.

"The gunman who killed 19 children and two teachers at a Texas school had written on social media that he would carry out the attack Facebook's owner Meta said the 18-year-old suspect's messages were sent privately on the platform The attack happened on Tuesday at the Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, around 80 miles (129km) west of San Antonio The attacker does not appear to have had a criminal record or a history of mental health problems, Texas Governor Greg Abbott says Democratic candidate Beto O'Rourke was ejected from the briefing after confronting Abbott on gun laws President Biden says he will travel to Texas in the coming days, as he called for gun control: ""It's time for action"" The shooting victims were aged between seven and 10. Teachers Eva Mireles and Irma Garcia also died in the attack Edited by Jude Sheerin We're pausing our live coverage for now. If you're just joining us, or want a recap, here's the latest updates on the mass shooting in Uvalde, Texas where 19 children and two teachers were killed on Tuesday. John SudworthBBC News Dylan Hockley was six years old at the time of the Sandy Hook shooting Newtown, Connecticut, is a place that reminds you that the
threat of gun violence is everywhere in America. Set in forested hills, with the treeline punctuated by white
church steeples, a road runs from the centre of town past the pleasant New
England homes and across a stream to reach, in a few short minutes, the Sandy
Hook Elementary School. It was here, 10 years ago this December, that a 20-year-old
resident shot and killed 26 children and staff members before turning the gun
on himself. Today, Newtown's flag is at half mast, a gesture of empathy
from one place so deeply scarred by an inexplicable act of brutality to
another. Nicole Hockley is a founding member of the Sandy Hook
Promise Foundation and I meet her, sitting outside the office on a picnic table
in the warm spring sunshine, to talk about the tragedy in Uvalde, Texas almost
2000 miles away. Her six-year-old son, Dylan, was one of those murdered at
Sandy Hook. ""All shootings reopen wounds that - every time I think
are perhaps somewhat healed - are torn open again,"" she tells me. ""But because it is so hauntingly similar to what
happened at Sandy Hook School it hit closer to home in a way that I hadn't
expected, and I went into a state of shock."" A law enforcement source has confirmed that the shooter was not wearing body armour when he entered the school on his rampage. Early reports suggested the gunman had been wearing some kind of bulletproof vest. But the source told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that he was wearing a ""chest rig"" which is a carrier to hold magazines, similar to what military and law enforcement tactical teams wear. That appears to have been the source of confusion over whether he was armoured or not. Reports are emerging that onlookers, frustrated at the police's lack of action, urged officers to charge into Robb Elementary School where the shooting took place on Tuesday. Juan Carranza, who watched the scene from outside his house,told the Associated Press,externalthat women standing nearby shouted ""Go in there! Go in there!"" at police officers soon after the attack began. But they didn't go in, he said. Another witness, Javier Cazares - whose daughter was killed in the attack - said he had raised the idea of charging into the school with other bystanders. ""Let's just rush in because the cops aren't doing anything like they are supposed to,"" he said. ""More could have been done."" ""They were unprepared,"" he added. Reality Check The National Rifle Association (NRA) is a gun advocacy group which has significant influence in US politics -officially spending about $3m per year to influence gun policy,external, with considerable  additional sums spent indirectly. Each election cycle the NRA awards letter grades (between A and F) to each US politician running for office. The grades are based on a politicianâs gun advocacy record, including how outspoken theyâve been on gun rights and how theyâve voted on gun laws in the past. Over the last decade, these ratings have become increasingly split down party lines. In 2020, 94% of Republicans running for office were given an A grade by the NRA (the highest pro-gun category).  In that same year, 92% of Democrats had the lowest F grade. This has significantly changed over time.  In 2010, more than a quarter of Democrats running for office were given an A grade. By 2020, there was only one remaining Democrat in this group. The full list of NRA grades for the 2022 US midterms is yet to be published, but the ideological divide shows little sign of narrowing. Read more about the NRA and why it's so powerful.  CNN reports that minutes before the attack began, the gunman texted a girl who lives in Frankfurt, Germany, about his plans. Screenshots of messages reviewed by the cable network apparently show the suspect complaining to the girl about his grandmother being ""on the phone with [mobile phone carrier] AT&T about my phone."" ""It's annoying,"" he texted. CNN reports,externalthat six minutes later he texted the girl back: ""I just shot my grandma in her head."" Seconds later, he added: ""Ima go shoot up a elementary school rn [right now]."" The last message was sent at 11:21 in Texas - 11 minutes before the school shooting began. The girl told CNN she used to speak to the 18-year-old daily on FaceTime, and they also communicated via a livestreaming app called Yubo and on a gaming app named Plato. Law enforcement sources have told the BBC's US partner, CBS News, that preliminary information suggests the gunman shot his grandmother in the face after arguing with her about a mobile phone bill. Protesters held a vigil in front of the headquarters of the National Rifle Association gun lobby in Virginia Members of the Houston Astros bow their heads during a moment of silence before a game against Cleveland A makeshift memorial outside Robb Elementary School Mourners pray at a Catholic parish in Uvalde Beto O'Rourke, a Democrat running for governor, heckled his rival during a press conference A sign sends a message of grieving to Uvalde at an MLB game in Ohio Oasis Outback, the store where the gunman bought his weapons A local child hands flowers to an officer outside the school to add to the memorial site Angelica Casas and Chelsea BaileyBBC News, Uvalde The siblings of a murdered child place flowers at a makeshift memorial outside the school Ivan Arellano, 18, was set to graduate from Uvalde High School later this month. One day before the shooting, he and his fellow graduates donned their caps and gowns and walked through the hallways of Robb Elementary to a chorus of cheers from the students. ""That was the first hall we walked in,"" he tells the BBC, describing the location where 19 students were later gunned down by his former classmate. Arellano said he's gone to Uvalde High with the gunman since the eighth grade, but that recently, the teen simply stopped coming to school. Arellano remembered the gunman as an ""odd"" and ""antisocial"" person, who lacked friends and would often use ""fear and intimidation"" to try to scare his classmates. He also pushed back on media reports that the gunman was bullied. ""He would choose to bully people, and it just wouldn't work so he would just get angry,"" he said. ""He would just try to scare people and I guess this was his last way to scare people."" In a town this small, Arellano said everyone here knows someone who's been personally touched by this unfathomable tragedy. Looking back, he said he feels like the warning signs were there. ""A lot of people who knew him, we knew he wasn't mentally healthy,"" he said. ""And a lot of people could agree that we probably should've said something."" Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, Uvalde Mary Hernandez knew one of the teachers who died Mary Hernandez grew up near the school, and still comes back every day to check up on her mother. On Tuesday she was shocked to find police had taken over the neighbourhood, and horrified when she heard the number of children killed. âItâs devastating because this is a small community and everybody is touched because 19 families are mourning and youâll know some of these people,â she said. Mary knew one of the teachers who died, Irma Garcia. They were both Catholic and had worked together organising retreats for parishioners. âI couldnât believe it! She was a beautiful person, a beautiful soul - very caring: you could tell that she was a good teacher.â Mary supports stricter gun laws, although she tells me she feels sheâs in a minority. Mental health is also a problem, something the Texas governor stressed in his press conference today. But, Mary says, âthatâs a problem everywhere in the world. Why is it only in the US that we have mass shootings? Because guns are available.â âItâs not going to be easy and itâs not going to be soon,â she says when I ask how the community can recover. âThere are good people here, but we are now among the other massacres that have occurred in the United States.â With some of the victims âvery very young,â she says, âit touches everybody and it hurts everybody.â Nomia IqbalBBC News, Uvalde A US flag hangs from the ceiling next to the lone star flag of Texas in this arena. This is where rodeos usually take place but tonight itâs turned into a prayer vigil so people can grieve their profound loss. A stage is set for music and prayers which looks out to a few hundred people on the bleachers - they are sombre with some shedding tears. Many are wearing shirts that simply say ""Uvalde"". Community leaders stand on the stage and start the event with a hymn that people join in. Their opening words were âwe love you.â Republican leadership is here - Governor Greg Abbott and Senator Ted Cruz - who refuse to talk to the press when we approach them. Here, there is no mention of the familiar issue that is always sparked by horrific US shootings - gun control. Instead the vigil is focused on something else familiar in times like this - offering thoughts and prayers. Mexican President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador has sent a message of solidarity to the US in the wake of the Uvalde shooting. Speaking to journalists in his daily news briefing, LÃ³pez Obrador said that he wished to ""express my condolences, my pain, and my solidarity with the families of the young people that lost their lives yesterday. Iâm sending them a strong hug"". ""In our country, lamentably, this happens. It hurts us a lot that these disasters happen. We want to send a hug to the family members of the young people, the victims, and also our solidarity with the government of the United States,"" he added. ""These are very sad, very difficult moments. For us, itâs the same."" In a statement, the Mexican government said that consular officials in the town of Eagle Pass - about 60 miles from Uvalde - were working with local officials to determine whether any of the dead or wounded were Mexican nationals. The foreign ministry said it would release the number of any Mexican citizens involved once the information was confirmed by US authorities. A Texas student has been arrested after being found with an ""AK-47 style pistol"" and a ""replica AR-15 style"" rifle, police say. The arrest took place outside a high school in Richardson, over 350 miles (560 km) north of Uvalde. Police say a witness called 911 to report a person carrying a rifle outside Berkner High School. Police responded and located the gunman, a student. The firearms were found in his car and he was charged with unlawful carrying of weapons in a weapons-free school zone. No other information was released due to the suspect's age. It comes a day after the murder spree in Uvalde. An Uvalde resident stands vigil outside the school The mother of the teenager who killed 21 people at a Uvalde primary school has spoken about her son. ""My son wasn't a violent person. I'm surprised by what he did,"" Adriana Reyes told the Daily Mail from the hospital where her own mother is being treated for a gunshot wound to her face (the suspect shot his grandmother before attacking the school, local authorities say). Reyes denied reports that she had a toxic relationship with her son. ""I had a good relationship with him. He kept to himself; he didn't have many friends,"" she told the newspaper. Reyes, 39, also told NBC News: ""Iâm very upset about everything. A lot of stuff has happened, but right now I donât feel good."" Juan Alvarez, Reyes' boyfriend, told NBC the attacker was ""a weird one"". ""I never got along with him. I never socialised with him. He doesnât talk to nobody,â said Alvarez, 62. âWhen you try to talk to him heâd just sit there and walk away.â This video can not be played Beto O'Rourke heckles Texas Governor Greg Abbott over gun laws Beto O'Rourke, the Democratic challenger to Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott, interrupted a news conference hosted by Abbott on Wednesday. O'Rourke was escorted out of the building after heckling his political rival, and blaming him for the Uvalde shooting. He was seen speaking to reporters in English and Spanish afterwards about why he staged the interruption. O'Rourke and other Democrats have said the state's lax gun laws led to Tuesday's massacre. During the interruption, O'Rourke could be heard referring to a 2019 shooting in El Paso, Texas. He wrote on social media on Tuesday that Texas officials like Abbott should have taken action on gun control at the time, but did nothing. Angelica Casas and Chelsea BaileyBBC News, Uvalde Mickey Craddock treats children as a nurse practitioner in the Uvalde community Today, unlike most days, Mickey Craddock had to drive past caution tape and a police barricade to get out of her home. Craddock, a local nurse practitioner who's served the Uvalde community for the last decade, lives three doors down from the home where the teenage gunman stayed with his grandmother. She said she didn't know the family well, but remembers a quiet teenage boy who occasionally played basketball down the street. ""He was a regular teenage kid,"" she said, ""he was a troubled kid, and I could probably point out five or six of them in this community. ""People from bad backgrounds, drug backgrounds, you know, but we never thought anything like this would happen."" Despite the media circus, Craddock's neighbourhood is quiet today. Chickens and roosters roam freely through front yards decorated with high school graduation photos for a ceremony that has since been cancelled. Craddock said when she initially heard reports of shots fired at the school she thought ""stupid kids were shooting guns in the air"" to celebrate the end of the school year. It wasn't until later she found out one of her colleagues at the clinic lost a child in the shooting that killed at least 19 children less than a mile away. ""I took care of half of those kids from the time they were babies,"" she said, her voice breaking. The killer, she says, ""had the tools that took out a whole bunch of children"". Sarah SmithNorth America Editor The state senator for the district that covers Uvalde, Roland Gutierrez, a Democrat, was visibly upset and very angry as he told me that something has
to be done about access to semi-automatic weapons in America. He said he couldnât imagine what people in other countries must think of the US when they see tragic incidents like this happening, and he
seemed to be struggling to understand why it is that an 18-year-old is allowed
to buy, legally, a semi-automatic weapon that can cause this type of carnage. He also said he does understand peopleâs commitment to the Second Amendment - their right to bear arms - and recognises that this is a rural
hunting community and his constituents are very wedded to their weapons. He just doesnât understand why military-style rifles are
allowed on the streets legally in America and hopes this
incident may change that. But he didnât seem optimistic that political change
was coming. Nomia IqbalReporting from Uvalde Hope Robinson Hope Robinson, 24, lives an hour away from Uvalde and came by to pay her respects. She is from a conservative family and says that âguns can be a force of good in the right handsâ. âMy husband is very pro-guns and I did say to him 'did this shake him?'. And he said 'a little'. ""But for me itâs about guns being in the right hands. I donât think anyone should be able to just get hold of them and there should be informational training, courses beforehand.â Like driving a car, I suggest. ""Yes, not anyone can just drive a car, but in my opinion if you make guns harder to get for everyone, bad people can still get them. ""I think itâs all about your intent. My husbandâs family used a gun when an intruder broke in to their house with a gun for example.â The right for Americans to bear arms as outlined in the Second Amendment is something she truly believes is important. âI do think teachers should be armed with guns to protect classes,"" she added. Pratiksha GhildialReporting from Uvalde The drive to the town of Uvalde is lined with farmland and ranches. As you enter the town, US and Texas flags fly at half mast. A sign says âPray for Uvaldeâ. Itâs a very small community where everybody seems to know everybody. Just outside the Robb Elementary School, streets are lined with huge media trucks - all here to try to tell the story of the horror that unfolded inside this tiny school campus. People have been laying flowers as tributes. Texan police officers in khaki-grey uniforms and trademark hats are zealously guarding the school premises. But there is very little they can do heal the deep wounds that will be felt for generations to come. A child inspects a shotgun at the NRA's 2015 conference A statement has been released by the National Rifle Association (NRA) - the influential pro-gun lobbying group that resists new gun control measures. The four-sentence statement begins with ""deepest sympathies"" to the families and victims of ""this horrific and evil crime"". ""Although an investigation is under way and facts are still emerging, we recognise this was the act of a lone, deranged criminal,"" the statement continues. Officials in Texas have not yet said whether the gunman had any prior criminal history. The NRA adds that at their annual conference, taking place this weekend in Houston, members ""will reflect on these events, pray for the victimsâ¦ and pledge to redouble our commitment to making schools secure"". In President Biden's remarks on Tuesday night, he called out pro-gun groups, asking Americans: ""When in Godâs name are we going to stand up to the gun lobby?""

"Relatives of children at the school gathered at a nearby civic centre to wait for news Nineteen young children and two adults have died in a shooting at a primary school in south Texas. The gunman opened fire at Robb Elementary School - which teaches children aged seven to 10 - in the city of Uvalde before he was killed by law enforcement, officials said. The 18-year-old suspect had a handgun, an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle and high-capacity magazines, investigators say. The teenager is suspected of shooting his grandmother before the rampage. Local media report he may have been a high school student in the area. Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District Chief of Police Pete Arredondo said the shooting began at 11:32 local time on Tuesday, and that investigators believe the attacker ""did act alone during this heinous crime"". LIVE - latest updates, reaction and analysis TIMELINE - how a sunny school day ended in bloodshed â¢VICTIMS - tributes to children and teacher killed Texas Governor Greg Abbott said the shooter, whom he named as Salvador Ramos, abandoned a vehicle before entering the school to ""horrifically, incomprehensibly"" open fire. An Uvalde school district police officer, who worked at the school, saw Ramos emerge from the vehicle carrying a rifle and wearing body armour, according to Erick Estrada from the Texas Department of Public Safety, who was speaking to CNN. The officer ""engaged"" the suspect but was unable to stop him, Mr Estrada said. Two more officers from Uvalde Police Department also attempted to stop Ramos but were unable to do so, and called for back-up. Several of the children who died have been identified. Family members confirmed the deaths of 10-year-olds Xavier Lopez and Amerie Jo Garza in statements on Tuesday night. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Angel Garza said on Facebook that his daughter Amerie had been killed. ""My little love is now flying high with the angels above. Please don't take a second for granted. Hug your family. Tell them you love them,"" he said. The two adults who died were both teachers - Irma Garcia and Eva Mireles. According to the school district's website, Mrs Garcia is a mother-of-four and had been a teacher for 23 years. The same website says that Ms Mireles had been a teacher for 17 years, has a daughter in college and loved running and hiking. Nearly 500 pupils are enrolled in the predominantly Hispanic school around 85 miles (135km) west of the city of San Antonio. This video can not be played Biden: When ""are we going to stand up to the gun lobby?"" The Associated Press news agency reports that a US Border Patrol official who was nearby when the shooting began rushed into the school and shot and killed the gunman, who was behind a barricade. Border Patrol is a federal agency that guards US ports of entry. Uvalde, which is fewer than 80 miles from the border with Mexico, is home to a Border Patrol station. Two border agents were reportedly shot in an exchange with the gunman. One agent was shot in the head, officials say, adding that both were now in a stable condition in hospital. According to CBS News, the attacker was wearing body armour as he carried out the attack. Another 18-year-old who is suspected of attacking a grocery store in Buffalo, New York, on 14 May was also wearing body armour and carrying a semi-automatic rifle - both of which are commercially available in the US. The Uvalde Memorial Hospital posted on Facebook earlier that 13 children had been taken to hospital ""via ambulances or buses"". A 66-year-old woman and a 10-year-old girl were in a critical condition at a hospital in San Antonio, University Health hospital officials said. This is a profoundly shocking tragedy, yet in America it is also depressingly familiar. The grief and sympathy being expressed around the country is genuine. But no one is genuinely surprised that this could happen. There have already been 27 school shootings this year alone. Young school children routinely rehearse what to do if a gunman enters their classroom. It's only 10 days since 10 people were killed in a mass shooting in New York. Politicians recognise this a problem almost unique to America, where guns have overtaken car crashes as the leading cause of death for children and teenagers. But it's a problem that politics seem incapable of solving. Deeply entrenched views on gun control are not changed in response to events like the tragedy in Uvalde. ""Why do we keep letting this happen?"" asked President Biden. ""Why are we willing to live with this carnage?"" But there is no sign that Democrats will get any closer to passing tighter gun control legislation. Some Republicans are already accusing them of using this latest school shooting to cynically further their own political objectives. Robb Elementary School will join the roll call of school shootings along with Sandy Hook and the Parkland shooting. The killing of innocent schoolchildren has reignited the debate over guns in America, but has not brought it any closer to a resolution. As evening fell police remained outside the community centre in Uvalde braving an intense rainstorm. Earlier, cries and sobs could be heard from outside as family members who gathered there received the devastating news that their children had been killed. Others were asked to give DNA samples to help identify some of the young victims. Just a few blocks from the Robb Elementary school, a small vigil was held for the victims and survivors of the attack. Karla Bohman's voice cracked as she told the group about a family friend whose young daughter, a student at the school, was among those still unaccounted for. ""They don't know if she's in surgery or one of the fatalities, but they know she's a victim of some sort because she's missing,"" Bohman cried. ""I can't believe this."" Cheryl Juhasz, a lifelong resident of Uvalde, quietly wept during the prayer. ""You can't comprehend evil like this. No matter where it happens, but it's harder when it happens at home."" School district superintendent Hal Harrell said the school year had been ended early in the wake of the shooting. Community members wept at a vigil on Tuesday night In a speech from the White House, US President Joe Biden said he was ""sick and tired"" of responding to mass shootings, as he called for gun control. ""How many scores of little children who witnessed what happened - see their friends die, as if they're in a battlefield, for God's sake,"" he said. ""They'll live with it the rest of their lives."" He ordered that flags at the White House and other US federal buildings be flown at half-mast in honour of the victims in Uvalde. School shootings have become recurring emergencies in the US, with 26 recorded last year, according to EdWeek, an education trade publication. This video can not be played Watch: Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr condemns gun violence in the US Active shooter lockdown drills are a common part of the school curriculum, from primary to high school. The 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut was the deadliest such attack. Twenty of the 26 victims were between the ages of five and six. Speaking on the floor of the US Senate in Washington DC on Tuesday, Connecticut Democratic Senator Chris Murphy begged his colleagues to pass gun control legislation. ""These kids weren't unlucky,"" he said. ""This only happens in this country. Nowhere else, nowhere else do little kids go to school thinking that they might be shot that day."" But Texas Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican, rejected the calls for gun control. He said restricting the rights of ""law-abiding citizens... doesn't work. It's not effective. It doesn't prevent crime."" Guns overtook car crashes to become theleading cause of death for US children and teenagers in 2020, according to data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) last month. On Monday, an FBI report found that ""active shooter"" rampage attacks have doubled since the coronavirus began in 2020. Were you in the area? Did you witness the incident?

Angel Garza said on Facebook that his daughter Amerie had been killed. ""My little love is now flying high with the angels above. Please don't take a second for granted. Hug your family. Tell them you love them,"" he said. The two adults who died were both teachers - Irma Garcia and Eva Mireles. According to the school district's website, Mrs Garcia is a mother-of-four and had been a teacher for 23 years. The same website says that Ms Mireles had been a teacher for 17 years, has a daughter in college and loved running and hiking. Nearly 500 pupils are enrolled in the predominantly Hispanic school around 85 miles (135km) west of the city of San Antonio. This video can not be played Biden: When ""are we going to stand up to the gun lobby?"" The Associated Press news agency reports that a US Border Patrol official who was nearby when the shooting began rushed into the school and shot and killed the gunman, who was behind a barricade. Border Patrol is a federal agency that guards US ports of entry. Uvalde, which is fewer than 80 miles from the border with Mexico, is home to a Border Patrol station. Two border agents were reportedly shot in an exchange with the gunman. One agent was shot in the head, officials say, adding that both were now in a stable condition in hospital. According to CBS News, the attacker was wearing body armour as he carried out the attack. Another 18-year-old who is suspected of attacking a grocery store in Buffalo, New York, on 14 May was also wearing body armour and carrying a semi-automatic rifle - both of which are commercially available in the US. The Uvalde Memorial Hospital posted on Facebook earlier that 13 children had been taken to hospital ""via ambulances or buses"". A 66-year-old woman and a 10-year-old girl were in a critical condition at a hospital in San Antonio, University Health hospital officials said. This is a profoundly shocking tragedy, yet in America it is also depressingly familiar. The grief and sympathy being expressed around the country is genuine. But no one is genuinely surprised that this could happen. There have already been 27 school shootings this year alone. Young school children routinely rehearse what to do if a gunman enters their classroom. It's only 10 days since 10 people were killed in a mass shooting in New York. Politicians recognise this a problem almost unique to America, where guns have overtaken car crashes as the leading cause of death for children and teenagers. But it's a problem that politics seem incapable of solving. Deeply entrenched views on gun control are not changed in response to events like the tragedy in Uvalde. ""Why do we keep letting this happen?"" asked President Biden. ""Why are we willing to live with this carnage?"" But there is no sign that Democrats will get any closer to passing tighter gun control legislation. Some Republicans are already accusing them of using this latest school shooting to cynically further their own political objectives. Robb Elementary School will join the roll call of school shootings along with Sandy Hook and the Parkland shooting. The killing of innocent schoolchildren has reignited the debate over guns in America, but has not brought it any closer to a resolution. As evening fell police remained outside the community centre in Uvalde braving an intense rainstorm. Earlier, cries and sobs could be heard from outside as family members who gathered there received the devastating news that their children had been killed. Others were asked to give DNA samples to help identify some of the young victims. Just a few blocks from the Robb Elementary school, a small vigil was held for the victims and survivors of the attack. Karla Bohman's voice cracked as she told the group about a family friend whose young daughter, a student at the school, was among those still unaccounted for. ""They don't know if she's in surgery or one of the fatalities, but they know she's a victim of some sort because she's missing,"" Bohman cried. ""I can't believe this."" Cheryl Juhasz, a lifelong resident of Uvalde, quietly wept during the prayer. ""You can't comprehend evil like this. No matter where it happens, but it's harder when it happens at home."" School district superintendent Hal Harrell said the school year had been ended early in the wake of the shooting. Community members wept at a vigil on Tuesday night In a speech from the White House, US President Joe Biden said he was ""sick and tired"" of responding to mass shootings, as he called for gun control. ""How many scores of little children who witnessed what happened - see their friends die, as if they're in a battlefield, for God's sake,"" he said. ""They'll live with it the rest of their lives."" He ordered that flags at the White House and other US federal buildings be flown at half-mast in honour of the victims in Uvalde. School shootings have become recurring emergencies in the US, with 26 recorded last year, according to EdWeek, an education trade publication. This video can not be played Watch: Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr condemns gun violence in the US Active shooter lockdown drills are a common part of the school curriculum, from primary to high school. The 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut was the deadliest such attack. Twenty of the 26 victims were between the ages of five and six. Speaking on the floor of the US Senate in Washington DC on Tuesday, Connecticut Democratic Senator Chris Murphy begged his colleagues to pass gun control legislation. ""These kids weren't unlucky,"" he said. ""This only happens in this country. Nowhere else, nowhere else do little kids go to school thinking that they might be shot that day."" But Texas Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican, rejected the calls for gun control. He said restricting the rights of ""law-abiding citizens... doesn't work. It's not effective. It doesn't prevent crime."" Guns overtook car crashes to become theleading cause of death for US children and teenagers in 2020, according to data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) last month. On Monday, an FBI report found that ""active shooter"" rampage attacks have doubled since the coronavirus began in 2020. Were you in the area? Did you witness the incident?

"The gunman who killed 19 children and two teachers at a Texas school had written on social media that he would carry out the attack Facebook's owner Meta said the 18-year-old suspect's messages were sent privately on the platform The attack happened on Tuesday at the Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, around 80 miles (129km) west of San Antonio The attacker does not appear to have had a criminal record or a history of mental health problems, Texas Governor Greg Abbott says Democratic candidate Beto O'Rourke was ejected from the briefing after confronting Abbott on gun laws President Biden says he will travel to Texas in the coming days, as he called for gun control: ""It's time for action"" The shooting victims were aged between seven and 10. Teachers Eva Mireles and Irma Garcia also died in the attack Edited by Jude Sheerin We're pausing our live coverage for now. If you're just joining us, or want a recap, here's the latest updates on the mass shooting in Uvalde, Texas where 19 children and two teachers were killed on Tuesday. John SudworthBBC News Dylan Hockley was six years old at the time of the Sandy Hook shooting Newtown, Connecticut, is a place that reminds you that the
threat of gun violence is everywhere in America. Set in forested hills, with the treeline punctuated by white
church steeples, a road runs from the centre of town past the pleasant New
England homes and across a stream to reach, in a few short minutes, the Sandy
Hook Elementary School. It was here, 10 years ago this December, that a 20-year-old
resident shot and killed 26 children and staff members before turning the gun
on himself. Today, Newtown's flag is at half mast, a gesture of empathy
from one place so deeply scarred by an inexplicable act of brutality to
another. Nicole Hockley is a founding member of the Sandy Hook
Promise Foundation and I meet her, sitting outside the office on a picnic table
in the warm spring sunshine, to talk about the tragedy in Uvalde, Texas almost
2000 miles away. Her six-year-old son, Dylan, was one of those murdered at
Sandy Hook. ""All shootings reopen wounds that - every time I think
are perhaps somewhat healed - are torn open again,"" she tells me. ""But because it is so hauntingly similar to what
happened at Sandy Hook School it hit closer to home in a way that I hadn't
expected, and I went into a state of shock."" A law enforcement source has confirmed that the shooter was not wearing body armour when he entered the school on his rampage. Early reports suggested the gunman had been wearing some kind of bulletproof vest. But the source told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that he was wearing a ""chest rig"" which is a carrier to hold magazines, similar to what military and law enforcement tactical teams wear. That appears to have been the source of confusion over whether he was armoured or not. Reports are emerging that onlookers, frustrated at the police's lack of action, urged officers to charge into Robb Elementary School where the shooting took place on Tuesday. Juan Carranza, who watched the scene from outside his house,told the Associated Press,externalthat women standing nearby shouted ""Go in there! Go in there!"" at police officers soon after the attack began. But they didn't go in, he said. Another witness, Javier Cazares - whose daughter was killed in the attack - said he had raised the idea of charging into the school with other bystanders. ""Let's just rush in because the cops aren't doing anything like they are supposed to,"" he said. ""More could have been done."" ""They were unprepared,"" he added. Reality Check The National Rifle Association (NRA) is a gun advocacy group which has significant influence in US politics -officially spending about $3m per year to influence gun policy,external, with considerable  additional sums spent indirectly. Each election cycle the NRA awards letter grades (between A and F) to each US politician running for office. The grades are based on a politicianâs gun advocacy record, including how outspoken theyâve been on gun rights and how theyâve voted on gun laws in the past. Over the last decade, these ratings have become increasingly split down party lines. In 2020, 94% of Republicans running for office were given an A grade by the NRA (the highest pro-gun category).  In that same year, 92% of Democrats had the lowest F grade. This has significantly changed over time.  In 2010, more than a quarter of Democrats running for office were given an A grade. By 2020, there was only one remaining Democrat in this group. The full list of NRA grades for the 2022 US midterms is yet to be published, but the ideological divide shows little sign of narrowing. Read more about the NRA and why it's so powerful.  CNN reports that minutes before the attack began, the gunman texted a girl who lives in Frankfurt, Germany, about his plans. Screenshots of messages reviewed by the cable network apparently show the suspect complaining to the girl about his grandmother being ""on the phone with [mobile phone carrier] AT&T about my phone."" ""It's annoying,"" he texted. CNN reports,externalthat six minutes later he texted the girl back: ""I just shot my grandma in her head."" Seconds later, he added: ""Ima go shoot up a elementary school rn [right now]."" The last message was sent at 11:21 in Texas - 11 minutes before the school shooting began. The girl told CNN she used to speak to the 18-year-old daily on FaceTime, and they also communicated via a livestreaming app called Yubo and on a gaming app named Plato. Law enforcement sources have told the BBC's US partner, CBS News, that preliminary information suggests the gunman shot his grandmother in the face after arguing with her about a mobile phone bill. Protesters held a vigil in front of the headquarters of the National Rifle Association gun lobby in Virginia Members of the Houston Astros bow their heads during a moment of silence before a game against Cleveland A makeshift memorial outside Robb Elementary School Mourners pray at a Catholic parish in Uvalde Beto O'Rourke, a Democrat running for governor, heckled his rival during a press conference A sign sends a message of grieving to Uvalde at an MLB game in Ohio Oasis Outback, the store where the gunman bought his weapons A local child hands flowers to an officer outside the school to add to the memorial site Angelica Casas and Chelsea BaileyBBC News, Uvalde The siblings of a murdered child place flowers at a makeshift memorial outside the school Ivan Arellano, 18, was set to graduate from Uvalde High School later this month. One day before the shooting, he and his fellow graduates donned their caps and gowns and walked through the hallways of Robb Elementary to a chorus of cheers from the students. ""That was the first hall we walked in,"" he tells the BBC, describing the location where 19 students were later gunned down by his former classmate. Arellano said he's gone to Uvalde High with the gunman since the eighth grade, but that recently, the teen simply stopped coming to school. Arellano remembered the gunman as an ""odd"" and ""antisocial"" person, who lacked friends and would often use ""fear and intimidation"" to try to scare his classmates. He also pushed back on media reports that the gunman was bullied. ""He would choose to bully people, and it just wouldn't work so he would just get angry,"" he said. ""He would just try to scare people and I guess this was his last way to scare people."" In a town this small, Arellano said everyone here knows someone who's been personally touched by this unfathomable tragedy. Looking back, he said he feels like the warning signs were there. ""A lot of people who knew him, we knew he wasn't mentally healthy,"" he said. ""And a lot of people could agree that we probably should've said something."" Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, Uvalde Mary Hernandez knew one of the teachers who died Mary Hernandez grew up near the school, and still comes back every day to check up on her mother. On Tuesday she was shocked to find police had taken over the neighbourhood, and horrified when she heard the number of children killed. âItâs devastating because this is a small community and everybody is touched because 19 families are mourning and youâll know some of these people,â she said. Mary knew one of the teachers who died, Irma Garcia. They were both Catholic and had worked together organising retreats for parishioners. âI couldnât believe it! She was a beautiful person, a beautiful soul - very caring: you could tell that she was a good teacher.â Mary supports stricter gun laws, although she tells me she feels sheâs in a minority. Mental health is also a problem, something the Texas governor stressed in his press conference today. But, Mary says, âthatâs a problem everywhere in the world. Why is it only in the US that we have mass shootings? Because guns are available.â âItâs not going to be easy and itâs not going to be soon,â she says when I ask how the community can recover. âThere are good people here, but we are now among the other massacres that have occurred in the United States.â With some of the victims âvery very young,â she says, âit touches everybody and it hurts everybody.â Nomia IqbalBBC News, Uvalde A US flag hangs from the ceiling next to the lone star flag of Texas in this arena. This is where rodeos usually take place but tonight itâs turned into a prayer vigil so people can grieve their profound loss. A stage is set for music and prayers which looks out to a few hundred people on the bleachers - they are sombre with some shedding tears. Many are wearing shirts that simply say ""Uvalde"". Community leaders stand on the stage and start the event with a hymn that people join in. Their opening words were âwe love you.â Republican leadership is here - Governor Greg Abbott and Senator Ted Cruz - who refuse to talk to the press when we approach them. Here, there is no mention of the familiar issue that is always sparked by horrific US shootings - gun control. Instead the vigil is focused on something else familiar in times like this - offering thoughts and prayers. Mexican President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador has sent a message of solidarity to the US in the wake of the Uvalde shooting. Speaking to journalists in his daily news briefing, LÃ³pez Obrador said that he wished to ""express my condolences, my pain, and my solidarity with the families of the young people that lost their lives yesterday. Iâm sending them a strong hug"". ""In our country, lamentably, this happens. It hurts us a lot that these disasters happen. We want to send a hug to the family members of the young people, the victims, and also our solidarity with the government of the United States,"" he added. ""These are very sad, very difficult moments. For us, itâs the same."" In a statement, the Mexican government said that consular officials in the town of Eagle Pass - about 60 miles from Uvalde - were working with local officials to determine whether any of the dead or wounded were Mexican nationals. The foreign ministry said it would release the number of any Mexican citizens involved once the information was confirmed by US authorities. A Texas student has been arrested after being found with an ""AK-47 style pistol"" and a ""replica AR-15 style"" rifle, police say. The arrest took place outside a high school in Richardson, over 350 miles (560 km) north of Uvalde. Police say a witness called 911 to report a person carrying a rifle outside Berkner High School. Police responded and located the gunman, a student. The firearms were found in his car and he was charged with unlawful carrying of weapons in a weapons-free school zone. No other information was released due to the suspect's age. It comes a day after the murder spree in Uvalde. An Uvalde resident stands vigil outside the school The mother of the teenager who killed 21 people at a Uvalde primary school has spoken about her son. ""My son wasn't a violent person. I'm surprised by what he did,"" Adriana Reyes told the Daily Mail from the hospital where her own mother is being treated for a gunshot wound to her face (the suspect shot his grandmother before attacking the school, local authorities say). Reyes denied reports that she had a toxic relationship with her son. ""I had a good relationship with him. He kept to himself; he didn't have many friends,"" she told the newspaper. Reyes, 39, also told NBC News: ""Iâm very upset about everything. A lot of stuff has happened, but right now I donât feel good."" Juan Alvarez, Reyes' boyfriend, told NBC the attacker was ""a weird one"". ""I never got along with him. I never socialised with him. He doesnât talk to nobody,â said Alvarez, 62. âWhen you try to talk to him heâd just sit there and walk away.â This video can not be played Beto O'Rourke heckles Texas Governor Greg Abbott over gun laws Beto O'Rourke, the Democratic challenger to Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott, interrupted a news conference hosted by Abbott on Wednesday. O'Rourke was escorted out of the building after heckling his political rival, and blaming him for the Uvalde shooting. He was seen speaking to reporters in English and Spanish afterwards about why he staged the interruption. O'Rourke and other Democrats have said the state's lax gun laws led to Tuesday's massacre. During the interruption, O'Rourke could be heard referring to a 2019 shooting in El Paso, Texas. He wrote on social media on Tuesday that Texas officials like Abbott should have taken action on gun control at the time, but did nothing. Angelica Casas and Chelsea BaileyBBC News, Uvalde Mickey Craddock treats children as a nurse practitioner in the Uvalde community Today, unlike most days, Mickey Craddock had to drive past caution tape and a police barricade to get out of her home. Craddock, a local nurse practitioner who's served the Uvalde community for the last decade, lives three doors down from the home where the teenage gunman stayed with his grandmother. She said she didn't know the family well, but remembers a quiet teenage boy who occasionally played basketball down the street. ""He was a regular teenage kid,"" she said, ""he was a troubled kid, and I could probably point out five or six of them in this community. ""People from bad backgrounds, drug backgrounds, you know, but we never thought anything like this would happen."" Despite the media circus, Craddock's neighbourhood is quiet today. Chickens and roosters roam freely through front yards decorated with high school graduation photos for a ceremony that has since been cancelled. Craddock said when she initially heard reports of shots fired at the school she thought ""stupid kids were shooting guns in the air"" to celebrate the end of the school year. It wasn't until later she found out one of her colleagues at the clinic lost a child in the shooting that killed at least 19 children less than a mile away. ""I took care of half of those kids from the time they were babies,"" she said, her voice breaking. The killer, she says, ""had the tools that took out a whole bunch of children"". Sarah SmithNorth America Editor The state senator for the district that covers Uvalde, Roland Gutierrez, a Democrat, was visibly upset and very angry as he told me that something has
to be done about access to semi-automatic weapons in America. He said he couldnât imagine what people in other countries must think of the US when they see tragic incidents like this happening, and he
seemed to be struggling to understand why it is that an 18-year-old is allowed
to buy, legally, a semi-automatic weapon that can cause this type of carnage. He also said he does understand peopleâs commitment to the Second Amendment - their right to bear arms - and recognises that this is a rural
hunting community and his constituents are very wedded to their weapons. He just doesnât understand why military-style rifles are
allowed on the streets legally in America and hopes this
incident may change that. But he didnât seem optimistic that political change
was coming. Nomia IqbalReporting from Uvalde Hope Robinson Hope Robinson, 24, lives an hour away from Uvalde and came by to pay her respects. She is from a conservative family and says that âguns can be a force of good in the right handsâ. âMy husband is very pro-guns and I did say to him 'did this shake him?'. And he said 'a little'. ""But for me itâs about guns being in the right hands. I donât think anyone should be able to just get hold of them and there should be informational training, courses beforehand.â Like driving a car, I suggest. ""Yes, not anyone can just drive a car, but in my opinion if you make guns harder to get for everyone, bad people can still get them. ""I think itâs all about your intent. My husbandâs family used a gun when an intruder broke in to their house with a gun for example.â The right for Americans to bear arms as outlined in the Second Amendment is something she truly believes is important. âI do think teachers should be armed with guns to protect classes,"" she added. Pratiksha GhildialReporting from Uvalde The drive to the town of Uvalde is lined with farmland and ranches. As you enter the town, US and Texas flags fly at half mast. A sign says âPray for Uvaldeâ. Itâs a very small community where everybody seems to know everybody. Just outside the Robb Elementary School, streets are lined with huge media trucks - all here to try to tell the story of the horror that unfolded inside this tiny school campus. People have been laying flowers as tributes. Texan police officers in khaki-grey uniforms and trademark hats are zealously guarding the school premises. But there is very little they can do heal the deep wounds that will be felt for generations to come. A child inspects a shotgun at the NRA's 2015 conference A statement has been released by the National Rifle Association (NRA) - the influential pro-gun lobbying group that resists new gun control measures. The four-sentence statement begins with ""deepest sympathies"" to the families and victims of ""this horrific and evil crime"". ""Although an investigation is under way and facts are still emerging, we recognise this was the act of a lone, deranged criminal,"" the statement continues. Officials in Texas have not yet said whether the gunman had any prior criminal history. The NRA adds that at their annual conference, taking place this weekend in Houston, members ""will reflect on these events, pray for the victimsâ¦ and pledge to redouble our commitment to making schools secure"". In President Biden's remarks on Tuesday night, he called out pro-gun groups, asking Americans: ""When in Godâs name are we going to stand up to the gun lobby?""

"Relatives of children at the school gathered at a nearby civic centre to wait for news Nineteen young children and two adults have died in a shooting at a primary school in south Texas. The gunman opened fire at Robb Elementary School - which teaches children aged seven to 10 - in the city of Uvalde before he was killed by law enforcement, officials said. The 18-year-old suspect had a handgun, an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle and high-capacity magazines, investigators say. The teenager is suspected of shooting his grandmother before the rampage. Local media report he may have been a high school student in the area. Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District Chief of Police Pete Arredondo said the shooting began at 11:32 local time on Tuesday, and that investigators believe the attacker ""did act alone during this heinous crime"". LIVE - latest updates, reaction and analysis TIMELINE - how a sunny school day ended in bloodshed â¢VICTIMS - tributes to children and teacher killed Texas Governor Greg Abbott said the shooter, whom he named as Salvador Ramos, abandoned a vehicle before entering the school to ""horrifically, incomprehensibly"" open fire. An Uvalde school district police officer, who worked at the school, saw Ramos emerge from the vehicle carrying a rifle and wearing body armour, according to Erick Estrada from the Texas Department of Public Safety, who was speaking to CNN. The officer ""engaged"" the suspect but was unable to stop him, Mr Estrada said. Two more officers from Uvalde Police Department also attempted to stop Ramos but were unable to do so, and called for back-up. Several of the children who died have been identified. Family members confirmed the deaths of 10-year-olds Xavier Lopez and Amerie Jo Garza in statements on Tuesday night. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Angel Garza said on Facebook that his daughter Amerie had been killed. ""My little love is now flying high with the angels above. Please don't take a second for granted. Hug your family. Tell them you love them,"" he said. The two adults who died were both teachers - Irma Garcia and Eva Mireles. According to the school district's website, Mrs Garcia is a mother-of-four and had been a teacher for 23 years. The same website says that Ms Mireles had been a teacher for 17 years, has a daughter in college and loved running and hiking. Nearly 500 pupils are enrolled in the predominantly Hispanic school around 85 miles (135km) west of the city of San Antonio. This video can not be played Biden: When ""are we going to stand up to the gun lobby?"" The Associated Press news agency reports that a US Border Patrol official who was nearby when the shooting began rushed into the school and shot and killed the gunman, who was behind a barricade. Border Patrol is a federal agency that guards US ports of entry. Uvalde, which is fewer than 80 miles from the border with Mexico, is home to a Border Patrol station. Two border agents were reportedly shot in an exchange with the gunman. One agent was shot in the head, officials say, adding that both were now in a stable condition in hospital. According to CBS News, the attacker was wearing body armour as he carried out the attack. Another 18-year-old who is suspected of attacking a grocery store in Buffalo, New York, on 14 May was also wearing body armour and carrying a semi-automatic rifle - both of which are commercially available in the US. The Uvalde Memorial Hospital posted on Facebook earlier that 13 children had been taken to hospital ""via ambulances or buses"". A 66-year-old woman and a 10-year-old girl were in a critical condition at a hospital in San Antonio, University Health hospital officials said. This is a profoundly shocking tragedy, yet in America it is also depressingly familiar. The grief and sympathy being expressed around the country is genuine. But no one is genuinely surprised that this could happen. There have already been 27 school shootings this year alone. Young school children routinely rehearse what to do if a gunman enters their classroom. It's only 10 days since 10 people were killed in a mass shooting in New York. Politicians recognise this a problem almost unique to America, where guns have overtaken car crashes as the leading cause of death for children and teenagers. But it's a problem that politics seem incapable of solving. Deeply entrenched views on gun control are not changed in response to events like the tragedy in Uvalde. ""Why do we keep letting this happen?"" asked President Biden. ""Why are we willing to live with this carnage?"" But there is no sign that Democrats will get any closer to passing tighter gun control legislation. Some Republicans are already accusing them of using this latest school shooting to cynically further their own political objectives. Robb Elementary School will join the roll call of school shootings along with Sandy Hook and the Parkland shooting. The killing of innocent schoolchildren has reignited the debate over guns in America, but has not brought it any closer to a resolution. As evening fell police remained outside the community centre in Uvalde braving an intense rainstorm. Earlier, cries and sobs could be heard from outside as family members who gathered there received the devastating news that their children had been killed. Others were asked to give DNA samples to help identify some of the young victims. Just a few blocks from the Robb Elementary school, a small vigil was held for the victims and survivors of the attack. Karla Bohman's voice cracked as she told the group about a family friend whose young daughter, a student at the school, was among those still unaccounted for. ""They don't know if she's in surgery or one of the fatalities, but they know she's a victim of some sort because she's missing,"" Bohman cried. ""I can't believe this."" Cheryl Juhasz, a lifelong resident of Uvalde, quietly wept during the prayer. ""You can't comprehend evil like this. No matter where it happens, but it's harder when it happens at home."" School district superintendent Hal Harrell said the school year had been ended early in the wake of the shooting. Community members wept at a vigil on Tuesday night In a speech from the White House, US President Joe Biden said he was ""sick and tired"" of responding to mass shootings, as he called for gun control. ""How many scores of little children who witnessed what happened - see their friends die, as if they're in a battlefield, for God's sake,"" he said. ""They'll live with it the rest of their lives."" He ordered that flags at the White House and other US federal buildings be flown at half-mast in honour of the victims in Uvalde. School shootings have become recurring emergencies in the US, with 26 recorded last year, according to EdWeek, an education trade publication. This video can not be played Watch: Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr condemns gun violence in the US Active shooter lockdown drills are a common part of the school curriculum, from primary to high school. The 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut was the deadliest such attack. Twenty of the 26 victims were between the ages of five and six. Speaking on the floor of the US Senate in Washington DC on Tuesday, Connecticut Democratic Senator Chris Murphy begged his colleagues to pass gun control legislation. ""These kids weren't unlucky,"" he said. ""This only happens in this country. Nowhere else, nowhere else do little kids go to school thinking that they might be shot that day."" But Texas Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican, rejected the calls for gun control. He said restricting the rights of ""law-abiding citizens... doesn't work. It's not effective. It doesn't prevent crime."" Guns overtook car crashes to become theleading cause of death for US children and teenagers in 2020, according to data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) last month. On Monday, an FBI report found that ""active shooter"" rampage attacks have doubled since the coronavirus began in 2020. Were you in the area? Did you witness the incident?

"The gunman who killed 19 children and two teachers at a Texas school had written on social media that he would carry out the attack Facebook's owner Meta said the 18-year-old suspect's messages were sent privately on the platform The attack happened on Tuesday at the Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, around 80 miles (129km) west of San Antonio The attacker does not appear to have had a criminal record or a history of mental health problems, Texas Governor Greg Abbott says Democratic candidate Beto O'Rourke was ejected from the briefing after confronting Abbott on gun laws President Biden says he will travel to Texas in the coming days, as he called for gun control: ""It's time for action"" The shooting victims were aged between seven and 10. Teachers Eva Mireles and Irma Garcia also died in the attack Edited by Jude Sheerin We're pausing our live coverage for now. If you're just joining us, or want a recap, here's the latest updates on the mass shooting in Uvalde, Texas where 19 children and two teachers were killed on Tuesday. John SudworthBBC News Dylan Hockley was six years old at the time of the Sandy Hook shooting Newtown, Connecticut, is a place that reminds you that the
threat of gun violence is everywhere in America. Set in forested hills, with the treeline punctuated by white
church steeples, a road runs from the centre of town past the pleasant New
England homes and across a stream to reach, in a few short minutes, the Sandy
Hook Elementary School. It was here, 10 years ago this December, that a 20-year-old
resident shot and killed 26 children and staff members before turning the gun
on himself. Today, Newtown's flag is at half mast, a gesture of empathy
from one place so deeply scarred by an inexplicable act of brutality to
another. Nicole Hockley is a founding member of the Sandy Hook
Promise Foundation and I meet her, sitting outside the office on a picnic table
in the warm spring sunshine, to talk about the tragedy in Uvalde, Texas almost
2000 miles away. Her six-year-old son, Dylan, was one of those murdered at
Sandy Hook. ""All shootings reopen wounds that - every time I think
are perhaps somewhat healed - are torn open again,"" she tells me. ""But because it is so hauntingly similar to what
happened at Sandy Hook School it hit closer to home in a way that I hadn't
expected, and I went into a state of shock."" A law enforcement source has confirmed that the shooter was not wearing body armour when he entered the school on his rampage. Early reports suggested the gunman had been wearing some kind of bulletproof vest. But the source told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that he was wearing a ""chest rig"" which is a carrier to hold magazines, similar to what military and law enforcement tactical teams wear. That appears to have been the source of confusion over whether he was armoured or not. Reports are emerging that onlookers, frustrated at the police's lack of action, urged officers to charge into Robb Elementary School where the shooting took place on Tuesday. Juan Carranza, who watched the scene from outside his house,told the Associated Press,externalthat women standing nearby shouted ""Go in there! Go in there!"" at police officers soon after the attack began. But they didn't go in, he said. Another witness, Javier Cazares - whose daughter was killed in the attack - said he had raised the idea of charging into the school with other bystanders. ""Let's just rush in because the cops aren't doing anything like they are supposed to,"" he said. ""More could have been done."" ""They were unprepared,"" he added. Reality Check The National Rifle Association (NRA) is a gun advocacy group which has significant influence in US politics -officially spending about $3m per year to influence gun policy,external, with considerable  additional sums spent indirectly. Each election cycle the NRA awards letter grades (between A and F) to each US politician running for office. The grades are based on a politicianâs gun advocacy record, including how outspoken theyâve been on gun rights and how theyâve voted on gun laws in the past. Over the last decade, these ratings have become increasingly split down party lines. In 2020, 94% of Republicans running for office were given an A grade by the NRA (the highest pro-gun category).  In that same year, 92% of Democrats had the lowest F grade. This has significantly changed over time.  In 2010, more than a quarter of Democrats running for office were given an A grade. By 2020, there was only one remaining Democrat in this group. The full list of NRA grades for the 2022 US midterms is yet to be published, but the ideological divide shows little sign of narrowing. Read more about the NRA and why it's so powerful.  CNN reports that minutes before the attack began, the gunman texted a girl who lives in Frankfurt, Germany, about his plans. Screenshots of messages reviewed by the cable network apparently show the suspect complaining to the girl about his grandmother being ""on the phone with [mobile phone carrier] AT&T about my phone."" ""It's annoying,"" he texted. CNN reports,externalthat six minutes later he texted the girl back: ""I just shot my grandma in her head."" Seconds later, he added: ""Ima go shoot up a elementary school rn [right now]."" The last message was sent at 11:21 in Texas - 11 minutes before the school shooting began. The girl told CNN she used to speak to the 18-year-old daily on FaceTime, and they also communicated via a livestreaming app called Yubo and on a gaming app named Plato. Law enforcement sources have told the BBC's US partner, CBS News, that preliminary information suggests the gunman shot his grandmother in the face after arguing with her about a mobile phone bill. Protesters held a vigil in front of the headquarters of the National Rifle Association gun lobby in Virginia Members of the Houston Astros bow their heads during a moment of silence before a game against Cleveland A makeshift memorial outside Robb Elementary School Mourners pray at a Catholic parish in Uvalde Beto O'Rourke, a Democrat running for governor, heckled his rival during a press conference A sign sends a message of grieving to Uvalde at an MLB game in Ohio Oasis Outback, the store where the gunman bought his weapons A local child hands flowers to an officer outside the school to add to the memorial site Angelica Casas and Chelsea BaileyBBC News, Uvalde The siblings of a murdered child place flowers at a makeshift memorial outside the school Ivan Arellano, 18, was set to graduate from Uvalde High School later this month. One day before the shooting, he and his fellow graduates donned their caps and gowns and walked through the hallways of Robb Elementary to a chorus of cheers from the students. ""That was the first hall we walked in,"" he tells the BBC, describing the location where 19 students were later gunned down by his former classmate. Arellano said he's gone to Uvalde High with the gunman since the eighth grade, but that recently, the teen simply stopped coming to school. Arellano remembered the gunman as an ""odd"" and ""antisocial"" person, who lacked friends and would often use ""fear and intimidation"" to try to scare his classmates. He also pushed back on media reports that the gunman was bullied. ""He would choose to bully people, and it just wouldn't work so he would just get angry,"" he said. ""He would just try to scare people and I guess this was his last way to scare people."" In a town this small, Arellano said everyone here knows someone who's been personally touched by this unfathomable tragedy. Looking back, he said he feels like the warning signs were there. ""A lot of people who knew him, we knew he wasn't mentally healthy,"" he said. ""And a lot of people could agree that we probably should've said something."" Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, Uvalde Mary Hernandez knew one of the teachers who died Mary Hernandez grew up near the school, and still comes back every day to check up on her mother. On Tuesday she was shocked to find police had taken over the neighbourhood, and horrified when she heard the number of children killed. âItâs devastating because this is a small community and everybody is touched because 19 families are mourning and youâll know some of these people,â she said. Mary knew one of the teachers who died, Irma Garcia. They were both Catholic and had worked together organising retreats for parishioners. âI couldnât believe it! She was a beautiful person, a beautiful soul - very caring: you could tell that she was a good teacher.â Mary supports stricter gun laws, although she tells me she feels sheâs in a minority. Mental health is also a problem, something the Texas governor stressed in his press conference today. But, Mary says, âthatâs a problem everywhere in the world. Why is it only in the US that we have mass shootings? Because guns are available.â âItâs not going to be easy and itâs not going to be soon,â she says when I ask how the community can recover. âThere are good people here, but we are now among the other massacres that have occurred in the United States.â With some of the victims âvery very young,â she says, âit touches everybody and it hurts everybody.â Nomia IqbalBBC News, Uvalde A US flag hangs from the ceiling next to the lone star flag of Texas in this arena. This is where rodeos usually take place but tonight itâs turned into a prayer vigil so people can grieve their profound loss. A stage is set for music and prayers which looks out to a few hundred people on the bleachers - they are sombre with some shedding tears. Many are wearing shirts that simply say ""Uvalde"". Community leaders stand on the stage and start the event with a hymn that people join in. Their opening words were âwe love you.â Republican leadership is here - Governor Greg Abbott and Senator Ted Cruz - who refuse to talk to the press when we approach them. Here, there is no mention of the familiar issue that is always sparked by horrific US shootings - gun control. Instead the vigil is focused on something else familiar in times like this - offering thoughts and prayers. Mexican President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador has sent a message of solidarity to the US in the wake of the Uvalde shooting. Speaking to journalists in his daily news briefing, LÃ³pez Obrador said that he wished to ""express my condolences, my pain, and my solidarity with the families of the young people that lost their lives yesterday. Iâm sending them a strong hug"". ""In our country, lamentably, this happens. It hurts us a lot that these disasters happen. We want to send a hug to the family members of the young people, the victims, and also our solidarity with the government of the United States,"" he added. ""These are very sad, very difficult moments. For us, itâs the same."" In a statement, the Mexican government said that consular officials in the town of Eagle Pass - about 60 miles from Uvalde - were working with local officials to determine whether any of the dead or wounded were Mexican nationals. The foreign ministry said it would release the number of any Mexican citizens involved once the information was confirmed by US authorities. A Texas student has been arrested after being found with an ""AK-47 style pistol"" and a ""replica AR-15 style"" rifle, police say. The arrest took place outside a high school in Richardson, over 350 miles (560 km) north of Uvalde. Police say a witness called 911 to report a person carrying a rifle outside Berkner High School. Police responded and located the gunman, a student. The firearms were found in his car and he was charged with unlawful carrying of weapons in a weapons-free school zone. No other information was released due to the suspect's age. It comes a day after the murder spree in Uvalde. An Uvalde resident stands vigil outside the school The mother of the teenager who killed 21 people at a Uvalde primary school has spoken about her son. ""My son wasn't a violent person. I'm surprised by what he did,"" Adriana Reyes told the Daily Mail from the hospital where her own mother is being treated for a gunshot wound to her face (the suspect shot his grandmother before attacking the school, local authorities say). Reyes denied reports that she had a toxic relationship with her son. ""I had a good relationship with him. He kept to himself; he didn't have many friends,"" she told the newspaper. Reyes, 39, also told NBC News: ""Iâm very upset about everything. A lot of stuff has happened, but right now I donât feel good."" Juan Alvarez, Reyes' boyfriend, told NBC the attacker was ""a weird one"". ""I never got along with him. I never socialised with him. He doesnât talk to nobody,â said Alvarez, 62. âWhen you try to talk to him heâd just sit there and walk away.â This video can not be played Beto O'Rourke heckles Texas Governor Greg Abbott over gun laws Beto O'Rourke, the Democratic challenger to Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott, interrupted a news conference hosted by Abbott on Wednesday. O'Rourke was escorted out of the building after heckling his political rival, and blaming him for the Uvalde shooting. He was seen speaking to reporters in English and Spanish afterwards about why he staged the interruption. O'Rourke and other Democrats have said the state's lax gun laws led to Tuesday's massacre. During the interruption, O'Rourke could be heard referring to a 2019 shooting in El Paso, Texas. He wrote on social media on Tuesday that Texas officials like Abbott should have taken action on gun control at the time, but did nothing. Angelica Casas and Chelsea BaileyBBC News, Uvalde Mickey Craddock treats children as a nurse practitioner in the Uvalde community Today, unlike most days, Mickey Craddock had to drive past caution tape and a police barricade to get out of her home. Craddock, a local nurse practitioner who's served the Uvalde community for the last decade, lives three doors down from the home where the teenage gunman stayed with his grandmother. She said she didn't know the family well, but remembers a quiet teenage boy who occasionally played basketball down the street. ""He was a regular teenage kid,"" she said, ""he was a troubled kid, and I could probably point out five or six of them in this community. ""People from bad backgrounds, drug backgrounds, you know, but we never thought anything like this would happen."" Despite the media circus, Craddock's neighbourhood is quiet today. Chickens and roosters roam freely through front yards decorated with high school graduation photos for a ceremony that has since been cancelled. Craddock said when she initially heard reports of shots fired at the school she thought ""stupid kids were shooting guns in the air"" to celebrate the end of the school year. It wasn't until later she found out one of her colleagues at the clinic lost a child in the shooting that killed at least 19 children less than a mile away. ""I took care of half of those kids from the time they were babies,"" she said, her voice breaking. The killer, she says, ""had the tools that took out a whole bunch of children"". Sarah SmithNorth America Editor The state senator for the district that covers Uvalde, Roland Gutierrez, a Democrat, was visibly upset and very angry as he told me that something has
to be done about access to semi-automatic weapons in America. He said he couldnât imagine what people in other countries must think of the US when they see tragic incidents like this happening, and he
seemed to be struggling to understand why it is that an 18-year-old is allowed
to buy, legally, a semi-automatic weapon that can cause this type of carnage. He also said he does understand peopleâs commitment to the Second Amendment - their right to bear arms - and recognises that this is a rural
hunting community and his constituents are very wedded to their weapons. He just doesnât understand why military-style rifles are
allowed on the streets legally in America and hopes this
incident may change that. But he didnât seem optimistic that political change
was coming. Nomia IqbalReporting from Uvalde Hope Robinson Hope Robinson, 24, lives an hour away from Uvalde and came by to pay her respects. She is from a conservative family and says that âguns can be a force of good in the right handsâ. âMy husband is very pro-guns and I did say to him 'did this shake him?'. And he said 'a little'. ""But for me itâs about guns being in the right hands. I donât think anyone should be able to just get hold of them and there should be informational training, courses beforehand.â Like driving a car, I suggest. ""Yes, not anyone can just drive a car, but in my opinion if you make guns harder to get for everyone, bad people can still get them. ""I think itâs all about your intent. My husbandâs family used a gun when an intruder broke in to their house with a gun for example.â The right for Americans to bear arms as outlined in the Second Amendment is something she truly believes is important. âI do think teachers should be armed with guns to protect classes,"" she added. Pratiksha GhildialReporting from Uvalde The drive to the town of Uvalde is lined with farmland and ranches. As you enter the town, US and Texas flags fly at half mast. A sign says âPray for Uvaldeâ. Itâs a very small community where everybody seems to know everybody. Just outside the Robb Elementary School, streets are lined with huge media trucks - all here to try to tell the story of the horror that unfolded inside this tiny school campus. People have been laying flowers as tributes. Texan police officers in khaki-grey uniforms and trademark hats are zealously guarding the school premises. But there is very little they can do heal the deep wounds that will be felt for generations to come. A child inspects a shotgun at the NRA's 2015 conference A statement has been released by the National Rifle Association (NRA) - the influential pro-gun lobbying group that resists new gun control measures. The four-sentence statement begins with ""deepest sympathies"" to the families and victims of ""this horrific and evil crime"". ""Although an investigation is under way and facts are still emerging, we recognise this was the act of a lone, deranged criminal,"" the statement continues. Officials in Texas have not yet said whether the gunman had any prior criminal history. The NRA adds that at their annual conference, taking place this weekend in Houston, members ""will reflect on these events, pray for the victimsâ¦ and pledge to redouble our commitment to making schools secure"".

"Old versus new: Leah's mum says the new one, pictured right, has given her renewed hope her daughter might be found Missing persons posters and billboards have been revamped, with experts turning to science and technology to make them more memorable. The charity Missing People hopes the changes will make the public more likely to engage and take action The posters carry a 3D image of the person and a QR code which shows them laughing and smiling when scanned. The mother of missing Leah Croucher called the new posters ""amazing"" and said they give them renewed hope. Leah was 19 when she went missing from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, on 15 February, 2019. Her mother, Claire Croucher, said ""One of the many challenges as a parent of a missing person is trying to communicate who you've lost. ""We feel that if the public were to understand who our daughter is, they are more likely to remember seeing or meeting her."" It is hoped that the 3D images and smiling faces will humanise the missing person and the aminated characteristics and gestures will make them more memorable to passers-by. The idea is that people might notify friends on social media and share relevant details like background maps of where the person was last seen. One of the most noticeable differences between the new and the old posters is the absence of the word ""missing"". This has been replaced with the more active phrase ""help find"" which the behavioural scientists behind the posters say is more likely to get people to take action. The posters will appear on billboards across London on 25 May to mark Missing Children's Day, and the new format will be used by the charity for all new posters after that. Finn Layland-Stratfield was 17 when he went missing from Tintagel, Cornwall, in 2017 The research for the new posters was compiled by experts Influence at Work, led by Steve Martin, the director of behavioural science at Columbia University's Graduate Business School. ""It takes a village to find a missing person,"" said Mr Martin. ""So, even if a couple of dozen extra people see that image, they connect with it, they feel some empathy towards it, that could make the difference."" Jo Youle, chief executive of Missing People, said their appeals were a hugely important way to reach the public, to help find children. ""By embracing innovation, we hope the new appeals will have an even greater impact and lead to those featured being found safely.""

"The US is cutting off another financial route for Russia to pay its international debts, a move that could push the country closer to default. The US Treasury Department said it would end a waiver that had allowed US bondholders to accept payments, tightening sanctions imposed over the war in Ukraine. Russia, which is rich from its oil and gas supplies, has the funds to pay. It has already signalled plans to contest any declaration of default. The country has almost $2 billion worth of payments that will be due up to the end of the year on its international bonds. While the new rules only apply to people in the US, they will make it difficult for Russia to make payments elsewhere given the role of US banks in the global financial system. What pain lies ahead for Russia's economy? Russia beats final deadline to avoid debt default The US had already barred Russia from using US banks to transfer payments. In comments last week, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned the waiver for investors was likely to expire. She said the exemption had been intended to allow an ""orderly transition"". Analysts have said they do not expect major ramifications from the move outside of Russia, with IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva saying in March that exposure to the holdings was ""not systemically relevant"". Russia's debt was alreadydowngraded to""junk status"" by major ratings agenciesin March, a move that disqualifies it from purchases by major investors, making it difficult for Russia to raise money on international markets. Professor Philip Nichols of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania said it's not clear what Western holders of Russian bonds have done in the weeks since the invasion, whether rushing to offload them or holding on in hopes the situation will eventually normalise. A default would mark the first time Russia has failed to pay its government debt since 1998 - the economic crisis at the end of then President Yeltsin's term in office. It would likely trigger a court case, opening up Russia to recovery proceedings from creditors. Inside Russia, any impact would be felt only over the long term as part of the country's wider economic isolation, Prof Nichols said. ""Russia just has a lot of oil and gas and that translates into a lot of money, but in the long-run, this is part of a web of instruments that are designed to make it far, far more difficult for Russia to wage war on its neighbours,"" he said. ""It's going to be really interesting to see what happens,"" Prof Nichols said. What pain lies ahead for Russia's economy?

"Marks & Spencer says it is moving away from town centres, as it saw online sales for clothes and homeware jump. The chain said the shift to online shopping during the pandemic had ""increased the imperative"" to reduce its clothing and home trading space. Many town centres had ""lost impetus"" due to ""failed local authority or government policy"", M&S said. It said it was now relocating some shops from older, multi-floor buildings with poor access and parking. ""As a result, a high proportion, but not all, of our relocations are to the edge of town,"" the retail giant said. M&S said it was planning around 15 new full-line stores and 40 new food stores over the next three years. The company said it was investing in a number of stores which had been relocated to the edges of towns, including to former Debenhams sites in Leamington Spa and Thurrock. It is part of a long-term plan to overhaul its large stores. The shake-up will eventually see the closure of some 110 main stores as it focuses on fewer but better locations. A total of 68 of these main-line stores have already shut and the retailer confirmed another 32 will go over the next three years. Boss Steve Rowe told reporters M&S was ""moving with the customer, where the customer is working and shopping"". He said the chain had ""some fabulous city and town centre stores"" but it had to ensure its portfolio was ""balanced"" and there would be more of a bias towards food in the future. M&S warns online sales tax will damage High Street M&S says recovery plan boosting sales and profits Announcing its results for last year, M&S, which is turning its business around after years of decline, said it had seen strong performance in its clothing and home operation. This was driven by a 55.6% surge in online sales. However, in-store sales fell by 11.2%. Meanwhile, its food sales were up by 10.1%. Overall, the company reported pre-tax profits of Â£392m for the year to 2 April - up from a loss of Â£209m the previous year. However, M&S said it expected sales growth to slow due to rising costs and increased pressure on customer budgets. The company said it was facing increased food costs, driven by global supply issues and labour shortages, while factory, transport and freight costs, as well as continued supply issues in China, were putting pressure on its clothing and home business. Julie Palmer, a retail expert at Begbies Traynor, said the typical M&S customer tended to be wealthier and less hard hit by rising costs ""but they could still choose to economise"" . ""How long cash-strapped shoppers will feel comfortable splashing out on M&S's upmarket foods remains to be seen,"" she added. Household budgets are being squeezed by rising food, energy and fuel bills,with inflation, the rate at which prices rise, hitting 9% in April- the highest level for 40 years. Also on Wednesday, online grocer Ocado warned that its joint venture with M&S will see earnings and sales weighed down by growing pressure on customers' spending. Ocado Retail, an online retail business which is owned 50-50 by the two companies, said consumers are ordering ""one or two fewer items per shop"" against the backdrop of a growing cost of living crisis. Chief executive Steve Rowe is handing over the reins today after 40 years at M&S, starting as a Saturday boy in Croydon. The business is certainly in better shape now than when he started the top job in 2016. Reviving the fortunes of this household name is still a work in progress, though. Although M&S has managed to finally arrest the decline in clothing and home sales, fashion sales in its shops are still 25% below where they were four years ago. M&S wants fewer and better big stores as we shop more online and has already been making some big changes. Today it said it was shifting away from town centre shops to more modern edge-of-town sites, taking a swipe at what it calls ""failed local authority and government policy"". This new focus will likely send a shudder through the High Streets set to be affected. The new leadership team at M&S will also have to steer the business through the cost of living crisis with soaring inflation and consumers tightening their belts. The company also announced it would pull out of Russia altogether, resulting in a Â£31m cost. M&S, which was criticised for not leaving the country at the start of the war in Ukraine, stopped shipments to Russia in March but previously said complex franchise deals prevented it from withdrawing completely. The retailer opened its first store in Russia in 2005. Its Russian arm is run by Turkish company FiBA, which operates 48 shops under the M&S banner in the country with 1,200 employees. Chief executive Mr Rowe is handing over leadership of M&S to Stuart Machin and Katie Bickerstaffe after running the company's turnaround for the past six years. The cost-cutting programme saw the closure of a number of M&S's clothing and homeware shops, with others converted into food stores, after disappointing fashion sales. In 2020 the company also announced thousands of jobs cutsafter the business was hit by Covid lockdowns.

"The gunman who killed 19 children and two teachers at a Texas school had written on social media that he would carry out the attack Facebook's owner Meta said the 18-year-old suspect's messages were sent privately on the platform The attack happened on Tuesday at the Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, around 80 miles (129km) west of San Antonio The attacker does not appear to have had a criminal record or a history of mental health problems, Texas Governor Greg Abbott says Democratic candidate Beto O'Rourke was ejected from the briefing after confronting Abbott on gun laws President Biden says he will travel to Texas in the coming days, as he called for gun control: ""It's time for action"" The shooting victims were aged between seven and 10. Teachers Eva Mireles and Irma Garcia also died in the attack Edited by Jude Sheerin We're pausing our live coverage for now. If you're just joining us, or want a recap, here's the latest updates on the mass shooting in Uvalde, Texas where 19 children and two teachers were killed on Tuesday. John SudworthBBC News Dylan Hockley was six years old at the time of the Sandy Hook shooting Newtown, Connecticut, is a place that reminds you that the
threat of gun violence is everywhere in America. Set in forested hills, with the treeline punctuated by white
church steeples, a road runs from the centre of town past the pleasant New
England homes and across a stream to reach, in a few short minutes, the Sandy
Hook Elementary School. It was here, 10 years ago this December, that a 20-year-old
resident shot and killed 26 children and staff members before turning the gun
on himself. Today, Newtown's flag is at half mast, a gesture of empathy
from one place so deeply scarred by an inexplicable act of brutality to
another. Nicole Hockley is a founding member of the Sandy Hook
Promise Foundation and I meet her, sitting outside the office on a picnic table
in the warm spring sunshine, to talk about the tragedy in Uvalde, Texas almost
2000 miles away. Her six-year-old son, Dylan, was one of those murdered at
Sandy Hook. ""All shootings reopen wounds that - every time I think
are perhaps somewhat healed - are torn open again,"" she tells me. ""But because it is so hauntingly similar to what
happened at Sandy Hook School it hit closer to home in a way that I hadn't
expected, and I went into a state of shock."" A law enforcement source has confirmed that the shooter was not wearing body armour when he entered the school on his rampage. Early reports suggested the gunman had been wearing some kind of bulletproof vest. But the source told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that he was wearing a ""chest rig"" which is a carrier to hold magazines, similar to what military and law enforcement tactical teams wear. That appears to have been the source of confusion over whether he was armoured or not. Reports are emerging that onlookers, frustrated at the police's lack of action, urged officers to charge into Robb Elementary School where the shooting took place on Tuesday. Juan Carranza, who watched the scene from outside his house,told the Associated Press,externalthat women standing nearby shouted ""Go in there! Go in there!"" at police officers soon after the attack began. But they didn't go in, he said. Another witness, Javier Cazares - whose daughter was killed in the attack - said he had raised the idea of charging into the school with other bystanders. ""Let's just rush in because the cops aren't doing anything like they are supposed to,"" he said. ""More could have been done."" ""They were unprepared,"" he added. Reality Check The National Rifle Association (NRA) is a gun advocacy group which has significant influence in US politics -officially spending about $3m per year to influence gun policy,external, with considerable  additional sums spent indirectly. Each election cycle the NRA awards letter grades (between A and F) to each US politician running for office. The grades are based on a politicianâs gun advocacy record, including how outspoken theyâve been on gun rights and how theyâve voted on gun laws in the past. Over the last decade, these ratings have become increasingly split down party lines. In 2020, 94% of Republicans running for office were given an A grade by the NRA (the highest pro-gun category).  In that same year, 92% of Democrats had the lowest F grade. This has significantly changed over time.  In 2010, more than a quarter of Democrats running for office were given an A grade. By 2020, there was only one remaining Democrat in this group. The full list of NRA grades for the 2022 US midterms is yet to be published, but the ideological divide shows little sign of narrowing. Read more about the NRA and why it's so powerful.  CNN reports that minutes before the attack began, the gunman texted a girl who lives in Frankfurt, Germany, about his plans. Screenshots of messages reviewed by the cable network apparently show the suspect complaining to the girl about his grandmother being ""on the phone with [mobile phone carrier] AT&T about my phone."" ""It's annoying,"" he texted. CNN reports,externalthat six minutes later he texted the girl back: ""I just shot my grandma in her head."" Seconds later, he added: ""Ima go shoot up a elementary school rn [right now]."" The last message was sent at 11:21 in Texas - 11 minutes before the school shooting began. The girl told CNN she used to speak to the 18-year-old daily on FaceTime, and they also communicated via a livestreaming app called Yubo and on a gaming app named Plato. Law enforcement sources have told the BBC's US partner, CBS News, that preliminary information suggests the gunman shot his grandmother in the face after arguing with her about a mobile phone bill. Protesters held a vigil in front of the headquarters of the National Rifle Association gun lobby in Virginia Members of the Houston Astros bow their heads during a moment of silence before a game against Cleveland A makeshift memorial outside Robb Elementary School Mourners pray at a Catholic parish in Uvalde Beto O'Rourke, a Democrat running for governor, heckled his rival during a press conference A sign sends a message of grieving to Uvalde at an MLB game in Ohio Oasis Outback, the store where the gunman bought his weapons A local child hands flowers to an officer outside the school to add to the memorial site Angelica Casas and Chelsea BaileyBBC News, Uvalde The siblings of a murdered child place flowers at a makeshift memorial outside the school Ivan Arellano, 18, was set to graduate from Uvalde High School later this month. One day before the shooting, he and his fellow graduates donned their caps and gowns and walked through the hallways of Robb Elementary to a chorus of cheers from the students. ""That was the first hall we walked in,"" he tells the BBC, describing the location where 19 students were later gunned down by his former classmate. Arellano said he's gone to Uvalde High with the gunman since the eighth grade, but that recently, the teen simply stopped coming to school. Arellano remembered the gunman as an ""odd"" and ""antisocial"" person, who lacked friends and would often use ""fear and intimidation"" to try to scare his classmates. He also pushed back on media reports that the gunman was bullied. ""He would choose to bully people, and it just wouldn't work so he would just get angry,"" he said. ""He would just try to scare people and I guess this was his last way to scare people."" In a town this small, Arellano said everyone here knows someone who's been personally touched by this unfathomable tragedy. Looking back, he said he feels like the warning signs were there. ""A lot of people who knew him, we knew he wasn't mentally healthy,"" he said. ""And a lot of people could agree that we probably should've said something."" Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, Uvalde Mary Hernandez knew one of the teachers who died Mary Hernandez grew up near the school, and still comes back every day to check up on her mother. On Tuesday she was shocked to find police had taken over the neighbourhood, and horrified when she heard the number of children killed. âItâs devastating because this is a small community and everybody is touched because 19 families are mourning and youâll know some of these people,â she said. Mary knew one of the teachers who died, Irma Garcia. They were both Catholic and had worked together organising retreats for parishioners. âI couldnât believe it! She was a beautiful person, a beautiful soul - very caring: you could tell that she was a good teacher.â Mary supports stricter gun laws, although she tells me she feels sheâs in a minority. Mental health is also a problem, something the Texas governor stressed in his press conference today. But, Mary says, âthatâs a problem everywhere in the world. Why is it only in the US that we have mass shootings? Because guns are available.â âItâs not going to be easy and itâs not going to be soon,â she says when I ask how the community can recover. âThere are good people here, but we are now among the other massacres that have occurred in the United States.â With some of the victims âvery very young,â she says, âit touches everybody and it hurts everybody.â Nomia IqbalBBC News, Uvalde A US flag hangs from the ceiling next to the lone star flag of Texas in this arena. This is where rodeos usually take place but tonight itâs turned into a prayer vigil so people can grieve their profound loss. A stage is set for music and prayers which looks out to a few hundred people on the bleachers - they are sombre with some shedding tears. Many are wearing shirts that simply say ""Uvalde"". Community leaders stand on the stage and start the event with a hymn that people join in. Their opening words were âwe love you.â Republican leadership is here - Governor Greg Abbott and Senator Ted Cruz - who refuse to talk to the press when we approach them. Here, there is no mention of the familiar issue that is always sparked by horrific US shootings - gun control. Instead the vigil is focused on something else familiar in times like this - offering thoughts and prayers. Mexican President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador has sent a message of solidarity to the US in the wake of the Uvalde shooting. Speaking to journalists in his daily news briefing, LÃ³pez Obrador said that he wished to ""express my condolences, my pain, and my solidarity with the families of the young people that lost their lives yesterday. Iâm sending them a strong hug"". ""In our country, lamentably, this happens. It hurts us a lot that these disasters happen. We want to send a hug to the family members of the young people, the victims, and also our solidarity with the government of the United States,"" he added. ""These are very sad, very difficult moments. For us, itâs the same."" In a statement, the Mexican government said that consular officials in the town of Eagle Pass - about 60 miles from Uvalde - were working with local officials to determine whether any of the dead or wounded were Mexican nationals. The foreign ministry said it would release the number of any Mexican citizens involved once the information was confirmed by US authorities. A Texas student has been arrested after being found with an ""AK-47 style pistol"" and a ""replica AR-15 style"" rifle, police say. The arrest took place outside a high school in Richardson, over 350 miles (560 km) north of Uvalde. Police say a witness called 911 to report a person carrying a rifle outside Berkner High School. Police responded and located the gunman, a student. The firearms were found in his car and he was charged with unlawful carrying of weapons in a weapons-free school zone. No other information was released due to the suspect's age. It comes a day after the murder spree in Uvalde. An Uvalde resident stands vigil outside the school The mother of the teenager who killed 21 people at a Uvalde primary school has spoken about her son. ""My son wasn't a violent person. I'm surprised by what he did,"" Adriana Reyes told the Daily Mail from the hospital where her own mother is being treated for a gunshot wound to her face (the suspect shot his grandmother before attacking the school, local authorities say). Reyes denied reports that she had a toxic relationship with her son. ""I had a good relationship with him. He kept to himself; he didn't have many friends,"" she told the newspaper. Reyes, 39, also told NBC News: ""Iâm very upset about everything. A lot of stuff has happened, but right now I donât feel good."" Juan Alvarez, Reyes' boyfriend, told NBC the attacker was ""a weird one"". ""I never got along with him. I never socialised with him. He doesnât talk to nobody,â said Alvarez, 62. âWhen you try to talk to him heâd just sit there and walk away.â This video can not be played Beto O'Rourke heckles Texas Governor Greg Abbott over gun laws Beto O'Rourke, the Democratic challenger to Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott, interrupted a news conference hosted by Abbott on Wednesday. O'Rourke was escorted out of the building after heckling his political rival, and blaming him for the Uvalde shooting. He was seen speaking to reporters in English and Spanish afterwards about why he staged the interruption. O'Rourke and other Democrats have said the state's lax gun laws led to Tuesday's massacre. During the interruption, O'Rourke could be heard referring to a 2019 shooting in El Paso, Texas. He wrote on social media on Tuesday that Texas officials like Abbott should have taken action on gun control at the time, but did nothing. Angelica Casas and Chelsea BaileyBBC News, Uvalde Mickey Craddock treats children as a nurse practitioner in the Uvalde community Today, unlike most days, Mickey Craddock had to drive past caution tape and a police barricade to get out of her home. Craddock, a local nurse practitioner who's served the Uvalde community for the last decade, lives three doors down from the home where the teenage gunman stayed with his grandmother. She said she didn't know the family well, but remembers a quiet teenage boy who occasionally played basketball down the street. ""He was a regular teenage kid,"" she said, ""he was a troubled kid, and I could probably point out five or six of them in this community. ""People from bad backgrounds, drug backgrounds, you know, but we never thought anything like this would happen."" Despite the media circus, Craddock's neighbourhood is quiet today. Chickens and roosters roam freely through front yards decorated with high school graduation photos for a ceremony that has since been cancelled. Craddock said when she initially heard reports of shots fired at the school she thought ""stupid kids were shooting guns in the air"" to celebrate the end of the school year. It wasn't until later she found out one of her colleagues at the clinic lost a child in the shooting that killed at least 19 children less than a mile away. ""I took care of half of those kids from the time they were babies,"" she said, her voice breaking. The killer, she says, ""had the tools that took out a whole bunch of children"". Sarah SmithNorth America Editor The state senator for the district that covers Uvalde, Roland Gutierrez, a Democrat, was visibly upset and very angry as he told me that something has
to be done about access to semi-automatic weapons in America. He said he couldnât imagine what people in other countries must think of the US when they see tragic incidents like this happening, and he
seemed to be struggling to understand why it is that an 18-year-old is allowed
to buy, legally, a semi-automatic weapon that can cause this type of carnage. He also said he does understand peopleâs commitment to the Second Amendment - their right to bear arms - and recognises that this is a rural
hunting community and his constituents are very wedded to their weapons. He just doesnât understand why military-style rifles are
allowed on the streets legally in America and hopes this
incident may change that. But he didnât seem optimistic that political change
was coming. Nomia IqbalReporting from Uvalde Hope Robinson Hope Robinson, 24, lives an hour away from Uvalde and came by to pay her respects. She is from a conservative family and says that âguns can be a force of good in the right handsâ. âMy husband is very pro-guns and I did say to him 'did this shake him?'. And he said 'a little'. ""But for me itâs about guns being in the right hands. I donât think anyone should be able to just get hold of them and there should be informational training, courses beforehand.â Like driving a car, I suggest. ""Yes, not anyone can just drive a car, but in my opinion if you make guns harder to get for everyone, bad people can still get them. ""I think itâs all about your intent. My husbandâs family used a gun when an intruder broke in to their house with a gun for example.â The right for Americans to bear arms as outlined in the Second Amendment is something she truly believes is important. âI do think teachers should be armed with guns to protect classes,"" she added. Pratiksha GhildialReporting from Uvalde The drive to the town of Uvalde is lined with farmland and ranches. As you enter the town, US and Texas flags fly at half mast. A sign says âPray for Uvaldeâ. Itâs a very small community where everybody seems to know everybody. Just outside the Robb Elementary School, streets are lined with huge media trucks - all here to try to tell the story of the horror that unfolded inside this tiny school campus. People have been laying flowers as tributes. Texan police officers in khaki-grey uniforms and trademark hats are zealously guarding the school premises. But there is very little they can do heal the deep wounds that will be felt for generations to come. A child inspects a shotgun at the NRA's 2015 conference A statement has been released by the National Rifle Association (NRA) - the influential pro-gun lobbying group that resists new gun control measures. The four-sentence statement begins with ""deepest sympathies"" to the families and victims of ""this horrific and evil crime"". ""Although an investigation is under way and facts are still emerging, we recognise this was the act of a lone, deranged criminal,"" the statement continues. Officials in Texas have not yet said whether the gunman had any prior criminal history. The NRA adds that at their annual conference, taking place this weekend in Houston, members ""will reflect on these events, pray for the victimsâ¦ and pledge to redouble our commitment to making schools secure"". In President Biden's remarks on Tuesday night, he called out pro-gun groups, asking Americans: ""When in Godâs name are we going to stand up to the gun lobby?""

""Let's just rush in because the cops aren't doing anything like they are supposed to,"" he said. ""More could have been done."" ""They were unprepared,"" he added. Reality Check The National Rifle Association (NRA) is a gun advocacy group which has significant influence in US politics -officially spending about $3m per year to influence gun policy,external, with considerable  additional sums spent indirectly. Each election cycle the NRA awards letter grades (between A and F) to each US politician running for office. The grades are based on a politicianâs gun advocacy record, including how outspoken theyâve been on gun rights and how theyâve voted on gun laws in the past. Over the last decade, these ratings have become increasingly split down party lines. In 2020, 94% of Republicans running for office were given an A grade by the NRA (the highest pro-gun category).  In that same year, 92% of Democrats had the lowest F grade. This has significantly changed over time.  In 2010, more than a quarter of Democrats running for office were given an A grade. By 2020, there was only one remaining Democrat in this group. The full list of NRA grades for the 2022 US midterms is yet to be published, but the ideological divide shows little sign of narrowing. Read more about the NRA and why it's so powerful.  CNN reports that minutes before the attack began, the gunman texted a girl who lives in Frankfurt, Germany, about his plans. Screenshots of messages reviewed by the cable network apparently show the suspect complaining to the girl about his grandmother being ""on the phone with [mobile phone carrier] AT&T about my phone."" ""It's annoying,"" he texted. CNN reports,externalthat six minutes later he texted the girl back: ""I just shot my grandma in her head."" Seconds later, he added: ""Ima go shoot up a elementary school rn [right now]."" The last message was sent at 11:21 in Texas - 11 minutes before the school shooting began. The girl told CNN she used to speak to the 18-year-old daily on FaceTime, and they also communicated via a livestreaming app called Yubo and on a gaming app named Plato. Law enforcement sources have told the BBC's US partner, CBS News, that preliminary information suggests the gunman shot his grandmother in the face after arguing with her about a mobile phone bill.

One day before the shooting, he and his fellow graduates donned their caps and gowns and walked through the hallways of Robb Elementary to a chorus of cheers from the students. ""That was the first hall we walked in,"" he tells the BBC, describing the location where 19 students were later gunned down by his former classmate. Arellano said he's gone to Uvalde High with the gunman since the eighth grade, but that recently, the teen simply stopped coming to school. Arellano remembered the gunman as an ""odd"" and ""antisocial"" person, who lacked friends and would often use ""fear and intimidation"" to try to scare his classmates. He also pushed back on media reports that the gunman was bullied. ""He would choose to bully people, and it just wouldn't work so he would just get angry,"" he said. ""He would just try to scare people and I guess this was his last way to scare people."" In a town this small, Arellano said everyone here knows someone who's been personally touched by this unfathomable tragedy. Looking back, he said he feels like the warning signs were there. ""A lot of people who knew him, we knew he wasn't mentally healthy,"" he said. ""And a lot of people could agree that we probably should've said something."" Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, Uvalde Mary Hernandez knew one of the teachers who died Mary Hernandez grew up near the school, and still comes back every day to check up on her mother. On Tuesday she was shocked to find police had taken over the neighbourhood, and horrified when she heard the number of children killed. âItâs devastating because this is a small community and everybody is touched because 19 families are mourning and youâll know some of these people,â she said. Mary knew one of the teachers who died, Irma Garcia. They were both Catholic and had worked together organising retreats for parishioners. âI couldnât believe it! She was a beautiful person, a beautiful soul - very caring: you could tell that she was a good teacher.â Mary supports stricter gun laws, although she tells me she feels sheâs in a minority. Mental health is also a problem, something the Texas governor stressed in his press conference today. But, Mary says, âthatâs a problem everywhere in the world. Why is it only in the US that we have mass shootings? Because guns are available.â âItâs not going to be easy and itâs not going to be soon,â she says when I ask how the community can recover. âThere are good people here, but we are now among the other massacres that have occurred in the United States.â With some of the victims âvery very young,â she says, âit touches everybody and it hurts everybody.â Nomia IqbalBBC News, Uvalde A US flag hangs from the ceiling next to the lone star flag of Texas in this arena. This is where rodeos usually take place but tonight itâs turned into a prayer vigil so people can grieve their profound loss. A stage is set for music and prayers which looks out to a few hundred people on the bleachers - they are sombre with some shedding tears. Many are wearing shirts that simply say ""Uvalde"". Community leaders stand on the stage and start the event with a hymn that people join in. Their opening words were âwe love you.â Republican leadership is here - Governor Greg Abbott and Senator Ted Cruz - who refuse to talk to the press when we approach them. Here, there is no mention of the familiar issue that is always sparked by horrific US shootings - gun control. Instead the vigil is focused on something else familiar in times like this - offering thoughts and prayers. Mexican President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador has sent a message of solidarity to the US in the wake of the Uvalde shooting. Speaking to journalists in his daily news briefing, LÃ³pez Obrador said that he wished to ""express my condolences, my pain, and my solidarity with the families of the young people that lost their lives yesterday. Iâm sending them a strong hug"". ""In our country, lamentably, this happens. It hurts us a lot that these disasters happen. We want to send a hug to the family members of the young people, the victims, and also our solidarity with the government of the United States,"" he added. ""These are very sad, very difficult moments. For us, itâs the same."" In a statement, the Mexican government said that consular officials in the town of Eagle Pass - about 60 miles from Uvalde - were working with local officials to determine whether any of the dead or wounded were Mexican nationals. The foreign ministry said it would release the number of any Mexican citizens involved once the information was confirmed by US authorities. A Texas student has been arrested after being found with an ""AK-47 style pistol"" and a ""replica AR-15 style"" rifle, police say. The arrest took place outside a high school in Richardson, over 350 miles (560 km) north of Uvalde. Police say a witness called 911 to report a person carrying a rifle outside Berkner High School. Police responded and located the gunman, a student. The firearms were found in his car and he was charged with unlawful carrying of weapons in a weapons-free school zone. No other information was released due to the suspect's age. It comes a day after the murder spree in Uvalde. An Uvalde resident stands vigil outside the school The mother of the teenager who killed 21 people at a Uvalde primary school has spoken about her son. ""My son wasn't a violent person. I'm surprised by what he did,"" Adriana Reyes told the Daily Mail from the hospital where her own mother is being treated for a gunshot wound to her face (the suspect shot his grandmother before attacking the school, local authorities say). Reyes denied reports that she had a toxic relationship with her son. ""I had a good relationship with him. He kept to himself; he didn't have many friends,"" she told the newspaper. Reyes, 39, also told NBC News: ""Iâm very upset about everything. A lot of stuff has happened, but right now I donât feel good."" Juan Alvarez, Reyes' boyfriend, told NBC the attacker was ""a weird one"". ""I never got along with him. I never socialised with him. He doesnât talk to nobody,â said Alvarez, 62. âWhen you try to talk to him heâd just sit there and walk away.â This video can not be played Beto O'Rourke heckles Texas Governor Greg Abbott over gun laws Beto O'Rourke, the Democratic challenger to Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott, interrupted a news conference hosted by Abbott on Wednesday. O'Rourke was escorted out of the building after heckling his political rival, and blaming him for the Uvalde shooting. He was seen speaking to reporters in English and Spanish afterwards about why he staged the interruption. O'Rourke and other Democrats have said the state's lax gun laws led to Tuesday's massacre. During the interruption, O'Rourke could be heard referring to a 2019 shooting in El Paso, Texas. He wrote on social media on Tuesday that Texas officials like Abbott should have taken action on gun control at the time, but did nothing. Angelica Casas and Chelsea BaileyBBC News, Uvalde Mickey Craddock treats children as a nurse practitioner in the Uvalde community Today, unlike most days, Mickey Craddock had to drive past caution tape and a police barricade to get out of her home. Craddock, a local nurse practitioner who's served the Uvalde community for the last decade, lives three doors down from the home where the teenage gunman stayed with his grandmother. She said she didn't know the family well, but remembers a quiet teenage boy who occasionally played basketball down the street. ""He was a regular teenage kid,"" she said, ""he was a troubled kid, and I could probably point out five or six of them in this community. ""People from bad backgrounds, drug backgrounds, you know, but we never thought anything like this would happen."" Despite the media circus, Craddock's neighbourhood is quiet today. Chickens and roosters roam freely through front yards decorated with high school graduation photos for a ceremony that has since been cancelled. Craddock said when she initially heard reports of shots fired at the school she thought ""stupid kids were shooting guns in the air"" to celebrate the end of the school year. It wasn't until later she found out one of her colleagues at the clinic lost a child in the shooting that killed at least 19 children less than a mile away. ""I took care of half of those kids from the time they were babies,"" she said, her voice breaking. The killer, she says, ""had the tools that took out a whole bunch of children"". Sarah SmithNorth America Editor The state senator for the district that covers Uvalde, Roland Gutierrez, a Democrat, was visibly upset and very angry as he told me that something has
to be done about access to semi-automatic weapons in America. He said he couldnât imagine what people in other countries must think of the US when they see tragic incidents like this happening, and he
seemed to be struggling to understand why it is that an 18-year-old is allowed
to buy, legally, a semi-automatic weapon that can cause this type of carnage. He also said he does understand peopleâs commitment to the Second Amendment - their right to bear arms - and recognises that this is a rural
hunting community and his constituents are very wedded to their weapons. He just doesnât understand why military-style rifles are
allowed on the streets legally in America and hopes this
incident may change that. But he didnât seem optimistic that political change
was coming. Nomia IqbalReporting from Uvalde Hope Robinson Hope Robinson, 24, lives an hour away from Uvalde and came by to pay her respects. She is from a conservative family and says that âguns can be a force of good in the right handsâ. âMy husband is very pro-guns and I did say to him 'did this shake him?'. And he said 'a little'. ""But for me itâs about guns being in the right hands. I donât think anyone should be able to just get hold of them and there should be informational training, courses beforehand.â Like driving a car, I suggest. ""Yes, not anyone can just drive a car, but in my opinion if you make guns harder to get for everyone, bad people can still get them. ""I think itâs all about your intent. My husbandâs family used a gun when an intruder broke in to their house with a gun for example.â The right for Americans to bear arms as outlined in the Second Amendment is something she truly believes is important. âI do think teachers should be armed with guns to protect classes,"" she added. Pratiksha GhildialReporting from Uvalde The drive to the town of Uvalde is lined with farmland and ranches. As you enter the town, US and Texas flags fly at half mast. A sign says âPray for Uvaldeâ. Itâs a very small community where everybody seems to know everybody. Just outside the Robb Elementary School, streets are lined with huge media trucks - all here to try to tell the story of the horror that unfolded inside this tiny school campus. People have been laying flowers as tributes. Texan police officers in khaki-grey uniforms and trademark hats are zealously guarding the school premises. But there is very little they can do heal the deep wounds that will be felt for generations to come. A child inspects a shotgun at the NRA's 2015 conference A statement has been released by the National Rifle Association (NRA) - the influential pro-gun lobbying group that resists new gun control measures. The four-sentence statement begins with ""deepest sympathies"" to the families and victims of ""this horrific and evil crime"". ""Although an investigation is under way and facts are still emerging, we recognise this was the act of a lone, deranged criminal,"" the statement continues. Officials in Texas have not yet said whether the gunman had any prior criminal history. The NRA adds that at their annual conference, taking place this weekend in Houston, members ""will reflect on these events, pray for the victimsâ¦ and pledge to redouble our commitment to making schools secure"". In President Biden's remarks on Tuesday night, he called out pro-gun groups, asking Americans: ""When in Godâs name are we going to stand up to the gun lobby?""

"Marks & Spencer says it is moving away from town centres, as it saw online sales for clothes and homeware jump. The chain said the shift to online shopping during the pandemic had ""increased the imperative"" to reduce its clothing and home trading space. Many town centres had ""lost impetus"" due to ""failed local authority or government policy"", M&S said. It said it was now relocating some shops from older, multi-floor buildings with poor access and parking. ""As a result, a high proportion, but not all, of our relocations are to the edge of town,"" the retail giant said. M&S said it was planning around 15 new full-line stores and 40 new food stores over the next three years. The company said it was investing in a number of stores which had been relocated to the edges of towns, including to former Debenhams sites in Leamington Spa and Thurrock. It is part of a long-term plan to overhaul its large stores. The shake-up will eventually see the closure of some 110 main stores as it focuses on fewer but better locations. A total of 68 of these main-line stores have already shut and the retailer confirmed another 32 will go over the next three years. Boss Steve Rowe told reporters M&S was ""moving with the customer, where the customer is working and shopping"". He said the chain had ""some fabulous city and town centre stores"" but it had to ensure its portfolio was ""balanced"" and there would be more of a bias towards food in the future. M&S warns online sales tax will damage High Street M&S says recovery plan boosting sales and profits Announcing its results for last year, M&S, which is turning its business around after years of decline, said it had seen strong performance in its clothing and home operation. This was driven by a 55.6% surge in online sales. However, in-store sales fell by 11.2%. Meanwhile, its food sales were up by 10.1%. Overall, the company reported pre-tax profits of Â£392m for the year to 2 April - up from a loss of Â£209m the previous year. However, M&S said it expected sales growth to slow due to rising costs and increased pressure on customer budgets. The company said it was facing increased food costs, driven by global supply issues and labour shortages, while factory, transport and freight costs, as well as continued supply issues in China, were putting pressure on its clothing and home business. Julie Palmer, a retail expert at Begbies Traynor, said the typical M&S customer tended to be wealthier and less hard hit by rising costs ""but they could still choose to economise"" . ""How long cash-strapped shoppers will feel comfortable splashing out on M&S's upmarket foods remains to be seen,"" she added. Household budgets are being squeezed by rising food, energy and fuel bills,with inflation, the rate at which prices rise, hitting 9% in April- the highest level for 40 years. Also on Wednesday, online grocer Ocado warned that its joint venture with M&S will see earnings and sales weighed down by growing pressure on customers' spending. Ocado Retail, an online retail business which is owned 50-50 by the two companies, said consumers are ordering ""one or two fewer items per shop"" against the backdrop of a growing cost of living crisis. Chief executive Steve Rowe is handing over the reins today after 40 years at M&S, starting as a Saturday boy in Croydon. The business is certainly in better shape now than when he started the top job in 2016. Reviving the fortunes of this household name is still a work in progress, though. Although M&S has managed to finally arrest the decline in clothing and home sales, fashion sales in its shops are still 25% below where they were four years ago. M&S wants fewer and better big stores as we shop more online and has already been making some big changes. Today it said it was shifting away from town centre shops to more modern edge-of-town sites, taking a swipe at what it calls ""failed local authority and government policy"". This new focus will likely send a shudder through the High Streets set to be affected. The new leadership team at M&S will also have to steer the business through the cost of living crisis with soaring inflation and consumers tightening their belts. The company also announced it would pull out of Russia altogether, resulting in a Â£31m cost. M&S, which was criticised for not leaving the country at the start of the war in Ukraine, stopped shipments to Russia in March but previously said complex franchise deals prevented it from withdrawing completely. The retailer opened its first store in Russia in 2005. Its Russian arm is run by Turkish company FiBA, which operates 48 shops under the M&S banner in the country with 1,200 employees. Chief executive Mr Rowe is handing over leadership of M&S to Stuart Machin and Katie Bickerstaffe after running the company's turnaround for the past six years. The cost-cutting programme saw the closure of a number of M&S's clothing and homeware shops, with others converted into food stores, after disappointing fashion sales. In 2020 the company also announced thousands of jobs cutsafter the business was hit by Covid lockdowns.

"The US is cutting off another financial route for Russia to pay its international debts, a move that could push the country closer to default. The US Treasury Department said it would end a waiver that had allowed US bondholders to accept payments, tightening sanctions imposed over the war in Ukraine. Russia, which is rich from its oil and gas supplies, has the funds to pay. It has already signalled plans to contest any declaration of default. The country has almost $2 billion worth of payments that will be due up to the end of the year on its international bonds. While the new rules only apply to people in the US, they will make it difficult for Russia to make payments elsewhere given the role of US banks in the global financial system. What pain lies ahead for Russia's economy? Russia beats final deadline to avoid debt default The US had already barred Russia from using US banks to transfer payments. In comments last week, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned the waiver for investors was likely to expire. She said the exemption had been intended to allow an ""orderly transition"". Analysts have said they do not expect major ramifications from the move outside of Russia, with IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva saying in March that exposure to the holdings was ""not systemically relevant"". Russia's debt was alreadydowngraded to""junk status"" by major ratings agenciesin March, a move that disqualifies it from purchases by major investors, making it difficult for Russia to raise money on international markets. Professor Philip Nichols of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania said it's not clear what Western holders of Russian bonds have done in the weeks since the invasion, whether rushing to offload them or holding on in hopes the situation will eventually normalise. A default would mark the first time Russia has failed to pay its government debt since 1998 - the economic crisis at the end of then President Yeltsin's term in office. It would likely trigger a court case, opening up Russia to recovery proceedings from creditors. Inside Russia, any impact would be felt only over the long term as part of the country's wider economic isolation, Prof Nichols said. ""Russia just has a lot of oil and gas and that translates into a lot of money, but in the long-run, this is part of a web of instruments that are designed to make it far, far more difficult for Russia to wage war on its neighbours,"" he said. ""It's going to be really interesting to see what happens,"" Prof Nichols said. What pain lies ahead for Russia's economy?

"The cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk in the Donbas region have come under intense bombardment as Russia tries to encircle them A defence ministry spokesman says the army still controlled the main road into the two cities, despite fighting in the area Russia says it will allow ships carrying food out of blockaded ports if sanctions are lifted Ukraine is a major grain producer and the EU accuses Russia of weaponising food The UK has warned prices will only increase if the stand-off isn't resolved President Putin signs a decree making it easier for Ukrainians in occupied areas to become Russian citizens Edited by Chris Giles and George Wright We are pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for now. We'll be back in the morning, Ukraine time. A young boy sits in front of a damaged building after a strike in Kramatorsk in the Donbas region But before we go, here's a recap of the day's main developments: Olga IvshinaBBC Russian senior correspondent The Russian parliament has passed a law raising the age limit for people signing up to the army to 50. It follows ongoing attempts by Russian officials to recruit more soldiers as Russian
casualties in Ukraine mount. Under current
legislation, only Russians aged 18 to 40 and foreigners aged 18 to 30 can enlist as
professional soldiers in the Russian military. âHighly
professional specialists are needed to use high-precision weapons and operate
weapons and military equipmentâ and such specialists may be aged 40 to 45, said
a note accompanying the draft bill. According to the
new law Russian citizens and foreigners up to the age of 50 will be able
to sign a contract with the military. The note said the
amendment would also help attract those in civilian professions to join the
army, including medics, engineers and communications experts. Since the start of
the war in Ukraine, the Russian Ministry of Defence and the so-called Wagner private
military company have launched a vast and persistent campaign to recruit new
soldiers both officially and unofficially. Based on open
sources, BBC Russian has identified at least 46 Russians aged over 45 who have been killed in Ukraine after the start of the invasion. This includes a 63-year-old retired general, who was shot down operating a Su-25 fighter
jet. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia Russia's plan to make it easier for Ukrainians living in Russian-controlled regions of Ukraine to receive Russian citizenship violates international law, Kyiv says. The government accused the Kremlin of ""criminal"" behaviour. President Vladimir Putin has issued an order to simplify the procedure of handing Russian citizenship to residents of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions in Ukraine's south. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia. ""The illegal issuing of passports... is a flagrant violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as norms and principles of international humanitarian law,"" the Ukrainian foreign ministry said in a statement.  Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv âQuantity has a quality of its own.â Itâs said these words were
used by Joseph Stalin to describe the Soviet approach to war. Throw enough
bodies at a conflict and eventually you will overwhelm the enemy. It worked for
the Red Army against the Nazis and the Finnish. In both wars they lost more
men, but eventually came out on top They are words that also
apply today. Vladimir Putinâs army is
finally finding some success, as his forces make breakthroughs in the eastern
Donbas region. Over the last few days they have captured a number of towns and
villages, forcing the Ukrainians to retreat to more defensible positions. They are doing it with sheer
weight of numbers. Not just men, but artillery, armour and air power. This morning the Governor of
Luhansk region described the numbers they were coming up against as âinsaneâ.
President Zelensky told ABC News his men were outnumbered 7-to-1 in the region. The current Russian targets
are the twin cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. There are thought to be
thousands of Ukrainian forces there, dug in and prepared for a long battle.
But, they are facing the prospect of being cut offâ¦ then destroyed by the sheer
weight of the Russian forces. If that happens, some of
Ukraineâs best troops will be taken out of the war. But, not all is lost for the
Ukrainians. They have huge quantities of international military support, both
promised and en route, much of it far more advanced than that currently on
display in the Donbas. The question is, can they
bring that quality to bear, before the Russian quantity overwhelms them? Russia has flattened large areas of Severodonetsk during weeks of bombardment A senior figure in eastern Ukraine has denied reports that a vital road linking Ukrainian-controlled areas in the east has been blocked from the rest of the country by Russian forces. ""Luhansk has not been cut off,"" said the region's military administration head, Serhiy Haidai. Fighting has reached the outskirts of the big city of Severodonetsk, a key Russian target. If they capture the road to Bakhmut then the city could be surrounded.  Haidai said that while the route to the south-west of Severodonetsk had come under fire, humanitarian aid was still getting through. Things were far bleaker in Severodonetsk itself, which was being shelled 24 hours a day and Russian forces were close enough to use mortar rounds as well as artillery and aerial bombing, he told the BBC. Six people were killed in Russian bombardment on Tuesday, he said on his Telegram feed. If Russia captures the neighbouring town of Lysychansk then the whole Luhansk region will be in its hands. Read more here. Russian President Vladimir Putin has met with soldiers wounded in Moscow's military campaign in Ukraine and hailed them as heroes. It's the first meeting of its kind since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The meetings took place at Moscow's Mandryka military hospital. Putin shook hands with the men and asked one soldier about his baby son, telling him: ""He will be proud of his dad."" ""These are people who are risking their health and lives for the sake of the people and children of Donbas, for the sake of Russia. They are all heroes,"" he told officials after meeting the wounded men. Sean CoughlanReporting from Bucharest Romanian President Klaus Iohannis (L) welcomes Britain's Prince Charles during their official meeting at Cotroceni Presidential Palace in Bucharest This
is the closest to the conflict in Ukraine that any senior member of the British Royal Family has come so far. Prince Charles has travelled to Romania to show solidarity for the refugeesand the
aid agencies trying to help them. Itâs a cause close
to his heart and heâs visiting a convention centre outside Bucharest being used
to distribute food, clothes and advice. Heâs in a
country with a war on its doorstep. Almost a million refugees have
come across the border into Romania. Thousands more are
arriving every single day and aid workers have been emphasising the sheer scale
of this mass migration. More than six million people have left Ukraine in three
months. Itâs also a refugee
crisis in a modern European setting. Many are keeping moving, stopping
temporarily in neighbouring Romania before heading further afield. Those that are
staying are not in camps or rows of tents - but in hostels, hotels, peopleâs
houses, spaces in public buildings. Thereâs been a
generous effort to welcome these displaced people, with volunteers meeting
arrivals at the railway station. But if international
interest wanes, and compassion fatigue sets in, it will be when the pressures
are even greater to support rising numbers of people facing a long-term
separation from their homes. George WrightBBC News Casey, seen here in a village near Kharkiv, has been in Ukraine for two months More now on Severodonetsk - a strategically vital city in the eastern Donbas region that is being bombarded by Russian forces. Dallas Anthony Casey is an American combat medic who has been volunteering in Ukraine for more than two months. He has been carrying out various roles including giving medical training to Ukrainian forces.

She lost the lower half of her leg and lost a lot of blood before we could get to her. We had to do CPR, but we were unsuccessful,"" he adds. Despite the constant shelling and complete devastation of the city, many civilians remain. ""When weâd drive through youâd see people on their bikes or on a stroll while the building right next to them gets blown up. No rush or hurry, theyâd just carry on with what they were doing."" The people remaining roughly fall into two groups, Casey says. ""Some think the Russians will come and take over and their life will be much better,"" he says. ""We convinced some people to come with us and theyâd be shamed on their way out of the shelter."" ""Then the other group of people are in complete shock. You go to their door, ask them if they want to be evacuated and theyâd be too scared to leave their homes,"" he says. ""Theyâd tell you: 'This is all I have, where am I going to go?'"" Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has said Russia is trying to ""blackmail"" the international community by raising the possibility of unblocking Black Sea ports in return for a relaxation of sanctions. Writing onTwitter,externalhe wrote ""Any foreign politician or official who may think of accepting this game should first visit the graves of killed Ukrainian children and talk to their parents."" Earlier the Interfax news agency cited Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Rudenko as saying Moscow is ready to provide a humanitarian corridor for vessels carrying food to leave Ukraine, in return for the lifting of some sanctions. Ukraine's Black Sea ports have been blocked since the beginning of Russia's invasion began on 24 February. More than 20 million tonnes of grain is currently stuck in silos in the country. Russian forces are seeking to take control of Severodonetsk Ukraine is battling to remain in control
of a key highway to the front-line city of Severodonetsk, the country's defence ministry says. Defence ministry spokesman Oleksandr Motuzyanyk told a
briefing that alternative routes existed to supply Ukrainian
units in Severodonetsk, which is surrounded on three sides by
Russian forces. Russia's aim is to fully surround
Ukrainian units in the city, as well as in nearby Lysychansk, he added. Russian forces are seeking to take control of Severodonetsk, Lyschansk, and Rubizhne in order to place the whole of the Luhansk area under Russian occupation. Luhansk makes up half of the eastern Donbas region, where Moscow has re-focused its war effort. Many believe President Putin could claim victory in the war if Russia takes control of Donbas. Jessica ParkerReporting from Brussels The EU is struggling to reach an agreement on its sixth
sanctions package against Russia, with Hungary vocal in its opposition to an
oil embargo. But while talks go on, thereâs also work to tighten up the
existing rules. The European Commission wants to make violating sanctions an
EU-wide crime. So if someone, for example, tried to flout an export ban to
Russia or hide sanctioned assets, it would, in theory, become easier to
prosecute them. The proposed measures wouldnât just cover oligarchs but
complicit lawyers and bankers too. The plans also look at broadening the blocâs
ability to seize, and even sell, assets that are linked to oligarchs as well as
organised crime. Yachts, helicopters and
works of art belonging to Russian or Belarusian individuals and companies are
among possessions seized so far. Britain's Defence Secretary Ben

Wallace adds his voice to those calling on Russia to let Ukraine export its

grain. He says it would help countries where grain scarcity could trigger

hunger. Russia must ""do the right thing"", Wallace tells reporters in Madrid, where he's been meeting Spanish defence minister Margarita Robles. But he rejected Russia's demand to lift sanctions in order for it to free up exports. He suggests instead that Black Sea nations, like Turkey, could escort Ukrainian grain

shipments. It would be ""premature"" to consider a prisoner swap with Kyiv before Ukrainian soldiers who have surrendered stand trial, Russia's deputy foreign minister says. In comments reported by Russian news agency Interfax, Andrei Rudenko, said Moscow would consider a prisoner swap with Kyiv after the surrendered Ukrainian fighters were ""appropriately convicted, sentenced"". ""Before that, all talk of an exchange is premature,"" he said. It comes after Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said late on Monday that Kyiv was ready for an exchange of prisoners and urged international allies to pressure Moscow. The fate remains unclear of hundreds of Ukrainian fighters from the besieged steelworks in the southern city of Mariupol who were taken to Russian-controlled areas last week.  This video can not be played Ros Atkins on... Russia's food war The West has accused the Russian military of holding food supplies hostage for millions around the world. War has blocked Ukraine's main ports on the Black sea, severely impacting food supply chains around the world. The country is a major exporter of wheat, but now millions of tonnes of grain are stuck - impacting the countries that can least afford it. Russia denies it is weaponising food supplies, claiming that Ukraine's attempts to mine the Black sea and sanctions are to blame, as the BBC's Ros Atkins explains. As we reported earlier, there have been Russian missile strikes on the southern city of Zaporizhzhia in what is being seen as the biggest attack on the city so far. At least one person has died and three others wounded. Ukrainian officials say Russia has gathered three of its battalion tactical groups at Vasylivka around 50km (30 miles) south of the city, but it is not yet clear whether they plan to launch an offensive on Zaporizhzhia. The area is important because it is a major transport hub, especially for railways. It is home to lots of heavy industry including a steelworks and several defence companies, including the Motor Sich factory which makes engines for planes and helicopters which the Russians claim to have hit and a radar manufacturer. Earlier in the conflict many people from Mariupol made their way to the town which had, up until now, been thought to have been relatively safe. Zaporizhzhia is also close to the site of a nuclear power station, which is Europe's biggest, on the southern bank of the Dnieper river. Russian troops are occupying the sprawling site, and while Ukrainian staff are operating it, the Russians have sent their own nuclear experts to monitor their work. Normally the plant generates more than half of Ukraine's nuclear power and 20% of the country's total electricity supply. You can read more about it here. This photo taken at the end of April showed damage close to the sea port in Mariupol The port of Mariupol has been completely cleared of mines and has begun to function again, according to Russia's defence ministry. Igor Konashenkov, a representative of the ministry, said that the demining and demilitarisation of the port had been completed, Russian media reported. Tass news agency quoted the Russian defence ministry as saying more than 12,000 explosive items and weapons  been found and defused. Yesterday, Mikhail Mizintsev, head of the Russian National Defense Control Center, said a ""humanitarian corridor"" from Mariupol towards the Black Sea 115 miles (185km) long and 2 miles (3.2km) wide was being arranged. But there has been no word from Ukraine, and it is not clear whether a risk of mines remains in the corridor. The Kremlin's deputy foreign minister said earlier that Russia was ready to provide a safe route out of Ukraine if sanctions were lifted and if Kyiv de-mined nearby waters. Sweden is not funding or arming terrorist organisations, Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson has said, in response to Turkish claims that it is a ""hatchery"" for terrorist organisations. Turkey is opposing Sweden and Finland's bids to join Nato, accusing them of harbouring members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group it views as a terrorist organisation, and followers of Fethullah Gulen, who Ankara accuses of orchestratinga 2016 coup attempt. ""We are not sending money to terrorist organisations, of course, nor any weapons,"" Andersson told a Stockholm press conference. Representatives of Sweden and Finland are meeting Turkish officials today for talks about their applications to join Nato. They need the support of all 30 Nato members, but Turkey has so far objected to their bids. Hugo BachegaBBC News, Dnipro Ukrainians, from those in power to the man in the street,

"Wladimir Klitschko celebrates with his brother after winning the WBO World Heavyweight title in 2002 in Atlantic City European governments should ""stay strong"" even though the Ukraine war would hurt their economies, the Klitschko brothers told the BBC. Former heavyweight champions Wladimir and Vitali were in Davos to encourage world leaders to support the Ukraine's fight against Russia. They acknowledged that some European leaders may be wavering in their commitment to the cause. But they thanked the UK for its support, urging, âplease donât stop"". Ukraineâs Klitschko brothers dominated the sport of boxing for a decade. Both were world heavyweight champions, and between them they fought 40 title bouts. Vitali Klitschko, the older of the two, turned to politics when his boxing career ended, and was elected mayor of Kyiv in 2014. They are now bringing the power of their global fame to bear on another, even tougher fight. The brothers visited the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, to urge the business and political leaders gathered there to step up their efforts in the struggle against Russian aggression. Vitali Klitschko urged European countries to continue supporting Ukraine âWe are asking for help and support, we are getting some of it. But it is not enough because itâs never enough as long as this war is still going,â Wladimir Klitschko told the BBC. Sanctions needed to go further, he said. âWe need to walk the talk and not just say it but actually do it. Because very often itâs sad but in reality itâs not working. ""And that is why it is important to isolate Russia financially, economically, because every cent that they are getting is getting in the budgets to finance the war in Ukraine right now and finance their soldiers and buy more weapons that are killing us, Ukrainians.â Wladimir told assembled reporters from the Swiss press that the country should set aside its long-standing tradition of neutrality, which has seen it prohibit Germany from supplying its stocks of Swiss-made ammunition to Ukrainian army. The Klitschkos were at Davos town hall to meet a group of Ukrainian refugees who are staying in the area, before appearing on stage at the World Economic Forum. Asked whether some nations, notably France and Germany, were beginning to waver in their support, and consider making concessions to Putin in a peace deal, Wladimir said: âI see that, and I tell to every politician, right now the world [is] black and white, and you have to decide: you on the side of democracy or peace, or you on the side of the dictator, the aggressors, Russian Federation?â Wladimir Klitschko thanked the British people for the support they had shown Ukraine Vitali acknowledged that the world would pay a price to support Ukraine. âIt is a very painful question for the economy but we pay to stop the warâ¦with human lives.â The brothers both thanked the British people for the support they have shown. âI want to say thank you so much for all the support that has been provided since the beginning of the war,â said Wladimir. âAnd it is not just verbally, it is the financial side, military equipment, support for the refugees that have been taken, so we feel this it is very important for us. Please donât stop, donât stop supporting us donât stop helping us as long as this war is still going.â âThank you Boris Johnson, and thank you everyone who supports Ukraine in Great Britain,â Vitali said.

"The cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk in the Donbas region have come under intense bombardment as Russia tries to encircle them A defence ministry spokesman says the army still controlled the main road into the two cities, despite fighting in the area Russia says it will allow ships carrying food out of blockaded ports if sanctions are lifted Ukraine is a major grain producer and the EU accuses Russia of weaponising food The UK has warned prices will only increase if the stand-off isn't resolved President Putin signs a decree making it easier for Ukrainians in occupied areas to become Russian citizens Edited by Chris Giles and George Wright We are pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for now. We'll be back in the morning, Ukraine time. A young boy sits in front of a damaged building after a strike in Kramatorsk in the Donbas region But before we go, here's a recap of the day's main developments: Olga IvshinaBBC Russian senior correspondent The Russian parliament has passed a law raising the age limit for people signing up to the army to 50. It follows ongoing attempts by Russian officials to recruit more soldiers as Russian
casualties in Ukraine mount. Under current
legislation, only Russians aged 18 to 40 and foreigners aged 18 to 30 can enlist as
professional soldiers in the Russian military. âHighly
professional specialists are needed to use high-precision weapons and operate
weapons and military equipmentâ and such specialists may be aged 40 to 45, said
a note accompanying the draft bill. According to the
new law Russian citizens and foreigners up to the age of 50 will be able
to sign a contract with the military. The note said the
amendment would also help attract those in civilian professions to join the
army, including medics, engineers and communications experts. Since the start of
the war in Ukraine, the Russian Ministry of Defence and the so-called Wagner private
military company have launched a vast and persistent campaign to recruit new
soldiers both officially and unofficially. Based on open
sources, BBC Russian has identified at least 46 Russians aged over 45 who have been killed in Ukraine after the start of the invasion. This includes a 63-year-old retired general, who was shot down operating a Su-25 fighter
jet. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia Russia's plan to make it easier for Ukrainians living in Russian-controlled regions of Ukraine to receive Russian citizenship violates international law, Kyiv says. The government accused the Kremlin of ""criminal"" behaviour. President Vladimir Putin has issued an order to simplify the procedure of handing Russian citizenship to residents of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions in Ukraine's south. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia. ""The illegal issuing of passports... is a flagrant violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as norms and principles of international humanitarian law,"" the Ukrainian foreign ministry said in a statement.  Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv âQuantity has a quality of its own.â Itâs said these words were
used by Joseph Stalin to describe the Soviet approach to war. Throw enough
bodies at a conflict and eventually you will overwhelm the enemy. It worked for
the Red Army against the Nazis and the Finnish. In both wars they lost more
men, but eventually came out on top They are words that also
apply today. Vladimir Putinâs army is
finally finding some success, as his forces make breakthroughs in the eastern
Donbas region. Over the last few days they have captured a number of towns and
villages, forcing the Ukrainians to retreat to more defensible positions. They are doing it with sheer
weight of numbers. Not just men, but artillery, armour and air power. This morning the Governor of
Luhansk region described the numbers they were coming up against as âinsaneâ.
President Zelensky told ABC News his men were outnumbered 7-to-1 in the region. The current Russian targets
are the twin cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. There are thought to be
thousands of Ukrainian forces there, dug in and prepared for a long battle.
But, they are facing the prospect of being cut offâ¦ then destroyed by the sheer
weight of the Russian forces. If that happens, some of
Ukraineâs best troops will be taken out of the war. But, not all is lost for the
Ukrainians. They have huge quantities of international military support, both
promised and en route, much of it far more advanced than that currently on
display in the Donbas. The question is, can they
bring that quality to bear, before the Russian quantity overwhelms them? Russia has flattened large areas of Severodonetsk during weeks of bombardment A senior figure in eastern Ukraine has denied reports that a vital road linking Ukrainian-controlled areas in the east has been blocked from the rest of the country by Russian forces. ""Luhansk has not been cut off,"" said the region's military administration head, Serhiy Haidai. Fighting has reached the outskirts of the big city of Severodonetsk, a key Russian target. If they capture the road to Bakhmut then the city could be surrounded.  Haidai said that while the route to the south-west of Severodonetsk had come under fire, humanitarian aid was still getting through. Things were far bleaker in Severodonetsk itself, which was being shelled 24 hours a day and Russian forces were close enough to use mortar rounds as well as artillery and aerial bombing, he told the BBC. Six people were killed in Russian bombardment on Tuesday, he said on his Telegram feed. If Russia captures the neighbouring town of Lysychansk then the whole Luhansk region will be in its hands. Read more here. Russian President Vladimir Putin has met with soldiers wounded in Moscow's military campaign in Ukraine and hailed them as heroes. It's the first meeting of its kind since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The meetings took place at Moscow's Mandryka military hospital. Putin shook hands with the men and asked one soldier about his baby son, telling him: ""He will be proud of his dad."" ""These are people who are risking their health and lives for the sake of the people and children of Donbas, for the sake of Russia. They are all heroes,"" he told officials after meeting the wounded men. Sean CoughlanReporting from Bucharest Romanian President Klaus Iohannis (L) welcomes Britain's Prince Charles during their official meeting at Cotroceni Presidential Palace in Bucharest This
is the closest to the conflict in Ukraine that any senior member of the British Royal Family has come so far. Prince Charles has travelled to Romania to show solidarity for the refugeesand the
aid agencies trying to help them. Itâs a cause close
to his heart and heâs visiting a convention centre outside Bucharest being used
to distribute food, clothes and advice. Heâs in a
country with a war on its doorstep. Almost a million refugees have
come across the border into Romania. Thousands more are
arriving every single day and aid workers have been emphasising the sheer scale
of this mass migration. More than six million people have left Ukraine in three
months. Itâs also a refugee
crisis in a modern European setting. Many are keeping moving, stopping
temporarily in neighbouring Romania before heading further afield. Those that are
staying are not in camps or rows of tents - but in hostels, hotels, peopleâs
houses, spaces in public buildings. Thereâs been a
generous effort to welcome these displaced people, with volunteers meeting
arrivals at the railway station. But if international
interest wanes, and compassion fatigue sets in, it will be when the pressures
are even greater to support rising numbers of people facing a long-term
separation from their homes.

"The cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk in the Donbas region have come under intense bombardment as Russia tries to encircle them A defence ministry spokesman says the army still controlled the main road into the two cities, despite fighting in the area Russia says it will allow ships carrying food out of blockaded ports if sanctions are lifted Ukraine is a major grain producer and the EU accuses Russia of weaponising food The UK has warned prices will only increase if the stand-off isn't resolved President Putin signs a decree making it easier for Ukrainians in occupied areas to become Russian citizens Edited by Chris Giles and George Wright We are pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for now. We'll be back in the morning, Ukraine time. A young boy sits in front of a damaged building after a strike in Kramatorsk in the Donbas region But before we go, here's a recap of the day's main developments: Olga IvshinaBBC Russian senior correspondent The Russian parliament has passed a law raising the age limit for people signing up to the army to 50. It follows ongoing attempts by Russian officials to recruit more soldiers as Russian
casualties in Ukraine mount. Under current
legislation, only Russians aged 18 to 40 and foreigners aged 18 to 30 can enlist as
professional soldiers in the Russian military. âHighly
professional specialists are needed to use high-precision weapons and operate
weapons and military equipmentâ and such specialists may be aged 40 to 45, said
a note accompanying the draft bill. According to the
new law Russian citizens and foreigners up to the age of 50 will be able
to sign a contract with the military. The note said the
amendment would also help attract those in civilian professions to join the
army, including medics, engineers and communications experts. Since the start of
the war in Ukraine, the Russian Ministry of Defence and the so-called Wagner private
military company have launched a vast and persistent campaign to recruit new
soldiers both officially and unofficially. Based on open
sources, BBC Russian has identified at least 46 Russians aged over 45 who have been killed in Ukraine after the start of the invasion. This includes a 63-year-old retired general, who was shot down operating a Su-25 fighter
jet. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia Russia's plan to make it easier for Ukrainians living in Russian-controlled regions of Ukraine to receive Russian citizenship violates international law, Kyiv says. The government accused the Kremlin of ""criminal"" behaviour. President Vladimir Putin has issued an order to simplify the procedure of handing Russian citizenship to residents of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions in Ukraine's south. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia. ""The illegal issuing of passports... is a flagrant violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as norms and principles of international humanitarian law,"" the Ukrainian foreign ministry said in a statement.  Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv âQuantity has a quality of its own.â Itâs said these words were
used by Joseph Stalin to describe the Soviet approach to war. Throw enough
bodies at a conflict and eventually you will overwhelm the enemy. It worked for
the Red Army against the Nazis and the Finnish. In both wars they lost more
men, but eventually came out on top They are words that also
apply today. Vladimir Putinâs army is
finally finding some success, as his forces make breakthroughs in the eastern
Donbas region. Over the last few days they have captured a number of towns and
villages, forcing the Ukrainians to retreat to more defensible positions. They are doing it with sheer
weight of numbers. Not just men, but artillery, armour and air power. This morning the Governor of
Luhansk region described the numbers they were coming up against as âinsaneâ.
President Zelensky told ABC News his men were outnumbered 7-to-1 in the region. The current Russian targets
are the twin cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. There are thought to be
thousands of Ukrainian forces there, dug in and prepared for a long battle.
But, they are facing the prospect of being cut offâ¦ then destroyed by the sheer
weight of the Russian forces. If that happens, some of
Ukraineâs best troops will be taken out of the war. But, not all is lost for the
Ukrainians. They have huge quantities of international military support, both
promised and en route, much of it far more advanced than that currently on
display in the Donbas. The question is, can they
bring that quality to bear, before the Russian quantity overwhelms them? Russia has flattened large areas of Severodonetsk during weeks of bombardment A senior figure in eastern Ukraine has denied reports that a vital road linking Ukrainian-controlled areas in the east has been blocked from the rest of the country by Russian forces. ""Luhansk has not been cut off,"" said the region's military administration head, Serhiy Haidai. Fighting has reached the outskirts of the big city of Severodonetsk, a key Russian target. If they capture the road to Bakhmut then the city could be surrounded.  Haidai said that while the route to the south-west of Severodonetsk had come under fire, humanitarian aid was still getting through. Things were far bleaker in Severodonetsk itself, which was being shelled 24 hours a day and Russian forces were close enough to use mortar rounds as well as artillery and aerial bombing, he told the BBC. Six people were killed in Russian bombardment on Tuesday, he said on his Telegram feed. If Russia captures the neighbouring town of Lysychansk then the whole Luhansk region will be in its hands.

It's the first meeting of its kind since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The meetings took place at Moscow's Mandryka military hospital. Putin shook hands with the men and asked one soldier about his baby son, telling him: ""He will be proud of his dad."" ""These are people who are risking their health and lives for the sake of the people and children of Donbas, for the sake of Russia. They are all heroes,"" he told officials after meeting the wounded men. Sean CoughlanReporting from Bucharest Romanian President Klaus Iohannis (L) welcomes Britain's Prince Charles during their official meeting at Cotroceni Presidential Palace in Bucharest This
is the closest to the conflict in Ukraine that any senior member of the British Royal Family has come so far. Prince Charles has travelled to Romania to show solidarity for the refugeesand the
aid agencies trying to help them. Itâs a cause close
to his heart and heâs visiting a convention centre outside Bucharest being used
to distribute food, clothes and advice. Heâs in a
country with a war on its doorstep. Almost a million refugees have
come across the border into Romania. Thousands more are
arriving every single day and aid workers have been emphasising the sheer scale
of this mass migration. More than six million people have left Ukraine in three
months. Itâs also a refugee
crisis in a modern European setting. Many are keeping moving, stopping
temporarily in neighbouring Romania before heading further afield. Those that are
staying are not in camps or rows of tents - but in hostels, hotels, peopleâs
houses, spaces in public buildings. Thereâs been a
generous effort to welcome these displaced people, with volunteers meeting
arrivals at the railway station. But if international
interest wanes, and compassion fatigue sets in, it will be when the pressures
are even greater to support rising numbers of people facing a long-term
separation from their homes. George WrightBBC News Casey, seen here in a village near Kharkiv, has been in Ukraine for two months More now on Severodonetsk - a strategically vital city in the eastern Donbas region that is being bombarded by Russian forces. Dallas Anthony Casey is an American combat medic who has been volunteering in Ukraine for more than two months. He has been carrying out various roles including giving medical training to Ukrainian forces. He is currently in Dnipro after returning from Severodonetsk, where he has been helping evacuate people remaining in the besieged city. Shelling of the city is ""constant"", he tells me. ""Never a moment where there wasnât. Weâd be driving down the road to one location and watch a building get hit. We'd stop and run into the building and see if anyone could be saved,"" Casey says. ""Two days ago one of the volunteer ladies was hit when going door to door. She lost the lower half of her leg and lost a lot of blood before we could get to her. We had to do CPR, but we were unsuccessful,"" he adds. Despite the constant shelling and complete devastation of the city, many civilians remain. ""When weâd drive through youâd see people on their bikes or on a stroll while the building right next to them gets blown up. No rush or hurry, theyâd just carry on with what they were doing."" The people remaining roughly fall into two groups, Casey says. ""Some think the Russians will come and take over and their life will be much better,"" he says. ""We convinced some people to come with us and theyâd be shamed on their way out of the shelter."" ""Then the other group of people are in complete shock. You go to their door, ask them if they want to be evacuated and theyâd be too scared to leave their homes,"" he says. ""Theyâd tell you: 'This is all I have, where am I going to go?'"" Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has said Russia is trying to ""blackmail"" the international community by raising the possibility of unblocking Black Sea ports in return for a relaxation of sanctions. Writing onTwitter,externalhe wrote ""Any foreign politician or official who may think of accepting this game should first visit the graves of killed Ukrainian children and talk to their parents."" Earlier the Interfax news agency cited Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Rudenko as saying Moscow is ready to provide a humanitarian corridor for vessels carrying food to leave Ukraine, in return for the lifting of some sanctions. Ukraine's Black Sea ports have been blocked since the beginning of Russia's invasion began on 24 February. More than 20 million tonnes of grain is currently stuck in silos in the country. Russian forces are seeking to take control of Severodonetsk Ukraine is battling to remain in control
of a key highway to the front-line city of Severodonetsk, the country's defence ministry says. Defence ministry spokesman Oleksandr Motuzyanyk told a
briefing that alternative routes existed to supply Ukrainian
units in Severodonetsk, which is surrounded on three sides by
Russian forces. Russia's aim is to fully surround
Ukrainian units in the city, as well as in nearby Lysychansk, he added. Russian forces are seeking to take control of Severodonetsk, Lyschansk, and Rubizhne in order to place the whole of the Luhansk area under Russian occupation. Luhansk makes up half of the eastern Donbas region, where Moscow has re-focused its war effort. Many believe President Putin could claim victory in the war if Russia takes control of Donbas. Jessica ParkerReporting from Brussels The EU is struggling to reach an agreement on its sixth
sanctions package against Russia, with Hungary vocal in its opposition to an
oil embargo. But while talks go on, thereâs also work to tighten up the
existing rules. The European Commission wants to make violating sanctions an
EU-wide crime. So if someone, for example, tried to flout an export ban to
Russia or hide sanctioned assets, it would, in theory, become easier to
prosecute them. The proposed measures wouldnât just cover oligarchs but
complicit lawyers and bankers too. The plans also look at broadening the blocâs
ability to seize, and even sell, assets that are linked to oligarchs as well as
organised crime. Yachts, helicopters and
works of art belonging to Russian or Belarusian individuals and companies are
among possessions seized so far. Britain's Defence Secretary Ben

Wallace adds his voice to those calling on Russia to let Ukraine export its

grain. He says it would help countries where grain scarcity could trigger

hunger. Russia must ""do the right thing"", Wallace tells reporters in Madrid, where he's been meeting Spanish defence minister Margarita Robles. But he rejected Russia's demand to lift sanctions in order for it to free up exports. He suggests instead that Black Sea nations, like Turkey, could escort Ukrainian grain

shipments. It would be ""premature"" to consider a prisoner swap with Kyiv before Ukrainian soldiers who have surrendered stand trial, Russia's deputy foreign minister says. In comments reported by Russian news agency Interfax, Andrei Rudenko, said Moscow would consider a prisoner swap with Kyiv after the surrendered Ukrainian fighters were ""appropriately convicted, sentenced"". ""Before that, all talk of an exchange is premature,"" he said. It comes after Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said late on Monday that Kyiv was ready for an exchange of prisoners and urged international allies to pressure Moscow. The fate remains unclear of hundreds of Ukrainian fighters from the besieged steelworks in the southern city of Mariupol who were taken to Russian-controlled areas last week.  This video can not be played Ros Atkins on... Russia's food war The West has accused the Russian military of holding food supplies hostage for millions around the world. War has blocked Ukraine's main ports on the Black sea, severely impacting food supply chains around the world. The country is a major exporter of wheat, but now millions of tonnes of grain are stuck - impacting the countries that can least afford it. Russia denies it is weaponising food supplies, claiming that Ukraine's attempts to mine the Black sea and sanctions are to blame, as the BBC's Ros Atkins explains. As we reported earlier, there have been Russian missile strikes on the southern city of Zaporizhzhia in what is being seen as the biggest attack on the city so far. At least one person has died and three others wounded. Ukrainian officials say Russia has gathered three of its battalion tactical groups at Vasylivka around 50km (30 miles) south of the city, but it is not yet clear whether they plan to launch an offensive on Zaporizhzhia. The area is important because it is a major transport hub, especially for railways. It is home to lots of heavy industry including a steelworks and several defence companies, including the Motor Sich factory which makes engines for planes and helicopters which the Russians claim to have hit and a radar manufacturer. Earlier in the conflict many people from Mariupol made their way to the town which had, up until now, been thought to have been relatively safe. Zaporizhzhia is also close to the site of a nuclear power station, which is Europe's biggest, on the southern bank of the Dnieper river. Russian troops are occupying the sprawling site, and while Ukrainian staff are operating it, the Russians have sent their own nuclear experts to monitor their work. Normally the plant generates more than half of Ukraine's nuclear power and 20% of the country's total electricity supply. You can read more about it here. This photo taken at the end of April showed damage close to the sea port in Mariupol The port of Mariupol has been completely cleared of mines and has begun to function again, according to Russia's defence ministry. Igor Konashenkov, a representative of the ministry, said that the demining and demilitarisation of the port had been completed, Russian media reported. Tass news agency quoted the Russian defence ministry as saying more than 12,000 explosive items and weapons  been found and defused. Yesterday, Mikhail Mizintsev, head of the Russian National Defense Control Center, said a ""humanitarian corridor"" from Mariupol towards the Black Sea 115 miles (185km) long and 2 miles (3.2km) wide was being arranged. But there has been no word from Ukraine, and it is not clear whether a risk of mines remains in the corridor. The Kremlin's deputy foreign minister said earlier that Russia was ready to provide a safe route out of Ukraine if sanctions were lifted and if Kyiv de-mined nearby waters. Sweden is not funding or arming terrorist organisations, Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson has said, in response to Turkish claims that it is a ""hatchery"" for terrorist organisations. Turkey is opposing Sweden and Finland's bids to join Nato, accusing them of harbouring members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group it views as a terrorist organisation, and followers of Fethullah Gulen, who Ankara accuses of orchestratinga 2016 coup attempt. ""We are not sending money to terrorist organisations, of course, nor any weapons,"" Andersson told a Stockholm press conference. Representatives of Sweden and Finland are meeting Turkish officials today for talks about their applications to join Nato. They need the support of all 30 Nato members, but Turkey has so far objected to their bids. Hugo BachegaBBC News, Dnipro Ukrainians, from those in power to the man in the street,
are adamant that the country will not cede any territory in order to make
Russia end its invasion, and all the suffering and destruction that come with
it. From President
Zelensky to opinion polls, the message has been clear. Many are furious that
such idea is even being suggested. They are quick to remember that the war
started not in February but in 2014, with Russiaâs invasion and annexation of
Crimea and support for pro-Russian separatists in the east. If you make a deal
with them today, the general view goes, they will come for more later. Kseniia, 37, came to
Dnipro to bury her brother, a member of Ukraineâs special forces in the east
who was killed earlier this month in a Russian missile attack. âI personally donât
think they should accept any ceasefire conditions from Russia because so many
people have been killed,â she said. âWe should fight for our right to exist,
for our sovereignty. Thatâs why my brother was fighting. We should fight to push
the Russians out.â Alex, 21, said: âI
adore my country. I donât want Russia to take any part of it,â he said. âThatâs
the opinion of everyone who loves Ukraine.â With the fighting now
focused on the east, he was concerned about the fate of his grandmother, who
lives in Severodonetsk. The city, the largest under Ukrainian control in the
province of Luhansk, has come under intense artillery and missile fire from
Russian forces, and there are growing concerns over the conditions for
thousands of civilians who are still there. âI hope weâll be able
to hold this area,â he told me. As he said this, the air raid sirens went off,
a reminder that danger for people here is never really far away.  President Vladimir Putin has issued an order to simplify the procedure of handing Russian citizenship to residents of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions in Ukraine's south. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city occupied by Russia. Zaporizhzhia is still under Ukrainian control, but many surrounding areas are under Russian occupation. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Wladimir Klitschko celebrates with his brother after winning the WBO World Heavyweight title in 2002 in Atlantic City European governments should ""stay strong"" even though the Ukraine war would hurt their economies, the Klitschko brothers told the BBC. Former heavyweight champions Wladimir and Vitali were in Davos to encourage world leaders to support the Ukraine's fight against Russia. They acknowledged that some European leaders may be wavering in their commitment to the cause. But they thanked the UK for its support, urging, âplease donât stop"". Ukraineâs Klitschko brothers dominated the sport of boxing for a decade. Both were world heavyweight champions, and between them they fought 40 title bouts. Vitali Klitschko, the older of the two, turned to politics when his boxing career ended, and was elected mayor of Kyiv in 2014. They are now bringing the power of their global fame to bear on another, even tougher fight. The brothers visited the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, to urge the business and political leaders gathered there to step up their efforts in the struggle against Russian aggression. Vitali Klitschko urged European countries to continue supporting Ukraine âWe are asking for help and support, we are getting some of it. But it is not enough because itâs never enough as long as this war is still going,â Wladimir Klitschko told the BBC. Sanctions needed to go further, he said. âWe need to walk the talk and not just say it but actually do it. Because very often itâs sad but in reality itâs not working. ""And that is why it is important to isolate Russia financially, economically, because every cent that they are getting is getting in the budgets to finance the war in Ukraine right now and finance their soldiers and buy more weapons that are killing us, Ukrainians.â Wladimir told assembled reporters from the Swiss press that the country should set aside its long-standing tradition of neutrality, which has seen it prohibit Germany from supplying its stocks of Swiss-made ammunition to Ukrainian army. The Klitschkos were at Davos town hall to meet a group of Ukrainian refugees who are staying in the area, before appearing on stage at the World Economic Forum. Asked whether some nations, notably France and Germany, were beginning to waver in their support, and consider making concessions to Putin in a peace deal, Wladimir said: âI see that, and I tell to every politician, right now the world [is] black and white, and you have to decide: you on the side of democracy or peace, or you on the side of the dictator, the aggressors, Russian Federation?â Wladimir Klitschko thanked the British people for the support they had shown Ukraine Vitali acknowledged that the world would pay a price to support Ukraine. âIt is a very painful question for the economy but we pay to stop the warâ¦with human lives.â The brothers both thanked the British people for the support they have shown. âI want to say thank you so much for all the support that has been provided since the beginning of the war,â said Wladimir. âAnd it is not just verbally, it is the financial side, military equipment, support for the refugees that have been taken, so we feel this it is very important for us. Please donât stop, donât stop supporting us donât stop helping us as long as this war is still going.â âThank you Boris Johnson, and thank you everyone who supports Ukraine in Great Britain,â Vitali said.
