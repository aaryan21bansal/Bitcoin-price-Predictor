Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer says the UK ""won't go back to normal"" regardless of whether it leaves the European Union, or holds another vote and decides to remain. He told a Labour meeting in Edinburgh that the only way to unite the country would be to take action to ensure people no longer felt disenfranchised. He said: ""If millions of people tell you that a political or economic situation isn't working for them, you've got to listen to that."" He said the UK will never get past Brexit ""if we only focus on one part of it: the deal"". ""We've got to focus on the other bit, which told us that we need much greater change than we've had for a long time. That told us that people feel disenfranchised at almost every level."" This video can not be played The leader of the SNP still wants to hold an independence referendum in 2020 SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon says Scotland does not want to leave the EU and that she still wants to hold an independence referendum in 2020. She told BBC Scotland's The Nine that the way to solve Scotland's ""problem of having our future determined by Westminster"" was to be independent. ""The UK is in a mess right now â it's not a mess of my making, and it's got to plot its way out of that,"" she said. The interview was the second in a series of special interviews on The Nine with the leaders of the main parties ahead of the general election. The focus for much of today's election talk has been the launch of Labour's manifesto. Thefull document,externalruns to 105 pages, but if you're looking for a recap of the main points, here'sour storyoutlining Labour's key policies. Brexit Party candidate Ann Widdecombe has this evening repeated her claims that she was offered a role by the Conservatives in the Brexit negotiations if she stood down in the general election - this time in an interview on LBC. In response, the Lib Dem's Tom Brake said the allegation ""must be added to the police investigation into whether
peerages were offered to Brexit Party candidates to stand down"". Last week, Boris Johnson said claims that Brexit Party election candidates had been offered peerages to encourage them to stand downwere ""nonsense"". Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent We donât know whether Jeremy Corbyn prefers a
new Brexit deal, negotiated by Labour, or no Brexit at all. That is the tightrope that he is walking throughout this
election campaign. I wouldnât expect him to give an answer before polling day â
or even after â because he knows he needs to appeal to Leave and Remain
supporting voters alike in the UK, if he has any hope of winning a majority at
the general election. Thatâs why the Conservatives will time and again attack that
for what they perceive as a weakness â as we saw at the recent head-to-head TV
debate. Jeremy Corbyn argues, as he did today, that Labourâs policy
is about negotiating a better deal with the EU in the spirit of the result of the last referendum and then putting that
to the people in another public vote. But that is very much not the narrative that they want to
pursue during this campaign. Theyâd rather that we focused on those big
promises and plans contained in the manifesto. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Jeremy Corbyn is promising to transform the UK with ""real change"" to rail, mail, water and energy as part of Labour's manifesto. BBC political correspondent Iain Watson explores what that all means. This video can not be played It was a busy day for Jeremy Corbyn, who launched Labour's manifesto at Birmingham City University, before heading to the Upper Gornal
Pensioners Club in Dudley. Housing was a big topic of conversation, with both Labour and the Conservatives setting out rival plans to tackle England's housing shortage. Boris Johnson donned a hard hat and visited a housing development in Bedford. Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson also sported a hat as she visited a bottling plant in
Kirkintilloch, East Dunbartonshire, to hear about sustainable packaging. For Nicola Sturgeon her outfit of choice was a cape - which she put on for a charity photocall following First Minister's Questions at the Scottish
Parliament in Edinburgh. Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert Jeremy Corbyn launched Labour's manifesto today, but how popular is he compared to the other party leaders? In recent weeks, the polling company Opinium has asked voters whether they approve or disapprove of the job that each party leader is doing - or, in the case of Boris Johnson, how they think he is performing as prime minister. None of the four leaders - Mr Johnson, Mr Corbyn, Jo Swinson or Nigel Farage (comparable figures are not available for the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon) emerges as especially popular. The least unpopular is Mr Johnson - the proportion of voters who approve of the job he is doing is more or less equal to those who disapprove. In the case of the other party leaders, those who disapprove clearly outnumber those who approve. However, in the case of Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson, many voters say they neither approve nor disapprove - an option chosen by 39%. Read more from Sir John here. Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor Writing about the Labour manifesto, released today, our correspondent writes: This is a radical attempt to change Britain's business model, involving not just huge amounts of public spending and investment, but also an attempt to rewire the way the economy works. Labour's answer to ""can we afford this?"" is ""we can't afford not to"" - arguing that only a very active government can reshape the economy to change the fate of the country, in particular to meet the green challenge. Labour is part of a now-shared consensus across every single party, the IMF and finance ministries across the world, that currently low interest rates charged on government borrowing should be used to fund substantial investments. Labour has used this opportunity to push the radicalism of its 2017 manifesto much further with about Â£140bn extra in spending a year, versus for example Â£80bn a year from the LibDems, and tens of billions from the Conservatives. It leaves all the major parties promising voters hundreds of billions over the Parliament. At around Â£600bn more in spending promises over the five years Labour has put clear blue water between themselves and the extra spending of the other major parties. Is this affordable? It is more risky than more-modest spending plans. Read more from Faisal here. There are just five days left to register to vote in next month's election.

"This video can not be played November 2019 - Benjamin Netanyahu rails against corruption charges Israel's attorney general has charged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with bribery, fraud and breach of trust in connection with three separate cases. Mr Netanyahu is alleged to have accepted gifts from wealthy businessmen and dispensed favours to try to get more positive press coverage. The prime minister described the charges as an ""attempted coup"", blaming them on a ""tainted"" process. He has also insisted he will not resign and is not legally obliged to do so. In a televised speech, Mr Netanyahu said authorities ""weren't after the truth, they were after me"", and called on the country to ""investigate the investigators"". Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu: Commando turned PM Netanyahu: What are the allegations? Earlier, Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit said he made the decision ""with a heavy heart"", but said it showed nobody was above the law in Israel. ""Law enforcement is not a choice. It is not a matter of right or left. It's not a matter of politics,"" he said. The announcement comes amid a political stand-off in Israel following two inconclusive general elections in April and September. On Wednesday, Mr Netanyahu's rival for the premiership, Benny Gantz, said he had been unable to form a governing coalition with a majority in parliament. He had been given the opportunity to try after Mr Netanyahu had earlier failed to do so. Supporters of Mr Netanyahu gathered outside the official prime minister's residence to protest against the charges Demonstrators also came out against Mr Netanyahu President Reuven Rivlin asked lawmakers on Thursday to agree on a candidate for prime minister within 21 days and avoid an unprecedented third election in a year. After the charges were announced, Mr Gantz tweeted his support for the attorney general and law enforcement agencies, and wrote it was ""a very sad day"" for Israel. Attorney General Mandelblit said in February that he intended to indict Mr Netanyahu in connection with three cases - known as Case 1,000, Case 2,000 and Case 4,000 - pending final hearings that eventually took place last month. Case 1,000:Mr Netanyahu has been charged with fraud and breach of trust in this case. He is alleged to have received various high-value benefits, including pink champagne and cigars, in return for favours for a wealthy friend. Mr Netanyahu has said they were tokens of friendship and that he did not act inappropriately in exchange for them. The friend similarly denies any wrongdoing. Case 2,000:Mr Netanyahu faces charges of fraud and breach of trust in this case. He is alleged to have agreed a deal with the publisher of a major newspaper to promote legislation to weaken a rival daily in return for favourable coverage. The publisher has been charged with bribery. Like the prime minister, he denies any wrongdoing. Both men have said they did not intend to promote the matters discussed in their meetings, and the legislation was not passed. Case 4,000:This is considered the most serious case because Mr Netanyahu has been charged with bribery, as well as fraud and breach of trust. It is alleged that Mr Netanyahu promoted regulatory decisions that favoured a leading telecommunications company in return for favourable news coverage from one of its websites, as part of an agreement with the company's controlling shareholder. The prime minister has insisted experts supported the regulatory decisions and that he received nothing in return. The shareholder, who has been charged with bribery, also denies wrongdoing. This is a watershed moment for Israel. Benjamin Netanyahu's legal problems have plagued his last few years in office, causing him to focus increasingly on his political survival rather than on governing. They are also one of the reasons for the country's political paralysis. Mr Netanyahu has been seeking new laws granting him immunity from prosecution. That was one of factors driving the country's last two elections, and one reason why there's been a deadlock in forming a coalition government. Throughout, the prime minister has categorically denied doing anything wrong. Now he's in a difficult position. It was thought some of the charges might be reduced, but the attorney general has indicted him on the full count, including the most serious one: bribery. It is not clear what this means for Mr Netanyahu's future. According to Israeli law, he can stay in office until the final verdict - but his political allies will have to decide whether to stick with him in ongoing coalition negotiations. Members of the opposition said this was a sad day for Israel, but immediately called on Mr Netanyahu to step down and fight his case in court. It is unclear what this means for Mr Netanyahu's future. He is presumed innocent unless proven otherwise, and there is currently no legal barrier to him staying in office as prime minister. It could take many months before the cases are brought before a district court. And even if convicted, Mr Netanyahu would not be required to step down until the appeals process was exhausted - something that could take years. However, correspondents say many will question the prime minister's ability to handle affairs of state if he is simultaneously defending himself in court. Non-governmental organisations may petition the Supreme Court to force Mr Netanyahu to resign. The court has previously ruled that a cabinet minister charged with a crime must step down or be removed from office, and it would have to decide whether that should also apply to the prime minister. Allies of Mr Netanyahu in parliament may seek to pass legislation that would grant him immunity from prosecution while in office, and allow lawmakers to overrule a possible Supreme Court ruling reversing that immunity.

"Prince Andrew was photographed leaving Buckingham Palace on Thursday evening The Duke of York has been seen for the first time since he announced he would step back from royal duties over the Jeffrey Epstein scandal. Prince Andrew said on Wednesday he wouldwithdraw from his official role for the ""foreseeable future"". Criticism of the prince's ties to convicted US sex offender Epstein intensified amid a growing backlash following a BBC interview. Lawyers for Epstein's victims have urged the prince to speak to US police. The prince was seen by photographers on Thursday morning driving out of his home in Windsor, Berkshire, and was later spotted leaving Buckingham Palace. The Duke of York's ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, whodefended him as a ""true and real gentleman"",externala day before the Newsnight interview was broadcast, was also seen being driven into the grounds of Buckingham Palace. Earlier in the day he was spotted driving out of his home in Windsor Prince Andrew's ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, was also seen being driven into the grounds of Buckingham Palace on Thursday Meanwhile, more organisations have announced they are cutting ties with the Duke of York. TheUniversity of Huddersfield said the prince was stepping down with immediate effect from his role as chancellor. The Association of Leading Visitor Attractions - which represents tourist sites such as museums, galleries and historic houses across the UK - said the prince was no longer its president. And the Outward Bound Trust - a network of outdoor education schools - said it had accepted his resignation as patron. Companies including BT and Barclays and other institutionshad already distanced themselves from the prince. Prince Andrew became a full-time working member of the Royal Family following his retirement from the Royal Navy. The announcement that he would be stepping down from public duties, described by Buckingham Palace as ""a personal decision"", was taken following discussions with the Queen and Prince Charles. Prince Andrew quits as university chancellor Prince Andrew stepping back from royal duties Entrepreneurs who back Prince Andrew's Pitch@Palace Six things we learned from the duke's interview The retirement of the Duke of Edinburgh from public life in 2017 is the most recent example of where a working royal has stepped back from their duties. Although under very different circumstances, in Prince Philip's case, some of his long-held patronages have been passed to other family members. The Duchess of Cambridge and the Countess of Wessex were among the royals to take on his former patronages. The prince's access to public money to fund travel and expenses will end. For example, a three-day visit to Bahrain by the prince on behalf of the UK government in April 2018cost Â£16,272,external, paid for by the taxpayer-funded Sovereign Grant. The Sovereign Grant is public moneywhich pays for the cost of official royal duties,external, in exchange for the surrender by the Queen of the revenue from the Crown Estate. Prince Andrew will step back from royal duties for the foreseeable future There is also an annual payment to the prince from the Privy Purse - the Queen's private income - recorded in 2011 as being Â£249,000. Asked about whether this funding would continue, Buckingham Palace said only that the Duke of York's office was funded privately by the Queen. The prince has been urged to put himself forward to be interviewed by US investigators who are looking into allegations against Jeffrey Epstein. In his statement on Wednesday, Prince Andrew said he was ""willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required"". David Boies, a lawyer representing Virginia Giuffre and other accusers, said the prince's withdrawal from his royal duties was ""a positive first step towards taking responsibility for his actions"". ""A second positive step would be to agree to be interviewed by the lawyers representing the victims of Jeffrey Epstein,"" he added. The prince said he regretted this 2010 meeting with Epstein Gloria Allred, who represents some of Epstein's accusers, told BBC Newsnight that she was ""glad"" it appeared the prince was willing to co-operate. But she asked: ""Is he insisting that he be served with a subpoena to testify, or is he willing to speak to law enforcement without being legally required to do so? ""My clients who are victims of Jeffrey Epstein have spoken to law enforcement without being 'required' to do so."" Another US lawyer for several Epstein accusers, Lisa Bloom, who is Ms Allred's daughter, said she would be prepared to serve legal papers on the prince in the UK, compelling him to give sworn testimony. Ms Bloom said it appeared the prince may have crucial information on Epstein's alleged crimes and that she would be willing to serve him with legal papers compelling him to give sworn testimony. Virginia Giuffre claimed she was forced to have sex with the prince three times. The prince has always denied any form of sexual contact or relationship with her. It is now unlikely that Prince Andrew will attend events or make trips in his capacity as the Queen's third child. Other working royals are expected to take over Prince Andrew's commitments in the short term. It is likely the prince's private office at Buckingham Palace, which helps him keep his official diary, will reduce in size. This video can not be played Prince Andrew: Epstein 'a constant sore in the family' But it will not be a complete retirement for Prince Andrew. It is understood the prince will continue to support his entrepreneur programme, Pitch@Palace,although it will take place separately from the palace. Prince Andrew's attendance at Royal Family engagements, such as the Trooping of the Colour, Remembrance Sunday or Christmas at the family's estate in Sandringham, Norfolk, is not thought to be affected. This is without precedent in modern times. Prince Andrew's public life is over for now. The statement says the withdrawal is ""for the foreseeable future"". But it's hard to see what will bring him back. The interview is almost universally seen as a mistake. It was a disaster. But it may have seemed a good idea at the time. BBC Panorama has been digging into Virginia Giuffre's allegations and is going to air soon. That will have added to the pressure, alongside legal efforts in New York to have more Epstein-related papers released. There's talk of a lack of grip at the Palace, but Buckingham Palace is not like a company or a government department, with reporting lines and a chain of command. For centuries princes have gone their own way. There are lots of questions - about money, titles, military commands, patronages, about how this might speed reform, and of course about whether Prince Andrew still has a part to play in helping with investigations into Epstein, and helping Epstein's victims find answers. But right now the humiliation is complete. Born into the public eye, Prince Andrew has had to retreat into a private life. And the monarchy is shaken. Prince Andrew & the Epstein Scandal: The Newsnight Interview was shown on BBC Two on 16 November 2019 and can be seen onBBC iPlayerin the UK. The full interview can also be seen onYouTube.

"Williamson caught at gully off Curran after making half-century England bowled out for 353 Southee took four wickets as England slipped from 277-4 to 295-8 Stokes (91) falls to excellent slip catch by Taylor First of two Tests; Play can go on until 05:30 GMT Jack Skelton, Callum Matthews and Amy Lofthouse That's us done for today. Thanks for your company. You can read Marc Higginson's report overhere. You'll be able to download the latest Test Match Special podcast later onhere. The full scorecard is availablehere. We'll see you at 21:30 for day three. BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra Australia are in complete control against Pakistan at the Gabba and they are about to pass Pakistan's total of 240. Although they have finally lost their first wicket as Joe Burns has just been bowled by Yasir Shah. You can listen to that one overhere. Stuart Broad:0-20 off 10 overs Jofra Archer:0-40 off 14 overs Sam Curran:2-28 off 10 overs Jack Leach:1-29 off 12 overs Ben Stokes:1-16 off four overs Joe Root:0-2 off one over More from England's Jack Leach:""There hasn't been much spin yet. That could change, it's sunny and warm and the wicket is starting to get dry so hopefully come day four or five there may be more spin. ""I'm trying to do a job first innings, contain them and let the pace lads do the work but I'm trying to build pressure and take wickets as well. ""We'll be looking to get a lead. It's a big first hour, if we can get a couple of early wickets we might be able to get a lead of 100 or 150."" Henry Nicholls and BJ Watling saw New Zealand to close at 144-4 - 209 runs behind. There was still time for Nicholls to be hit on the helmet by a well-directed Jofra Archer bouncer. Sam Curran got the prize scalp of Kane Williamson with a brilliant rising delivery that went off  the New Zealand captain's glove to Ben Stokes at first slip. Jeet Raval and Ross Taylor both fell to poor strokes off Jack Leach and Ben Stokes respectively as England chipped away and started to earn control. Sam Curran came on first change and struck in his first over as he Tom Latham lbw for eight. Latham should have reviewed however, as he got a thin inside edge but despite a brief consultation with Jeet Raval the opener walked. Stuart Broad then fell quickly as England were bowled out for 353. It was a total they would have been disappointed with having 202-3 and then 277-4 but on a pitch that's starting to look two-paced it may yet be a good total. Jos Buttler and Jack Leach then shared 52 for the ninth wicket as they hauled England towards 350. Jos Buttler was eventually caught on the deep point fence in slightly bizarre circumstances as Mitchell Santner jumped back over the advertising boards after signing some autographs as Neil Wagner was running in. That started a collapse of 4-18 in 21 balls as Ollie Pope was caught behind playing a loose drive, Sam Curran was trapped lbw first ball and Jofra Archer was caught in the slips. Ben Stokes and Ollie Pope resumed with England on 241-4. They added 36 in the first 10 overs of the day's play before a spectacular catch at first slip from Ross Taylor saw the end of Stokes. Right, let's have a recap of the day's action. England's Jack Leach:""It was a good day. We would have liked an extra wicket at the end. If we can get a couple early, we'll be right on top. ""The ball from Sam Curran to get Kane Williamson misbehaved and that's a good sign when you've got runs on the board. ""We would have liked to have got more runs, we were aiming for at least 400. We wanted that big score and we wanted a century in there and that's something we're working hard to do. Hopefully that'll come in the second innings."" New Zealand's Tim Southee:""It would have been nice to be three down tonight but we've still got batting to come. We just need some partnerships and eke out some more runs. ""I thought we bowled well yesterday and we got our rewards for that today. We would have taken 6-112 at the start of the day. ""Test cricket challenges you physically as well as mentally. You've got to take 20 wickets to win Tests, you've just got to keep coming as a bowler. ""We'll turn up tomorrow, approach the first session and then reassess where we are at lunch and then the same at tea."" Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent A compelling day really. It's been a hard-fought battle out there. When you see the sort of ball that dismissed Kane Williamson, England's 353 might not be that bad. England will be happier at the end of the day than they were halfway through it. And BJ Watling gets in behind to defend. That's it for day two of the first Test at Mount Mauganui. New Zealand walk off on 144-4, trailing England by 209 runs. Henry Nicholls returns the favour, tickling it round the corner for one. BJ Watling to face the final ball of the day... BJ Watling taps a single. Henry Nicholls had to face that brutal Jofra Archer over and now has to see out the rest of this over. Cheers, mate. England captain Joe Root is bringing himself on for the final over of the day. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played November 2019 - Benjamin Netanyahu rails against corruption charges Israel's attorney general has charged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with bribery, fraud and breach of trust in connection with three separate cases.

The announcement comes amid a political stand-off in Israel following two inconclusive general elections in April and September.

They are also one of the reasons for the country's political paralysis. Mr Netanyahu has been seeking new laws granting him immunity from prosecution. That was one of factors driving the country's last two elections, and one reason why there's been a deadlock in forming a coalition government. Throughout, the prime minister has categorically denied doing anything wrong. Now he's in a difficult position. It was thought some of the charges might be reduced, but the attorney general has indicted him on the full count, including the most serious one: bribery. It is not clear what this means for Mr Netanyahu's future. According to Israeli law, he can stay in office until the final verdict - but his political allies will have to decide whether to stick with him in ongoing coalition negotiations. Members of the opposition said this was a sad day for Israel, but immediately called on Mr Netanyahu to step down and fight his case in court. It is unclear what this means for Mr Netanyahu's future. He is presumed innocent unless proven otherwise, and there is currently no legal barrier to him staying in office as prime minister. It could take many months before the cases are brought before a district court. And even if convicted, Mr Netanyahu would not be required to step down until the appeals process was exhausted - something that could take years. However, correspondents say many will question the prime minister's ability to handle affairs of state if he is simultaneously defending himself in court. Non-governmental organisations may petition the Supreme Court to force Mr Netanyahu to resign. The court has previously ruled that a cabinet minister charged with a crime must step down or be removed from office, and it would have to decide whether that should also apply to the prime minister. Allies of Mr Netanyahu in parliament may seek to pass legislation that would grant him immunity from prosecution while in office, and allow lawmakers to overrule a possible Supreme Court ruling reversing that immunity.

"This video can not be played November 2019 - Benjamin Netanyahu rails against corruption charges Israel's attorney general has charged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with bribery, fraud and breach of trust in connection with three separate cases. Mr Netanyahu is alleged to have accepted gifts from wealthy businessmen and dispensed favours to try to get more positive press coverage. The prime minister described the charges as an ""attempted coup"", blaming them on a ""tainted"" process. He has also insisted he will not resign and is not legally obliged to do so. In a televised speech, Mr Netanyahu said authorities ""weren't after the truth, they were after me"", and called on the country to ""investigate the investigators"". Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu: Commando turned PM Netanyahu: What are the allegations? Earlier, Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit said he made the decision ""with a heavy heart"", but said it showed nobody was above the law in Israel. ""Law enforcement is not a choice. It is not a matter of right or left. It's not a matter of politics,"" he said. The announcement comes amid a political stand-off in Israel following two inconclusive general elections in April and September. On Wednesday, Mr Netanyahu's rival for the premiership, Benny Gantz, said he had been unable to form a governing coalition with a majority in parliament. He had been given the opportunity to try after Mr Netanyahu had earlier failed to do so. Supporters of Mr Netanyahu gathered outside the official prime minister's residence to protest against the charges Demonstrators also came out against Mr Netanyahu President Reuven Rivlin asked lawmakers on Thursday to agree on a candidate for prime minister within 21 days and avoid an unprecedented third election in a year. After the charges were announced, Mr Gantz tweeted his support for the attorney general and law enforcement agencies, and wrote it was ""a very sad day"" for Israel. Attorney General Mandelblit said in February that he intended to indict Mr Netanyahu in connection with three cases - known as Case 1,000, Case 2,000 and Case 4,000 - pending final hearings that eventually took place last month. Case 1,000:Mr Netanyahu has been charged with fraud and breach of trust in this case. He is alleged to have received various high-value benefits, including pink champagne and cigars, in return for favours for a wealthy friend. Mr Netanyahu has said they were tokens of friendship and that he did not act inappropriately in exchange for them. The friend similarly denies any wrongdoing. Case 2,000:Mr Netanyahu faces charges of fraud and breach of trust in this case. He is alleged to have agreed a deal with the publisher of a major newspaper to promote legislation to weaken a rival daily in return for favourable coverage. The publisher has been charged with bribery. Like the prime minister, he denies any wrongdoing. Both men have said they did not intend to promote the matters discussed in their meetings, and the legislation was not passed. Case 4,000:This is considered the most serious case because Mr Netanyahu has been charged with bribery, as well as fraud and breach of trust. It is alleged that Mr Netanyahu promoted regulatory decisions that favoured a leading telecommunications company in return for favourable news coverage from one of its websites, as part of an agreement with the company's controlling shareholder. The prime minister has insisted experts supported the regulatory decisions and that he received nothing in return. The shareholder, who has been charged with bribery, also denies wrongdoing. This is a watershed moment for Israel. Benjamin Netanyahu's legal problems have plagued his last few years in office, causing him to focus increasingly on his political survival rather than on governing. They are also one of the reasons for the country's political paralysis. Mr Netanyahu has been seeking new laws granting him immunity from prosecution.

"John and Irene Hays of Hays Travel rescued 555 Thomas Cook shops Hays Travel, which bought Thomas Cook after it collapsed, has announced plans to hire an extra 1,500 staff. The travel agent has already taken on 2,330 former Thomas Cook employees. But now Hays plans to hire another 200 people at its head office in Sunderland, an extra 500 to handle foreign exchange, and an apprentice at each of its 737 branches. The move has been seen as a vote of confidence in the package holiday market. Hays took on all of Thomas Cook's 555 shops in October after the travel agent spectacularly collapsed earlier this year. Thomas Cook buyers pledge to save 2,500 jobs Who are the family buying Thomas Cook shops? Since then it has reopened 450 of those stores and hired a lot of its old staff. But now it is expanding further. John Hays, who runs the travel agent with his wife Irene, said: ""We're further increasing staffing to ensure we have the highest customer service levels across all of our stores and our head office functions."" He said applicants didn't need experience in the sector ""just an enthusiasm for travel"". The hiring spree will take Hays' workforce to 5,700 people. ""The former Thomas Cook managers have said the biggest difference for them is being empowered and valued - as an independent travel agent they are not tied to certain products or scripts and they feel trusted,"" Mr Hays said. ""This is a key principle of our business."" It is the latest sign of renewed confidence in the package holiday business. Earlier this week, EasyJet announced plans torelaunch its own package holiday operationin a bid to fill the gap in the market left by Thomas Cook. About 20 million people fly with EasyJet to Europe annually but only 500,000 book accommodation through it.

"The Conservatives have raised Â£5.7m in the first week of the official election campaign, according to the Electoral Commission. The Tories received 87% of registered donations in that period, figures show, while Labour raised a total of Â£218,500. The Lib Dems received Â£275,000, whilst the Brexit Party raised Â£250,000. But the figures do not represent all donations, as only those above Â£7,500 have to be reported. The biggest gift to the Tories was Â£1.5m from theatre producer and regular donor John Gore. Meanwhile, the largest single registered donation to Labour was Â£62,000 from the Unite union, led by Jeremy Corbyn ally Len McCluskey. Labour fined Â£12,500 by Electoral Commission Bequests to Tories exceed members' income BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the figures showed an ""astonishing gap in fundraising"". The discrepancy between the two main parties is even wider than in the first week of the 2017 campaign, when the Tories raised Â£4.1m in comparison to the Â£2.7m received by Labour. In addition, BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said he understood the Conservatives had raised more than Â£4m in unregistered smaller donations since the beginning of the election campaign. This is four times the Â£1m in small donations - averaging Â£26 each - that Labour says it has received over the same period. In the first week of the current campaign, the Green Party raised Â£30,000 in registered donations - half the Â£60,000 raised by the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland. This is the first UK-wide election when pre-poll donations and loan reports have been published for parties in Northern Ireland. Money received during the other weeks of the five-week official election campaign will be detailed in later releases. For Labour, 70% of registered donations came from unions. For the Conservatives, 47% of the party's donations came from individuals, with the remainder coming from companies. The party received Â£500,000 from investment firm WA Capital and the same from property company Countywide Developments. Another Tory donor, Lubov Chernukhin, the wife of a former minister for Russian President Vladimir Putin, gave Â£200,000 in the same period. The biggest donor to the Lib Dems was wealth management firm Attestor Services, which gave Â£75,000.

"Andy Anokye denies 31 charges, which include rape A rapper described as ""a violent and controlling narcissist and a bully"" imprisoned and repeatedly raped four young women, a court has heard. Andy Anokye, 32, who performs as Solo 45, denies 31 charges against him. They include 22 allegations of rape, five counts of false imprisonment, two of assault by penetration and two of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Prosecutor Christopher Quinlan told Bristol Crown Court the grime artist filmed some of his actions. ""Each suffered in similar ways at different times at the defendant's hands,"" he added. Mr Quinlan said the abuse took place over a two-year period. One of the women reported the abuse to friends and then to police, he said. Mr Anokye was arrested and his mobile phone and laptop were seized by officers, who contacted three other women. Mr Quinlan said the musician had filmed ""a great deal of what he did"" on his phone. ""He physically assaulted and falsely imprisoned them, held them against their will and he raped each of them repeatedly,"" he told the court. ""He is a violent and controlling narcissist and a bully. He is a sadist who derives satisfaction and sexual pleasure from inflicting pain and suffering on his victims."" Mr Quinlan said Mr Anokye, of Millennium Promenade, Bristol, will claim that any sexual activity between him and the women was consensual. Judge William Hart told jurors the defendant was a member of the grime collective, Boy Better Know. Mr Quinlan added Mr Anokye became known to each of the complainants through their ""knowledge and taste"" for grime music. He described the genre to the jury as ""dance music influenced by garage music"". ""Artists of that genre include Skepta and Stormzy,"" he said. ""Neither has anything to do with this case but you may hear reference to either or both of them during the evidence."" The jury of five men and seven women have been told they will view some of the recordings made by Anokye. ""You may find it both unpleasant and upsetting,"" Mr Quinlan said. ""It is important evidence. We promise you that to show it is not gratuitous but necessary."" The case continues.

"Labour's manifesto,externalincludes a pledge to be building 100,000 council houses and at least 50,000 affordable homes through housing associations a year by the end of the Parliament. Housing is devolved, so the party is talking about England only. This is a properly large number of homes to be building. To put it into context, a combination of council housing, housing associations and the private sector has managed to produce more than 150,000 dwellings in total for onlytwo of the past 10 years,external. The last year in which more than 100,000 council houses were built in England was 1977. And since the early 1990s, only a very few years have seen more than one or two thousand council houses built. But while local authorities tend not to be as involved in building houses as they once were, there are also homes not built by councils but still for social rent, of which6,287 were built in 2018-19,external. Labour, however, has been clear in its manifesto it is talking about homes ""built by councils for social rent"". And it defines social rent as being about half the cost of market rates. Perhaps the biggest challenge would be finding people to build these houses. The construction sector has beencomplaining about skills shortages,externalfor several years, so even diverting all the workers currently building homes for the private sector would not necessarily be enough. Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner told BBC News the key would be better training. ""We can get people into these courses and get people on the ground being able to do the work,"" she said. Asked about who these people might be given unemployment is at relatively low levels (1.3 million in themost recent figures,external), she said many of those on zero-hours contracts or having to work several jobs would prefer to be retrained. In 2017-18, there were 69,897 enrolments in further education courses in construction, planning and the built environment, while 44,570 people took part in apprenticeships in that area. Labour is separately committed to creating one million ""green"" jobs, of which just under half would be used to transform existing homes, so a lot of workers would need to be retrained into these sorts of roles. And on top of that, Labour is also committed to a big programme of infrastructure investment, covering things such as schools, hospitals and care homes, which would also require workers with construction skills. It's not just bricklayers, plasterers, carpenters, electricians and plumbers who would be needed - councils not currently geared up to large-scale housebuilding would also need to employ extra staff, as well as expanding their planning departments. Some of the people with these skills could be attracted from overseas but any sort of Brexit that did not keep the UK as part of the single market would probably make it harder for employers to hire workers from the rest of Europe. Labour has, however, given itself five years to be building 100,000 council houses and 50,000 housing association homes a year, which means there would be time to create the courses and get people trained to do the work, as well as preparing local authorities for the task. There are also questions about whether enough land could be found to build all these new properties on but if the government was sufficiently committed to the programme (and had a big enough majority) it could change the planning rules. There is not a specific costing for the housebuilding programme - it is part of Labour's Â£150bn Social Transformation Fund. So, there are significant challenges but if a Labour government spent the billions of pounds necessary to train workers, offered high enough wages to attract people to retrain and took the time and effort to push through the structural changes needed in local authorities and the planning system, this housebuilding target would not be impossible.

"Jeremy Corbyn always promised something different. He was chosen by his party in 2015 largely because he was such a contrast to the other candidates who seemed, fairly or unfairly,  somehow to merge into one. If his 2017 general election manifesto was exciting for those on the left of the Labour Party,today's publication,externalmight feel like their dreams have come true. Indeed, as the Labour leader went through his programme for the country at the party's manifesto launch today there was a sense that finally, after more than four years of being in charge, when he has often been tangled up in the party's own internal wars, he's been able to say what he really wants to do, and how he would really seek to achieve it. This isn't a souped-up version of Ed Miliband in 2015, it's not really a more full throttle version of 2017. Labour vows to 'transform' UK at manifesto launch What are the 12 key policies in the Labour manifesto? This is Labour's 2017 election manifesto with rocket boosters - several huge nationalisations, higher taxes for the wealthy and business, a rewiring of the rules on the economy, a huge expansion in the role of the state almost everywhere you look. This is big government. This has, of course, always been how Jeremy Corbyn and the hugely influential Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell think the country should be run. That's why for so long they were the rebels in their own party. There is nothing new for them in the broad principles they have laid out today. What they are gambling on, and many in their own party are really sceptical of, is whether a 21st century version of the beliefs they have stood by for so long can find favour with the country at large. Certainly the country faces big challenges. Clearly, many public services are stretched after years of a squeeze on public spending. There is no question that Jeremy Corbyn's transformation of the Labour Party has shifted the whole political compass round to the left. But that doesn't mean Labour can be confident at all that it means the country is hungry for a total reboot of the kind the party is promising. Polls at this stage suggest that most people are not that enthusiastic about change in such a dramatic way. Voters might like the idea of what one senior Labour figure simply described as 'lots of free stuff'. Perhaps the manifesto today could be the start of a breakthrough in this campaign. But there are doubts tonight about whether the plans are realistic, and whether the public would be willing in anything like enough numbers to put their trust in Mr Corbyn to make it happen.

"The Labour Party has launched its 2019 election manifesto, with the slogan It's Time For Real Change. It sets out the policies the party aims to introduce should it win the election. Thefull document,externalruns to 105 pages. But what are the promises that will grab the public's attention, and potentially win over voters on polling day, 12 December? The party also wants to cut private provision in the NHS. The 4.3% per year rise is at the top end of what health think tanks and analysts have been calling for. Labour would also have to find money to cover revenue lost from its pledges to scrap prescription, basic dentistry and hospital car parking charges. A key section covers Labour's plan to cut private provision in the NHS, which currently accounts for about 7% of the health budget in England. This would clearly involve outsourced contracts, for example for physiotherapy and community health. But will NHS hospitals suddenly see their waiting lists balloon as a result of operations outsourced to private hospitals being brought back into the public sector? And are these pledges longer-term aspirations or shorter-term priorities? Healthcare is devolved so these policies would apply to England only, but the devolved nations would benefit from the funding. This video can not be played ""Rail, mail, water and energy into public ownership"": Jeremy Corbyn launches Labour's manifesto Labour will renegotiate a new Brexit deal within three months, and hold a referendum on the deal or Remain within six months The short section called ""The Final Say on Brexit"" only begins on page 89 of this manifesto. The other main UK-wide parties have simple slogans, but Labour's policy is more complicated and doesn't fit on a manifesto cover or the side of a bus. It promises to renegotiate a new Brexit deal within three months, based on a new UK-EU customs union and close EU single market alignment. It would also give EU nationals living and working in the UK the automatic right to stay. That deal would then be put to a legally-binding referendum within six months, alongside the option to remain in the EU. Labour wants to appeal to both Leavers and Remainers and to give the people the final say. It would implement the referendum result immediately. But Mr Corbyn will not say how he would vote in it. And that continues to divert attention away from his other practical policies. This policy would apply to the whole of the UK. Update: On 22 November Jeremy Corbyn revealed that he would remain neutral if there was another referendum. What is Labour's Brexit plan? Will this be a Brexit election? It would boost anyone over the age of 25 earning the minimum wage, known as the National Living Wage. The Conservatives had already announced the living wage would gradually increase to Â£10.50 over the next six years. Labour is now promising more and faster, with all workers over 16 years old getting Â£10 an hour within the next year. It is an attempt to tackle the growing issue of in-work poverty. It's cheaper than other policy announcements because employers, rather than government, mostly pay the wages, but it's a big jump for them to swallow in a very short timeframe. Labour is also promising extra measures to boost workers' rights, including longer maternity and paternity pay, and guaranteed bereavement pay. This would apply to the whole of the UK. How high could the lowest wages go? Is the minimum wage enough to live on? Pension age would remain at 66 while retirement ages for those in arduous and stressful jobs will be reviewed. Not long ago, government number-crunchers suggested workers under 30 may not receive a state pension until they turned 70. So Labour's plan to freeze the state pension age at 66 for the foreseeable future has been called a ""gargantuan promise"" by one analyst. It would cost billions of pounds more than most recent government plans to raise the age for men and women to 68 by 2039. Yet, it would clearly be popular among middle-age voters. For existing pensioners, the so-called triple-lock - linking annual state pension rises to the highest of average earnings, the cost of living, or 2.5% - would continue, as all the major parties have promised. There are also pitches to specific groups. The so-called Waspi women - born in the 1950s and furious with ""surprise"" pension age changes - are promised compensation. This would apply to the whole of the UK. The fight over women's pensions Why 70 may be the new 65 Provide ""community-based, person-centred"" support in England, including free personal care. Labour's plan for a comprehensive National Care Service is bold. The question will be whether their costings stand-up to scrutiny. That is not just about the affordability of the plan now, but also its cost as the population ages. At the heart of the policy is free personal care for older people who need help with day-to-day tasks like washing, dressing and medication. This system already operates in Scotland, but in England, the idea was rejected 20 years ago by the then-Labour government as too expensive. There are also promises to double the number of people receiving help, so easing NHS pressures. Plans to reform the care system have ended up as political footballs in past elections - the challenge for Labour will be building a consensus around their ideas. Health and social care is devolved. This would apply to England only. Will Jeremy Corbyn's long march lead to power? To put the UK on track for a net-zero carbon energy system within the 2030s. The date for reducing carbon emissions to effectively zero is much sooner than the government envisages. It's not quite the neat formulation of ""net zero"" by 2030 that many party activists wanted (and the Green Party has promised). Instead, in one line, the document talks of achieving ""the substantial majority of our emissions reductions"" by 2030. In another, it mentions putting the UK ""on track for a net-zero carbon energy system within the 2030s"". Presumably that creates enough stretch room to get to 2040 - five years earlier than the Lib Dems' target year and 10 years earlier than the Tories. This policy would apply to the whole of the UK CONFUSED?Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external BREXIT:Where do the parties stand? The party will nationalise the so-called big six energy firms, National Grid, the water industry, Royal Mail, railways and the broadband arm of BT. Labour's manifesto is one of the most radical proposed overhauls of the way companies are owned and run in decades. It would mark the biggest ownership takeover by the state since the nationalisations that occurred after the outbreak of World War Two. Those companies that Labour does not want to own and operate themselves will also face a huge change in the way they are supervised by government. The current inhabitants of company boardrooms are very aware life would be very different under a Labour government. This policy would apply to the whole of the UK. How much could Labour's nationalisation plan cost? Start work on a new benefits system to replace controversial benefit. Labour's plan to scrap Universal Credit deals with its immediate concerns about the much-criticised benefit. However, the party does not say what it would replace it with. Universal Credit was originally introduced to tackle the complexity and unfairness of the existing benefits system. But many of the accompanying changes became linked to austerity measures like benefit caps. Going back to the system which Universal Credit replaced would create its own problems. And its introduction shows just how difficult it can be to devise a new system that works. Labour has said it will start work on ideas for a new system immediately, but getting that right is likely to take years. This would apply across the UK. There are also plans to scrap tuition fees and bring back maintenance grants for the poorest students. The controversial policy of abolishing private schools, voted through at conference, is being parked for the moment. But there is a firm commitment to remove their charitable tax status. The big pledge, as in 2017, is the abolition of tuition fees. Universities will worry that the commitment to find public money to replace them could come under pressure if public finances tighten. Scrapping tuition fees will benefit the wealthiest students most. Maintenance grants would be restored for the poorest. The combined cost is estimated at Â£12bn a year. On school funding, Labour's promise goes further than the Conservatives and Lib Dems. By 2022-2023, spending would be Â£10.5bn higher in cash terms, which would reverse cuts (and then some) made since 2010. Education is devolved. This would apply to England only. Labour will also bring the railways back into public ownership. Labour says it will bring the railways back into public ownership when the current rail franchises expire. The party says that means there will be no cost to the government as the contracts will have ended. However, it is unclear who will then own the trains and the associated costs. The use of driver-only operated trains will also be stopped, having caused years of disruption because of industrial action by disgruntled staff. Industry estimates this would cost more than Â£200m a year. And the bus system will fall under council control again while thousands of routes that have been cut will be reinstated. Free bus travel is also promised for under-25s. The costs for this are not provided in the manifesto. Labour promises a Â£250bn green transformation fund; HS2 will be built and extended into Scotland and long-suffering train passengers in the north of England will get ""Crossrail for the North"". Transport is partly devolved. Free bus travel for under-25s would apply to England only, while infrastructure projects and renationalisation would apply across the UK. It will mean EU citizens in the UK no longer have to apply to continue living and working in the country. The settlement scheme was set up by the Conservative government to formalise the rights of EU citizens to continue living and working in the UK after Brexit. Ministers have claimed the system is working well with applications from around 2.45 million people so far. But that means almost one million EU nationals have yet to sign up, raising concerns that some who have difficulty proving they've been in Britain could be at risk of deportation. Labour's proposal would end the worry and uncertainty for EU citizens in Britain, but it could create problems for border staff after Brexit in distinguishing between those who've already been living in the UK and new arrivals who may have certain restrictions. This policy would apply to the whole of the UK. Start a rapid programme of homebuilding. Labour's promise to build 100,000 council homes and 50,000 housing association properties a year by the end of the five-year Parliament marks a rapid change. Building on this scale has not been seen for 40 years. The UK's population is getting older and one in five people has a disability, so the type of homes proposed will face close scrutiny.  There are also questions over the availability of construction workers to build them. More people have rented from private landlords than social ones since 2013. Many are aged under 35. For them, rent controls would aim to keep down costs by linking rent rises to inflation (the cost of living) and giving city authorities the power to be even stricter. This will reignite debate over their effectiveness. The plan for a new Department for Housing shows how central this area is to Labour's key policies. Housing is devolved so this policy would apply to England only.

"Labour was the second biggest party in the House of Commons, with 243 MPs out of 650 seats, when Parliament was dissolved on 6 November. Jeremy Corbyn. He is a 70-year-old former union official, and has been an MP for just over 36 years. He became leader in 2015 in a surprise election win. He had never previously been a government minister or held high office in the Labour Party. He has a loyal fan base as an anti-war, and anti-spending cuts, campaigner. Profile: Will Jeremy Corbyn's long march lead to power?

The referendum would be a choice between a ""credible"" Leave option versus Remain. Under its Leave option, Labour says it will negotiate for the UK to remain in an EU customs union, and retain a ""close"" single market relationship. This would allow the UK to continue trading with the EU without checks, but it would prevent it from striking its own trade deals with other countries. It says it will achieve this within six months. Where do the parties stand on Brexit? Labour is a socialist party - that means it wants to tax the rich to pay for better public services, give workers more rights and take control of things like the railways, the Royal Mail, energy and water supply, so they are not run for private profit.

"This video can not be played Fiona Hill: Sondland was involved in a ""domestic political errand"" for Trump US President Donald Trump disregarded senior advisers and pushed a false theory that Ukraine had meddled in the 2016 election, an ex-White House aide has told the impeachment inquiry. Fiona Hill said the president had instead listened to the views of his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. Ms Hill called the claims about Ukraine a ""fictional narrative"". The inquiry is assessing if Mr Trump withheld aid to pressure Ukraine to investigate a political rival. It is illegal in the US to seek foreign help to gain electoral advantage. Mr Trump denies any wrongdoing. According to a discredited theory, it was Ukrainians or individuals with Ukrainian connections who had interfered in the 2016 vote, rather than Russia. UK coal miner's daughter turned White House aide Three Republican claims fact-checked The hearing as it happened In a phone call with the Ukrainian president, President Trump urged him to look into the claims as well as open an investigation into Joe Biden, one of the main Democratic presidential candidates. Thursday was the fifth and last scheduled day of public hearings by the House Intelligence Committee. Concluding the proceedings, inquiry chairman Democrat Adam Schiff said Mr Trump's conduct had been far more serious than anything done by President Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal in the 1970s. ""What we've seen here is far more serious than a third-rate burglary of the Democratic headquarters,"" he said. ""What we're talking about here is the withholding of recognition in that White House meeting [and] the withholding of military aid to an ally at war."" Ms Hill - the former top Russia expert to the White House - accused other members of Mr Trump's Republican party of sowing doubt about Russian interference in the 2016 elections. This video can not be played This week's impeachment hearings in three minutes ""Based on questions and statements I have heard, some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against our country - and that perhaps, somehow, for some reason, Ukraine did,"" she said. She urged lawmakers not to promote ""politically driven falsehoods"" that cast doubt on Russia's interference in US elections. ""This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves,"" she said. Democratic lawyer Daniel Goldman asked her: ""So is it your understanding then that President Trump disregarded the advice of his senior officials about this theory and instead listened to Rudy Giuliani's views?"" ""That appears to be the case, yes,"" she replied. She also warned that Mr Giuliani had been making ""explosive"" and ""incendiary"" claims about Ukraine. ""He was clearly pushing forward issues and ideas that would, you know, probably come back to haunt us,"" she testified. ""I think that's where we are today."" This video can not be played 'The president's voice was loud and recognisable' - what an aide overheard. She testified to having had a couple of ""testy encounters"" with Gordon Sondland -the US ambassador to the EU who testified on Wednesday- over Ukraine, because Mr Sondland had not kept her informed of ""all the meetings he was having"". But she later realised he had had a ""different remit"". ""He was running a personal domestic political errand, we were concerned with national security,"" she said. US diplomat to Ukraine David Holmes, who also testified at Thursday's hearing, said his work at the embassy in Kyiv had been overshadowed this year by the actions of Mr Giuliani. ""I became aware that Mr Giuliani, a private lawyer, was taking a direct role in Ukrainian diplomacy,"" Mr Holmes said. Mr Holmes was ""shocked"" on 18 July when an official from the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) announced that military aid to Ukraine was being withheld. ""The official said the order had come from the president and had been conveyed to OMB by Mr Mulvaney with no further explanation,"" Mr Holmes said, referring to acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney. Mr Holmes saidhe had overheard a phone call on 26 July between Mr Trump and Mr Sondlandthat was potentially damaging for Mr Trump. Mr Sondland, in his hearing appearance on Wednesday, confirmed the two men had discussed ""the investigations"" the president wanted Ukraine to launch during this call Five key Sondland moments - analysed ""When the president came on, [Sondland] sort of winced and held the phone away from his ear like this,"" Mr Holmes said, gesturing with his hands.

"A number of orphaned British children caught up in the war in Syria are to be brought home to the UK, the foreign secretary has said. They will be the first UK citizens to be repatriated from the area of north-eastern Syria formerly controlled by the Islamic State (IS) group. The ""innocent"" children should ""never have been subjected to the horrors of war"", Dominic Raab said. Charities have urged the government to bring every British child back home. Those who are returning are expected to arrive in the UK in the coming days. For security reasons, further details of their repatriation cannot be given. In a statement, Mr Raab said: ""We have facilitated their return home, because it was the right thing to do. ""Now they must be allowed the privacy and given the support to return to a normal life."" BBC Middle East Correspondent Quentin Sommerville said the orphaned children were handed over to a delegation from the Foreign Office and had left Syria, with diplomats saying they were doing ""very well"". IS once controlled 88,000 sq km (34,000 sq miles) of territory stretching from western Syria to eastern Iraq. The fate of foreign IS fighters and other foreigners caught up in the conflict has been a key issue since the defeat of the extremist group was declared in March 2019. The UK had been reluctant to take back citizens from the area. Other countries including France, Denmark, Norway and Kazakhstan have brought children home. The United Nations has said countries should take responsibility for their own citizens unless they are to be prosecuted in Syria in accordance with international standards. The rise and fall of the Islamic State group Save The Children - which runs services from two centres in northern Syria - welcomed the repatriation of the orphaned children but called on the government to do more. The charity estimates there are up to 60 British children still in Syrian camps, the majority of which are with their mothers. Orla Minogue, a humanitarian adviser at the charity, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the children are facing ""absolutely dire"" conditions, including overcrowding, a shortage of clean water and limited medical care. ""Those children are just as innocent as those others,"" she said. And she urged the government to act quickly, warning of a ""brief time window"" to getting them out safely. ""All of these children need to be repatriated now - especially as we head into winter conditions - these camps are not set up for this kind of harsh weather we might see in Syria."" Human Rights Watch has described government-facilitated repatriations of foreign nationals as ""piecemeal."" It says more than 1,200 foreign nationals have been repatriated from both Syria and Iraq to Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Russia, Kosovo, and Turkey. Alison Griffin, head of humanitarian campaigns at Save The Children, said the UK government ""is transforming the lives of these innocent children who have been through terrible things that are far beyond their control"". She added: ""They will now have the precious chance to recover, have happy childhoods and live full lives. We should be proud of everyone who has worked to make this happen. ""Every child saved is a triumph of compassion in the face of cruelty. We fervently hope this is just the start.""

"This video can not be played Fiona Hill: Sondland was involved in a ""domestic political errand"" for Trump US President Donald Trump disregarded senior advisers and pushed a false theory that Ukraine had meddled in the 2016 election, an ex-White House aide has told the impeachment inquiry. Fiona Hill said the president had instead listened to the views of his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. Ms Hill called the claims about Ukraine a ""fictional narrative"". The inquiry is assessing if Mr Trump withheld aid to pressure Ukraine to investigate a political rival. It is illegal in the US to seek foreign help to gain electoral advantage. Mr Trump denies any wrongdoing. According to a discredited theory, it was Ukrainians or individuals with Ukrainian connections who had interfered in the 2016 vote, rather than Russia. UK coal miner's daughter turned White House aide Three Republican claims fact-checked The hearing as it happened In a phone call with the Ukrainian president, President Trump urged him to look into the claims as well as open an investigation into Joe Biden, one of the main Democratic presidential candidates. Thursday was the fifth and last scheduled day of public hearings by the House Intelligence Committee. Concluding the proceedings, inquiry chairman Democrat Adam Schiff said Mr Trump's conduct had been far more serious than anything done by President Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal in the 1970s. ""What we've seen here is far more serious than a third-rate burglary of the Democratic headquarters,"" he said. ""What we're talking about here is the withholding of recognition in that White House meeting [and] the withholding of military aid to an ally at war."" Ms Hill - the former top Russia expert to the White House - accused other members of Mr Trump's Republican party of sowing doubt about Russian interference in the 2016 elections. This video can not be played This week's impeachment hearings in three minutes ""Based on questions and statements I have heard, some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against our country - and that perhaps, somehow, for some reason, Ukraine did,"" she said. She urged lawmakers not to promote ""politically driven falsehoods"" that cast doubt on Russia's interference in US elections. ""This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves,"" she said. Democratic lawyer Daniel Goldman asked her: ""So is it your understanding then that President Trump disregarded the advice of his senior officials about this theory and instead listened to Rudy Giuliani's views?"" ""That appears to be the case, yes,"" she replied. She also warned that Mr Giuliani had been making ""explosive"" and ""incendiary"" claims about Ukraine. ""He was clearly pushing forward issues and ideas that would, you know, probably come back to haunt us,"" she testified. ""I think that's where we are today."" This video can not be played 'The president's voice was loud and recognisable' - what an aide overheard. She testified to having had a couple of ""testy encounters"" with Gordon Sondland -the US ambassador to the EU who testified on Wednesday- over Ukraine, because Mr Sondland had not kept her informed of ""all the meetings he was having"". But she later realised he had had a ""different remit"". ""He was running a personal domestic political errand, we were concerned with national security,"" she said. US diplomat to Ukraine David Holmes, who also testified at Thursday's hearing, said his work at the embassy in Kyiv had been overshadowed this year by the actions of Mr Giuliani. ""I became aware that Mr Giuliani, a private lawyer, was taking a direct role in Ukrainian diplomacy,"" Mr Holmes said. Mr Holmes was ""shocked"" on 18 July when an official from the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) announced that military aid to Ukraine was being withheld. ""The official said the order had come from the president and had been conveyed to OMB by Mr Mulvaney with no further explanation,"" Mr Holmes said, referring to acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney. Mr Holmes saidhe had overheard a phone call on 26 July between Mr Trump and Mr Sondlandthat was potentially damaging for Mr Trump. Mr Sondland, in his hearing appearance on Wednesday, confirmed the two men had discussed ""the investigations"" the president wanted Ukraine to launch during this call Five key Sondland moments - analysed ""When the president came on, [Sondland] sort of winced and held the phone away from his ear like this,"" Mr Holmes said, gesturing with his hands.

"Helen McCourt was murdered by Ian Simms in Billinge, Merseyside, in 1988 The mother of a murder victim is ""horrified"" her daughter's killer will be freed despite never revealing where her body is. Ian Simms, 63, was jailed in 1989 for murdering Helen McCourt who disappeared in February 1988 aged 22. He was originally sentenced to a minimum of 16 years. The killer was considered for parole for the seventh time on 8 November and officials said he ""met the test for release"". Simms killed Ms McCourt as she walked home from work in Liverpool. Her mother Marie said she was left shaking with anger after receiving a call earlier from her victim liaison officer at the parole board confirming Simms' release. Ian Simms, seen here in 1988, was jailed for murder ""I'm just in a state of shock to be honest,"" Mrs McCourt said, from the family home in Billinge near St Helens, Merseyside. ""I've just had some forms come through, I think that's on what grounds the parole board has granted him release on licence, but I don't know all the conditions. ""I was just in shock. I'm still trying to deal with it. I'm horrified by it, I'm horrified by it. This man is a danger."" She has urged the next government to introduce Helen's Law, legislation that would deny parole to killers who do not disclose their victims' remains. The bill recently ran out of time, when the general election was called. Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent It feels wrong, unjust and unfair that a convicted murderer can be freed from jail without giving any clue as to where their victim's body is, but parole decisions are not based on fairness. They're about assessing objectively whether an offender can be safely managed outside prison after they've served the minimum term, the punishment part, of their sentence. In Simms' case it appears the Parole Board did consider his refusal to divulge where Helen McCourt's remains are, but weighed that alongside numerous other factors. It is hard to see, therefore, how Helen's Law would have made a difference in this case. It does no more than ""require"" the Board to take the non-disclosure of information by an offender into account when determining if they should be let out. However, the Bill, backed by the Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats, will be reintroduced when parliament sits again after the election, and when it becomes law may well affect cases in the future - a lasting legacy of Marie McCourt's tireless campaigning. Simms was denied release at a hearing in 2016, but was subsequently transferred to an open prison ""due to progress made"", where he has ""followed the rules"" when granted temporary release. The Parole Board said it had ""carefully considered"" Simms' failure to reveal where he concealed Ms McCourt's body and concluded there is ""no prospect of Simms ever disclosing the whereabouts of his victim even if he were kept in prison until he died"". The board added the refusal continues to cause understandable distress and misery to the victim's family and the panel concluded this demonstrated a lack of empathy. But it said denial was not a ""necessarily-determining factor"" and also considered evidence from two psychologists who recommended release. This video can not be played 'Why should he be let out to torture us some more?' The Parole Board said: ""The progress that Mr Simms has made, the considerable change in his behaviour, the fact that he has not been involved in any violence or substance misuse for many years, his protective factors, the recommendations from all the professionals and all the evidence presented at the hearing, the panel was satisfied that Mr Simms met the test for release."" Mum 'running out of time' to find daughter's body Killers face parole refusal over hidden bodies Mum's anger at killer's prison day trips Mrs McCourt has described not knowing the whereabouts of her daughter's body as ""torture"". ""If Helen's Law had been on the statute books right now those judges would have to really make sure in their decision to release him that he would be safe. ""They would have to go into that, they would have to obey that law and it hasn't happened."" She added she did not know when or where Simms would be released and had ""very little to go on"".

"This video can not be played The history stolen by metal detectorists Two metal detectorists stole a Â£3m Viking hoard that experts say has the potential to ""rewrite history"". George Powell and Layton Davies dug up about 300 coins in a field in Eye, near Leominster, Herefordshire, in 2015. They did not declare the 1,100-year-old find, said to be one of the biggest to date, and instead sold it to dealers. They were convicted of theft and concealing their find. Coin sellers Simon Wicks and Paul Wells were also convicted on the concealment charge. Most of the estimated 300 coins believed to be in the hoard are still missing The hoard included a 9th Century gold ring, a dragon's head bracelet, a silver ingot and a crystal rock pendant. Just 31 coins - worth between Â£10,000 and Â£50,000 - and some pieces of jewellery have been recovered, but the majority is still missing. ""They must be concealed in one or more places or by now having been concealed have been dispersed never to be reassembled as a hoard of such coinage again,"" prosecutor, Kevin Hegarty QC, said. During their trial at Worcester Crown Court, Powell, 38, of Newport, and Davies, 51, of Pontypridd, had denied deliberately ignoring the Treasure Act, which demands significant finds be declared. Experts say the coins, which are Saxon and believed to have been hidden by a Viking, provide fresh information about the unification of England and show there was an alliance previously not thought to exist between the kings of Mercia and Wessex. ""These coins enable us to re-interpret our history at a key moment in the creation of England as a single kingdom,"" according to Gareth Williams, curator of early medieval coins at the British Museum. Layton Davies, George Powell, Paul Wells and Simon Wicks were convicted by a jury at Worcester Crown Court When Powell and Davies made their discovery in June 2015, they did not inform the farmer who owned the field and instead contacted dealers to find out the worth of the items. A month later, they contacted the National Museum of Wales but only declared one coin each and three items of jewellery. Both men claimed talk of a 300-coin hoard had been a rumour, but suspicions were aroused and police began to investigate. They recovered deleted photos on Davies's phone which showed the hoard intact in a freshly dug hole. The Â£3m crime which 'deprived heritage' Â£3m coin hoard theft accused 'in it for the money' The court heard the detectorists had been meeting Wicks, from Hailsham, and Wells, from Cardiff, to release the coins on to the market. Wicks, Powell and Davies were also found guilty of converting the stolen hoard into cash after police traced several coins which had been sold to private collectors. Wells told the court he knew the coins should be declared, but was himself found to have hidden five in a magnifying glass handle. Alfred the Great is the most famous Anglo Saxon king and ruled Wessex from 871 to 899 The recovered coins were issued by two separate, but neighbouring, kingdoms in the late 9th Century: Wessex and Mercia. Wessex at the time was ruled by the famous Alfred the Great and Mercia by the lesser known Ceolwulf II, who ""just disappears from history without a trace"" when the hoard was buried around the year 879, Mr Williams said. ""What the coins show, beyond any possible doubt, is that there was actually an alliance between Alfred and Ceolwulf,"" Mr Williams continued, as they were sharing a coin design. ""And yet a few years later, Ceolwulf is dismissed by historians at Alfred's court. He's written out of history, but the coins show a different picture. ""This is a find of national importance from a key moment in the unification of England. ""It comes just at the moment when the Vikings were attacking in a large way."" Peter Reavill, the finds liaison officer for the British Museum in Shropshire and Herefordshire, said it was a concern hobbyists like Powell and Davies could prioritise personal financial gain over national interests. ""It will be so easy for really important objects just to slip through the net, mostly due to individuals' greed. ""Important information has been lost forever. That's our heritage, everyone's heritage, that's being lost in the hope of financial gain and I think that's terrible,"" Mr Williams added. Among the hoard was a crystal pendant that dates to around AD600 Who buried the hoard and why? Although most of the hoard is Anglo Saxon, Mr Williams has no doubt it was gathered and buried by a Viking. A Viking army is known to have been in the area at the time, he said, attacking the Wessex and Mercia kingdoms including the Battle of Edington, Wiltshire, in 878 against Alfred the Great, one year before the hoard is thought to have been buried. ""It was probably buried to preserve it from other Vikings as well as Anglo Saxons,"" Mr Williams said, ""and for whatever reason the person who buried it wasn't able to go back and recover it"". Amanda Blakeman, West Mercia Police's Deputy Chief Constable, said the men were looking to ""criminally profit from removing the historical footprint of our country"". ""It's absolutely critical that we protect our heritage, our history, and we bring offenders to justice who are looking to profit from something that is owned by the community,"" she said. Ms Blakeman has recently been appointed as the national leader for heritage and cultural crime and has established police and expert networks to help tackle these ""complex and protracted"" investigations in the future. ""We must recover that property and we must cut off those markets that are available to be able to disperse our history, not only across this country, but across the world,"" she said. All four men were convicted of ignoring the law which states significant finds must be declared As the verdicts were read out, an ambulance was called for Wells who became unwell. Court was adjourned until Friday for sentencing and the other defendants were remanded in custody. Judge Nicholas Cartwright said: ""I am not going to admit George Powell bail, he's going to be sentenced for theft of items worth millions of pounds and is facing a very long sentence of imprisonment and in addition to that there will inevitably be a confiscation process. ""There are hidden assets by way of unrecovered treasure worth a very large sum, probably millions of pounds, so there's the prospect of a very long default period of imprisonment should the assets remain hidden.""

His parents havebegun legal actionagainst the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO). Mr Raab said the government needed to ""protect taxpayers' money"".

Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said seeking legal costs from Harry Dunn's family was about protecting taxpayer's money Mr Dunn was fatally injured on 27 August, when his motorbike was in collision with a car owned by Anne Sacoolas, 42, outside RAF Croughton, where her husband Jonathan was an intelligence officer. Mrs Sacoolas left the UK claiming diplomatic immunity but the family are seeking a judicial review of that decision.

"A number of orphaned British children caught up in the war in Syria are to be brought home to the UK, the foreign secretary has said. They will be the first UK citizens to be repatriated from the area of north-eastern Syria formerly controlled by the Islamic State (IS) group. The ""innocent"" children should ""never have been subjected to the horrors of war"", Dominic Raab said. Charities have urged the government to bring every British child back home. Those who are returning are expected to arrive in the UK in the coming days. For security reasons, further details of their repatriation cannot be given. In a statement, Mr Raab said: ""We have facilitated their return home, because it was the right thing to do. ""Now they must be allowed the privacy and given the support to return to a normal life."" BBC Middle East Correspondent Quentin Sommerville said the orphaned children were handed over to a delegation from the Foreign Office and had left Syria, with diplomats saying they were doing ""very well"". IS once controlled 88,000 sq km (34,000 sq miles) of territory stretching from western Syria to eastern Iraq. The fate of foreign IS fighters and other foreigners caught up in the conflict has been a key issue since the defeat of the extremist group was declared in March 2019. The UK had been reluctant to take back citizens from the area. Other countries including France, Denmark, Norway and Kazakhstan have brought children home. The United Nations has said countries should take responsibility for their own citizens unless they are to be prosecuted in Syria in accordance with international standards. The rise and fall of the Islamic State group Save The Children - which runs services from two centres in northern Syria - welcomed the repatriation of the orphaned children but called on the government to do more. The charity estimates there are up to 60 British children still in Syrian camps, the majority of which are with their mothers. Orla Minogue, a humanitarian adviser at the charity, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the children are facing ""absolutely dire"" conditions, including overcrowding, a shortage of clean water and limited medical care. ""Those children are just as innocent as those others,"" she said. And she urged the government to act quickly, warning of a ""brief time window"" to getting them out safely. ""All of these children need to be repatriated now - especially as we head into winter conditions - these camps are not set up for this kind of harsh weather we might see in Syria."" Human Rights Watch has described government-facilitated repatriations of foreign nationals as ""piecemeal."" It says more than 1,200 foreign nationals have been repatriated from both Syria and Iraq to Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Russia, Kosovo, and Turkey. Alison Griffin, head of humanitarian campaigns at Save The Children, said the UK government ""is transforming the lives of these innocent children who have been through terrible things that are far beyond their control"". She added: ""They will now have the precious chance to recover, have happy childhoods and live full lives. We should be proud of everyone who has worked to make this happen.

"Helen McCourt was murdered by Ian Simms in Billinge, Merseyside, in 1988 The mother of a murder victim is ""horrified"" her daughter's killer will be freed despite never revealing where her body is. Ian Simms, 63, was jailed in 1989 for murdering Helen McCourt who disappeared in February 1988 aged 22. He was originally sentenced to a minimum of 16 years. The killer was considered for parole for the seventh time on 8 November and officials said he ""met the test for release"". Simms killed Ms McCourt as she walked home from work in Liverpool. Her mother Marie said she was left shaking with anger after receiving a call earlier from her victim liaison officer at the parole board confirming Simms' release. Ian Simms, seen here in 1988, was jailed for murder ""I'm just in a state of shock to be honest,"" Mrs McCourt said, from the family home in Billinge near St Helens, Merseyside. ""I've just had some forms come through, I think that's on what grounds the parole board has granted him release on licence, but I don't know all the conditions. ""I was just in shock. I'm still trying to deal with it. I'm horrified by it, I'm horrified by it. This man is a danger."" She has urged the next government to introduce Helen's Law, legislation that would deny parole to killers who do not disclose their victims' remains. The bill recently ran out of time, when the general election was called. Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent It feels wrong, unjust and unfair that a convicted murderer can be freed from jail without giving any clue as to where their victim's body is, but parole decisions are not based on fairness. They're about assessing objectively whether an offender can be safely managed outside prison after they've served the minimum term, the punishment part, of their sentence. In Simms' case it appears the Parole Board did consider his refusal to divulge where Helen McCourt's remains are, but weighed that alongside numerous other factors. It is hard to see, therefore, how Helen's Law would have made a difference in this case. It does no more than ""require"" the Board to take the non-disclosure of information by an offender into account when determining if they should be let out. However, the Bill, backed by the Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats, will be reintroduced when parliament sits again after the election, and when it becomes law may well affect cases in the future - a lasting legacy of Marie McCourt's tireless campaigning. Simms was denied release at a hearing in 2016, but was subsequently transferred to an open prison ""due to progress made"", where he has ""followed the rules"" when granted temporary release. The Parole Board said it had ""carefully considered"" Simms' failure to reveal where he concealed Ms McCourt's body and concluded there is ""no prospect of Simms ever disclosing the whereabouts of his victim even if he were kept in prison until he died"". The board added the refusal continues to cause understandable distress and misery to the victim's family and the panel concluded this demonstrated a lack of empathy. But it said denial was not a ""necessarily-determining factor"" and also considered evidence from two psychologists who recommended release. This video can not be played 'Why should he be let out to torture us some more?' The Parole Board said: ""The progress that Mr Simms has made, the considerable change in his behaviour, the fact that he has not been involved in any violence or substance misuse for many years, his protective factors, the recommendations from all the professionals and all the evidence presented at the hearing, the panel was satisfied that Mr Simms met the test for release."" Mum 'running out of time' to find daughter's body Killers face parole refusal over hidden bodies Mum's anger at killer's prison day trips Mrs McCourt has described not knowing the whereabouts of her daughter's body as ""torture"". ""If Helen's Law had been on the statute books right now those judges would have to really make sure in their decision to release him that he would be safe. ""They would have to go into that, they would have to obey that law and it hasn't happened."" She added she did not know when or where Simms would be released and had ""very little to go on"".

"Superintendent Jeff Eakins said many of those buried at the site were children The graves of 145 people have been discovered under a high school in Tampa, in the US state of Florida. They are part of Ridgewood Cemetery, a mid-20th Century cemetery for the poor. The coffins - buried 3-5ft (1-1.5m) deep - were discovered using ground-penetrating radar after the school was alerted about the possible location of the cemetery. Records indicate more than 250 people were buried there, most of them African Americans, the school district said. Up to 77 of them were infants or small children. The city opened Ridgewood in 1942 and sold it off to a private company in 1957. The school district acquired the land in 1959, opening King High School in 1960. Today, the site consists of open land and the school's agricultural building. Ferguson: The other young black lives laid to rest in Michael Brown's cemetery Large '1,400-year-old cemetery' uncovered Plans are being made to have the building removed, according to school district Superintendent Jeff Eakins. ""We want to make sure that the folks buried at this site are honoured,"" he said. While the radar used can't confirm what exactly is under the surface, the patterns of the findings matched historical records of the cemetery. As for the graves that have not been accounted for, some may have been moved or not picked up by the radar because they have deteriorated or, in the case of children, their small size. ""I am sick of this. This hurts deeply,"" Yvette Lewis, president of the local branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, was quoted as saying by the Tampa Bay Times. ""It was hate toward people who looked like me. It deeply saddens me that people can hate you this much, that they can treat you less than.""

"Mr Salmond arrived at the High Court in Edinburgh ahead of the hearing before Lady Dorrian Alex Salmond has appeared in court charged with carrying out a series of sexual offences against 10 women while serving as Scotland's first minister. Mr Salmond faced a total of 14 charges at the High Court in Edinburgh. He denies all the allegations, which include one attempted rape, one intent to rape, 10 sexual assaults and two indecent assaults.

"Emilia Clarke's role as Daenerys Targaryen in Game of Thrones initially required her to take her clothes off Directors UK has published its first guidelines for scenes involving nudity and simulated sex. The body that represents UK TV and film directors is aiming to show best practice for working with actors, intimacy coordinators, and others. The news comes a day after Emilia Clarke said shefound Game of Thrones' nude scenes ""hard""and that she was pressured to go naked in other roles. ""Everyone deserves the right to feel safe at work,"" Directors UK said. ""This is just as true when working on a Hollywood blockbuster as it is on a prime-time drama or a debut short film."" The new guidelines, which are supported by industry bodies including Bafta, Equity, the BFI and the Casting Directors' Guild, come in the wake of the#MeToo movementand allegations that some bosses demanded sexual favours for acting work. The guidelines advise a ban on full nudity in any audition or call back and no semi-nudity in first auditions. The document states that ""by their nature, auditions are based on a power imbalance"", and that ""some performers can feel obligated to agree to uncomfortable requests to get a job"".

Productions must also obtain explicit written consent from the performer prior to them being filmed or photographed nude or semi-nude.

The Bafta-winning director, whose work includes Generation Kill, Parade's End and Bleak House, added: ""Throughout my career, I have seen how vitally important it is to know how to approach sensitive content with professionalism. ""The guidelines created by Directors UK set the standard for directing intimate scenes, and will help to foster a safe working environment for everyone on a film or television set."" A statement from Bafta described Directors UK as being ""hugely instrumental"" in addressing ""bullying and harassment"" in the industry. ""They've really embraced the agenda and have created a suite of additional resources which build on the guidance and help their members not only to tackle poor behaviour when they witness it, but also to recognise their role in creating an environment where bullying, harassment and all kinds of coercive behaviour are not tolerated.""

Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said seeking legal costs from Harry Dunn's family was about protecting taxpayer's money Mr Dunn was fatally injured on 27 August, when his motorbike was in collision with a car owned by Anne Sacoolas, 42, outside RAF Croughton, where her husband Jonathan was an intelligence officer. Mrs Sacoolas left the UK claiming diplomatic immunity but the family are seeking a judicial review of that decision. Northamptonshire Police interviewed Mrs Sacoolasin the US in Octoberand a file was handed to the Crown Prosecution Service earlier this month. Mrs Charles said: ""We do not understand why it is taking so long to come to a charging decision, when the evidence shows that it really is straight forward."" Radd Seiger, the family's spokesman, said: ""If [Mr Raab] is so concerned about taxpayers' money in the litigation then he would come and talk to us to find a resolution, rather than risking having taxpayers themselves paying a very expensive legal bill if the FCO lose."" A spokesman for FCO said: ""We have deep sympathy for Harry's family. We have done and will continue to do everything we properly can to ensure that justice is done. ""As the foreign secretary set out in Parliament, the individual involved had diplomatic immunity whilst in the country under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations."" He added it was ""usual government practice to seek costs in legal challenges of this kind"".

He added: ""The only proper place to answer criminal charges is in this court, and that is exactly what I intend to do next spring."" The charges are set out in an indictment which includes the specific details of the allegations against the 64-year-old former SNP leader. The attempted rape is said to have happened in June 2014 at the first minister's official Bute House residence in Edinburgh.

"Helen McCourt was murdered by Ian Simms in Billinge, Merseyside, in 1988 The mother of a murder victim is ""horrified"" her daughter's killer will be freed despite never revealing where her body is. Ian Simms, 63, was jailed in 1989 for murdering Helen McCourt who disappeared in February 1988 aged 22. He was originally sentenced to a minimum of 16 years. The killer was considered for parole for the seventh time on 8 November and officials said he ""met the test for release"". Simms killed Ms McCourt as she walked home from work in Liverpool. Her mother Marie said she was left shaking with anger after receiving a call earlier from her victim liaison officer at the parole board confirming Simms' release. Ian Simms, seen here in 1988, was jailed for murder ""I'm just in a state of shock to be honest,"" Mrs McCourt said, from the family home in Billinge near St Helens, Merseyside. ""I've just had some forms come through, I think that's on what grounds the parole board has granted him release on licence, but I don't know all the conditions. ""I was just in shock. I'm still trying to deal with it. I'm horrified by it, I'm horrified by it. This man is a danger."" She has urged the next government to introduce Helen's Law, legislation that would deny parole to killers who do not disclose their victims' remains. The bill recently ran out of time, when the general election was called. Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent It feels wrong, unjust and unfair that a convicted murderer can be freed from jail without giving any clue as to where their victim's body is, but parole decisions are not based on fairness. They're about assessing objectively whether an offender can be safely managed outside prison after they've served the minimum term, the punishment part, of their sentence. In Simms' case it appears the Parole Board did consider his refusal to divulge where Helen McCourt's remains are, but weighed that alongside numerous other factors. It is hard to see, therefore, how Helen's Law would have made a difference in this case. It does no more than ""require"" the Board to take the non-disclosure of information by an offender into account when determining if they should be let out. However, the Bill, backed by the Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats, will be reintroduced when parliament sits again after the election, and when it becomes law may well affect cases in the future - a lasting legacy of Marie McCourt's tireless campaigning. Simms was denied release at a hearing in 2016, but was subsequently transferred to an open prison ""due to progress made"", where he has ""followed the rules"" when granted temporary release. The Parole Board said it had ""carefully considered"" Simms' failure to reveal where he concealed Ms McCourt's body and concluded there is ""no prospect of Simms ever disclosing the whereabouts of his victim even if he were kept in prison until he died"". The board added the refusal continues to cause understandable distress and misery to the victim's family and the panel concluded this demonstrated a lack of empathy. But it said denial was not a ""necessarily-determining factor"" and also considered evidence from two psychologists who recommended release. This video can not be played 'Why should he be let out to torture us some more?' The Parole Board said: ""The progress that Mr Simms has made, the considerable change in his behaviour, the fact that he has not been involved in any violence or substance misuse for many years, his protective factors, the recommendations from all the professionals and all the evidence presented at the hearing, the panel was satisfied that Mr Simms met the test for release."" Mum 'running out of time' to find daughter's body Killers face parole refusal over hidden bodies Mum's anger at killer's prison day trips Mrs McCourt has described not knowing the whereabouts of her daughter's body as ""torture"". ""If Helen's Law had been on the statute books right now those judges would have to really make sure in their decision to release him that he would be safe. ""They would have to go into that, they would have to obey that law and it hasn't happened."" She added she did not know when or where Simms would be released and had ""very little to go on"".

"Samuel L Jackson (left) and Anthony Mackie star in The Banker Apple has cancelled the world premiere of one of its streaming service's first original movies while it investigates ""concerns"" about the film. The Banker is based on the true story of two black businessmen who overcame racial prejudice by enlisting a white man to front their bank in 1960s Texas. Apple did not give details about the nature of the concerns. ButHollywood media reported,externalthey related to complaints from the children of one of the men, Bernard Garrett. The red carpet premiere was due to take place on the closing night of the American Film Institute [AFI] Festival in Los Angeles on Thursday. The film is due to have a cinema release on 6 December before being available on Apple TV+ in January. Mackie and Jackson also co-starred in the Avengers movies In a statement, Apple said: ""We purchased The Banker earlier this year as we were moved by the film's entertaining and educational story about social change and financial literacy. ""Last week some concerns surrounding the film were brought to our attention. We, along with the film-makers, need some time to look into these matters and determine the best next steps. ""In light of this, we are no longer premiering The Banker at AFI Fest."" The Banker stars Anthony Mackie as Garrett and his Avengers co-star Samuel L Jackson as Garrett's partner Joe Morris. In the film, they recruit Matt Steiner, played by Nicholas Hoult, to help them get around racial barriers. The pair pose as a cleaner and chauffeur, but in reality use the banks they buy to give loans to other African Americans. When announcing the premiere in October, AFI Festivals director Michael Lumpkin said: ""The Banker joins a remarkable group of films being released this year that openly confront centuries of racism and injustice in our country, while celebrating the brave individuals whose activism has created real change.""

"This video can not be played Chris Martin: ""Everyone will catch up if you prove that it's easy to do it the right way"" Coldplay have put plans to tour their new album on hold, due to concerns over the environmental impact of concerts. ""We're not touring this album,"" frontman Chris Martin told BBC News. ""We're taking time over the next year or two, to work out how our tour can not only be sustainable [but] how can it be actively beneficial."" ""All of us have to work out the best way of doing our job,"" he continued, saying the band wanted their future tours to ""have a positive impact"". Coldplay's new album Everyday Life is released on Friday and, instead of spending months on the road, they are playing two gigs in Jordan, which will be broadcast, free, to a global audience on YouTube. The concerts, will take place in Amman on Friday at sunrise and sunset respectively, mirroring the two ""sides"" of their new album. The UK band last travelled the world with their A Head Full of Dreams Tour, which saw them stage 122 shows across five continents in 2016 and 2017. Musicians 'have to be proactive' on climate change Coldplay reveal new album tracks in local paper ""Our next tour will be the best possible version of a tour like that environmentally,"" Martin said. ""We would be disappointed if it's not carbon neutral. ""The hardest thing is the flying side of things. But, for example, our dream is to have a show with no single use plastic, to have it largely solar powered. ""We've done a lot of big tours at this point. How do we turn it around so it's no so much taking as giving?"" The WWF welcomed Coldplay's initiative, saying: ""It is fantastic to see world-famous artists stepping up to protect the planet. ""We all have a responsibility to lead by example in the face of this climate and nature crisis - inaction is not an option if we are to preserve our planet for future generations,"" said Gareth Redmond-King, the organisation's head of climate change.

Speaking to BBC entertainment correspondent Colin Paterson, Martin said Jordan had been chosen because ""we wanted to pick somewhere in the middle of the world where we normally don't get to play"". He said the new record - which will be released on Friday - reflected the band's global perspective. ""If you've had the privilege of travelling around the world, you know we're all from the same place,"" he went on. ""In a very gentle British way, this record is us saying we don't feel different from any human on earth."" Martin said songs from Everyday Life had been inspired in part by BBC News reports aboutan Afghan gardeneranda Nigerian hymn composer. ""Journalism at its best finds these individual stories that reinforce our shared humanity,"" he explained. Coldplay will perform a one-off concert for fans at the Natural History Museum in London on 25 November. All proceeds from the show will be donated to an environmental charity. Staging a world tour isn't as simple as bunging Chris Martin and his bandmates in the back of a mini-van with a map and a year's supply of digestives. In fact, the band's last tour employed 109 crew, 32 trucks and nine bus drivers, who travelled to five continents, playing to 5.4 million people at 122 concerts. There's no easy way to calculate the band's carbon footprint; but the music industry'smost recent figures,externalsuggest that live music generates 405,000 tonnes of greenhouse-gas emissions in the UK every year. It's not just flights that cause the problem. Fans travelling to and from shows are the biggest source of pollution; but there's an environmental cost to producing merchandise, powering the spotlights and moving stages from venue to venue. U2's infamous ""claw"" allowed the band to play in the middle of their audience - but at what cost to the environment? At the most extreme end of the scale, the ambitious ""claw"" structure that U2 took on the road in 2009 required 120 trucks to shift it around. According to one environmental group, the band generated the equivalent carbon footprint of a return flight to Mars. Since then, the industry has stepped up its efforts to become more sustainable. Radiohead swapped spotlights for LEDs, which use a fraction of the power needed for a traditional lighting rig. The 1975 have stopped making new merchandise, and are donating Â£1 from every ticket sold to One Tree Planted, a non-profit organisation that plants trees all over the world. And U2 have enacted anumber of changes,external, from recycling guitar strings to using hydrogen fuel cells. Coldplay are going one step further. They don't just want to be carbon neutral, but to have tours that are ""actively beneficial"" to the planet. And by putting their concerts on hold, they're giving up a huge pay day: The Head Full of Dream tour made $523m. The industry will be watching to see what solutions they come up with.

"The red panda, similar to this one at Zagreb zoo, has been described as an ""outstanding climber"" Authorities are searching for a red panda that escaped from a zoo in south-eastern France. Staff at St-Martin-la-Plaine zoo near Lyon say the endangered animal got free by scaling branches broken by recent snowfall. It was last seen by a motorist less than 5km (3.1 miles) away, near Saint-Maurice-sur-Dargoire.

"Women can expect to take on caring responsibilities for an older, sick or disabled relative more than a decade earlier than men, a report concludes. Research by Sheffield and Birmingham universities shows half of women will care by the age of 46, compared with half of men, for whom the age is 57. The research suggests two-thirds of UK adults can expect to become an unpaid carer during their lifetimes. The charity Carers UK says carers need five-to-10 days of paid care leave. For the charity's report -Will I Care?,external- the academics analysed data from individuals who had participated in both the British Household Panel Survey and Understanding Society social and economic study for more than 15 years between 1991 and 2018. Their findings showed 65% of adults had provided unpaid care for a loved one. Women had a 70% chance of becoming a carer and men 60%. Carers quitting jobs from pressure Carers bullied by government, MPs say By the time they were 46, half of women had been a carer, the researchers found, while with men, it was not until they reached the age of 57 that they had the same 50-50 chance of being a carer. Most carers were middle-aged - almost half (46%) aged 46 to 65 - and the average person has a 50-50 chance of becoming a carer by the age of 50, according to the researchers' data. Ravi has cared for her elderly father on and off for 26 years since her mother died. But the responsibility intensified 12 years ago when her father, who's in his 80s, underwent open-heart surgery - and the past year and a half has been particularly taxing, after he suffered a stroke in 2018. Ravi says extra help would be welcome Ravi, from Hounslow in west London, is now in her 50s. She told the BBC she spent about six hours a day caring for her father - she cooks for him, checks his blood sugars, administers medicine, acts as his advocate, as the stroke has led to impaired speech, and deals with correspondence. She also works full-time as a residential social worker and says her caring responsibilities have had a major impact on her health. ""You get to a point where you think, 'I can't take it any more', and you have to step back and get yourself into a good place before you can go on. ""Sometimes I say things I shouldn't say, but as my manager said to me, 'You're only human'. ""I've got a lot of patience and understanding but when I'm not feeling 100%, or if I'm tired, then it's hard to keep my composure."" The emotional fallout from her father also takes its toll. ""I'm having to deal with his frustrations and emotion - I get the brunt of that frustration. He gets a lot more agitated than he used to."" Ravi says more support for people like herself - including paid carer's leave - would be welcome. ""As a wider society, I think people see you and think you're fine and you look OK on the surface, but it's really stressful and draining."" Lead report author and head of the Sustainable Care programme at Sheffield, Prof Sue Yeandle, said: ""Caring is vital for us all and a precious support for those we love at critical times. ""Provided by millions of women, care also features strongly in the lives of men. Yet too often carers pay a heavy price for the support they give - financial strain, poorer health, social isolation."" Helen Walker, chief executive of Carers UK, said: ""Many of us don't expect to become an unpaid carer but the reality is two in three of us will do it in our lifetimes. ""Our research shows women are disproportionately affected, facing difficult decisions about their loved ones' health, family finances and how best to combine paid work, and care more than a decade earlier than men."" The charity is calling on the next government to commit to delivering long-term investment in social care and give carers a right to five-to-10 days of paid care leave. The carer's allowance has not been subject to the benefits freeze. In November, the Department for Work and Pensions said it wouldrise by 1.7%from April 2020. Labour's social-care and mental-health spokeswoman Barbara Keeley said: ""Nine years of failure to fund social care properly means that carers are picking up the pieces of a broken system. ""A Labour government will help carers by introducing free personal care for older people and we will raise the carer's allowance for full-time unpaid carers in line with job-seeker's allowance, and deliver an updated national carers strategy."" Liberal Democrat health spokeswoman Luciana Berger said carers were ""unsung heroes"". ""In government, Lib Dems will introduce a statutory guarantee of regular respite breaks for unpaid carers and require councils to make regular contact with carers to offer support and signpost services. ""We will also provide a package of carer benefits, such as free leisure centre access, free bus travel for young carers and self-referral to socially prescribed activities and courses."" She said Lib Dems would also raise the amount people can earn before losing their carer's allowance from Â£123 to Â£150 a week, and reduce the number of hours' care per week required to qualify for it.

"Julie Davis, the original claimant in the case, said women had been treated ""like guinea pigs"". More than 1,350 Australian women have won a long-running class action lawsuit against Johnson & Johnson (J&J) over vaginal mesh implants. Australia's Federal Court found that J&J subsidiary Ethicon failed to warn patients and surgeons about the ""risks"" posed by the products. The implants were commonly used to treat pelvic organ prolapse and incontinence after childbirth. The case is one of a series of lawsuits J&J faces over the products. Some patients said they had suffered chronic pain, bleeding and severe discomfort during sexual intercourse after having the mesh surgically implanted. Judge Anna Katzmann ruled that much of the information the company provided about the products was ""inaccurate"" and at times made ""false representations"". ""The risks were known, not insignificant and on Ethicon's own admission, serious harm could ensue if they eventuated,"" Ms Katzmann said in her ruling. The court will set damages next year. Australia apologises for 'decades of pain' Life after vaginal mesh surgery Asbestos discovery triggers J&J baby powder recall In a statement, Ethicon defended its record and said it would consider an appeal. ""Ethicon believes that the company acted ethically and responsibly in the research, development and supply of these products,"" the company said. Julie Davis, the original claimant in the case, welcomed the decision. ""They have treated women essentially like guinea pigs, lied about it and done nothing to help,"" she told reporters outside the court in Sydney. Last year, the Australian government issued a national apology to women affected by vaginal mesh, acknowledging decades of ""agony and pain"". The ruling is the latest bad news for J&J, which is facing billions of dollars in legal claims over other products, including opioids. In October, the company agreed to pay nearly $117m (Â£90.5m) to resolve claims over pelvic mesh in 41 US states and the District of Columbia. It is also facing lawsuits over the product in Canada and Europe. Separately, J&J isfacing thousands of lawsuits from people who claim its talc products caused cancer. The multinational was also ordered to pay $8bn in damages to a man over claims he was not warned that an anti-psychotic drug could lead to breast growth. Despite the lawsuits, the company booked $20.7bn in quarterly sales in its most recent results, an increase of 1.9% over the same quarter in 2018.

"Three patients became ill and one of them died because of the infected organs A transplant patient died after a surgeon failed to disclose he had spilt stomach contents on organs which went on to be used in NHS operations. The 36-year-old died of an aneurysm caused directly by infection from a donated liver, while two other patients became ill from transplants. The incident took place in 2015 but only came to light when one of the sick patients attended a hospital in Wales. It had involved a surgeon from Oxford University NHS Foundation Trust. The trust has agreed damages of Â£215,000 for one of the cases. Several organs became infected with Candida albicans, a fungal infection, after the surgeon cut the stomach in a donor while retrieving organs, spilling the contents over other organs. The surgeon did not tell anyone as he should have done and the organs were transplanted into three patients. How well does the NHS spend its money? Baby death review: What do we know? Millions 'missing out' on NHS dentistry One recipient died after receiving an infected liver, while a 44-year-old received a kidney and pancreas and a 25-year-old parent from Wales received a kidney. The incident only came to light after surgeons at Cardiff & Vale University Health Board raised the alarm with the Human Tissue Authority and the Welsh Government. They became worried when the 25-year-old patient who received the kidney, and who was under their care at the University Hospital of Wales, became seriously unwell due to the infected organ. The patient, who does not wish to be named but is from south Wales, needed the donor kidney removing as an emergency after suffering extreme pain and extensive internal bleeding. The 25-year-old was placed in an induced coma and given 16 blood transfusions, before spending a year on dialysis having never needed it before. The Oxford University trust has paid Â£215,000 in damages to the patient after they launched a legal challenge. A serious incident report by NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) said the surgeon had ""no recollection of anything of note"" when taking the organs, but had noticed a ""small nick"" on reflection which saw a small amount of stomach content spilt. The spill was not documented at the time of the procedure, meaning those receiving the organs and their doctors were unaware of the risk of infection. The NHSBT report concluded: ""This incident represents an example of donor-transmitted infection with Candida albicans which contributed to the loss of one kidney graft and the death of a liver recipient. ""The infection of the graft may have arisen during the retrieval procedure."" The trust admitted it had been in breach of duty of care by the failure of the surgeon to record the cut into the donor's stomach. In defence of the legal action, trust lawyers claimed that, despite the stomach spill, even if known at the time of transplant, the risk would have been considered low. But solicitor Jodi Newton, a medical negligence specialist at Hudgell Solicitors, representing the patient, said it was ""a completely unacceptable breach of duty of care"" which was ""extremely damaging for patient trust in surgeons"". The patient said: ""What angers me to this day is that fact that the surgeon who removed the organs from the donor wasn't honest. ""It was only when people who received the organs became unwell that the truth was told."" Prof Meghana Pandit, chief medical officer at Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said: ""This is a very unusual circumstance and we are keen to ensure that we do everything we can to make sure it doesn't happen again in future."" John Forsythe, medical director for organ donation and transplantation at NHSBT, said: ""Our thoughts are with the recipients and their families over this sad and unusual case. ""We acted quickly to investigate what happened and we worked with transplant centres afterwards. Our report concluded the infection of the transplanted organ may have arisen during the retrieval procedure."" It is unclear whether the families of the 36-year-old who died or the 44-year-old are aware of the incident. NHSBT said it was up to local transplant centres to inform patients about contamination. Cardiff and Vale University Health Board said the NHSBT investigation which took place after it reported the issue ""did not identify any faults or concerns with procedures in Cardiff"".

"The Labour Party has launched its 2019 election manifesto, with the slogan It's Time For Real Change. It sets out the policies the party aims to introduce should it win the election. Thefull document,externalruns to 105 pages. But what are the promises that will grab the public's attention, and potentially win over voters on polling day, 12 December? The party also wants to cut private provision in the NHS. The 4.3% per year rise is at the top end of what health think tanks and analysts have been calling for. Labour would also have to find money to cover revenue lost from its pledges to scrap prescription, basic dentistry and hospital car parking charges. A key section covers Labour's plan to cut private provision in the NHS, which currently accounts for about 7% of the health budget in England. This would clearly involve outsourced contracts, for example for physiotherapy and community health. But will NHS hospitals suddenly see their waiting lists balloon as a result of operations outsourced to private hospitals being brought back into the public sector? And are these pledges longer-term aspirations or shorter-term priorities? Healthcare is devolved so these policies would apply to England only, but the devolved nations would benefit from the funding. This video can not be played ""Rail, mail, water and energy into public ownership"": Jeremy Corbyn launches Labour's manifesto Labour will renegotiate a new Brexit deal within three months, and hold a referendum on the deal or Remain within six months The short section called ""The Final Say on Brexit"" only begins on page 89 of this manifesto. The other main UK-wide parties have simple slogans, but Labour's policy is more complicated and doesn't fit on a manifesto cover or the side of a bus. It promises to renegotiate a new Brexit deal within three months, based on a new UK-EU customs union and close EU single market alignment. It would also give EU nationals living and working in the UK the automatic right to stay. That deal would then be put to a legally-binding referendum within six months, alongside the option to remain in the EU. Labour wants to appeal to both Leavers and Remainers and to give the people the final say. It would implement the referendum result immediately. But Mr Corbyn will not say how he would vote in it. And that continues to divert attention away from his other practical policies. This policy would apply to the whole of the UK. Update: On 22 November Jeremy Corbyn revealed that he would remain neutral if there was another referendum. What is Labour's Brexit plan? Will this be a Brexit election? It would boost anyone over the age of 25 earning the minimum wage, known as the National Living Wage. The Conservatives had already announced the living wage would gradually increase to Â£10.50 over the next six years. Labour is now promising more and faster, with all workers over 16 years old getting Â£10 an hour within the next year. It is an attempt to tackle the growing issue of in-work poverty. It's cheaper than other policy announcements because employers, rather than government, mostly pay the wages, but it's a big jump for them to swallow in a very short timeframe. Labour is also promising extra measures to boost workers' rights, including longer maternity and paternity pay, and guaranteed bereavement pay. This would apply to the whole of the UK. How high could the lowest wages go? Is the minimum wage enough to live on? Pension age would remain at 66 while retirement ages for those in arduous and stressful jobs will be reviewed. Not long ago, government number-crunchers suggested workers under 30 may not receive a state pension until they turned 70. So Labour's plan to freeze the state pension age at 66 for the foreseeable future has been called a ""gargantuan promise"" by one analyst. It would cost billions of pounds more than most recent government plans to raise the age for men and women to 68 by 2039. Yet, it would clearly be popular among middle-age voters. For existing pensioners, the so-called triple-lock - linking annual state pension rises to the highest of average earnings, the cost of living, or 2.5% - would continue, as all the major parties have promised. There are also pitches to specific groups. The so-called Waspi women - born in the 1950s and furious with ""surprise"" pension age changes - are promised compensation. This would apply to the whole of the UK. The fight over women's pensions Why 70 may be the new 65 Provide ""community-based, person-centred"" support in England, including free personal care. Labour's plan for a comprehensive National Care Service is bold. The question will be whether their costings stand-up to scrutiny. That is not just about the affordability of the plan now, but also its cost as the population ages. At the heart of the policy is free personal care for older people who need help with day-to-day tasks like washing, dressing and medication. This system already operates in Scotland, but in England, the idea was rejected 20 years ago by the then-Labour government as too expensive. There are also promises to double the number of people receiving help, so easing NHS pressures. Plans to reform the care system have ended up as political footballs in past elections - the challenge for Labour will be building a consensus around their ideas. Health and social care is devolved. This would apply to England only. Will Jeremy Corbyn's long march lead to power? To put the UK on track for a net-zero carbon energy system within the 2030s. The date for reducing carbon emissions to effectively zero is much sooner than the government envisages. It's not quite the neat formulation of ""net zero"" by 2030 that many party activists wanted (and the Green Party has promised). Instead, in one line, the document talks of achieving ""the substantial majority of our emissions reductions"" by 2030. In another, it mentions putting the UK ""on track for a net-zero carbon energy system within the 2030s"". Presumably that creates enough stretch room to get to 2040 - five years earlier than the Lib Dems' target year and 10 years earlier than the Tories. This policy would apply to the whole of the UK CONFUSED?Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external BREXIT:Where do the parties stand? The party will nationalise the so-called big six energy firms, National Grid, the water industry, Royal Mail, railways and the broadband arm of BT. Labour's manifesto is one of the most radical proposed overhauls of the way companies are owned and run in decades. It would mark the biggest ownership takeover by the state since the nationalisations that occurred after the outbreak of World War Two. Those companies that Labour does not want to own and operate themselves will also face a huge change in the way they are supervised by government. The current inhabitants of company boardrooms are very aware life would be very different under a Labour government. This policy would apply to the whole of the UK. How much could Labour's nationalisation plan cost? Start work on a new benefits system to replace controversial benefit. Labour's plan to scrap Universal Credit deals with its immediate concerns about the much-criticised benefit. However, the party does not say what it would replace it with. Universal Credit was originally introduced to tackle the complexity and unfairness of the existing benefits system. But many of the accompanying changes became linked to austerity measures like benefit caps. Going back to the system which Universal Credit replaced would create its own problems. And its introduction shows just how difficult it can be to devise a new system that works. Labour has said it will start work on ideas for a new system immediately, but getting that right is likely to take years. This would apply across the UK. There are also plans to scrap tuition fees and bring back maintenance grants for the poorest students. The controversial policy of abolishing private schools, voted through at conference, is being parked for the moment. But there is a firm commitment to remove their charitable tax status. The big pledge, as in 2017, is the abolition of tuition fees. Universities will worry that the commitment to find public money to replace them could come under pressure if public finances tighten. Scrapping tuition fees will benefit the wealthiest students most. Maintenance grants would be restored for the poorest. The combined cost is estimated at Â£12bn a year. On school funding, Labour's promise goes further than the Conservatives and Lib Dems. By 2022-2023, spending would be Â£10.5bn higher in cash terms, which would reverse cuts (and then some) made since 2010. Education is devolved. This would apply to England only. Labour will also bring the railways back into public ownership. Labour says it will bring the railways back into public ownership when the current rail franchises expire. The party says that means there will be no cost to the government as the contracts will have ended. However, it is unclear who will then own the trains and the associated costs. The use of driver-only operated trains will also be stopped, having caused years of disruption because of industrial action by disgruntled staff. Industry estimates this would cost more than Â£200m a year. And the bus system will fall under council control again while thousands of routes that have been cut will be reinstated. Free bus travel is also promised for under-25s. The costs for this are not provided in the manifesto. Labour promises a Â£250bn green transformation fund; HS2 will be built and extended into Scotland and long-suffering train passengers in the north of England will get ""Crossrail for the North"". Transport is partly devolved. Free bus travel for under-25s would apply to England only, while infrastructure projects and renationalisation would apply across the UK. It will mean EU citizens in the UK no longer have to apply to continue living and working in the country. The settlement scheme was set up by the Conservative government to formalise the rights of EU citizens to continue living and working in the UK after Brexit. Ministers have claimed the system is working well with applications from around 2.45 million people so far. But that means almost one million EU nationals have yet to sign up, raising concerns that some who have difficulty proving they've been in Britain could be at risk of deportation. Labour's proposal would end the worry and uncertainty for EU citizens in Britain, but it could create problems for border staff after Brexit in distinguishing between those who've already been living in the UK and new arrivals who may have certain restrictions. This policy would apply to the whole of the UK. Start a rapid programme of homebuilding. Labour's promise to build 100,000 council homes and 50,000 housing association properties a year by the end of the five-year Parliament marks a rapid change. Building on this scale has not been seen for 40 years. The UK's population is getting older and one in five people has a disability, so the type of homes proposed will face close scrutiny.  There are also questions over the availability of construction workers to build them. More people have rented from private landlords than social ones since 2013. Many are aged under 35. For them, rent controls would aim to keep down costs by linking rent rises to inflation (the cost of living) and giving city authorities the power to be even stricter. This will reignite debate over their effectiveness. The plan for a new Department for Housing shows how central this area is to Labour's key policies. Housing is devolved so this policy would apply to England only.

"Women can expect to take on caring responsibilities for an older, sick or disabled relative more than a decade earlier than men, a report concludes. Research by Sheffield and Birmingham universities shows half of women will care by the age of 46, compared with half of men, for whom the age is 57. The research suggests two-thirds of UK adults can expect to become an unpaid carer during their lifetimes. The charity Carers UK says carers need five-to-10 days of paid care leave. For the charity's report -Will I Care?,external- the academics analysed data from individuals who had participated in both the British Household Panel Survey and Understanding Society social and economic study for more than 15 years between 1991 and 2018. Their findings showed 65% of adults had provided unpaid care for a loved one. Women had a 70% chance of becoming a carer and men 60%. Carers quitting jobs from pressure Carers bullied by government, MPs say By the time they were 46, half of women had been a carer, the researchers found, while with men, it was not until they reached the age of 57 that they had the same 50-50 chance of being a carer. Most carers were middle-aged - almost half (46%) aged 46 to 65 - and the average person has a 50-50 chance of becoming a carer by the age of 50, according to the researchers' data. Ravi has cared for her elderly father on and off for 26 years since her mother died. But the responsibility intensified 12 years ago when her father, who's in his 80s, underwent open-heart surgery - and the past year and a half has been particularly taxing, after he suffered a stroke in 2018. Ravi says extra help would be welcome Ravi, from Hounslow in west London, is now in her 50s. She told the BBC she spent about six hours a day caring for her father - she cooks for him, checks his blood sugars, administers medicine, acts as his advocate, as the stroke has led to impaired speech, and deals with correspondence. She also works full-time as a residential social worker and says her caring responsibilities have had a major impact on her health. ""You get to a point where you think, 'I can't take it any more', and you have to step back and get yourself into a good place before you can go on. ""Sometimes I say things I shouldn't say, but as my manager said to me, 'You're only human'. ""I've got a lot of patience and understanding but when I'm not feeling 100%, or if I'm tired, then it's hard to keep my composure."" The emotional fallout from her father also takes its toll. ""I'm having to deal with his frustrations and emotion - I get the brunt of that frustration. He gets a lot more agitated than he used to."" Ravi says more support for people like herself - including paid carer's leave - would be welcome. ""As a wider society, I think people see you and think you're fine and you look OK on the surface, but it's really stressful and draining."" Lead report author and head of the Sustainable Care programme at Sheffield, Prof Sue Yeandle, said: ""Caring is vital for us all and a precious support for those we love at critical times. ""Provided by millions of women, care also features strongly in the lives of men. Yet too often carers pay a heavy price for the support they give - financial strain, poorer health, social isolation."" Helen Walker, chief executive of Carers UK, said: ""Many of us don't expect to become an unpaid carer but the reality is two in three of us will do it in our lifetimes. ""Our research shows women are disproportionately affected, facing difficult decisions about their loved ones' health, family finances and how best to combine paid work, and care more than a decade earlier than men."" The charity is calling on the next government to commit to delivering long-term investment in social care and give carers a right to five-to-10 days of paid care leave. The carer's allowance has not been subject to the benefits freeze. In November, the Department for Work and Pensions said it wouldrise by 1.7%from April 2020. Labour's social-care and mental-health spokeswoman Barbara Keeley said: ""Nine years of failure to fund social care properly means that carers are picking up the pieces of a broken system. ""A Labour government will help carers by introducing free personal care for older people and we will raise the carer's allowance for full-time unpaid carers in line with job-seeker's allowance, and deliver an updated national carers strategy."" Liberal Democrat health spokeswoman Luciana Berger said carers were ""unsung heroes"". ""In government, Lib Dems will introduce a statutory guarantee of regular respite breaks for unpaid carers and require councils to make regular contact with carers to offer support and signpost services. ""We will also provide a package of carer benefits, such as free leisure centre access, free bus travel for young carers and self-referral to socially prescribed activities and courses."" She said Lib Dems would also raise the amount people can earn before losing their carer's allowance from Â£123 to Â£150 a week, and reduce the number of hours' care per week required to qualify for it.

"ScotRail has admitted it will not hit a target of stopping the dumping of human waste onto railway tracks by 2020. The train operator had signed up to a UK-wide pledge to stop the practice of emptying raw sewage on to the railways. But severe delays to a fleet of refurbished trains means ScotRail will still be using rolling stock without toilet waste tanks next year. The firm said it is working to introduce the refurbished trains as soon as possible. ScotRail was meant to have received 26 refurbished high-speed trains, with waste tanks fitted, for routes linking Scotland's seven cities from rail firm Wabtec by December last year. Only eight of these models - which date back to the 1970s but have been renovated - have been delivered so far. ScotRail has been forced to hire 'classic' trains, without waste retention tanks fitted, to make up some of the shortfall and nine of these will still be in operation next year. Mick Hogg, the RMT union's regional organiser in Scotland, said: ""We are livid that this promise has been broken. ""Why should our members be subjected to these disgusting conditions, being sprayed by this foul waste, as they go about their work at the trackside. ""This deal has been a disgrace for taxpayer and the travelling public, who is asking the serious questions of why these refurbished trains are going to be years late."" A deal to stop dumping human waste was originally agreed and implemented in December 2017 The practice of dumping sewage on the railwayswas ended by ScotRail in 2017. However, it wasreintroduced last yearas an interim measure after delays to the fleet of refurbished intercity trains. A number of other rail operators across the UK will also miss the 2020 waste target. Research by industry regulator, the Office of Road and Rail, found that the risk of infection to railway workers from the waste was low. The HST was the mainstay of British Rail's inter-city service and the delayed refurbishment programme has an estimated total cost of Â£54m A ScotRail spokesman said there was no specific legislative requirement to have retentions tanks fitted to the trains but they are being fitted as the rolling stock goes through its refurbishment programme. He added: ""We're working with suppliers to ensure the refurbishment of our fleet of high-speed InterCity trains is completed as soon as possible."" A spokesman for track operator Network Rail said: ""We are committed to putting an end to trains emptying waste onto the tracks and we are working with all operators to make this happen. ""There are a few train companies that have been given a bit more time for a small number of their trains and we are tracking their action plans closely to make sure they comply.""

"Two in five adults would fake a sick day if they needed a day off, a Com Res survey for the BBC suggests. When questioned on their morals and values, people admitted to lying about sickness, stealing and taking credit for other people's work. While younger staff lied more often than their elders, they were more willing to stand up for colleagues. The average worker takes about four sick days a year, according to the Office for National Statistics. The most common reasons for calling off work in 2018 were the common cold, musculoskeletal problems (like back pain), mental health conditions and ""other"" problems. Sickness due to fibbing was unsurprisingly not included in the government's statistics. The UK-wide survey questioned 3,655 adults aged over 16. The findings are part of a larger survey about what people in the UK find right and wrong. As well as faking sickies, employees are often also prepared to cover for colleagues who they know might be faking it. The survey found that 66% would not tell bosses if they knew their colleagues were absent, but not ill. Hayley Lewis, an occupational psychologist, said it takes confidence to tell your boss you need a break, and if the relationship is bad, employees will tend to be less truthful. Two-thirds of workers would not tell bosses if they knew their colleagues were absent, but not ill. ""'People don't leave an organisation - they leave their boss' goes the saying,"" says Ms Lewis. Also, people can be influenced by their boss' behaviour, she adds. ""We look to role models. If the boss is dragging themselves in, not taking breaks, eating lunch at their desk, it reinforces the message that it is not okay to take a break,"" she says. That often leaves employees only one option, Ms Lewis says - to ring up sick. Men were almost twice as likely as women to say they would accept praise from a boss for work that someone else had done. And almost a third said they stole work supplies like staplers and notebooks. The younger the employee, the more likely they were to speak up for women in the workplace. Workers under 34 were more than twice as likely than older colleagues to turn to senior managers, or intervene. if they saw a male boss touch a female employee on the back during a meeting. Only 16% of workers aged over 55 agreed. While 70% of younger adults would report or intervene if a senior figure in a company made sexual comments towards a younger colleague, less than half of people over 55 would do the same.

"Emilia Clarke's role as Daenerys Targaryen in Game of Thrones initially required her to take her clothes off Directors UK has published its first guidelines for scenes involving nudity and simulated sex. The body that represents UK TV and film directors is aiming to show best practice for working with actors, intimacy coordinators, and others. The news comes a day after Emilia Clarke said shefound Game of Thrones' nude scenes ""hard""and that she was pressured to go naked in other roles. ""Everyone deserves the right to feel safe at work,"" Directors UK said. ""This is just as true when working on a Hollywood blockbuster as it is on a prime-time drama or a debut short film."" The new guidelines, which are supported by industry bodies including Bafta, Equity, the BFI and the Casting Directors' Guild, come in the wake of the#MeToo movementand allegations that some bosses demanded sexual favours for acting work. The guidelines advise a ban on full nudity in any audition or call back and no semi-nudity in first auditions. The document states that ""by their nature, auditions are based on a power imbalance"", and that ""some performers can feel obligated to agree to uncomfortable requests to get a job"".

"Empire actor Jussie Smollett is suing the city of Chicago over their actions against him. Papers filed by his lawyers claim he's been caused ""humiliation and extreme distress"". Authorities have accused him of staging a racist and homophobic attack on himself in January, something he's always denied. They're trying to get him to pay $130,000 (Â£100,000) in costs to cover the time police spent investigating. This video can not be played Watch the background to the bizarre Jussie Smollett case - this video was published in April 2019 If you're new to this story, there are a lot of twists and turns to get your head around. At the start of this year, police in Chicago announced they were investigating an attack on actor Jussie Smollett, who'd been punched in the face, had an ""unknown chemical substance"" poured on him and a rope wrapped around his neck. Celebrities like Viola Davis, Janelle Monae and TI, alongside his Empire co-stars, tweeted messages of support. But in February, Jussie Smollett himself was arrested. The police photo of Jussie Smollett from 21 February 2019 Police claimed he'd paid two brothers to carry out the attack ""to promote his career"" because he was ""dissatisfied with his salary"". But, in March, after an emergency court appearance, all charges against Jussie Smollettwere dropped. His lawyer said his record ""had been wiped clean"", describing him as a ""victim who was vilified and made to appear as a perpetrator"". This video can not be played This footage, released by police in June, was taken about seven hours after the alleged attack But Chicago Police and the city's mayor stood by their case against Jussie Smollett - and accused the courts of letting him ""off scot-free"". Then the man who decided to drop the charges, Illinois prosecutor Joe Magats, said even he thought Smollett was guilty. But he explained the charges were dropped because Jussie paid $10,000 (Â£7,600) in bail to the courts and carried out community service. And that's when the city of Chicago announced it wassuing the actorfor the money it spent investigating the attack. Jussie Smollett and Taraji P Henson as Jamal and Cookie Lyon in American drama Empire In court documents filed this week, Jussie Smollett has called this action against him ""malicious"". He's accused the city, police and others of causing ""substantial economic damages as well as reputational harm, humiliation, mental anguish and extreme emotional distress,"" and says he's seeking compensation. But a spokesperson for Chicago's law department has told the Reuters new agency that the city ""stands by its original complaint"".

"Nicola Sturgeon is quizzed by opposition party leaders during first minister's questions Jackson Carlaw asks about child deaths at the QEUH; the FM points to engagement with parents Richard Leonard and Sturgeon clash over private firm involvement in the NHS Alison Johnstone calls for a 'real fox hunting ban' and the FM says legislation will be brought forward Carers, shipbuilding and food banks are raised from the back benches Louise Wilson and Craig Hutchison That's all from Holyrood Live on Thursday 21 November 2019. Questions about the NHS dominated first minister's questions today. Scottish Tory interim leader Jackson Carlaw raised questions about the health secretary's response following the death of two patients at the Royal Hospital for Children in Glasgow. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon apologised to the families of the parents and said the government was determined to ensure their questions were answered. Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard asks about the role of private firms within the NHS, leading Ms Sturgeon to highlight 0.6% of the overall budget went to the private sector, less than in England.

The Lib Dems believe the independence of the BBC must be protected Mr Rumbles says, and therefore calls for the setting up of an independent licence fee commission. The setting of the fee should be decoupled from any external influences, he argues. The Lib Dem says the Conservative amendment tries to shift the blame to the BBC. He suggests the BBC agreeing to the funding deal was, to channel Don Vito Corleone, ""an offer they couldn't refuse"". Protesters  gathered outside the BBC to protest against plans to axe free TV licences for the over-75s. The SNP has called for licence decisions to bemade independently of government, while Labour has pledged tosave free TV licences. According to the Sun on Sunday,external, the prime minister ordered officials to find a way to ensure no over-75s would need to pay as a ""priority"". Meanwhile the Lib Dems say scrapping free TV licences for over-75s will have a ""huge impact"" on the mental wellbeing of older people. Allow Twitter content?

Mike Rumbles points out the UK has one of the lowest state pensions and the free licence fee was supposed to augment this. The Lib Dem MSP accepts this is a reserved matter, but argues Holyrood can take a view on this issue. He says some 300,000 over 75s will have to pay the cost of the licence fee of Â£155 themselves, with those just outside the threshold for pension credit unable to do so. Mr Rumbles says it was wrong for the BBC to be given this responsibility by the UK government. Green MSP Alison Johnstone says we have been promised the end of austerity by the UK government, yet this summer saw the announcement that free TV licences for over 75s would be scrapped. This was ruled out by the Conservatives in the 2017 manifesto but the decision was passed on to the BBC, she adds. Green MSP Alison Johnstone For the poorest households the TV licence cost is a significant proportion of their income she states, noting the UK has the lowest state pension of all advanced economies in the world. Only 60% of people eligible for pension credit actually receive it Ms Johnstone adds, meaning many UK households will not get the free licence. Ms Baker points to a petition raised by Age UK which garnered 630,000 signatures calling on the government to take back responsibility for the funding of TV licenses. Research shows 70% of over 75s will have to consider cutting back on essentials like heating or food to pay for the licence, the Labour MSP says. Ms Baker says around two fifths of those who entitled to pension credit are not claiming it. She warns about vulnerable people becoming more lonely or having their mental health affected by losing the companionship of TV. The Labour MSP calls for the UK government to restore free TV licences for all over 75s. The BBC and the government should find a way to save free TV licences for all over-75s, a committee of MPs has said. The House of Commons media select committee said the new position, where only those claiming pension credit will be eligible, was an ""absurd situation"". The BBC said it will continue to scrap free TV licences for up to 3.7m people. A government spokesman said: ""We're disappointed with the BBC's decision not to continue free licences for the over-75s."" Read more here. Allow Twitter content?

Ms Baker points to BBC investment in the new BBC Scotland channel and the iPlayer. But she also highlights challenges, including the increasingly varied and competitive market. The announcement made by the BBC was a direct result of the UK government's decision. The Conservatives' insistence that it was a BBC decision is ""at best disingenuous and at worst shameless"" the Labour MSP says. The number of over 75s in Scotland expected to be impacted by the change approaches a quarter of a million, she adds. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Labour MSP Claire Baker Labour MSP Claire Baker says free TV licences for over 75s were introduced by a Labour government and paid for directly by it. Ms Baker tells the chamber this was introduced as a social benefit. Labour was and continues to be completely against this decision by the UK government, she says. The Labour MSP argues setting the licence fee should not be solely down to the UK government, with little input from the BBC and none from viewers. Ms Hamilton says the BBC should use its substantial licence fee income to provide for UK audiences. She adds this income, plus income from abroad, should be reinvested ""appropriately"", including by showing restraint on salaries. The BBC proposed the most narrowly defined option for reform for over 75s she argues. The SNP has failed to explain what would happen to the BBC in Scotland if it became independent, the Tory MSP states. Ms Hamilton says it is important to says where responsibility lies for this decision, pointing out  the funding deal was agreed in 2015 as part of the charter renewal. The Tory MSP argues the key element of the deal was for the BBC to fund free licences for over 75s and for this it received concessions including the promise to close the iPlayer loophole. She says the BBC agreed to the deal and says it was the ""right deal at the right time"", adding she is quoting Lord Hall. The BBC  should have communicated its concerns about the the costs earlier says Mr Hamilton, who points out that under the current BBC plans the poorest over 75s will continue to get free TV licences.

"Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash outside RAF Croughton The parents of Harry Dunn have said they are ""disgusted"" with Dominic Raab after he defended the government's decision to seek legal costs from them. The 19-year-old died after a collision in Northamptonshire in August that led to the suspect leaving the UK claiming diplomatic immunity. His parents havebegun legal actionagainst the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO). Mr Raab said the government needed to ""protect taxpayers' money"". Mr Dunn's mother Charlotte Charles toldVictoria Derbyshirethe foreign secretary's comments were ""just completely disgusting"" and she also said they had been ""misled"" by him.

He continued: ""It pains me because I want to give them the solace of justice in this case. ""But we also need to protect the taxpayers' money and the legal position that we set out, which is the correct one."" Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said seeking legal costs from Harry Dunn's family was about protecting taxpayer's money Mr Dunn was fatally injured on 27 August, when his motorbike was in collision with a car owned by Anne Sacoolas, 42, outside RAF Croughton, where her husband Jonathan was an intelligence officer. Mrs Sacoolas left the UK claiming diplomatic immunity but the family are seeking a judicial review of that decision. Northamptonshire Police interviewed Mrs Sacoolasin the US in Octoberand a file was handed to the Crown Prosecution Service earlier this month. Mrs Charles said: ""We do not understand why it is taking so long to come to a charging decision, when the evidence shows that it really is straight forward."" Radd Seiger, the family's spokesman, said: ""If [Mr Raab] is so concerned about taxpayers' money in the litigation then he would come and talk to us to find a resolution, rather than risking having taxpayers themselves paying a very expensive legal bill if the FCO lose."" A spokesman for FCO said: ""We have deep sympathy for Harry's family. We have done and will continue to do everything we properly can to ensure that justice is done.

"Dozens of British Airways flights into the UK have been delayed or cancelled after what the airline has described as a ""technical issue"". Flights from the US, India and Japan were showing up as delayed. ""Our teams are working hard to resolve a technical issue which is affecting some of our flights,"" BA said on Twitter, in response to a passenger who had been delayed. Some people have been put up in hotels and booked on other flights, it said. A spokesperson for Gatwick Airport, where a number of BA flights have arrived late, blamed the delays on an issue with the airline's system for handling flight plans. They said the problem caused delays of around three hours for some long-haul flights arriving into the airport, which had a knock-on effect on departures. The worst affected was Flight BA170 from Pittsburgh, in the US, which was more than 12 hours behind schedule. It is the latest technical issue to affect the airline, which faced massive disruption in August when more than 100 flights were cancelled because of an IT glitch. Allow Twitter content?

"If you've been following the election campaign so far - you probably know the main messages from the main politics parties. The Tories - Get Brexit Done Labour - Real Change The Lib Dems and SNP - Stop Brexit. But it's the off the cuff comments - the things that let us know a bit more about the parties who want to run the country - that are often the most interesting. Boris Johnson let one slip on Wednesday when - we think accidentally - he told a voter he was going to cut the amount of national insurance we pay by raising the threshold to Â£12,000. Cue a mad dash to confirm the details (Â£9,500 in first budget - Â£12,500 at some point in future). Mr Johnson also sat down with political journalists for a chat - which gives us some more clues about what he'd do if he retains power. It's clear the PM is planning some sort of announcement on social care in the Tory manifesto - expected in the next few days. At the heart of his pledge will be ensuring that nobody has to sell their home to pay for their care. We await details on what the promised new policy will look like.

Mr Johnson said: ""You have to look at the size of the bill. It's huge. You have to consider the thick end of Â£100bn is being properly spent and whether we are profiling that spend correctly."" ""You know where my instincts are. I've overseen a great number of very big infrastructure projects. ""I'm going to hesitate before simply scrapping something that has been long-planned and is of great national importance. ""But we will want to be checking the money is being properly spent and there aren't ways in which it could be reprioritised or reprofiled."" Beyond National Insurance, Mr Johnson wasn't giving much away on personal taxation. He wouldn't be drawn on whether he'll cut stamp duty - or how he might help middle or higher-earners, as he pledged during the Tory leadership campaign. But might something come down the line? ""The answer is yes in principle - but we have to start where we want to help the most."" After one policy emerged out of nowhere - you can maybe understand why he didn't get into detail.

"Prince Andrew was photographed leaving Buckingham Palace on Thursday evening The Duke of York has been seen for the first time since he announced he would step back from royal duties over the Jeffrey Epstein scandal. Prince Andrew said on Wednesday he wouldwithdraw from his official role for the ""foreseeable future"". Criticism of the prince's ties to convicted US sex offender Epstein intensified amid a growing backlash following a BBC interview. Lawyers for Epstein's victims have urged the prince to speak to US police. The prince was seen by photographers on Thursday morning driving out of his home in Windsor, Berkshire, and was later spotted leaving Buckingham Palace. The Duke of York's ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, whodefended him as a ""true and real gentleman"",externala day before the Newsnight interview was broadcast, was also seen being driven into the grounds of Buckingham Palace. Earlier in the day he was spotted driving out of his home in Windsor Prince Andrew's ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, was also seen being driven into the grounds of Buckingham Palace on Thursday Meanwhile, more organisations have announced they are cutting ties with the Duke of York. TheUniversity of Huddersfield said the prince was stepping down with immediate effect from his role as chancellor. The Association of Leading Visitor Attractions - which represents tourist sites such as museums, galleries and historic houses across the UK - said the prince was no longer its president. And the Outward Bound Trust - a network of outdoor education schools - said it had accepted his resignation as patron. Companies including BT and Barclays and other institutionshad already distanced themselves from the prince. Prince Andrew became a full-time working member of the Royal Family following his retirement from the Royal Navy. The announcement that he would be stepping down from public duties, described by Buckingham Palace as ""a personal decision"", was taken following discussions with the Queen and Prince Charles. Prince Andrew quits as university chancellor Prince Andrew stepping back from royal duties Entrepreneurs who back Prince Andrew's Pitch@Palace Six things we learned from the duke's interview The retirement of the Duke of Edinburgh from public life in 2017 is the most recent example of where a working royal has stepped back from their duties. Although under very different circumstances, in Prince Philip's case, some of his long-held patronages have been passed to other family members. The Duchess of Cambridge and the Countess of Wessex were among the royals to take on his former patronages. The prince's access to public money to fund travel and expenses will end. For example, a three-day visit to Bahrain by the prince on behalf of the UK government in April 2018cost Â£16,272,external, paid for by the taxpayer-funded Sovereign Grant. The Sovereign Grant is public moneywhich pays for the cost of official royal duties,external, in exchange for the surrender by the Queen of the revenue from the Crown Estate. Prince Andrew will step back from royal duties for the foreseeable future There is also an annual payment to the prince from the Privy Purse - the Queen's private income - recorded in 2011 as being Â£249,000. Asked about whether this funding would continue, Buckingham Palace said only that the Duke of York's office was funded privately by the Queen. The prince has been urged to put himself forward to be interviewed by US investigators who are looking into allegations against Jeffrey Epstein. In his statement on Wednesday, Prince Andrew said he was ""willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required"". David Boies, a lawyer representing Virginia Giuffre and other accusers, said the prince's withdrawal from his royal duties was ""a positive first step towards taking responsibility for his actions"". ""A second positive step would be to agree to be interviewed by the lawyers representing the victims of Jeffrey Epstein,"" he added. The prince said he regretted this 2010 meeting with Epstein Gloria Allred, who represents some of Epstein's accusers, told BBC Newsnight that she was ""glad"" it appeared the prince was willing to co-operate. But she asked: ""Is he insisting that he be served with a subpoena to testify, or is he willing to speak to law enforcement without being legally required to do so? ""My clients who are victims of Jeffrey Epstein have spoken to law enforcement without being 'required' to do so."" Another US lawyer for several Epstein accusers, Lisa Bloom, who is Ms Allred's daughter, said she would be prepared to serve legal papers on the prince in the UK, compelling him to give sworn testimony. Ms Bloom said it appeared the prince may have crucial information on Epstein's alleged crimes and that she would be willing to serve him with legal papers compelling him to give sworn testimony. Virginia Giuffre claimed she was forced to have sex with the prince three times. The prince has always denied any form of sexual contact or relationship with her. It is now unlikely that Prince Andrew will attend events or make trips in his capacity as the Queen's third child. Other working royals are expected to take over Prince Andrew's commitments in the short term. It is likely the prince's private office at Buckingham Palace, which helps him keep his official diary, will reduce in size. This video can not be played Prince Andrew: Epstein 'a constant sore in the family' But it will not be a complete retirement for Prince Andrew. It is understood the prince will continue to support his entrepreneur programme, Pitch@Palace,although it will take place separately from the palace. Prince Andrew's attendance at Royal Family engagements, such as the Trooping of the Colour, Remembrance Sunday or Christmas at the family's estate in Sandringham, Norfolk, is not thought to be affected. This is without precedent in modern times. Prince Andrew's public life is over for now. The statement says the withdrawal is ""for the foreseeable future"". But it's hard to see what will bring him back. The interview is almost universally seen as a mistake. It was a disaster. But it may have seemed a good idea at the time. BBC Panorama has been digging into Virginia Giuffre's allegations and is going to air soon. That will have added to the pressure, alongside legal efforts in New York to have more Epstein-related papers released. There's talk of a lack of grip at the Palace, but Buckingham Palace is not like a company or a government department, with reporting lines and a chain of command. For centuries princes have gone their own way. There are lots of questions - about money, titles, military commands, patronages, about how this might speed reform, and of course about whether Prince Andrew still has a part to play in helping with investigations into Epstein, and helping Epstein's victims find answers. But right now the humiliation is complete. Born into the public eye, Prince Andrew has had to retreat into a private life. And the monarchy is shaken.

"Mr Salmond arrived at the High Court in Edinburgh ahead of the hearing before Lady Dorrian Alex Salmond has appeared in court charged with carrying out a series of sexual offences against 10 women while serving as Scotland's first minister. Mr Salmond faced a total of 14 charges at the High Court in Edinburgh. He denies all the allegations, which include one attempted rape, one intent to rape, 10 sexual assaults and two indecent assaults. The offences are alleged to have happened between June 2008 and November 2014. His QC, Gordon Jackson, said Mr Salmond was pleading not guilty, and judge Lady Dorrian set the trial date for 9 March next year. The trial is expected to last about four weeks. Mr Salmond served as first minister between 16 May 2007 and 20 November 2014. This video can not be played Alex Salmond says he is innocent of sexual assault allegations Speaking outside court after the brief hearing, Mr Salmond said he was innocent of the charges against him, and would defend himself ""vigorously"" during the trial. He added: ""The only proper place to answer criminal charges is in this court, and that is exactly what I intend to do next spring."" The charges are set out in an indictment which includes the specific details of the allegations against the 64-year-old former SNP leader.

"Prince Andrew was photographed leaving Buckingham Palace on Thursday evening The Duke of York has been seen for the first time since he announced he would step back from royal duties over the Jeffrey Epstein scandal. Prince Andrew said on Wednesday he wouldwithdraw from his official role for the ""foreseeable future"". Criticism of the prince's ties to convicted US sex offender Epstein intensified amid a growing backlash following a BBC interview. Lawyers for Epstein's victims have urged the prince to speak to US police. The prince was seen by photographers on Thursday morning driving out of his home in Windsor, Berkshire, and was later spotted leaving Buckingham Palace. The Duke of York's ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, whodefended him as a ""true and real gentleman"",externala day before the Newsnight interview was broadcast, was also seen being driven into the grounds of Buckingham Palace. Earlier in the day he was spotted driving out of his home in Windsor Prince Andrew's ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, was also seen being driven into the grounds of Buckingham Palace on Thursday Meanwhile, more organisations have announced they are cutting ties with the Duke of York. TheUniversity of Huddersfield said the prince was stepping down with immediate effect from his role as chancellor. The Association of Leading Visitor Attractions - which represents tourist sites such as museums, galleries and historic houses across the UK - said the prince was no longer its president. And the Outward Bound Trust - a network of outdoor education schools - said it had accepted his resignation as patron. Companies including BT and Barclays and other institutionshad already distanced themselves from the prince. Prince Andrew became a full-time working member of the Royal Family following his retirement from the Royal Navy. The announcement that he would be stepping down from public duties, described by Buckingham Palace as ""a personal decision"", was taken following discussions with the Queen and Prince Charles. Prince Andrew quits as university chancellor Prince Andrew stepping back from royal duties Entrepreneurs who back Prince Andrew's Pitch@Palace Six things we learned from the duke's interview The retirement of the Duke of Edinburgh from public life in 2017 is the most recent example of where a working royal has stepped back from their duties. Although under very different circumstances, in Prince Philip's case, some of his long-held patronages have been passed to other family members. The Duchess of Cambridge and the Countess of Wessex were among the royals to take on his former patronages. The prince's access to public money to fund travel and expenses will end. For example, a three-day visit to Bahrain by the prince on behalf of the UK government in April 2018cost Â£16,272,external, paid for by the taxpayer-funded Sovereign Grant. The Sovereign Grant is public moneywhich pays for the cost of official royal duties,external, in exchange for the surrender by the Queen of the revenue from the Crown Estate. Prince Andrew will step back from royal duties for the foreseeable future There is also an annual payment to the prince from the Privy Purse - the Queen's private income - recorded in 2011 as being Â£249,000. Asked about whether this funding would continue, Buckingham Palace said only that the Duke of York's office was funded privately by the Queen. The prince has been urged to put himself forward to be interviewed by US investigators who are looking into allegations against Jeffrey Epstein. In his statement on Wednesday, Prince Andrew said he was ""willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required"". David Boies, a lawyer representing Virginia Giuffre and other accusers, said the prince's withdrawal from his royal duties was ""a positive first step towards taking responsibility for his actions"". ""A second positive step would be to agree to be interviewed by the lawyers representing the victims of Jeffrey Epstein,"" he added. The prince said he regretted this 2010 meeting with Epstein Gloria Allred, who represents some of Epstein's accusers, told BBC Newsnight that she was ""glad"" it appeared the prince was willing to co-operate. But she asked: ""Is he insisting that he be served with a subpoena to testify, or is he willing to speak to law enforcement without being legally required to do so? ""My clients who are victims of Jeffrey Epstein have spoken to law enforcement without being 'required' to do so."" Another US lawyer for several Epstein accusers, Lisa Bloom, who is Ms Allred's daughter, said she would be prepared to serve legal papers on the prince in the UK, compelling him to give sworn testimony. Ms Bloom said it appeared the prince may have crucial information on Epstein's alleged crimes and that she would be willing to serve him with legal papers compelling him to give sworn testimony. Virginia Giuffre claimed she was forced to have sex with the prince three times. The prince has always denied any form of sexual contact or relationship with her. It is now unlikely that Prince Andrew will attend events or make trips in his capacity as the Queen's third child. Other working royals are expected to take over Prince Andrew's commitments in the short term. It is likely the prince's private office at Buckingham Palace, which helps him keep his official diary, will reduce in size. This video can not be played Prince Andrew: Epstein 'a constant sore in the family' But it will not be a complete retirement for Prince Andrew. It is understood the prince will continue to support his entrepreneur programme, Pitch@Palace,although it will take place separately from the palace. Prince Andrew's attendance at Royal Family engagements, such as the Trooping of the Colour, Remembrance Sunday or Christmas at the family's estate in Sandringham, Norfolk, is not thought to be affected. This is without precedent in modern times. Prince Andrew's public life is over for now. The statement says the withdrawal is ""for the foreseeable future"". But it's hard to see what will bring him back. The interview is almost universally seen as a mistake. It was a disaster. But it may have seemed a good idea at the time. BBC Panorama has been digging into Virginia Giuffre's allegations and is going to air soon. That will have added to the pressure, alongside legal efforts in New York to have more Epstein-related papers released. There's talk of a lack of grip at the Palace, but Buckingham Palace is not like a company or a government department, with reporting lines and a chain of command. For centuries princes have gone their own way. There are lots of questions - about money, titles, military commands, patronages, about how this might speed reform, and of course about whether Prince Andrew still has a part to play in helping with investigations into Epstein, and helping Epstein's victims find answers. But right now the humiliation is complete. Born into the public eye, Prince Andrew has had to retreat into a private life. And the monarchy is shaken. Prince Andrew & the Epstein Scandal: The Newsnight Interview was shown on BBC Two on 16 November 2019 and can be seen onBBC iPlayerin the UK. The full interview can also be seen onYouTube.

"Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash outside RAF Croughton The parents of Harry Dunn have said they are ""disgusted"" with Dominic Raab after he defended the government's decision to seek legal costs from them. The 19-year-old died after a collision in Northamptonshire in August that led to the suspect leaving the UK claiming diplomatic immunity. His parents havebegun legal actionagainst the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO). Mr Raab said the government needed to ""protect taxpayers' money"". Mr Dunn's mother Charlotte Charles toldVictoria Derbyshirethe foreign secretary's comments were ""just completely disgusting"" and she also said they had been ""misled"" by him. ""A month ago he said in parliament there were no obstacles to justice, but yesterday he said he was still working to clear obstacles."" ""I'm just really angry with that,"" she said. Bikers take to the road in memory of Harry Dunn Harry Dunn's parents' claims 'without foundation' Harry Dunn parents raise ambulance 'concerns' The FCO said last monthit would ""seek costs"" for any judicial review brought and argues the family has not found ""any reasonably arguable ground of legal challenge"". This video can not be played Harry Dunnâs mother Charlotte Charles says the family has been misled by Dominic Raab Mr Raabtold Sky News:,external""We just cannot responsibly allow ourselves to be sued without taking the normal action in defending ourselves when the position that the representative and the family are pursuing in law is wrong."" He continued: ""It pains me because I want to give them the solace of justice in this case. ""But we also need to protect the taxpayers' money and the legal position that we set out, which is the correct one."" Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said seeking legal costs from Harry Dunn's family was about protecting taxpayer's money Mr Dunn was fatally injured on 27 August, when his motorbike was in collision with a car owned by Anne Sacoolas, 42, outside RAF Croughton, where her husband Jonathan was an intelligence officer. Mrs Sacoolas left the UK claiming diplomatic immunity but the family are seeking a judicial review of that decision. Northamptonshire Police interviewed Mrs Sacoolasin the US in Octoberand a file was handed to the Crown Prosecution Service earlier this month. Mrs Charles said: ""We do not understand why it is taking so long to come to a charging decision, when the evidence shows that it really is straight forward."" Radd Seiger, the family's spokesman, said: ""If [Mr Raab] is so concerned about taxpayers' money in the litigation then he would come and talk to us to find a resolution, rather than risking having taxpayers themselves paying a very expensive legal bill if the FCO lose."" A spokesman for FCO said: ""We have deep sympathy for Harry's family. We have done and will continue to do everything we properly can to ensure that justice is done. ""As the foreign secretary set out in Parliament, the individual involved had diplomatic immunity whilst in the country under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations."" He added it was ""usual government practice to seek costs in legal challenges of this kind"".

"Ryanair described the ruling as an isolated case A Spanish court has called budget airline Ryanair's policy of charging a fee for hand luggage ""excessive"" after a passenger was fined for taking a carry-on bag without a special ticket. The passenger was forced to pay a â¬20 (Â£17) fine to bring her 10kg luggage on board. Ryanair allows only small bags as hand luggage if they can be stowed beneath the seat in front. The airline said it would not change its policy. Ryanair passengers brace for new bag rules Ryanair rated 'greedy and arrogant' by customers Ryanair sacks staff who 'spent night on airport floor' in Spain The passenger was travelling from Madrid to Brussels when she was charged to bring her extra luggage. The airline has a policy of charging customers an additional fee for carrying anything more than one personal item on board. Larger bags can also require a luggage fee. In its ruling, the Commercial Court ruled that the woman should be refunded with interest. The baggage could easily have fitted in the cabin, the judge said. He ruled the policy to be null and void and told Ryanair ""to remove it"" from its terms and conditions. However, compensation was ruled out as the judge did not deem the case to have caused enough stress to the disgruntled passenger. This video can not be played Expert advice from travel blogger Julie Falconer to help you on your travels The airline said it would not change its policy. ""This ruling will not affect Ryanair's baggage policy, either in the past or in the future, as it is an isolated case that misinterpreted our commercial freedom to determine the size of our cabin baggage,"" it said in a statement. The ruling cannot be appealed against. Another Ryanair customer took a unique step to avoid paying an extra baggage fee. Martin Gibson says he was flying from Billund, Denmark to London in February when he was informed he would have to pay to check in his motorcycle helmet. The Londoner argued that the helmet was a hat, at which point he says Ryanair employees told him if it was a hat he would have to wear it. Martin argued his helmet was a hat to avoid having to check it Martin told the BBC he had to wear the helmet for about 45 minutes at the departure gate and on the walk to the plane, otherwise he wouldn't have been allowed to board. While wearing his helmet at the gate, Martin says he ""stood next next to the ladies enforcing this absurd rule to make sure everyone else got a good chuckle out of it"". Once on the plane, he was allowed to take off his helmet and stow it in the overhead bin. He says he's carried the helmet on previous flights, both on Ryanair and other airlines, and not had issues.

"Women can expect to take on caring responsibilities for an older, sick or disabled relative more than a decade earlier than men, a report concludes. Research by Sheffield and Birmingham universities shows half of women will care by the age of 46, compared with half of men, for whom the age is 57. The research suggests two-thirds of UK adults can expect to become an unpaid carer during their lifetimes. The charity Carers UK says carers need five-to-10 days of paid care leave. For the charity's report -Will I Care?,external- the academics analysed data from individuals who had participated in both the British Household Panel Survey and Understanding Society social and economic study for more than 15 years between 1991 and 2018. Their findings showed 65% of adults had provided unpaid care for a loved one. Women had a 70% chance of becoming a carer and men 60%. Carers quitting jobs from pressure Carers bullied by government, MPs say By the time they were 46, half of women had been a carer, the researchers found, while with men, it was not until they reached the age of 57 that they had the same 50-50 chance of being a carer. Most carers were middle-aged - almost half (46%) aged 46 to 65 - and the average person has a 50-50 chance of becoming a carer by the age of 50, according to the researchers' data. Ravi has cared for her elderly father on and off for 26 years since her mother died. But the responsibility intensified 12 years ago when her father, who's in his 80s, underwent open-heart surgery - and the past year and a half has been particularly taxing, after he suffered a stroke in 2018. Ravi says extra help would be welcome Ravi, from Hounslow in west London, is now in her 50s. She told the BBC she spent about six hours a day caring for her father - she cooks for him, checks his blood sugars, administers medicine, acts as his advocate, as the stroke has led to impaired speech, and deals with correspondence. She also works full-time as a residential social worker and says her caring responsibilities have had a major impact on her health. ""You get to a point where you think, 'I can't take it any more', and you have to step back and get yourself into a good place before you can go on. ""Sometimes I say things I shouldn't say, but as my manager said to me, 'You're only human'. ""I've got a lot of patience and understanding but when I'm not feeling 100%, or if I'm tired, then it's hard to keep my composure."" The emotional fallout from her father also takes its toll. ""I'm having to deal with his frustrations and emotion - I get the brunt of that frustration. He gets a lot more agitated than he used to."" Ravi says more support for people like herself - including paid carer's leave - would be welcome. ""As a wider society, I think people see you and think you're fine and you look OK on the surface, but it's really stressful and draining."" Lead report author and head of the Sustainable Care programme at Sheffield, Prof Sue Yeandle, said: ""Caring is vital for us all and a precious support for those we love at critical times. ""Provided by millions of women, care also features strongly in the lives of men. Yet too often carers pay a heavy price for the support they give - financial strain, poorer health, social isolation."" Helen Walker, chief executive of Carers UK, said: ""Many of us don't expect to become an unpaid carer but the reality is two in three of us will do it in our lifetimes. ""Our research shows women are disproportionately affected, facing difficult decisions about their loved ones' health, family finances and how best to combine paid work, and care more than a decade earlier than men."" The charity is calling on the next government to commit to delivering long-term investment in social care and give carers a right to five-to-10 days of paid care leave. The carer's allowance has not been subject to the benefits freeze. In November, the Department for Work and Pensions said it wouldrise by 1.7%from April 2020. Labour's social-care and mental-health spokeswoman Barbara Keeley said: ""Nine years of failure to fund social care properly means that carers are picking up the pieces of a broken system. ""A Labour government will help carers by introducing free personal care for older people and we will raise the carer's allowance for full-time unpaid carers in line with job-seeker's allowance, and deliver an updated national carers strategy."" Liberal Democrat health spokeswoman Luciana Berger said carers were ""unsung heroes"". ""In government, Lib Dems will introduce a statutory guarantee of regular respite breaks for unpaid carers and require councils to make regular contact with carers to offer support and signpost services. ""We will also provide a package of carer benefits, such as free leisure centre access, free bus travel for young carers and self-referral to socially prescribed activities and courses."" She said Lib Dems would also raise the amount people can earn before losing their carer's allowance from Â£123 to Â£150 a week, and reduce the number of hours' care per week required to qualify for it.

TheUniversity of Huddersfield said the prince was stepping down with immediate effect from his role as chancellor. The Association of Leading Visitor Attractions - which represents tourist sites such as museums, galleries and historic houses across the UK - said the prince was no longer its president. And the Outward Bound Trust - a network of outdoor education schools - said it had accepted his resignation as patron. Companies including BT and Barclays and other institutionshad already distanced themselves from the prince. Prince Andrew became a full-time working member of the Royal Family following his retirement from the Royal Navy. The announcement that he would be stepping down from public duties, described by Buckingham Palace as ""a personal decision"", was taken following discussions with the Queen and Prince Charles. Prince Andrew quits as university chancellor Prince Andrew stepping back from royal duties Entrepreneurs who back Prince Andrew's Pitch@Palace Six things we learned from the duke's interview The retirement of the Duke of Edinburgh from public life in 2017 is the most recent example of where a working royal has stepped back from their duties. Although under very different circumstances, in Prince Philip's case, some of his long-held patronages have been passed to other family members. The Duchess of Cambridge and the Countess of Wessex were among the royals to take on his former patronages. The prince's access to public money to fund travel and expenses will end. For example, a three-day visit to Bahrain by the prince on behalf of the UK government in April 2018cost Â£16,272,external, paid for by the taxpayer-funded Sovereign Grant. The Sovereign Grant is public moneywhich pays for the cost of official royal duties,external, in exchange for the surrender by the Queen of the revenue from the Crown Estate. Prince Andrew will step back from royal duties for the foreseeable future There is also an annual payment to the prince from the Privy Purse - the Queen's private income - recorded in 2011 as being Â£249,000. Asked about whether this funding would continue, Buckingham Palace said only that the Duke of York's office was funded privately by the Queen. The prince has been urged to put himself forward to be interviewed by US investigators who are looking into allegations against Jeffrey Epstein. In his statement on Wednesday, Prince Andrew said he was ""willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required"". David Boies, a lawyer representing Virginia Giuffre and other accusers, said the prince's withdrawal from his royal duties was ""a positive first step towards taking responsibility for his actions"". ""A second positive step would be to agree to be interviewed by the lawyers representing the victims of Jeffrey Epstein,"" he added. The prince said he regretted this 2010 meeting with Epstein Gloria Allred, who represents some of Epstein's accusers, told BBC Newsnight that she was ""glad"" it appeared the prince was willing to co-operate. But she asked: ""Is he insisting that he be served with a subpoena to testify, or is he willing to speak to law enforcement without being legally required to do so? ""My clients who are victims of Jeffrey Epstein have spoken to law enforcement without being 'required' to do so."" Another US lawyer for several Epstein accusers, Lisa Bloom, who is Ms Allred's daughter, said she would be prepared to serve legal papers on the prince in the UK, compelling him to give sworn testimony. Ms Bloom said it appeared the prince may have crucial information on Epstein's alleged crimes and that she would be willing to serve him with legal papers compelling him to give sworn testimony. Virginia Giuffre claimed she was forced to have sex with the prince three times. The prince has always denied any form of sexual contact or relationship with her. It is now unlikely that Prince Andrew will attend events or make trips in his capacity as the Queen's third child. Other working royals are expected to take over Prince Andrew's commitments in the short term. It is likely the prince's private office at Buckingham Palace, which helps him keep his official diary, will reduce in size. This video can not be played Prince Andrew: Epstein 'a constant sore in the family' But it will not be a complete retirement for Prince Andrew. It is understood the prince will continue to support his entrepreneur programme, Pitch@Palace,although it will take place separately from the palace. Prince Andrew's attendance at Royal Family engagements, such as the Trooping of the Colour, Remembrance Sunday or Christmas at the family's estate in Sandringham, Norfolk, is not thought to be affected. This is without precedent in modern times. Prince Andrew's public life is over for now. The statement says the withdrawal is ""for the foreseeable future"". But it's hard to see what will bring him back. The interview is almost universally seen as a mistake. It was a disaster. But it may have seemed a good idea at the time. BBC Panorama has been digging into Virginia Giuffre's allegations and is going to air soon. That will have added to the pressure, alongside legal efforts in New York to have more Epstein-related papers released. There's talk of a lack of grip at the Palace, but Buckingham Palace is not like a company or a government department, with reporting lines and a chain of command. For centuries princes have gone their own way. There are lots of questions - about money, titles, military commands, patronages, about how this might speed reform, and of course about whether Prince Andrew still has a part to play in helping with investigations into Epstein, and helping Epstein's victims find answers. But right now the humiliation is complete. Born into the public eye, Prince Andrew has had to retreat into a private life. And the monarchy is shaken.

"Entrepreneurs have come out in support of Prince Andrew's business scheme for start-up firms as fears grow it may not continue amid the current controversy. Will King, founder of King of Shaves, said it was ""really sad"" the Pitch@Palace initiative had ""been affected by the personal issues around the Duke of York."" The scheme provides start-up firms with advice and contacts, but no funding. A source close to Prince Andrew said he would continue to be involved. This is despite hisstepping back from public duties for the foreseeable future. There has been ongoing controversy over the prince's ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Mr King, a founding member of Pitch@Palace suggested Prince Andrew could be ""rotated out of his captaincy of the ship"" for the business initiative. He said there were plenty of royals who could take his place, including William and Kate, as well as Harry and Meghan. ""If you're going to continue the Pitch@Palace in the royal environment, where you have an infrastructure that is paid for - I think, in part - by the taxpayer it would be an extraordinary shame that the palace don't see the opportunity in continuing this initiative."" He said the scheme had created Â£1bn of economic activity and noted that 97% of the companies who used it were still going. But asked if it can continue with Prince Andrew at the helm, he said: ""I don't know, I don't know."" Mr King said he had been invited in 2013 to a breakfast chaired by the prince's personal secretary Amanda Thirsk ""with the idea of trying to develop a UK entrepreneurial eco-system"". It was this idea which became Pitch@Palace, he said. Nick Mason, co-founder of digital identity tool Zaka, said Pitch@Palace was ""a fantastic programme for young entrepreneurs that offers valuable opportunities to learn from and connect with leaders of industry."" ""The Duke of York and his team were a constant source of encouragement throughout the impeccably-run programme and are clearly passionate about empowering the wonderful ventures that participate,"" Mr Mason said. Alex Redston, co-founder of of Prison Voicemail, was one of the first people involved in the event. He said the event had put him in contact with ""one gentleman worth billions... who had incredible connections in telecoms and was interested in social impact"". ""An amazing contact to make,"" Mr Redston said.  ""And other people who have helped us. Because we were so early stage we didn't quite understand the absolute rocket fuel that was there at the time."" James Talbot, chief executive of audio products firm Damson, said Prince Andrew retiring from public duties ""would represent an absolute disaster for the start-up community"". ""The Duke of York has provided an excellent platform for businesses, like Damson, to benefit from the network of connections and associates [to which] his status gives him access,"" Mr Talbot said. Rajeeb Dey, the chief executive of training software firm Learnerbly, said: ""Pitch@Palace has provided hundreds of entrepreneurs with unparalleled access to leading investors and influencers in the world of business."" Business giants KPMG and Standard Chartered revealed they had severed ties with the Duke of York's mentoring initiative this week. These revelations came after a BBC Newsnight interview with Prince Andrew which critics described as a ""car crash"". Sources have told the BBC the KPMG and Standard Chartered decisions were taken before the BBC interview. Several businesses and universities are reviewing their association with Prince Andrew following the interview. Despite the prince's stepping back from royal duties, he will still continue to be involved in the entrepreneur event, a source close to Prince Andrew told the BBC. The source said Prince Andrew was integral to Pitch@Palace. ""If you talk to any of the entrepreneurs you'll hear this,"" the source said, adding: ""I see it [Pitch@Palace] continuing, absolutely."" The source said none of Pitch@Palace's partners had mentioned the prince standing down, seeminglycontradicting a report in the Financial Times,external. Pitch@Palace was aware six months ago that Standard Chartered and KPMG would not be extending their sponsorship, but other sponsors were ""steady as they go"", the source said. ""People believe in the programme. It's huge and important to the economy so as long as we are finding and developing great entrepreneurs - that's why the partners are involved. They know that's important to their business,"" the source added.

"In aninterview with BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlis,,externalthe Duke of York, Prince Andrew has given details about his relationship with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and addressed allegations about sex with a teenage girl. Here are six things we learned from the interview. Prince Andrew has defended his relationship with Epstein before -including as recently as August- two weeks afterthe disgraced financier took his own lifewhile awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. But in the BBC interview broadcast on Saturday night, the prince gave more detail about why he ""still"" did not regret the friendship. He said knowing Epstein had ""some seriously beneficial outcomes"", at a time when he had left a career in the Navy and begun one as a trade and industry special representative. Prince Andrew said: ""The people that I met and the opportunities that I was given to learn, either by him or because of him, were actually very useful."" Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell in New York in 2005 Prince Andrew has always said he met Jeffrey Epstein in 1999 through the financier's then-girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell - a well-connected socialite. Ms Maxwell, daughter of the late newspaper tycoon, Robert Maxwell, has generally kept a low profile since claims about Epstein began to emerge. But the prince said he met up with her earlier this year, before Epstein was arrested and charged over sex trafficking allegations. ""She was here (in the UK) doing some rally,"" the prince said. He said they did not discuss Epstein during the meet-up. ""There wasn't anything to discuss about him because he wasn't in the news, you know, it was justâ¦ we had moved on."" Who is Ghislaine Maxwell? The prince stressed throughout the interview that he and Epstein ""weren't that close"". Invitations Epstein had received to events at Windsor Castle and at Sandringham were in the financier's capacity as Ms Maxwell's ""plus one"" rather than as a friend in his own right, he said. Prince Andrew said this photo was taken on a walk where he told Epstein their friendship was over Much of the interview focused on why the prince went to stay with Epstein in 2010, following Epstein's conviction and imprisonment for soliciting and procuring a minor for prostitution. The prince said the visit was to explain to Epstein that their friendship was over. He said he had considered speaking to Epstein on the phone, but decided to meet him face-to-face ""to show leadership"". ""I took the judgement call that because this was serious, and I felt that doing it over the telephone was the chicken's way of doing it, I had to go and see him and talk to him."" Prince Andrew returning from the Falklands War in September 1982 Maitlis asked the prince for his response to allegations against him made by one of Epstein's accusers, Virginia Giuffre (then known as Virginia Roberts). Ms Giuffre said she met the prince in 2001 when she dined with him, danced with him at a nightclub in London, and had sex with him at Ghislaine Maxwell's house in Belgravia. Maitlis pointed out that Ms Giuffre's accusations were ""very specific"" and included that the prince had been ""profusely sweating"". The prince said a ""problem"" with Ms Giuffre's story was that a medical condition meant he could not have been sweating. ""I didn't sweat at the time because I had suffered what I would describe as an overdose of adrenalin in the Falklands War when I was shot at and I simplyâ¦ it was almost impossible for me to sweat,"" he said. A picture shows Prince Andrew with the then Virginia Roberts, now Giuffre Prince Andrew revealed he had investigated the possibility that a photograph - or elements of it -provided by Ms Giuffre was fake. One reason the prince gave was his attire. ""I don't believe it's a picture of me in London because... when I go out in London, I wear a suit and a tie,"" he said. ""That's what I would describe asâ¦ those are my travelling clothes... if I'm going overseas."" However, newspapers have previouslypictured the prince wearing jeans without a tie or blazer on a night out in London.,external Speaking about the photo with Ms Giuffre, Prince Andrew told Newsnight: ""Nobody can prove whether or not that photograph has been doctored but I don't recollect that photograph ever being taken."" He also said he did not believe the photograph ""was taken in the way that has been suggested"" because it shows the prince's hand on the woman's waist. ""I am not one to, as it were, hug - and public displays of affection are not something that I do."" This video can not be played Prince Andrew: 'Going to Pizza Express in Woking is an unusual thing for me to do' The duke said the day on which Ms Giuffre's allegations are said to have happened, 10 March 2001, he was not out in London but ""at home with the children"". He said he had taken his eldest daughter, Princess Beatrice, to a party at a Pizza Express restaurant in Woking at about four or 5pm. ""And then because the Duchess was away, we have a simple rule in the family that when one is away the other one is there."" He added he remembered the occasion ""weirdly distinctly"" because it was one of only a couple of times that he had been to Woking, and going to the Pizza Express there was ""a very unusual thing for me to do"".

"Andrew Lloyd Webber has announced he is to join forces with ticket resellers Twickets in a bid to beat touts. The theatrical grandee, whose LW playhouses include The London Palladium  and the Theatre Royal Drury Lane, hopes the move will bring consumer-friendly ticket resale to the West End. Fans have often been charged over the odds on secondary ticketing platforms. The new system means unwanted tickets bought at the box office can be resold for no more than the original price. Twickets will also add a fee of 10% to 13% of the face value. Andrew Lloyd Webber: My career in 7 songs Rebecca Kane Burton, CEO at LW Theatres said: ""We continue to strive to not only offer our customers an incredible experience, but also help them when things don't go to plan. ""Providing a safe, secure and easy way to resell tickets is best practice and yet another step LW Theatres is taking to innovate and improve theatre-going."" Lord Lloyd-Webber has produced best-selling and long-running musicals including Cats and Jesus Christ Supsterstar. Twickets launched in 2015 as a more ethical ticketing company, helping fans get into concerts by the likes of Adele and Arctic Monkeys, but this is their first official tie-in with a UK theatre group. ""The UK is in the midst of a market shift away from rip-off secondary ticketing platforms and towards capped consumer-friendly resale services,"" said Twickets' founder Richard Davies. ""I am proud Twickets is at the forefront of this change, and delighted we can extend our service to theatre lovers via this groundbreaking partnership with LW Theatres."" The partnership will not stop touts from putting tickets on other ticket resale sites, but intends to give theatregoers a trusted option for trading unwanted tickets at a fair price. Tickets for shows such as Hamilton have been highly sought The move comes after the West End production of Hamilton scrapped apaperless ticketing schemeintended to combat unauthorised resale. Producers argued that increased customer awareness and action against sites like Viagogo meant they could reintroduce a ""more open"" system, including printed paper tickets. Hamilton and Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, two of the biggest West End hits in recent years, say tickets that are re-sold will be cancelled. Music stars including Adele, Little Mix and The Spice Girls also teamed up with Twickets as the official ticket reseller for their last tours.

"Convicted child abuser Michael Murphy was found guilty of 12 charges in February 2019, but some say they did not get justice due to double jeopardy laws Victims of sexual abuse have said they feel ""desperately let down"" after ministers refused to add child abuse to a list of serious crimes that can be retried if new evidence emerges. Charities and a group of ex-footballers had campaigned for reform of double-jeopardy laws in England and Wales. A cross-party group of MPs and the victims' commissioner had backed them. But Justice Minister Robert Buckland said it would have ""inevitably"" led to calls for other crimes to be included. Currently, only 29 ""serious crimes"" - including murder, rape and some class-A drug offences - allow for suspects to be tried more than once, where ""strong and viable"" new evidence has emerged. But the victims' commissioner, Vera Baird, had wanted this extended to cover non-penetrative sexual abuse of children, promptedby the case of former football coach Bob Higgins. Bob Higgins was jailed in June for 24 years and three months for abusing young players He was jailed in June 2019 for indecently assaulting 24 boys - but six other complainants were told their allegations were not serious enough to be tried for a second time. The All-Party Parliamentary Group on Adult Survivors of Childhood Sexual Abuse had also backed calls for change, following the case. In a letter seen by the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme, Mr Buckland told Ms Baird he had ""reluctantly concluded"" extending the law would ""not be right"". He said the maximum prison sentence for child sexual abuse was ""substantially lower"" than for the crimes already covered by double jeopardy and widening the law ""would inevitably lead to demands for the inclusion of other offences"" - in particular, ""crimes of violence"". He added: ""Ultimately, there is a risk that retrial might come to be regarded not as an extremely rare exception to the double-jeopardy rule but as a species of prosecution appeal"". One complainant described current double-jeopardy laws as a ""slap in the face"". The man she accuses of child sex abuse, former music-tour manager Michael Murphy, 72, went on trial in July 2018 for 15 counts of historical abuse against five children - including indecent assault, gross indecency and rape. He was found not guilty on three charges and the jury could not decide on the other counts. Murphy worked in the music industry At a second trial, in February 2019, Murphy was found guilty of all remaining 12 charges but, under double jeopardy, the jury could not reconsider the not-guilty verdicts from the first trial. ""I was told I couldn't have anything to do with a second trial,"" the complainant said. ""I understand why double jeopardy is there but once they have been found guilty, it's clear they have done it to someone else. ""I was hoping that, if he went to prison, it would be enough to feel justice - but it really doesn't."" Ex-Southampton FC youth footballer Dean Radford, one of the six men whose allegations against Higgins could not be retried, said he was ""desperately disappointed"". ""Any normal person on the street can see that any child abuse should be deemed serious enough [to be re-tried],"" he said. ""This is just another example of the government sweeping it under the carpet because they don't want to put the resources into it."" This video can not be played Dean Radford told BBC News in June there had been ""no justice"" for him Dino Nocivelli, a lawyer for five of the men, said Mr Buckland ""failed to listen to the thousands that have signed a petition demanding change to the double jeopardy laws"". He added he would continue to seek a meeting with the minister ""so he can see first hand the impact of his decision"".

"Dozens of British Airways flights into the UK have been delayed or cancelled after what the airline has described as a ""technical issue"". Flights from the US, India and Japan were showing up as delayed. ""Our teams are working hard to resolve a technical issue which is affecting some of our flights,"" BA said on Twitter, in response to a passenger who had been delayed. Some people have been put up in hotels and booked on other flights, it said. A spokesperson for Gatwick Airport, where a number of BA flights have arrived late, blamed the delays on an issue with the airline's system for handling flight plans. They said the problem caused delays of around three hours for some long-haul flights arriving into the airport, which had a knock-on effect on departures. The worst affected was Flight BA170 from Pittsburgh, in the US, which was more than 12 hours behind schedule. It is the latest technical issue to affect the airline, which faced massive disruption in August when more than 100 flights were cancelled because of an IT glitch. Allow Twitter content?

Three of the tourists' top five compiled half-centuries as England closed on 241-4. Ben Stokes hit a unbeaten 67 against a flagging New Zealand attack after disciplined fifties from Rory Burns and Joe Denly laid the platform. Colin de Grandhomme took 2-28 for the hosts on a good batting wicket. England have become notorious for batting collapses in recent times but this was a solid, if not perfect, way to begin a Test series. Captain Joe Root was the only member of the top order not to reach double figures, while debutant opener Dom Sibley hinted at - but did not fully show - his patient temperament in a gritty 22. Stokes was dropped on 63 by Ross Taylor at first slip late in the day but he saw England through to the close in New Zealand's North Island, along with Ollie Pope who made a sparky 18. TMS podcast: England and NZ size each other up Day one as it happened Joe Denly and Ben Stokes shared an 83-run stand against New Zealand On their last tour of New Zealand,England were dismantled for 58on the opening day of the series, but Denly in particular showed the determination that was missing two years ago to grind out a start. Just 30 runs came from the first 10 overs and when an aggressive shot was played - such as 24-year-old Sibley clipping his first ball to the mid-wicket boundary - it was a result of the bowlers straying off line, rather than a risky shot from the batsmen. The approach worked to an extent. Burns' half-century from 135 balls was his slowest in Test cricket, while Denly largely stayed clear of playing the drives that have been his undoing in the past and instead played himself in. Batting at three, Denly was in the middle for just under four hours before reaching his half-century as the 33-year-old grafted against New Zealand's accurate attack, before attacking left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner with a glorious straight six. Stokes, too, showed the value of England's new-found patience. After a quiet start he grew in fluency, taking Trent Boult for 16 runs in the closing stages, before being dropped by Taylor. After a determined innings it was a surprise when Denly, faced with the second new ball, sent a thin edge off Southee through to wicketkeeper BJ Watling. The frustrated groan from the batsman showed his annoyance at, once again, falling short of a century. In fact, England's wickets all seemed to fall to a lapse in concentration. Sibley was caught at first slip playing across the line while Burns, jittery after being hit on the helmet and edging through slip, nicked De Grandhomme through to Watling. Root was the most disappointing of all, taking 21 balls to get off the mark before slicing the next delivery to second slip. Trent Boult finished the opening day with figures of 22-6-61-0 In Boult and Southee, New Zealand have two of the best swing bowlers in the world, but there was little assistance on offer for them. As the ball got older, Boult had to rely on his variations, bowling cross-seam, while Southee was economical but unable to make a breakthrough. It was all-rounder De Grandhomme and his nagging medium-pacers that eventually saw off both openers, while Neil Wagner was rewarded for a lengthy, hostile spell with the wicket of captain Root. Southee produced a fine delivery to dismiss Denly - a touch wider, drawing the batsman into a false shot - and for much of the day, the New Zealand attack kept the lid on England's scoring rate. The only time England were able to get away was in the closing stages, when a tiring Boult returned with the new ball. On a good wicket and with the likes of Jos Buttler and Sam Curran to come, England will hope to compile a potentially match-winning total on the second day, which begins at 22:00 GMT. Ben Stokes has made 20 Test half-centuries for England, converting eight into centuries England batsman Rory Burns on Test Match Special: ""It was a tough day but a good day. It looked like a good wicket - it was a bit slower than I thought it would be and that made the cricket a bit attritional. ""I was nowhere near my fluent best but managed to stick in and grit it out. I'm disappointed to only get a 50 and not a big one."" New Zealand bowler Neil Wagner on TMS:""I thought we bowled pretty well and England batted well. When we put it in the right area, they were patient and when we got it wrong, they put it away. ""But they haven't run away from us and if we get a couple of early wickets tomorrow [Friday] we're right back in it."" Ex-England batsman Mark Ramprakash on TMS:""England will fancy their chances. I don't think the wicket is going to change, it looks good for batting. ""The top order were focused for setting a platform for the rest of the team. Only four down at the end of the day means England will be pleased with their work.""

"Empire actor Jussie Smollett is suing the city of Chicago over their actions against him. Papers filed by his lawyers claim he's been caused ""humiliation and extreme distress"". Authorities have accused him of staging a racist and homophobic attack on himself in January, something he's always denied. They're trying to get him to pay $130,000 (Â£100,000) in costs to cover the time police spent investigating. This video can not be played Watch the background to the bizarre Jussie Smollett case - this video was published in April 2019 If you're new to this story, there are a lot of twists and turns to get your head around. At the start of this year, police in Chicago announced they were investigating an attack on actor Jussie Smollett, who'd been punched in the face, had an ""unknown chemical substance"" poured on him and a rope wrapped around his neck. Celebrities like Viola Davis, Janelle Monae and TI, alongside his Empire co-stars, tweeted messages of support. But in February, Jussie Smollett himself was arrested. The police photo of Jussie Smollett from 21 February 2019 Police claimed he'd paid two brothers to carry out the attack ""to promote his career"" because he was ""dissatisfied with his salary"". But, in March, after an emergency court appearance, all charges against Jussie Smollettwere dropped. His lawyer said his record ""had been wiped clean"", describing him as a ""victim who was vilified and made to appear as a perpetrator"". This video can not be played This footage, released by police in June, was taken about seven hours after the alleged attack But Chicago Police and the city's mayor stood by their case against Jussie Smollett - and accused the courts of letting him ""off scot-free"". Then the man who decided to drop the charges, Illinois prosecutor Joe Magats, said even he thought Smollett was guilty. But he explained the charges were dropped because Jussie paid $10,000 (Â£7,600) in bail to the courts and carried out community service. And that's when the city of Chicago announced it wassuing the actorfor the money it spent investigating the attack. Jussie Smollett and Taraji P Henson as Jamal and Cookie Lyon in American drama Empire In court documents filed this week, Jussie Smollett has called this action against him ""malicious"". He's accused the city, police and others of causing ""substantial economic damages as well as reputational harm, humiliation, mental anguish and extreme emotional distress,"" and says he's seeking compensation. But a spokesperson for Chicago's law department has told the Reuters new agency that the city ""stands by its original complaint"".

"This video can not be played Prince Andrew: Epstein 'a constant sore in the family' The Duke of York says he is stepping back from royal duties because the Jeffrey Epstein scandal has become a ""major disruption"" to the Royal Family. Prince Andrew, 59, said he had asked the Queen for permission to withdraw for the ""foreseeable future"". He said he deeply sympathised with sex offender Epstein's victims and everyone who ""wants some form of closure"". The duke has faced a growing backlash followinga BBC interviewabout his friendship with the US financier. Companies he has links with, such as BT and Barclays, have joined universities and charities in distancing themselves from him. For several months the duke had been facing questions over his ties to Epstein, whotook his own life in Augustwhile awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein's accusers, claimed she was forced to have sex with the prince three times. The duke has always denied any form of sexual contact or relationship with her. His latest move, described by Buckingham Palace as ""a personal decision"", was taken following discussions with the Queen and Prince Charles. Letter casts doubt on when duke met Epstein Six things we learned from the duke's interview Prince Andrew's links to Jeffrey Epstein In a statement, the duke said: ""I continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein. ""His suicide has left many unanswered questions, particularly for his victims, and I deeply sympathise with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure. ""I can only hope that, in time, they will be able to rebuild their lives."" He added that he was ""willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required"". BBC royal correspondent Daniela Relph said his latest statement was ""completely different in tone"" to his recent TV interview and had ""addressed all the issues that he'd been criticised for"", including offering sympathy to Epstein's victims. She described his decision to step back as a ""drastic"" move but said ""the rumours that had been circulating had been really difficult for the Royal Family to manage"". The duke was pictured with 17-year-old Virginia Giuffre in Ghislaine Maxwell's London home in 2001 In his interview with the BBC's Newsnight on Saturday, the duke said the ""opportunities I was given to learn"" about business meant he did not regret the friendship with Epstein, although he said meeting him for a final time in 2010 was ""the wrong decision"". The duke said he could not recall ever meeting Virginia Giuffre, then known as Roberts, and said that on the night she claims they first met that he went to Pizza Express in Woking and then returned home. He sought to cast doubt on her testimony claiming that he was ""profusely sweating"" in a nightclub, saying that a medical condition at the time meant he could not perspire. He said he had met Epstein ""through his girlfriend back in 1999"" - a reference to Ghislaine Maxwell, who had been a friend of Prince Andrew since she was at university. Since the interview, a letter written in 2011 to the Times newspaper by Buckingham Palace has emerged, saying they met in the early 1990s. This is without precedent in modern times. Prince Andrew's public life is over for now. The statement says the withdrawal is ""for the foreseeable future"". But it's hard to see what will bring him back. The interview is almost universally seen as a mistake. It was a disaster. But it may have seemed a good idea at the time. BBC Panorama has been digging into Virginia Roberts Giuffre's allegations and is going to air soon. That will have added to the pressure, alongside legal efforts in New York to have more Epstein-related papers released. There's talk of a lack of grip at the Palace, but Buckingham Palace is not like a company or a government department, with reporting lines and a chain of command. For centuries princes have gone their own way. There are lots of questions - about money, titles, military commands, patronages, about how this might speed reform, and of course about whether Prince Andrew still has a part to play in helping with investigations into Epstein, and helping Epstein's victims find answers. But right now the humiliation is complete. Born into the public eye, Prince Andrew has had to retreat into a private life. And the monarchy is shaken. Former Buckingham Palace press officer Dickie Arbiter told the BBC News Channel that the prince's position had become ""untenable"" and the only surprise was that it took so long, adding ""there was no other direction he could go"". However, he said the prince was ""not out of the woods yet"" as the FBI and lawyers for some of Epstein's alleged victims wanted to talk to him under oath. Lawyer Gloria Allred, who is representing several of Epstein's victims, told BBC Newsnight that she was ""very glad"" the prince had indicated he was willing to speak to law enforcement, but said she didn't know why he had added ""if required"" to his statement. She said he should volunteer to cooperate ""without any condition and without any more delay"". The prince said he regretted this 2010 meeting with Epstein The duke's website,externalsays he carries out official duties for the Queen, focusing on promoting economic growth and skilled job creation. Over the past two months he has carried out overseas engagements in Australia, United Arab Emirates and Thailand. The prince's announcement means he won't be carrying out public engagements, but he will still attend Royal Family events such as Trooping the Colour and Remembrance Sunday. BT became the latest in a series of organisations to distance themselves from Prince Andrew ""in light of recent developments"". In a statement, the firm said it had been working with iDEA - which helps people develop digital, business and employment skills - since 2017 but ""our dealings have been with its executive directors not its patron, the Duke of York"". ""We are reviewing our relationship with the organisation and hope that we might be able to work further with them, in the event of a change in their patronage,"" a spokeswoman said. Standard Chartered Bank and KPMG also announced they were withdrawing support for the duke's business mentoring initiative Pitch@Palace. Sources told the BBC the decisions were made before the interview. Four Australian universities also said they would not be continuing their involvement in Pitch@Palace Australia.

"A letter written to the Times newspaper by Buckingham Palace has cast doubt on when the Duke of York first met convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The 2011 letter,externalsays they met in the early 1990s, not in 1999 as Prince Andrew said in his BBC interview. It comes as the duke faces a growing backlash after he said he did not regret his friendship with Epstein. Buckingham Palace said the prince's words speak for themselves and he stands by his recollection of events. Writing to the Times in March 2011, the duke's then private secretary Alastair Watson aimed to address ""widespread comment"" about the relationship with the New York financier, who died in prison this year awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. He said Prince Andrew had known Epstein ""since being introduced to him in the early 1990s"", but dismissed the ""insinuations and innuendos"" as ""without foundation"". Prince Andrew stands by 'car-crash' interview Epstein's accusers 'failed by royalty' - lawyer Six things we learned from Prince Andrew interview But in his interview with the BBC's Newsnight on Saturday, the duke said they ""met through his girlfriend back in 1999"" - a reference to Ghislaine Maxwell, who had been a friend of Prince Andrew since she was at university. The 2011 letter was published after the Times reported on the existence of a photo of the prince with 17-year-old Virginia Giuffre, then known as Roberts, who would later testify that she had been forced to have sex with him.

The duke was pictured with Ms Giuffre in Ghislaine Maxwell's London home in 2001 BT has become the latest in a series of organisations to distance themselves from Prince Andrew since the interview was broadcast.

""In light of recent developments we are reviewing our relationship with the organisation and hope that we might be able to work further with them, in the event of a change in their patronage,"" a spokeswoman said. Among some close to the prince there was a belief that ""once the dust died down"" the  Newsnight interview would have been worth it - because his core denials and admissions would be what was left in the public's mind. It is hard to see the logic of that position now. The letter to the Times from the prince's former private secretary undermines Prince Andrew's recollection of when his friendship with Epstein started. The Daily Mail hashighlighted at least one example,external, illustrated with photos, of when he and the Duchess of York broke what he called their ""simple rule"" that when one of them was away, the other was always with their children in the evening. That ""simple rule"" was offered as a reason why the prince could not have been with Virginia Roberts in London on the night she claims he danced and had sex with her. The loss of corporate support is particularly troubling for the palace: it is a ""real-world"" response to the interview, not just commentary and headlines. BT goes out of its way to say they'd reconsider if the organisation that they currently sponsor changed its patron - the prince. This is not getting better for the prince, or for the palace. It is getting worse. Standard Chartered Bank and KPMG earlier announced they werewithdrawing support for the duke's business mentoring initiativePitch@Palace, but sources told the BBC the decisions were made before the interview.

"This video can not be played The big names who had a bad day at the hearing A top US diplomat has told an impeachment inquiry that he followed President Donald Trump's orders to put pressure on Ukraine to investigate his Democratic rival, Joe Biden. The instruction came from Mr Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, Ambassador Gordon Sondland said. The inquiry is assessing if Mr Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine as a precondition. He denies any wrongdoing. It is illegal in the US to seek foreign help to gain electoral advantage. Mr Biden is one of the top contenders for the Democratic nomination for the 2020 presidential election. Mr Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU, told the latest hearing in the US House of Representatives that Mr Giuliani had sought a public statement from Ukraine's leader, Volodymyr Zelensky, announcing an inquiry into ""corruption issues"". Mr Giuliani specifically mentioned the company Burisma - which had the son of Democratic presidential candidate Mr Biden, Hunter, as a board member - and issues surrounding the 2016 US presidential election, he said. Sondland's testimony and reaction Five key moments from impeachment hearing Who's who in Trump-Ukraine story? Why Ukraine is so important to the US If found guilty in a majority vote in the House, the Republican president will face an impeachment trial in the Senate. But two-thirds of members of that Republican-controlled chamber would then need to vote for Mr Trump to be removed from office. In his opening statement, he said he had worked with Mr Giuliani ""at the express direction of the president"". While he is the US ambassador to the EU, Mr Sondland said his brief included work on Ukraine alongside other colleagues - despite that country not being an EU member. ""We did not want to work with Mr Giuliani. Simply put, we played the hand we were dealt. We all understood that if we refused to work with Mr Giuliani, we would lose an important opportunity to cement relations between the United States and Ukraine. So we followed the president's orders,"" he added. He then confirmed the president had sought an investigation in exchange for a White House visit for Mr Zelensky - a quid pro quo (a favour in return for a favour). ""I know that members of this committee have frequently framed these complicated issues in the form of a simple question: Was there a quid pro quo? As I testified previously, with regard to the requested White House call and White House meeting, the answer is yes."" This video can not be played EU ambassador Gordon Sondland testifies that Trump's personal lawyer ""requests were a quid pro quo"" However, Mr Sondland also said he had never directly heard from the president that military aid would be released in exchange for such an inquiry. The US diplomat said he was ""adamantly opposed"" to the suspension of military aid to Ukraine, and was never told why it was withheld. A timeline of the Trump-Ukraine story The impeachment story explained But he came to believe it was linked to Ukraine announcing corruption investigations. Mr Sondland said he had later told an aide to the Ukrainian president: ""I believed that the resumption of US aid would likely not occur until Ukraine took some kind of action on the public statement that we had been discussing for many weeks."" This video can not be played A beginner's guide to impeachment and Trump Moreover, the ambassador insisted that this was not a secret plan, as some critics have suggested, instead arguing it was transparent and that his superiors were ""fully supportive"". Mr Sondland said the leaders of the state department, National Security Council and White House had been informed, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. He does not remember any objections from his superiors to the policy. The ambassador said he had even discussed the fact military aid had been withheld with Vice President Mike Pence on a visit to Warsaw in September. The chief of staff for Mr Pence has denied the vice president ever spoke to Mr Sondland ""about investigating the Bidens, Burisma, or the conditional release of financial aid to Ukraine based upon potential investigations"". Similarly, a spokesman for the state department said Mr Sondland had ""never told Secretary Pompeo that he believed the President was linking aid to investigations of political opponents. Any suggestion to the contrary is flat out false"". This video can not be played ""I want nothing"" - Trump re-enacts Sondland call Mr Sondland, a wealthy hotelier, donated to Mr Trump's 2016 election campaign and was appointed to his position by the president in July 2018. Mr Trump has already responded to the testimony. Brandishing a copy of Mr Sondland's opening statement on the White House South Lawn, he read out a transcript of a phone conversation the pair had, in which the president said: ""I want nothing. That's what I want from Ukraine."" He also told reporters he did not know the EU ambassador ""very well"", but said he seemed ""like a nice guy"". Mr Giuliani has also denied Mr Sondland's testimony, tweeting he had ""never met him and had very few calls with him"". With his opening statement to the House impeachment hearings on Wednesday, Gordon Sondland fired a torpedo that has blown a hole in the White House's defences. Water is rushing in, and it's now a question of whether the Trump presidency can be saved before it disappears beneath the waves. Mr Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU, was working with Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, on Ukrainian policy at the explicit direction of the president. There was a quid pro quo. A White House visit for President Zelensky was conditional on opening investigations that could help the president politically. Mr Sondland also came to believe that US military aid to Ukraine was being held up for this reason. Everyone at the White House - acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former National Security Adviser John Bolton and others - was ""in the loop"". The word ""bombshell"" gets thrown around a lot these days, but Mr Sondland's testimony,  which represents a shift from his earlier closed-door statements, is a watershed moment in these impeachment investigations. Read more from Anthony Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defence Laura Cooper and Undersecretary of State David Hale testified later on Wednesday. Ms Cooper told the lawmakers that as early as 25 July - the day President Trump had his phone call with President Zelensky - she had received expressions of concern about the aid from the Ukrainian embassy. ""The Ukrainian embassy staff asked - what is going on with Ukrainian security assistance?"" She added that the embassy staff had raised similar concerns with the state department. David Hale and Laura Cooper testified late on Wednesday Mr Hale said that in March he had been ""concerned"" by a campaign of attacks in Ukraine against then-Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch and had felt she needed a statement of support from the state department. He told the hearing he had immediately briefed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on the issue, but Mr Pompeo ""did not issue a statement at that time"". In May Ms Yovanovitch was recalled by President Trump, who called her ""bad news"" in his controversial phone call.

"Two in five adults would fake a sick day if they needed a day off, a Com Res survey for the BBC suggests. When questioned on their morals and values, people admitted to lying about sickness, stealing and taking credit for other people's work. While younger staff lied more often than their elders, they were more willing to stand up for colleagues. The average worker takes about four sick days a year, according to the Office for National Statistics. The most common reasons for calling off work in 2018 were the common cold, musculoskeletal problems (like back pain), mental health conditions and ""other"" problems. Sickness due to fibbing was unsurprisingly not included in the government's statistics. The UK-wide survey questioned 3,655 adults aged over 16. The findings are part of a larger survey about what people in the UK find right and wrong. As well as faking sickies, employees are often also prepared to cover for colleagues who they know might be faking it. The survey found that 66% would not tell bosses if they knew their colleagues were absent, but not ill. Hayley Lewis, an occupational psychologist, said it takes confidence to tell your boss you need a break, and if the relationship is bad, employees will tend to be less truthful. Two-thirds of workers would not tell bosses if they knew their colleagues were absent, but not ill. ""'People don't leave an organisation - they leave their boss' goes the saying,"" says Ms Lewis. Also, people can be influenced by their boss' behaviour, she adds. ""We look to role models. If the boss is dragging themselves in, not taking breaks, eating lunch at their desk, it reinforces the message that it is not okay to take a break,"" she says. That often leaves employees only one option, Ms Lewis says - to ring up sick. Men were almost twice as likely as women to say they would accept praise from a boss for work that someone else had done. And almost a third said they stole work supplies like staplers and notebooks. The younger the employee, the more likely they were to speak up for women in the workplace. Workers under 34 were more than twice as likely than older colleagues to turn to senior managers, or intervene. if they saw a male boss touch a female employee on the back during a meeting. Only 16% of workers aged over 55 agreed. While 70% of younger adults would report or intervene if a senior figure in a company made sexual comments towards a younger colleague, less than half of people over 55 would do the same.

"This video can not be played Chris Martin: ""Everyone will catch up if you prove that it's easy to do it the right way"" Coldplay have put plans to tour their new album on hold, due to concerns over the environmental impact of concerts. ""We're not touring this album,"" frontman Chris Martin told BBC News. ""We're taking time over the next year or two, to work out how our tour can not only be sustainable [but] how can it be actively beneficial."" ""All of us have to work out the best way of doing our job,"" he continued, saying the band wanted their future tours to ""have a positive impact"". Coldplay's new album Everyday Life is released on Friday and, instead of spending months on the road, they are playing two gigs in Jordan, which will be broadcast, free, to a global audience on YouTube. The concerts, will take place in Amman on Friday at sunrise and sunset respectively, mirroring the two ""sides"" of their new album. The UK band last travelled the world with their A Head Full of Dreams Tour, which saw them stage 122 shows across five continents in 2016 and 2017. Musicians 'have to be proactive' on climate change Coldplay reveal new album tracks in local paper ""Our next tour will be the best possible version of a tour like that environmentally,"" Martin said. ""We would be disappointed if it's not carbon neutral. ""The hardest thing is the flying side of things. But, for example, our dream is to have a show with no single use plastic, to have it largely solar powered. ""We've done a lot of big tours at this point. How do we turn it around so it's no so much taking as giving?"" The WWF welcomed Coldplay's initiative, saying: ""It is fantastic to see world-famous artists stepping up to protect the planet. ""We all have a responsibility to lead by example in the face of this climate and nature crisis - inaction is not an option if we are to preserve our planet for future generations,"" said Gareth Redmond-King, the organisation's head of climate change.

Speaking to BBC entertainment correspondent Colin Paterson, Martin said Jordan had been chosen because ""we wanted to pick somewhere in the middle of the world where we normally don't get to play"". He said the new record - which will be released on Friday - reflected the band's global perspective. ""If you've had the privilege of travelling around the world, you know we're all from the same place,"" he went on. ""In a very gentle British way, this record is us saying we don't feel different from any human on earth."" Martin said songs from Everyday Life had been inspired in part by BBC News reports aboutan Afghan gardeneranda Nigerian hymn composer. ""Journalism at its best finds these individual stories that reinforce our shared humanity,"" he explained. Coldplay will perform a one-off concert for fans at the Natural History Museum in London on 25 November. All proceeds from the show will be donated to an environmental charity. Staging a world tour isn't as simple as bunging Chris Martin and his bandmates in the back of a mini-van with a map and a year's supply of digestives. In fact, the band's last tour employed 109 crew, 32 trucks and nine bus drivers, who travelled to five continents, playing to 5.4 million people at 122 concerts. There's no easy way to calculate the band's carbon footprint; but the music industry'smost recent figures,externalsuggest that live music generates 405,000 tonnes of greenhouse-gas emissions in the UK every year. It's not just flights that cause the problem. Fans travelling to and from shows are the biggest source of pollution; but there's an environmental cost to producing merchandise, powering the spotlights and moving stages from venue to venue. U2's infamous ""claw"" allowed the band to play in the middle of their audience - but at what cost to the environment? At the most extreme end of the scale, the ambitious ""claw"" structure that U2 took on the road in 2009 required 120 trucks to shift it around. According to one environmental group, the band generated the equivalent carbon footprint of a return flight to Mars. Since then, the industry has stepped up its efforts to become more sustainable. Radiohead swapped spotlights for LEDs, which use a fraction of the power needed for a traditional lighting rig. The 1975 have stopped making new merchandise, and are donating Â£1 from every ticket sold to One Tree Planted, a non-profit organisation that plants trees all over the world. And U2 have enacted anumber of changes,external, from recycling guitar strings to using hydrogen fuel cells. Coldplay are going one step further. They don't just want to be carbon neutral, but to have tours that are ""actively beneficial"" to the planet. And by putting their concerts on hold, they're giving up a huge pay day: The Head Full of Dream tour made $523m. The industry will be watching to see what solutions they come up with.

"Disciplined England dig in to build solid platform after winning toss Stokes - dropped on 63 by Taylor at slip - ends unbeaten on 67 Denly (74) & Burns (52) make patient half-centuries All four batsmen to fall caught behind the wicket Callum Matthews, Jack Skelton and Amy Lofthouse Right, that's us done for day one. England's day or honours even? Either way Joe Root's side have a promising platform. You can read Amy Lofthouse's report on the day's actionhere. The latest Test Match Special podcast will be available to download in the next few hours overhere. You can scroll back through this page for the best quotes and reaction while we'll have the latest Jonathan Agnew column on the website later today. Thanks for joining us, see you at 21:30 GMT! BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra You can listen to commentary of the final session from the Gabba where Australia are facing Pakistan from 6am overhere. Pakistan have had a slight recovery and are currently 175-6. Mark RamprakashEx-England batsman on BBC Test Match Special England will fancy their chances. I don't think the wicket is going to change, it looks good for batting. England have a left-hand, right-hand combination at the crease and it's not a brand new ball. England will be aiming at 400. Trent Boult:0-61 off 22 overs Tim Southee:1-46 off 21 overs Colin de Grandhomme:2-28 off 19 overs Neil Wagner:1-77 off 23 overs Mitchell Santner:0-24 off five overs Steven FinnEngland bowler on BBC Test Match Special The first 10 overs tomorow will be really crucial. If New Zealand get two or three wickets they have a real foothold. Mark RamprakashEx-England batsman on BBC Test Match Special New Zealand's bowlers are very good at bowling to their field and England's top order were perhaps a little bit conservative in their approach at the crease. They were focused for setting a platform for the rest of the team. Only four down at the end of the day means England will be well pleased with their work. Ben Stokes and Ollie Pope shared an unbeaten 38 in the final eight overs of the day as England continued to build a promising platform. Stokes hit 16 off one Trent Boult over - where he was also dropped at slip by Ross Taylor - as he brought up his 20th Test half-century. Pope finished the day on 18 off 23 deliveries and looked busy and proactive during 33-minute innings. Joe Denly reached his fifth Test half-century as he shared 83 with Ben Stokes. The pair upped the ante after tea as both took a particular liking to the left-arm spin of Mitchell Santner. Denly eventually fell for 74 as he edged a good delivery from Tim Southee through to the diving BJ Watling behind the stumps. Mark RamprakashEx-England batsman on BBC Test Match Special Joe Root didn't look balanced today. He lacked fluency and his usual intent. That brought Joe Root to the crease and he didn't look at all comfortable. Normally so proactive, it took him 21 balls to get off the mark. The very next ball he guided a catch - almost like you would in catching practice - to Tim Southee at second slip. It was a strange dismissal and a strange innings from England's captain. Steven FinnEngland bowler on BBC Test Match Special Burns, Sibley and Denly allowed England to get a foothold into the game. Root downwards are fluent players so having that platform at the top of the order is very important. A 52-run opening stand was a promising start for England and it was built upon by Rory Burns and Joe Denly who helped them to 113-1 before Burns feathered a thin edge off Colin de Grandhomme behind to fall for 52. Joe Root won the toss and elected to bat first giving debutant Dom Sibley an early opportunity at Test match cricket. He got off to the perfect start as he clipped his first ball through mid-wicket for four. The Warwickshire opener played a couple more lovely shots through the leg side before eventually falling for 22. Sibley was trying to work the ball to leg but got a leading edge off Colin de Grandhomme to slip. It was a promising start to Test cricket for the 24-year-old but it did also highlight a potential technical flaw in his game because the ball that dismissed him should have been hit through the off side. Let's have a recap of the day's action... England batsman Rory Burns on Test Match Special:""It was a tough day but a good day. ""It looked like a good wicket - it was a bit slower than I thought it would be and that made the cricket a bit attritional. ""Me and Sibley are going to be a bit more traditional at the top of the innings. It didn't really feel different for me personally - I always go about my batting that way, see off the good balls, pick off the bad ones. ""I don't think there were any nerves for Dom - and if there were any, they were gone after his first ball, a lovely shot for four. ""I was nowhere near my fluent best but managed to stick in and grit it out. I'm disappointed to only get a 50 and not a big one. ""The bounce might get a bit lower. It was a bit inconsistent earlier in the day. It's going to be hard work."" Mark RamprakashEx-England batsman on BBC Test Match Special These players have been away from this format for a few weeks. England will be reasonably happy with their day. The two openers negotiated the first hour very competently. The late flurry, with Ollie Pope looking in particularly good touch, was nice to see. Steven FinnEngland bowler on BBC Test Match Special It felt an even day. Both teams were sussing each other out in the morning session. There was not much for the England batsmen to capitalise on from New Zealand's bowlers. But England earned the right to score runs off tired bowlers later in the day. A lot has been made about England's approach to Test cricket in the last year or so and in the build-up to this Test Chris Silverwood and Joe Root have admitted they'll look to approach it differently and play a more patient style. Today was our first viewing of the style and while 241-4 is a promising position for England, there were 21 maidens. While a more conservative approach was needed, it's important England don't retreat too much. They've got to be proactive and look to rotate the strike more than they did today. It felt like they were a bit reserved at the crease at times today. #bbccricket Charlie:It's weird nowadays when you can describe a day of Test match cricket as ""a proper day of Test match cricket"". New Zealand bowler Neil Wagner on Test Match Special:""I thought we bowled pretty well and England batted well. A tough day. ""We played a first-class game here a couple of weeks ago and it was a similar pitch. With the wind the wicket can dry out a touch. But the bowlers stuck to it pretty well, we kept charging in but England batted really well. ""The ball was swinging still and continued throughout the day but when we put it in the right area, they were patient and when we got it wrong, they put it away. ""But they haven't run away from us and if we get a couple of early wickets tomorrow we're right back in it."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"The Welsh Government runs education in Wales, with a Liberal Democrat minister in charge The Liberal Democrats claim Wales would gain an extra Â£560m a year due to their election pledges on education. The party has unveiled a Â£10bn boost to schools in England in its manifesto. Education is devolved, so more spending in England triggers extra cash for the Welsh Government to use as it sees fit. Pledging to stop Brexit if it wins a majority, the party says it would herald a wider remit for the assembly with powers over policing and prisons. Lib Dem plans to spend more on services in England would generate an extra Â£1.87bn for the Welsh Government in 2024/25, they said. That compares to the Welsh Government's revenue budget of around Â£14.4bn this year. ""The election of a Liberal Democrat majority government on a clear stop Brexit platform will provide a democratic mandate to stop this mess, revoke Article 50 and stay in the EU,"" the manifesto, launched Wednesday, said. ""We are unashamedly fighting to stay in the European Union, and we are the strongest party of Remain."" Why did the Lib Dems go tough on spending? A simple guide to the Liberal Democrats Who should I vote for? Election policy guide Welsh Lib Dem leader Jane Dodds said she would urge ministers in Cardiff to spend the extra money promised on schools, to give children ""the best start in life"". Her party colleague Kirsty Williams is education minister in the Labour-led Welsh Government. ""Our ambitious plans to reverse cuts to education in England would provide Â£560m more that the Welsh Government can spend on our schools and teachers, to ensure we continue to build an education system fit for the 21st Century,"" Ms Dodds said. The Lib Dems say the money would come from what they claim would be a Â£50bn boost to public finances by cancelling Brexit. Jo Swinson said her party's plans would give Wales an extra Â£560m in cash Funding for public services in Wales would be 13% higher in five years compared to this year's budget, under the Liberal Democrats' plans. Inflation will eat into that, and we cannot yet compare it to detailed plans from Labour and the Conservatives who have not published their manifestos. The biggest contribution to the Lib Dems' extra spending is based on the economic growth they expect to see if Brexit was cancelled. Although forecasts say the economy will grow faster if the UK were to remain in the EU, that cannot be guaranteed. The Lib Dems also intend to raise money by putting 1p on all income tax bands. The Welsh Government is free to spend its budget - including any additional funding - on its own priorities. It also has powers to vary the level of income tax so could remove the 1p tax rise if it wanted. Revenue funding covers day-to-day spending, such as wages, and does not include the capital funding that pays to build infrastructure. The manifesto pledges a ""written, federal constitution"" that would make the National Assembly for Wales and the Scottish Parliaments permanent institutions. As it stands, the assembly can technically be abolished through an act of parliament. The Lib Dems would devolve powers over criminal justice to politicians in Cardiff Bay, giving them control over youth justice, probation services, prisons and policing. Criminal justice in Wales is currently overseen by the UK government in London. Plans for policing promise to invest Â£1bn across England and Wales to restore community policing, ""enough for two new police officers in every ward"". The Lib Dems promised to separate England and Wales' legal systems to reflect the growing difference in laws, and to devolve air passenger duty. This video can not be played What does devolution mean? Police and crime commissioners would be abolished and replaced with local boards made up of councillors, while the party would fund a two percent pay rise for police officers. The Lib Dems said it would include the Welsh Government on UK policy making on drug policy and student visas, and create a joint climate council of the nations to coordinate action on the climate emergency. On funding for Wales, the Lib Dems said it recognised that Wales is underfunded and will seek ""over a parliament to increase the Welsh block grant to an equitable level."" Wales' devolved services are mostly funded from the block grant, which comes from the UK government. Use the form below to send us your questions and we could be in touch.

"This video can not be played ""Rail, mail, water and energy into public ownership"": Jeremy Corbyn launches Labour's manifesto Labour has launched its general election manifesto, promising to ""transform"" the UK and to renationalise rail, mail, water and energy. Leader Jeremy Corbyn also vowed ""a green transformation"" of the economy, aiming to get the UK ""on track"" for a net-zero carbon system by the 2030s. The 105 page manifesto,externalincludes a windfall tax on oil firms and scrapping rises in the state pension age. Mr Corbyn said his offer to voters was ""radical"" and would mean ""real change"". He accused ""bankers, billionaires and the establishment"" of wanting to thwart his plans, adding: ""They don't own the Labour Party. The people own the Labour Party."" Kuenssberg: The manifesto Corbyn has always wanted What is in the Labour Party manifesto? Labour eyes 'radical' plan for companies On Brexit, Labour says it wants to renegotiate a new Brexit deal, incorporating a close relationship with the EU, which would then be put to a ""legally binding"" referendum. On Scottish independence, the party says it would not grant permission for a referendum on the issue ""in the early years"" of a Labour government. BBC economics correspondent Dharshini David said Labour's manifesto pledges would add Â£83bn to annual government spending by 2024. The party said this would be paid for by tax increases on higher earners and reversing corporation tax cuts. Â£75bn to build 150,000 new council and social homes a year, within five years An immediate 5% pay rise for public sector workers, with year-on-year above-inflation pay rises to follow Introducing a ""real living wage"" of at least Â£10 an hour Reviewing the retirement age for people in hard manual jobs Introducing a second homes tax Reversing inheritance tax cuts and imposing VAT on private school fees Giving EU nationals living in UK the automatic right to stay Reinstating 3,000 bus routes that have been cut Free broadband for all, delivered by part-nationalising BT A Â£3bn plan to offer adults in England free access to retraining A pledge to reduce all primary school classes to fewer than 30 children Free personal at-home care in England for over-65s most in need of it A pledge to renew the Trident nuclear deterrent and spend at least 2% of GDP on defence Reducing the voting age to 16 This video can not be played BBC political correspondent, Iain Watson, explores what's in Labour's manifesto Speaking at Birmingham City University, Mr Corbyn insisted Labour's policies were fully costed and ""popular"". But there has been internal controversy over the idea of a one-off tax on oil companies, with some trade union officials fearing it would damage Scotland's North Sea Oil industry. Labour and Tories push rival housing policies Labour's big-state, big-spend, transformation plan Mr Corbyn is promising to set up a Â£250bn Green Transformation Fund - to be paid for through borrowing - to fund 300,000 new ""green apprenticeships"" and loans for people to buy electric cars. And Labour is promising to ""achieve the substantial majority of our emissions reductions by 2030 in a way that is evidence-based"". This is without doubt the most ambitious - and most costly - manifesto I've ever seen. Radical it absolutely is, but the question is: is it credible or affordable? Labour says yes, by introducing higher taxes on the wealthy and big businesses. But we live in a globalised era when the wealthy can move their money around. Would they leave their cash in a Labour Britain that was going to tax them more? Another credibility question that centres on Jeremy Corbyn is whether is he the leader to deliver this, given he won't answer the most basic, fundamental political question of our time, which is: ""Are you for or against Brexit?"" Mr Corbyn said it was a ""manifesto of hope"", adding: ""Over the next three weeks, the most powerful people in Britain and their supporters are going to tell you that everything in this manifesto is impossible. ""That it's too much for you. Because they don't want real change. Why would they? The system is working just fine for them. It's rigged in their favour."" The party is hoping its manifesto will help it get back into power for the first time since 2010, but the opinion polls so far suggest it is heading for defeat on 12 December. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn defends ""radical"" Labour manifesto Labour is locked in a battle with the Conservatives - who are also promising to borrow money to spend on public services - in seats across the Midlands and the north of England. In his speech, Mr Corbyn said voters could trust his party to deliver its pledges because ""we're opposed by the vested interests for standing up for a different kind of society"". ""We'll deliver real change for the many, and not the few,"" he said. Responding to the manifesto launch, the Conservatives said: ""A Corbyn-led government would mean higher taxes, the chaos of two more referendums, and frightening levels of debt."" A spokesman added that ""hardworking taxpayers"" would be left to ""foot the bill"". Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said Mr Corbyn's wider plans would be ""badly damaged"" if Labour took the UK out of the EU.

"This video can not be played ""Rail, mail, water and energy into public ownership"": Jeremy Corbyn launches Labour's manifesto Labour has launched its general election manifesto, promising to ""transform"" the UK and to renationalise rail, mail, water and energy. Leader Jeremy Corbyn also vowed ""a green transformation"" of the economy, aiming to get the UK ""on track"" for a net-zero carbon system by the 2030s. The 105 page manifesto,externalincludes a windfall tax on oil firms and scrapping rises in the state pension age. Mr Corbyn said his offer to voters was ""radical"" and would mean ""real change"". He accused ""bankers, billionaires and the establishment"" of wanting to thwart his plans, adding: ""They don't own the Labour Party. The people own the Labour Party."" Kuenssberg: The manifesto Corbyn has always wanted What is in the Labour Party manifesto? Labour eyes 'radical' plan for companies On Brexit, Labour says it wants to renegotiate a new Brexit deal, incorporating a close relationship with the EU, which would then be put to a ""legally binding"" referendum. On Scottish independence, the party says it would not grant permission for a referendum on the issue ""in the early years"" of a Labour government. BBC economics correspondent Dharshini David said Labour's manifesto pledges would add Â£83bn to annual government spending by 2024. The party said this would be paid for by tax increases on higher earners and reversing corporation tax cuts. Â£75bn to build 150,000 new council and social homes a year, within five years An immediate 5% pay rise for public sector workers, with year-on-year above-inflation pay rises to follow Introducing a ""real living wage"" of at least Â£10 an hour Reviewing the retirement age for people in hard manual jobs Introducing a second homes tax Reversing inheritance tax cuts and imposing VAT on private school fees Giving EU nationals living in UK the automatic right to stay Reinstating 3,000 bus routes that have been cut Free broadband for all, delivered by part-nationalising BT A Â£3bn plan to offer adults in England free access to retraining A pledge to reduce all primary school classes to fewer than 30 children Free personal at-home care in England for over-65s most in need of it A pledge to renew the Trident nuclear deterrent and spend at least 2% of GDP on defence Reducing the voting age to 16 This video can not be played BBC political correspondent, Iain Watson, explores what's in Labour's manifesto Speaking at Birmingham City University, Mr Corbyn insisted Labour's policies were fully costed and ""popular"". But there has been internal controversy over the idea of a one-off tax on oil companies, with some trade union officials fearing it would damage Scotland's North Sea Oil industry. Labour and Tories push rival housing policies Labour's big-state, big-spend, transformation plan Mr Corbyn is promising to set up a Â£250bn Green Transformation Fund - to be paid for through borrowing - to fund 300,000 new ""green apprenticeships"" and loans for people to buy electric cars. And Labour is promising to ""achieve the substantial majority of our emissions reductions by 2030 in a way that is evidence-based"". This is without doubt the most ambitious - and most costly - manifesto I've ever seen. Radical it absolutely is, but the question is: is it credible or affordable? Labour says yes, by introducing higher taxes on the wealthy and big businesses. But we live in a globalised era when the wealthy can move their money around. Would they leave their cash in a Labour Britain that was going to tax them more? Another credibility question that centres on Jeremy Corbyn is whether is he the leader to deliver this, given he won't answer the most basic, fundamental political question of our time, which is: ""Are you for or against Brexit?"" Mr Corbyn said it was a ""manifesto of hope"", adding: ""Over the next three weeks, the most powerful people in Britain and their supporters are going to tell you that everything in this manifesto is impossible. ""That it's too much for you. Because they don't want real change. Why would they? The system is working just fine for them. It's rigged in their favour."" The party is hoping its manifesto will help it get back into power for the first time since 2010, but the opinion polls so far suggest it is heading for defeat on 12 December. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn defends ""radical"" Labour manifesto Labour is locked in a battle with the Conservatives - who are also promising to borrow money to spend on public services - in seats across the Midlands and the north of England. In his speech, Mr Corbyn said voters could trust his party to deliver its pledges because ""we're opposed by the vested interests for standing up for a different kind of society"". ""We'll deliver real change for the many, and not the few,"" he said. Responding to the manifesto launch, the Conservatives said: ""A Corbyn-led government would mean higher taxes, the chaos of two more referendums, and frightening levels of debt."" A spokesman added that ""hardworking taxpayers"" would be left to ""foot the bill"". Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said Mr Corbyn's wider plans would be ""badly damaged"" if Labour took the UK out of the EU. He added that ""the extensive plan of nationalisation"" would ""keep government locked down for years"".

"Google is extending a ban on political campaigns targeting advertising at people based on their supposed political leanings. It said political groups would soon only be able to target ads based on ""general categories"" such as age, gender and rough location. This restriction is already in place in the UK and the rest of the EU but will be imposed worldwide on 6 January 2020. That could have big implications for next year's US Presidential vote. The firm said it would also clarify under what circumstances it would remove political ads for making ""false claims"". For example, Google would remove ads that falsely claimed that a candidate had died or that gave the wrong date for an election. However, it would not ban claims that you cannot trust a rival party, for instance, which would be viewed as being a matter of opinion. A spokeswoman told the BBC the new guidance would be provided within a week. Google's approach to deliberately misleading statements puts it at odds with Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg said his social networkwould not fact-check advertisingfrom political candidates or campaigns, although it has since stressed that this does not amount to a totally hand-off approach. ""We prohibit misinformation about voting and do not allow ads which contain content previously debunked by our third party fact-checkers,"" said a spokesman. ""As we've said, we are looking at different ways we might refine our approach to political ads."" Twitter, meanwhile, has said it woulddisallow political advertising altogether. Googleâs new policy puts it somewhere roughly in the middle, suggesting a hands-off approach, with only the the most obvious misinformation being acted upon. âWe recognise that robust political dialogue is an important part of democracy, and no one can sensibly adjudicate every political claim, counterclaim, and insinuation,â said Scott Spencer, Googleâs head of product management for Google Ads. ""So we expect that the number of political ads on which we take action will be very limited - but we will continue to do so for clear violations.â A decision to impose a global ban on political campaigns matching their own databases of prospective voters against Google's user base is set to have major ramifications ahead of next year's US Presidential election.

""So we expect that the number of political ads on which we take action will be very limited - but we will continue to do so for clear violations.â A decision to impose a global ban on political campaigns matching their own databases of prospective voters against Google's user base is set to have major ramifications ahead of next year's US Presidential election. Until now, strategists could use this to target individuals across platforms such as YouTube and Google Search. Based on a userâs browsing habits - such as what news websites they frequent - Google makes an assumption about whether that user has left- or right-leaning political views. In the US - but not in other countries, including the UK - political campaigns had the option to target people based on their political leaning. It was however possible for campaigns in other countries to upload their own lists of contact details - a database of party members, for example - to Google, which would then match it with users on its service so ads could reach those people directly. This will no longer be allowed. ""It will take some time to implement these changes,â Mr Spencer added. Campaigns, like any other advertiser, can still place ads against specific types of content  - such as videos about football or articles on the economy - Google said. Who is spending money to get you to vote? 'Defining what is political advertising is hard' Online election ads - who is targeting whom? Any action taken against advertising deemed to be against its polices will be logged onGoogleâs Transparency Report section,external. Details about deleted ads will appear on the page, but not the advertisement itself. Google said this data would remain downloadable so it could be independently analysed. Political advertising makes up a relatively small amount of Googleâs total advertising revenues, which totalled $116bn in 2018. Since March 2019, for example, Googleâs figures suggest just Â£171,250 has been spent on political advertising ads within the UK. In the US, campaigns have spent $128m on Google ads since the firm started publishing data on the region in May 2018. The biggest spender, the âTrump Make America Great Again Committeeâ, has spent $8.5m on Google since that date. Update 21 November: This article has been changed to reflect the fact in the UK and EU, Google already prevents political parties from targeting ads to users' based on their political views. The original version was based on a blog from the company that incorrectly suggested it would only begin enforcing the rule in the UK within a week and the EU by the end of the year. _____ Follow Dave Leeon Twitter @DaveLeeBBC,external Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

"A protester uses a torch light while crawling within a sewer tunnel to see how wide it is Some of the last protesters remaining at a besieged university in Hong Kong have tried to escape and evade police by crawling through sewers. Hundreds of protesters have already left PolyU but dozens remain inside. The campus - the scene of some of the most intense clashes witnessed during months of anti-government protests - is surrounded by police who are arresting for rioting any adults trying to leave. Six people were arrested on Wednesday for an attempted escape via the sewers. The group included two men climbing out of an underground drain and four people - three men and a woman - who had removed a manhole cover and lowered a rope into the drain to assist them, police said. ""It was complicated and dark down there, I wanted to get home as soon as possible,"" one young man who unsuccessfully attempted a sewer escape told BBC Chinese. ""But how else could we leave the PolyU campus?"" Former UK consulate worker says China tortured him Hong Kong protests explained in 100 and 500 words Hong Kong: 'I was tear gassed getting my lunch' The four-day campus siege at PolyU - Hong Kong Polytechnic University - has been one of the most dramatic confrontations in the wider protest movement that has paralysed the city for more than five months The protests started after the government planned to pass a bill that would allow suspects to be extradited to mainland China. The bill was eventually withdrawn, but the demonstrations continued, having evolved into a broader protest against alleged police brutality, and the way the former British colony is administered by Beijing. PolyU is the last of five Hong Kong universities that protesters had occupied in the last 10 days. Fewer than 100 hardcore demonstrators remain on the campus after days of violent clashes with security forces. Many have surrendered to police or emerged as part of medical evacuations. More than 1,000 people have been arrested. Those under 18 were allowed to go home but had their details registered. Fire service divers searched the tunnels for any trapped protesters Several small groups of protesters seeking to avoid possibly years in prison if arrested on rioting charges have reportedly attempted a dangerous escape route through the sewers. They have descended into the tunnels armed with torches and gas masks. The fire brigade have now blocked the main entrance into the sewers within the PolyU campus to thwart such escapes. On Tuesday and Wednesday divers searched the tunnels for any protesters who might have been trapped but found none. Whether any protesters have successfully escaped via the sewers remains unclear, despite rumours on campus to the contrary. The two arrested on Wednesday made it about half a kilometre from the university when they emerged and were arrested. Bowie, a 21-year-old student who made an attempt, told Reuters news agency: ""The sewer was very smelly, with many cockroaches, many snakes. Every step was very, very painful. I'd never thought that one day I would need to hide in a sewer or escape through sewers to survive."" One protester makes a daring escape Her group spent an hour swimming in the fetid water, but when they emerged, were crushed to realise they were still within the university grounds, she said. Tunnelling out of campus is just the latest escape plan hatched by increasingly desperate protesters. On Monday, dozens slid down ropes from a bridge, fleeing on waiting motorcycles.  Police said nearly 40 of them were later arrested. How is Hong Kong run? Some have tried to flee under cover of darkness while many others have tried to get through police lines, some being beaten before being arrested.

"The teenager drew up a ""hit list"" of areas he wanted to attack A teenage neo-Nazi who wrote about an ""inevitable race war"" in his diary and identified a series of possible targets has been convicted of preparing terrorist acts. The 16-year-old boy listed the locations from his home city of Durham in his ""guerrilla warfare"" manual. He also described himself as a ""natural sadist"", Manchester Crown Court heard. The boy is the youngest person to be convicted of planning a terrorist attack in the UK. A jury found the boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, guilty of preparation of terrorist acts between October 2017 and March this year. He was also convicted of disseminating a terrorist publication, possessing an article for a purpose connected to terrorism and three counts of possessing documents useful to someone preparing acts of terrorism. He was remanded in custody and will be sentenced on 7 January. Teen neo-Nazi became 'living dead' The court heard the boy began drafting a ""manual for practical sensible guerrilla warfare against the Jewish system in Durham City area"". The manual listed ""means of attack"" and ""areas to attack"", which listed local venues ""worth attacking"" such as post offices, pubs and schools. A ""things to do"" list from August 2018 included the words ""shed empathy"" alongside a hand-drawn symbol of the Order of Nine Angles, which the court heard was a ""self-consciously, explicitly malevolent"" Satanic organisation. The boy denied being a neo-Nazi, saying his writings were an extremist ""alter ego"" The boy also wrote of planning to conduct an arson spree with Molotov cocktails on local synagogues. Jurors heard, in the course of his internet searches, he looked for a ""map of synagogues in the UK"" and ""Newcastle synagogue"". He also visited websites on firearms and was in communication with a gun auctioneer. After his arrest in March, police found him in possession of instructions showing to make bombs and the poison ricin. They also found he had distributed firearms manuals online by uploading them to a neo-Nazi website. The boy had started writing a ""guerrilla warfare"" manual Giving evidence, the boy denied being a neo-Nazi and said he had merely created an extremist ""persona"" online and in his journal. Det Chf Supt Martin Snowden, head of Counter Terrorism Policing North East, said: ""The extreme right wing views and hateful rhetoric displayed by this teenager are deeply concerning and we cannot account for those who may have been susceptible to his influence or how they may act in the future. ""His extensive repetitious internet searches, diary entries and escalating behaviour combined with his desire for notoriety highlight how dangerous he could have become had he not come to the attention of the authorities.""

"Two in five adults would fake a sick day if they needed a day off, a Com Res survey for the BBC suggests. When questioned on their morals and values, people admitted to lying about sickness, stealing and taking credit for other people's work. While younger staff lied more often than their elders, they were more willing to stand up for colleagues. The average worker takes about four sick days a year, according to the Office for National Statistics. The most common reasons for calling off work in 2018 were the common cold, musculoskeletal problems (like back pain), mental health conditions and ""other"" problems. Sickness due to fibbing was unsurprisingly not included in the government's statistics. The UK-wide survey questioned 3,655 adults aged over 16. The findings are part of a larger survey about what people in the UK find right and wrong. As well as faking sickies, employees are often also prepared to cover for colleagues who they know might be faking it. The survey found that 66% would not tell bosses if they knew their colleagues were absent, but not ill. Hayley Lewis, an occupational psychologist, said it takes confidence to tell your boss you need a break, and if the relationship is bad, employees will tend to be less truthful. Two-thirds of workers would not tell bosses if they knew their colleagues were absent, but not ill. ""'People don't leave an organisation - they leave their boss' goes the saying,"" says Ms Lewis. Also, people can be influenced by their boss' behaviour, she adds. ""We look to role models. If the boss is dragging themselves in, not taking breaks, eating lunch at their desk, it reinforces the message that it is not okay to take a break,"" she says. That often leaves employees only one option, Ms Lewis says - to ring up sick. Men were almost twice as likely as women to say they would accept praise from a boss for work that someone else had done. And almost a third said they stole work supplies like staplers and notebooks. The younger the employee, the more likely they were to speak up for women in the workplace. Workers under 34 were more than twice as likely than older colleagues to turn to senior managers, or intervene. if they saw a male boss touch a female employee on the back during a meeting. Only 16% of workers aged over 55 agreed. While 70% of younger adults would report or intervene if a senior figure in a company made sexual comments towards a younger colleague, less than half of people over 55 would do the same.

"This video can not be played ""Rail, mail, water and energy into public ownership"": Jeremy Corbyn launches Labour's manifesto Labour has launched its general election manifesto, promising to ""transform"" the UK and to renationalise rail, mail, water and energy. Leader Jeremy Corbyn also vowed ""a green transformation"" of the economy, aiming to get the UK ""on track"" for a net-zero carbon system by the 2030s. The 105 page manifesto,externalincludes a windfall tax on oil firms and scrapping rises in the state pension age. Mr Corbyn said his offer to voters was ""radical"" and would mean ""real change"". He accused ""bankers, billionaires and the establishment"" of wanting to thwart his plans, adding: ""They don't own the Labour Party. The people own the Labour Party."" Kuenssberg: The manifesto Corbyn has always wanted What is in the Labour Party manifesto? Labour eyes 'radical' plan for companies On Brexit, Labour says it wants to renegotiate a new Brexit deal, incorporating a close relationship with the EU, which would then be put to a ""legally binding"" referendum. On Scottish independence, the party says it would not grant permission for a referendum on the issue ""in the early years"" of a Labour government. BBC economics correspondent Dharshini David said Labour's manifesto pledges would add Â£83bn to annual government spending by 2024. The party said this would be paid for by tax increases on higher earners and reversing corporation tax cuts. Â£75bn to build 150,000 new council and social homes a year, within five years An immediate 5% pay rise for public sector workers, with year-on-year above-inflation pay rises to follow Introducing a ""real living wage"" of at least Â£10 an hour Reviewing the retirement age for people in hard manual jobs Introducing a second homes tax Reversing inheritance tax cuts and imposing VAT on private school fees Giving EU nationals living in UK the automatic right to stay Reinstating 3,000 bus routes that have been cut Free broadband for all, delivered by part-nationalising BT A Â£3bn plan to offer adults in England free access to retraining A pledge to reduce all primary school classes to fewer than 30 children Free personal at-home care in England for over-65s most in need of it A pledge to renew the Trident nuclear deterrent and spend at least 2% of GDP on defence Reducing the voting age to 16 This video can not be played BBC political correspondent, Iain Watson, explores what's in Labour's manifesto Speaking at Birmingham City University, Mr Corbyn insisted Labour's policies were fully costed and ""popular"". But there has been internal controversy over the idea of a one-off tax on oil companies, with some trade union officials fearing it would damage Scotland's North Sea Oil industry. Labour and Tories push rival housing policies Labour's big-state, big-spend, transformation plan Mr Corbyn is promising to set up a Â£250bn Green Transformation Fund - to be paid for through borrowing - to fund 300,000 new ""green apprenticeships"" and loans for people to buy electric cars. And Labour is promising to ""achieve the substantial majority of our emissions reductions by 2030 in a way that is evidence-based"". This is without doubt the most ambitious - and most costly - manifesto I've ever seen. Radical it absolutely is, but the question is: is it credible or affordable? Labour says yes, by introducing higher taxes on the wealthy and big businesses. But we live in a globalised era when the wealthy can move their money around. Would they leave their cash in a Labour Britain that was going to tax them more? Another credibility question that centres on Jeremy Corbyn is whether is he the leader to deliver this, given he won't answer the most basic, fundamental political question of our time, which is: ""Are you for or against Brexit?"" Mr Corbyn said it was a ""manifesto of hope"", adding: ""Over the next three weeks, the most powerful people in Britain and their supporters are going to tell you that everything in this manifesto is impossible. ""That it's too much for you. Because they don't want real change. Why would they? The system is working just fine for them. It's rigged in their favour."" The party is hoping its manifesto will help it get back into power for the first time since 2010, but the opinion polls so far suggest it is heading for defeat on 12 December. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn defends ""radical"" Labour manifesto Labour is locked in a battle with the Conservatives - who are also promising to borrow money to spend on public services - in seats across the Midlands and the north of England. In his speech, Mr Corbyn said voters could trust his party to deliver its pledges because ""we're opposed by the vested interests for standing up for a different kind of society"". ""We'll deliver real change for the many, and not the few,"" he said. Responding to the manifesto launch, the Conservatives said: ""A Corbyn-led government would mean higher taxes, the chaos of two more referendums, and frightening levels of debt."" A spokesman added that ""hardworking taxpayers"" would be left to ""foot the bill"". Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said Mr Corbyn's wider plans would be ""badly damaged"" if Labour took the UK out of the EU.

"This video can not be played Simon Cheng says he was blindfolded and beaten in China A former employee of the UK's Hong Kong consulate has told the BBC that he was tortured in China and accused of inciting political unrest in the city. Simon Cheng, a Hong Kong citizen who worked for the UK government for almost two years, was detained for 15 days on a trip to mainland China in August. ""I was shackled, blindfolded and hooded,"" the 29-year-old tells me. UK government sources say they believe his claims - of being beaten and forced to sign confessions - are credible. Following our interview, the British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab summoned the Chinese ambassador. ""We are outraged by the disgraceful mistreatment that Mr Cheng faced when he was in detention in mainland China... and we've made clear that we expect the Chinese authorities to review and hold to account those responsible,"" Mr Raab told the BBC. But on Wednesday a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson told the BBC they ""absolutely cannot accept the UK government's interference in this case"" - and would in return summon the UK ambassador to ""express their opposition and anger"". ""We hope the UK will be prudent and stop interfering in Hong Kong and in China's domestic affairs because it will, eventually, only harm the UK's own interests,"" the spokesperson added. Mr Cheng says he spent his free time gathering information about Hong Kong's protests, at the urging of the British Consulate Mr Cheng's raises questions for both the Chinese and the UK governments. The claims he makes - including that he saw other Hongkongers in Chinese custody - are likely to fuel protesters' fears that their city's freedoms are being eroded under Chinese rule. ""They said they work for the secret service and that there are no human rights,"" he tells me. ""Then they started the torture."" As a trade and investment officer at the UK consulate, Simon Cheng's particular brief was to drum up interest in investing in Scotland among the Chinese business community. It required him to travel frequently to mainland China. But in June, with Hong Kong engulfed in mass demonstrations, Mr Cheng volunteered for an additional role. ""The British Consulate instructed staff to collect information about the status of the protests,"" he says. As a supporter of the pro-democracy movement he found it easy to blend in and, with the consent of the consulate, he signed up to some of the social media groups through which the protesters co-ordinated their actions. Paid overtime for the information he gathered, he began reporting back what he saw to his colleagues. His task, both Mr Cheng and UK government sources insist, was not to direct events in any way but to purely observe - the kind of civil society monitoring work many embassies do. Mr Cheng says he was paid overtime to gather information on Hong Kong's protests But China had already begun to accuse the UK of meddling in Hong Kong, with British politicians becoming increasing vocal in their support for the protesters. On 8 August, with emails still on his phone linking him to that work observing the protests, he was sent by the consulate to a business conference in the Chinese city of Shenzhen. He didn't know it, but his life was about to change forever. Although China has ruled Hong Kong for more than 20 years, the border between the city and the mainland still looks and feels like an international boundary. The ""one country two systems"" principle - that the protesters say they are fighting to preserve - is meant to ensure that Hong Kong retains control over most of its affairs, including its borders. But Simon Cheng was about to discover for himself the blurred edges of that legal and political framework. Since the opening of the Hong Kong-Shenzhen high-speed rail link last year, a new border post has been placed inside West Kowloon station, in the heart of Hong Kong. The West Kowloon railway station, where Mr Cheng was first detained, has also seen protests It is deeply controversial: Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement views the presence of the Chinese police, manning the Chinese side, as an unwelcome extension of Chinese authority. It was here they stopped Simon Cheng, returning from his business trip. He was put on a train, transported back to Shenzhen and handed over, he says, to three plainclothes officers from China's National Security Police. Raising his arms above his head Mr Cheng shows me how he was hung up from the chain linking the handcuffs on his wrists. The questions focused on his involvement in the protests with the aim, he says, of forcing him to confess to fomenting unrest on behalf of the British state. ""They wanted to know what role the UK had in the Hong Kong protests - they asked what support, money and equipment we were giving to the protesters."" The detention centre where Mr Cheng alleges he was held He says he was made to hold stress positions - squatting against a wall for example - for hours on end, and beaten if he moved. ""They would beat the bony parts, like my ankles... or any vulnerable part."" He claims he was subjected to sleep deprivation, with his interrogators forcing him to sing the Chinese national anthem to keep himself awake. And, he believes, he was not the only Hongkonger undergoing such treatment. ""I saw a bunch of Hong Kong people getting arrested and interrogated. I heard someone speak in Cantonese saying: 'Raise your hands up - you raised the flags in the protest didn't you?'"" Summaryof theprotests in 100 or 500 words Timelineofmajor events so far How is Hong Kong runand what is the Basic Law? Watch: The identity crisis behind the protests Avisual guideto how one peaceful protest turned violent From a large pile of more than 1,000 photographs of Hong Kong protesters, he says, he was told to jot down the names and political affiliations of anyone he recognised. ""The secret police clearly stated that batches after batches of Hong Kong protesters had been caught, delivered and detained in mainland China."" Strapped to a chair and held by his hair, he says they tried to force him to open his mobile phone using the facial recognition function. Once they'd gained access, they printed off the emails detailing the information he'd passed to the UK consulate about the protests. ""I told them I want to make it 100% clear, the UK didn't assign resources or help with the protests,"" he tells me. But it was no use. Eventually, they made him record two video confessions, he says, one for the ""betrayal of the motherland"" and another for ""soliciting prostitution"". The detention of a local employee of a foreign embassy or consulate is a relatively rare event. The last high-profile case involving the UK was the arrest in 2009 of a number of Iranian employees at the British embassy in Tehran. They were accused of playing a significant role in that year's violent demonstrations - an accusation that finds echoes in Simon Cheng's account. Mr Cheng, pictured during a BBC interview, says he was forced into stress positions by China's National Security Police As in his own case, locally-employed staff usually have no diplomatic protection, potentially making them soft targets for intelligence gathering. But Mr Cheng may have been targeted for other reasons. He tells me he had a mainland Chinese friend who'd been arrested for taking part in the Hong Kong protests and was now on bail there. During his business trip to Shenzhen, without the knowledge of the UK consulate, Mr Cheng had met the relatives of this friend to collect money for his living expenses. Any mainlander known to have joined the pro-democracy demonstrations would be at risk of being placed under Chinese surveillance. Although collecting money for a friend in legal difficulty is unlikely to constitute a crime, even in China, it could well have placed Mr Cheng under suspicion too. I ask him what he thinks is the most likely reason for his detention - his position at the UK consulate, or his friendship with this mainland Chinese protester? ""Until now I have no idea,"" he replies. ""But I think both factors could be part of the reason."" Alongside our interview, Mr Cheng haspublished his own detailed account,externalof what happened to him. In it, he says that on the 11th day of his detention his treatment suddenly improved, a date that he says coincides with the first international media reports about his disappearance. UK government sources say that, behind the scenes, intense diplomatic activity was already under way to try to secure his release. Of China's only public version of events - the allegation that he was placed in 15 days administrative detention for soliciting prostitution - Mr Cheng is dismissive. ""It was a tactic for secretly and arbitrarily incarcerating me for an even longer period, without interference from third parties."" The detention prompted a public outcry and considerable media coverage In China, administrative detention is a penalty that can be imposed by the police, acting with no judicial oversight. And, he suggests, the circumstances of his arrest appear unusual. Allegations of soliciting prostitution are normally dealt with in China as a routine matter by the local police. They are far less likely to be the concern of the Chinese border authorities in West Kowloon station. Mr Cheng's written statement also mentions that, before his arrest, he stopped in Shenzhen for a massage. I ask him directly if he paid for sex. ""I don't want to focus on the question of whether I solicited a prostitute, because that's exactly what they want,"" he replies. ""So, I just want to state clearly that I did nothing regrettable to the people I cherish and love."" Whatever the reasons behind the decision to release him, he says it came with a warning. ""They stated that if I receive media interviews and speak out [about] anything other than 'soliciting prostitution' publicly, I will be taken back to mainland China from Hong Kong."" The UK's Hong Kong consulate has since reviewed, and tightened up, its guidelines for local staff travelling on work trips to the Chinese mainland. Simon Cheng has told the BBC that he believes it is too dangerous for him to return to Hong Kong. Initially, he was so concerned about his safety, he refused to allow the UK government to issue a statement condemning the way he'd been treated. 'I was tear gassed getting my lunch' 'Why we stormed the parliament' Picture power: portraits of Hong Kong protesters 'I can't say I love China anymore' He was also given little choice but to resign because the UK government now sees him as a security risk following his long interrogation at the hands of the Chinese secret police. But UK sources say he has been provided with support, including a two-year working visa for the UK. ""Our hearts are with Simon Cheng and his family,"" Dominic Raab, the British Foreign Secretary, told the BBC. ""From the outset my overriding concern has been to make sure that he's taken care of properly and he gets the support that he needs."" Mr Cheng believes it is too dangerous for him to go back to Hong Kong, and says he is seeking asylum But Mr Cheng's written statement suggests he does not see the protection he's being offered as adequate and, he says, he's now seeking asylum anywhere he can feel safe. While he faces an uncertain future, the political and diplomatic ramifications of his extraordinary testimony are likely to be significant. The claims he makes will feed into the already frayed relations between the UK and China over the subject of Hong Kong. China will face questions about the use of torture in its headlong search for proof of foreign interference. The British government will face questions about whether it could have done more to protect Mr Cheng as well as its treatment of him since. As for Hong Kong's protesters - who began their fight against an extradition bill that would have allowed suspects to be sent to China - Simon Cheng's story will confirm one thing above all else: that there is indeed much to fear from a justice system so at odds with their own.

"This video can not be played ""Rail, mail, water and energy into public ownership"": Jeremy Corbyn launches Labour's manifesto Labour has launched its general election manifesto, promising to ""transform"" the UK and to renationalise rail, mail, water and energy. Leader Jeremy Corbyn also vowed ""a green transformation"" of the economy, aiming to get the UK ""on track"" for a net-zero carbon system by the 2030s. The 105 page manifesto,externalincludes a windfall tax on oil firms and scrapping rises in the state pension age. Mr Corbyn said his offer to voters was ""radical"" and would mean ""real change"". He accused ""bankers, billionaires and the establishment"" of wanting to thwart his plans, adding: ""They don't own the Labour Party. The people own the Labour Party."" Kuenssberg: The manifesto Corbyn has always wanted What is in the Labour Party manifesto? Labour eyes 'radical' plan for companies On Brexit, Labour says it wants to renegotiate a new Brexit deal, incorporating a close relationship with the EU, which would then be put to a ""legally binding"" referendum. On Scottish independence, the party says it would not grant permission for a referendum on the issue ""in the early years"" of a Labour government. BBC economics correspondent Dharshini David said Labour's manifesto pledges would add Â£83bn to annual government spending by 2024. The party said this would be paid for by tax increases on higher earners and reversing corporation tax cuts. Â£75bn to build 150,000 new council and social homes a year, within five years An immediate 5% pay rise for public sector workers, with year-on-year above-inflation pay rises to follow Introducing a ""real living wage"" of at least Â£10 an hour Reviewing the retirement age for people in hard manual jobs Introducing a second homes tax Reversing inheritance tax cuts and imposing VAT on private school fees Giving EU nationals living in UK the automatic right to stay Reinstating 3,000 bus routes that have been cut Free broadband for all, delivered by part-nationalising BT A Â£3bn plan to offer adults in England free access to retraining A pledge to reduce all primary school classes to fewer than 30 children Free personal at-home care in England for over-65s most in need of it A pledge to renew the Trident nuclear deterrent and spend at least 2% of GDP on defence Reducing the voting age to 16 This video can not be played BBC political correspondent, Iain Watson, explores what's in Labour's manifesto Speaking at Birmingham City University, Mr Corbyn insisted Labour's policies were fully costed and ""popular"". But there has been internal controversy over the idea of a one-off tax on oil companies, with some trade union officials fearing it would damage Scotland's North Sea Oil industry. Labour and Tories push rival housing policies Labour's big-state, big-spend, transformation plan Mr Corbyn is promising to set up a Â£250bn Green Transformation Fund - to be paid for through borrowing - to fund 300,000 new ""green apprenticeships"" and loans for people to buy electric cars. And Labour is promising to ""achieve the substantial majority of our emissions reductions by 2030 in a way that is evidence-based"". This is without doubt the most ambitious - and most costly - manifesto I've ever seen. Radical it absolutely is, but the question is: is it credible or affordable? Labour says yes, by introducing higher taxes on the wealthy and big businesses. But we live in a globalised era when the wealthy can move their money around. Would they leave their cash in a Labour Britain that was going to tax them more? Another credibility question that centres on Jeremy Corbyn is whether is he the leader to deliver this, given he won't answer the most basic, fundamental political question of our time, which is: ""Are you for or against Brexit?"" Mr Corbyn said it was a ""manifesto of hope"", adding: ""Over the next three weeks, the most powerful people in Britain and their supporters are going to tell you that everything in this manifesto is impossible. ""That it's too much for you. Because they don't want real change. Why would they? The system is working just fine for them. It's rigged in their favour."" The party is hoping its manifesto will help it get back into power for the first time since 2010, but the opinion polls so far suggest it is heading for defeat on 12 December. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn defends ""radical"" Labour manifesto Labour is locked in a battle with the Conservatives - who are also promising to borrow money to spend on public services - in seats across the Midlands and the north of England. In his speech, Mr Corbyn said voters could trust his party to deliver its pledges because ""we're opposed by the vested interests for standing up for a different kind of society"". ""We'll deliver real change for the many, and not the few,"" he said. Responding to the manifesto launch, the Conservatives said: ""A Corbyn-led government would mean higher taxes, the chaos of two more referendums, and frightening levels of debt."" A spokesman added that ""hardworking taxpayers"" would be left to ""foot the bill"". Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said Mr Corbyn's wider plans would be ""badly damaged"" if Labour took the UK out of the EU. He added that ""the extensive plan of nationalisation"" would ""keep government locked down for years"".

The Liberal Democrats have vowed to cancel Brexit if elected as a majority government, or otherwise campaign for a referendum including the option of staying in the EU. The SNP wants Scotland to stay in the EU. The Brexit Party wants the UK to leave immediately without an exit deal, but negotiate a free trade agreement with the EU. Carbon neutrality:The Conservatives have said they want to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, while the Liberal Democrats have pledged to achieve this by 2045. The Green party has gone even further, by aiming for carbon neutrality by 2030. The SNP says it wants a 100% reduction in emissions as soon as possible. Housing:The Liberal Democrats say total house building should rise to 300,000 homes each year, a third of which should be for social rent. The party wants to allow social renters to use their rent payments to build up a stake in their property, and give government-backed loans to first-time renters to help with tenancy deposits. The Conservatives have announced measures which they say will boost private house building, promising a million homes over the next five years. They have also pledged to ""work with investors and others"" to increase the availability of long-term fixed rate mortgages up to 95% of a house's value.

"This video can not be played Lib Dems want to stop Boris Johnson winning a majority, says Davey The Lib Dems' deputy leader says the party can stop Boris Johnson from winning the general election ""and through that we can stop Brexit"". Sir Ed Davey told the BBC the most likely outcome on 12 December was a ""minority Tory government"". He suggested the Lib Dems would support them, along with other parties, if they agreed to another EU referendum. The party launched its election manifesto earlier with a pledge to stop Brexit which they say would save Â£50bn. If the party wins the general election outright, it says it would revoke Article 50, halting Brexit and keeping the UK in the European Union. If it does not win, it will continue campaigning for another EU referendum, or ""People's Vote"". Sir Ed told the BBC's Andrew Neil Show the party wants to stop the Conservatives getting a majority at the election and then use whatever leverage they have to push for another referendum. Live: Debate reaction and Lib Dem manifesto Islam: Lib Dems are banking on taxation with a purpose Lib Dems promise 20,000 more teachers A simple guide to the Liberal Democrats ""The most likely result I think, looking at the figures, is probably a minority Tory government,"" said Sir Ed. ""If it's a minority Tory government, Boris Johnson says he wants to deliver Brexitâ¦ The only way he could do that is with a People's Vote and so we will challenge him and we will work with others to say 'if you want to do what you said, Mr Johnsonâ¦ if you want to do what you said, work for a People's Vote."" He added: ""We can stop Boris Johnson getting a majority and through that we can stop Brexit."" Sources inside the party concede now that after the withdrawal of the Brexit Party in Conservative seats, what might have been a wildly unpredictable four-way race, has moved to a scrappy national two-way - with the SNP separately dominant in Scotland, and the third smaller UK-wide party eagerly trying to nibble at the margins to get in. With Labour yet to make any big breakthrough in the campaign, the Lib Dems claim they are the ones who can nab seats from the Conservatives. So Lib Dem votes in marginal seats are the ones that could prevent Johnson from a clear run at five years in office. The party's private hopes a few weeks ago of a massive increase in the number of seats has slipped a lot. Read Laura's full blog This video can not be played Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson is pressed on whether she'd block a Tory or Labour government Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson has repeatedly insisted that she is aiming to be the prime minister of a Liberal Democrat government after 12 December's election - but she admitted in a BBC interview that it would be a ""big step"", given the current opinion polls. She told the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg her MPs would not actively support a Labour or Tory programme of government as she believes neither Jeremy Corbyn nor Boris Johnson are fit to be prime minister. But she did not rule out allowing either of them to take office - by abstaining in a vote on their first Queen's Speech - if they agreed to hold another EU referendum. She also suggested there could be a ""government of national unity"" - made up of senior figures from different parties - if there was no overall winner at the polls. ""It's certainly something which I put forward and suggested a few months ago, it wasn't something which there was a majority for, ultimately, in the previous Parliament, but we don't know what the arithmetic of the next Parliament will look like. ""And I just don't think that we should be sort of trapped by convention into thinking our politics has to go down the tramlines that we've assumed it would in the past because this is a time of change in politics."" She said people needed to be ""more imaginative about what happens"" after an election, suggesting that there were MPs in other parties that the Lib Dems could work with. At her party's manifesto launch, Ms Swinson said the economic boost the UK would get from staying in the EU was at the heart of her plan to build a ""brighter future for people"". The so-called Â£50bn ""Remain bonus"" would pay for 20,000 new teachers, extra cash for schools and support for the low-paid. She said the UK ""deserved better"" than Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn in Number 10. The largest single spending commitmentin the Lib Dems' 96-page manifesto,external, launched at an event in north London, is a major expansion of free childcare, to be paid for by an increase in corporation tax and changes to capital gains allowances on the sale of assets. There are also eye-catching pledges to freeze the cost of many rail fares for five years, to legalise and tax cannabis sales to over-18s and to charge those taking frequent international flights more. The Lib Dems are hoping to significantly boost their presence in Parliament on the back of their opposition to Brexit, as they target pro-Remain seats in the south of England and London held by the Conservatives and Labour. Speaking at her manifesto launch, she accused Boris Johnson of ""lying"" when he said a Tory victory on 12 December would ""get Brexit done"". What lay ahead instead, she said, were ""years and years of endless trade negotiations"" with the EU and ""more time and energy wasted in getting something we know will not be as good as what we have now"".
