Over the course of the campaign almost every single poll has had the Conservatives ahead by at least 6%. So if they don't end up with the most votes it would be a serious failure. Labour have consistently been in a clear second place, a long way ahead of the Liberal Democrats in third. The Brexit Party started the campaign at around 10% of the vote but have fallen back dramatically - in part as a result of their decision not to contest Conservative-held seats. In Scotland the picture is very different. In the few polls there have been, the SNP has always had a commanding lead with the Conservatives in second place. Again, if that's not the result then the polls will have been badly flawed. For most of the campaign there have been marked differences between the polling companies. But all of them have suggested that the race has narrowed in the final two weeks. Out of 100 people who are likely to vote, about... Please upgrade your browser or enable JavaScript to see the full interactive experience There's about a 90% chance that the true support for each party lies within the ranges shown above, which means there's a one in 10 chance that it lies outside these ranges. * Because the SNP and Plaid Cymru only campaign in Scotland and Wales respectively, the margins of error for their support across Great Britain is likely to be less than +/- 1% What most polls don't tell us is how votes will be converted into seats in the House of Commons. There have been several attempts to do this, though, using large polling samples which allow complex analyses of the levels of support for each party among different demographic groups. The central forecast of the final YouGov projection is a Conservative majority of 28. But it's important to look at the range of possible outcomes their analysis implies. For the Conservatives that range is 311-367 seats. So, on this basis, another hung parliament cannot be ruled out - and neither can a large majority. The BBC won't report on any polls that come out on polling day so this will be the final update to the poll tracker. The exit poll, commissioned by the BBC, ITV News and Sky News will be published when voting ends at 22.00 GMT on Thursday night. Compare where the parties stand on key issues like Brexit, education and the NHS. General election manifesto guide Going into the last few days of the election campaign the Conservative lead over Labour remains solid. The latest polls all put the Conservatives in the low to mid-40s and Labour in the low 30s in percentage terms across Britain as a whole. The Lib Dems are in a narrow 11-14% range and the Brexit Party are in low single digits - a long way down compared to where they started. Over the course of the campaign, both of the main parties have seen their poll ratings go up but the gap between the two is more or less where it was five weeks ago. As Sir John Curtice has pointed out, if the result on Thursday is in line with these numbers then the Conservatives are probably on course for a decent majority in the House of Commons. There should be a few more polls to come over the next three days - as well as another YouGov seat projection - so that could still change. But there would have to be a pretty big shift to point to a different overall result. Of course, they could all be systematically wrong - it wouldn't be the first time if that turned out to be true. But if you're using the polls as a guide to what could happen then their message is clear. The latest batch of polls lends more weight to the suggestion that the Conservative rise, which has been a consistent feature of the election campaign, has levelled off. That doesn't mean they can't go up any further, but for the time being it seems as though support for them is fairly static. Meanwhile, the Labour Party is still moving upwards - apparently mostly at the expense of the Liberal Democrats. If this trend continues, then we could be on course for another election where the two biggest parties capture a very large share of the overall vote. It would still need another big move, though, to reach the 84% that the Conservatives and Labour achieved between them in 2017. And there are only ten days to go. Our poll tracker smoothes out the bumps in polling by including old polls. Their influence decays, halving every week, but that still means our rolling average can look a little behind the latest figures. The differences are all smaller than the margin of error, but if parties are picking up or losing share, we might be a point or two off what a simple average of the latest polls would tell you. That's not so apparent when the parties are all moving in parallel - so we're lagging a little for everyone and the differences between parties will look similar. But, with the Conservatives plateauing, it might take a little while before our tracker starts to show Labour catching up as the most recent polls suggest they might be. YouGov's seat projection has raised a lot of interest. A lot of that is down to the fact that when they did the same exercise in 2017 they were pretty successful at forecasting the overall election result as well as the outcome in most individual constituencies. Their new projection puts the Conservatives on 359 seats, Labour on 211, the SNP on 43, Lib Dems on 13 and other parties on 24. That suggests a Conservative majority of 68. However, this still needs to be treated with caution for several reasons. It's still based on polling which, as we know, is always subject to error. The margin of error for this model ranges from a Conservative landslide to a very slim majority. Whilst the model uses a sophisticated technique to see how national polling trends play out in individual constituencies, it is always going to be very difficult to account for truly local factors - such as a prominent local independent candidate. Also, some other recent polls have suggested that Labour have moved a bit closer to the Conservatives than they are in the YouGov poll. That would clearly have an impact on the size of any overall majority, and the polls will continue to move between now and 12 December. So, whilst the projection is certainly very interesting, it shouldn't be treated as providing a reliable forecast of what the result of the election will be. One other feature of the most recent polls is that, with one clear exception, there seems to be more consistency between the different polling companies. If you look back to the beginning of October, there were very large differences between them. Now, each of the parties seems to be performing in a fairly narrow range across the polls: the low 40s for the Conservatives; close to 30% for Labour, and the mid-teens for the Lib Dems. The outlier is Opinium's latest poll which has the Conservatives on 47% and the Lib Dems down on 12%. Of course, convergence doesn't mean the polls can tell us what the final result will be. There's still more than two weeks to go and the lesson from 2015 is that there can be a consistent error across nearly all polls. Overall, the polls from the last week have shown the same pattern of movement as they have throughout the campaign. In particular, the Conservatives have gone up again in the BBC poll tracker and the Brexit Party continues to fall. There may be the first signs in the raw polling figures, though, that the Conservative shift is beginning to level off. Several of the pollsters have them one or two points below their peak in the latest figures. Even if their rise does stall, though, the Tories are now fairly close to the 43% they actually achieved at the 2017 election. A new Panelbase poll in Scotland also puts them only marginally below the result from last time. However, a result along those lines wouldn't mean their vote share was approximately flat across the country. The national figures can mask big shifts at a local level. There could still be dramatic swings in individual constituencies. Writing updates on the election campaign polls is beginning to get a bit repetitive. Once again, the changes since last week are basically following the same pattern as we've seen before. The Conservatives are up and Labour is also up a bit. The Brexit Party is down, and the Lib Dems are also a bit lower than before. In fact, the Conservatives are now pushing towards the 43% they actually achieved across Britain at the general election in 2017. As we noted last week, pollsters are adjusting their methodologies to take account of the fact that the Brexit Party has withdrawn in Conservative-held seats. That ought to help them hold on to seats they're defending. Perhaps slightly counterintuitively, though, it might mean Boris Johnson needs a bigger lead in the polls to be sure of winning an overall majority of MPs. Piling on extra votes in safe Conservative constituencies, thanks to the absence of a Brexit Party candidate, probably won't translate into extra seats in the House of Commons. A poll by LucidTalk covering the election in Northern Ireland was also published last week. These are few and far between, and the poll was conducted before the official election campaign got underway, so it's very hard to get a good sense of any trends. But compared to the 2017 election, the poll suggested the DUP and Sinn Fein losing vote share with the Alliance and SDLP going up. If the actual election result goes a similar way it could mean the smaller parties making gains in terms of seats at the expense of the big two. We are starting to see the pollsters respond to the tactical voting arrangements by parties. YouGov's latest poll removed the Brexit Party, Liberal Democrats, Green and Plaid Cymru as an option in seats where they have stood down. The most notable, if unsurprising, effect was for the Brexit Party. Their support roughly halved from 9% to 4% as they roughly halved the number of constituencies in which they are standing. Other pollsters have said they will follow suit. We can expect further changes as nominations close and it becomes clear who is standing in each constituency. So there will be even more movements in the poll tracker over the coming weeks. Some of it will be, as ever, down to the changing political landscape. But some will be down to pollsters' efforts to measure that landscape more accurately. We are starting to see the pollsters respond to the tactical voting arrangements by parties.

But some will be down to pollsters' efforts to measure that landscape more accurately. The trends that were noticeable in the polls a week ago have carried on over the last seven days. The Conservatives have continued their steady upward progress. But the tentative signs of a Labour recovery have also become firmer. Both parties' average scores are up, although they're still below the vote shares they recorded at the 2017 election - more than 10% below in Labour's case. Going in the other direction, the Brexit Party are down to 9% in the BBC poll tracker - their lowest score since the party was launched in April. And it's now clear that the Liberal Democrats have fallen away a little from where they were a month ago. YouGov has also published polls for Wales and Scotland. In Wales, they have Labour up four points with the Lib Dems losing the same amount since the last poll. Labour, on 29%, are now roughly on a par with the Conservatives on 28%. Since there are so few Welsh polls probably the best we can say with any confidence is that it looks close between the two main parties - with Plaid Cymru, the Liberal Democrats and the Brexit Party also in a close battle for third place. The Scotland poll gave the SNP a very large lead on 42%, with the Conservatives in a clear second place, and Labour falling to its lowest score since before the last election - just below the Lib Dems. However, that poll was conducted more than two weeks ago, before the election was even confirmed so it's rather likely that these figures are out of date. There can be little doubt, however, that the SNP are currently on course for a strong result. It's nearly a week now since it became clear that there would be a general election on 12 December. There have already been eight polls conducted since then - we can expect that from now on they will be coming thick and fast. Over the last seven days the Conservatives have continued their upward trend in the BBC poll tracker whilst the Brexit Party are still drifting downwards. There are also some early signs of a recovery for Labour. They've hit an average of 26% - their highest figure since the first half of September. Meanwhile the Liberal Democrats have fallen to 17% - their lowest since the start of June. These movements are pretty small so far, though, so we will need to see if they continue in the coming days. There's no doubt that Brexit will be a major issue at this election. But as the campaign gets underway, will other policy areas come to the fore? Opinium has found that Brexit is a more dominant subject as the campaign gets under way than it was at the last general election. Forty per cent of people in their latest poll said it was the single issue that was most likely to influence their vote. That compares with 18% at the start of the 2017 campaign. However, when people were asked to name the three most important issues facing the country, 59% of respondents identified health/NHS compared to only 52% for the EU/Brexit. That's a shift compared to their recent polls where Brexit has come out on top or in equal first place. It's possible that by campaigning on non-Brexit issues the parties will be able to influence how much weight voters give to different subjects. Panelbase's latest poll also puts the NHS/health as the top issue. On the other hand, Deltapoll have Britain leaving the EU clearly ahead of health. The difference here could be explained by the fact they don't namecheck the NHS in their range of options. The last few weeks have seen a gradual, further strengthening of the Conservatives' position in the polls. In the latest poll by Opinium they hit 40% - the highest figure in a single poll since the middle of August. They've also moved up to an average of 36% in the BBC poll tracker. In the meantime, the Liberal Democrats have fallen away a little from their party conference highpoint to settle at that 18%-ish level they've occupied for much of the autumn while the Brexit Party continue to drift downwards. Labour's average rating has essentially stayed flat. Because voting intention polls are fairly scarce in Scotland, it's difficult to identify trends. But the latest Panelbase poll conducted earlier this month suggests that the SNP continues to dominate. Comparing polls to the 2017 general election result suggests Labour and the Conservatives are on course to lose votes, the SNP are roughly level with where they were, whilst the Lib Dems could gain votes. The SNP's share in polls has floated between 36% and 43% for the last two years. In our GB-wide poll tracker, that translates to 4%, occasionally dropping to 3% or rising to 5% since Scotland has just under 10% of the GB population. That's why we don't suggest a margin of error range as we do for parties that field candidates across the whole of Great Britain. Polls are even rarer in Wales - but the latest from YouGov, also conducted earlier this month, broadly matches others from earlier in the year. The Conservatives are down from their 2017 election share but Labour has fallen back much more dramatically. From the 49% they achieved then, their share of the vote has approximately halved according to polls. The Lib Dems are up sharply and the Brexit Party are performing far more strongly than UKIP did when voters last had their say. Our poll tracker lines show an average of results from the polls to date. Each dot in the chart above shows one poll result for a party. There are too many individual dots to keep track of: even on one day there can be very different results for one party from different polls. So we summarise all that information with a line that averages those results. It bounces around less and makes it easier to tell the signal from the noise (or the trends from the blips?). We use polls conducted by members of the British Polling Council. As of September 2019, that's BMG, ComRes, Deltapoll, Hanbury, ICM, Ipsos Mori, Kantar, Opinium, ORB, Panelbase, Sky Data, Survation and YouGov. Most of the polls included cover Great Britain, although some do poll the whole of the UK, but as a result we do not have separate data for parties that only stand in Northern Ireland. We use results that exclude or downweight those who are unlikely to vote and people who do not express a preference. We include data that are in the public domain: some polling companies will not publish all data for all parties at the same time and so we update the poll tracker as data become available. The margin of error is plus or minus four percentage points. This means that there's a 90% chance that an election held tomorrow would give national vote shares within four points of our estimates for each of the parties. And there's a 10% chance that it would be outside that range. We base these figures on aBritish Polling Council analysis,externalof the results of the final set of polls before each of the elections from 2001 to 2017. The approach mentioned above doesn't quite work for parties that only run in Scotland or Wales or are standing in only a few seats, like UKIP or The Independent Group for Change. The electorate they are appealing to is smaller and this makes their possible vote smaller when it is projected across Great Britain or the whole of the UK. This also means that their margin of error is smaller than that of those parties that stand across Britain and is likely to be less than + / - 1%. We have more coverage of politics inScotlandandWaleson their national politics pages. Our estimate of a party's support is a rolling average of polls to date. Bigger and more recent polls have more influence on our figures. We also limit the influence of any one poll or of those polling firms who poll very frequently to prevent our results being too dependent on one source. In a little more detail: the average is weighted by sample size. The more people polled in a particular survey, the more weight we will give it, up to a threshold of 2,000 people. On the other hand, the older a poll is the less influence it has on the average figure we calculate. We also give less value to any polling firm that has data for more than 5,000 people in a fortnight. A typical poll may cover about 1,000 people. Because a party isn't guaranteed to get the same vote share in an election as it did in a poll the previous day. Polling a sample of the population has often been likened to tasting soup. If the soup has been well stirred then you need to have only one spoonful to get a sense of what the whole bowl is like. In the same way, a well-conducted poll of 1,000 people can, most of the time, give us an idea of what the country as a whole is thinking. But it's not 100% precise, so, the margin of error gives a sense of how the results might change with a different sample of 1,000 people. This margin of error only applies to national vote share: converting that into seats in Parliament is much harder and less precise. There are also systematic differences between polling companies who approach people in different ways, who ask different questions and who analyse the results differently. We list the main polling firms and the questions they ask below. Polling companies also analyse their data differently. They make choices about how to weight each respondent. For example, if a poll of 1,000 people is made up of 550 men and 450 women, it is unrepresentative because it does not reflect the profile of the UK population (51% female). So the answers of female respondents should be given slightly more weight than male respondents in the analysis so that the final results are 51% based on female answers rather than 45%. That's not controversial, but adjusting for past vote or likelihood to vote is harder. Some pollsters ask respondents who they voted for last time and weight the sample to try and ensure it matches the political make-up of the general population. One problem with doing this is that a certain number of people will incorrectly recall who they voted for last time - and a few will even lie about it. So polling companies often use a variety of further methods to improve the accuracy of their weighting. That variety of methods leads to a variety of answers. Most companies then weight or filter by likelihood to vote so that the answers of people who are most likely to vote are given the most prominence in the results. Finally, several pollsters reallocate a percentage of ""don't knows"" to the party they voted for last time. This is to get around the problem that emerged following the 1979 election with the phenomenon of ""shy Tories"" or the ""spiral of silence"" - people who do not want to discuss their voting preference but who will still vote. Our approach, excluding ""don't knows"" from our polltracker, is slightly different. It is like saying that they won't vote or, if they did, their voting preferences would look quite like those who do express a preference. Many polling companies changed their methodology when the candidates lists were released to account for those parties that are standing only in a few seats. If a general election were held today, which of the following parties would you vote for? Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat, SNP (if living in Scotland), Plaid Cymru (if living in Wales), Green Party, Brexit Party, another party Prior to August 2019, Green Party and Brexit Party were only prompted for if the respondent answered ""another party"". Following a randomised controlled trial, BMG decided to move those two parties into the main prompt list. The Independent Group for Change and UKIP remain in the secondary prompt list.

"The UK is gearing up to hold a general election on Thursday. These national votes, to choose a government to run the country, are supposed to be held every five years. But this would be the third since 2015. A total of 650 people will be chosen asmembers of Parliament (MPs), to decide laws and policies. Members of Parliament are elected by voters to represent the interests of their constituency in the House of Commons. Most belong to a political party, but some do stand as independents. There are 650 MPs in the House. MPs are elected to the House of Commons, one of two chambers of Parliament in London, where the government is based. The government passes laws that help it run the country. This compares with local governments which deal with issues such as bin collections and schools in each area. In a general election, the UK's 46 million voters are invited to choose an MP for their area - one of 650 constituencies. Anyone aged 18 or over can vote, as long as they are registered and a British citizen or qualifying citizen of the Commonwealth or Republic of Ireland. Older people are more likely than younger ones to vote. At the 2017 general election, 59% of 20- to 24-year-olds voted, compared with 77% of 60- to 69-year-olds. However, about two-thirds of the more than 3.1 million people who registered to vote between the election being called and the registration deadline were under the age of 35, with more than a million of them under 25. Voting takes place at local polling stations, set up in places such as churches and school halls. Voters put a cross on the ballot paper beside the name of their chosen candidate and drop it into a sealed ballot box. Most people over 18 on polling day can stand as a candidate - as long as they are a British citizen or a qualifying Commonwealth or Republic of Ireland citizen resident in the UK. They must also pay a Â£500 deposit, which will be lost if they do not get at least 5% of the votes in their constituency. Candidates must meet certain conditions - prisoners, civil servants, judges and members of the police and armed forces cannot stand. A total of 3,322 candidates are standing across the 650 seats this year. There are 91 Davids standing for election - the most popular name among the candidates - while the first female name on the list is Sarah in 18th place. There are 22 candidates with that first name standing. The candidate with the most votes in each constituency is elected, even if they are chosen by less than half the electorate in their seat. Most MPs represent a political party but some stand for election as independent candidates. Any party with more than half the MPs (326) in the Commons usually forms the government. Parties with well below 50% of the national vote can take power as a result of theUK's voting system. The UK uses a first past the post voting system. It means a local candidate who receives the most votes wins â and the party with the most winning candidates forms a government. So the overall number of votes parties get nationally does not have any bearing on who wins the election. If no party has a majority of MPs, the one with the most can form a coalition - or partnership - with one or more other parties to gain control. The prime minister is not directly voted for by the public. He or she is chosen by the winning party's MPs and appointed bythe Queen, who is duty bound to follow their advice. The Queen is the UKâs head of state, although she is not in charge of the government. Elizabeth II is the countryâs longest-serving monarch, having ascended to the throne in 1952. She performs state duties, which include formally opening Parliament, representing the country at events such as the annual Remembrance Day parade, and making official visits overseas. She is also head of the armed forces and Church of England. Detailed proposals for everything from the economy to defence and policing are set out before any general election inmanifestos. A manifesto is basically a brochure containing all of a party's ideas and policies. Manifestos are usually published during the general election campaign. If a party wins the election, it is often judged by how many of its manifesto promises it manages to deliver as a government. These come from the UK's political parties - groups of people with similar political beliefs who come together to try to win power. The issues UK voters care most about have changed a lot, according to the polls. TheNational Health Service (NHS)and immigration were the things that most concerned voters in 2015. The National Health Service (NHS), which started in 1948, is the government-funded national healthcare service that provides free diagnosis and treatment for UK citizens. TheEuropean Union (EU)was of far less interest. European Union: the political and economic union of 28 member states, which the UK is planning to leave. Now, however,Brexit- the UK's departure from the EU - is a huge issue. Short for British exit - refers to the UK leaving the European Union. Neither the Conservative orLabourparties had enough votes to form a majority government after the 2017 election. The Labour Party was founded by the trade union movement in 1900 to give workers a voice in Parliament. It believes in the redistribution of wealth and opportunity, greater rights for working people and strong, state-run public services. The Conservatives were the bigger of the two parties and formed a partnership with the Democratic Unionist PartyDUPin order to win votes in the Commons. The Democratic Unionist Party was founded in 1971, during the time of conflict in Northern Ireland, known as the Troubles. As unionists, the DUP support Northern Ireland being part of the UK and are known for their socially conservative beliefs on abortion and same-sex marriage. After the 2017 election, DUP MPs helped keep the Conservatives in power by agreeing to support them in Commons votes. Since the election, the Conservatives and Labour have both lost MPs, while theLiberal Democratshave made gains. Often called the Lib Dems, the Liberal Democrats were formed in 1988 by the merger of one of Britain's oldest political institutions, the Liberal Party, which stood for free trade and individual liberty, and the Social Democratic Party, a centrist offshoot of the Labour Party. The party likes to see itself as being on the centre ground of British politics. Parliament's second chamber is theHouse of Lords. The House of Lords is the second chamber of the UK Parliament. It is independent from the House of Commons but shares with it the role of making laws, while it also checks the governmentâs work. Members are given a title, such as Lord, are not elected, do not represent constituencies and most do not belong to any party. Its members are not elected but are appointed by the Queen, on the prime minister's advice. On general election day, voting takes place between 07:00 and 22:00. The results are declared through the night and the following day. When the overall result is known, the leader of the winning party, if there is one, visits Buckingham Palace to ask the Queen for permission to form a new government. Once they have that, which is a formality, they return to the traditional home of the prime minister10 Downing Street. This terraced house is the official residence and office of the UK prime minister. Often they will stand outside to deliver a speech about their party's plans for the coming years.

"The EU has told Boris Johnson to select a UK candidate for the new European Commission Boris Johnson has now written to the EU accepting a new Brexit extension until 31 January. But do EU leaders believe this will be the last delay before Brexit? In his letter to Brussels, the UK prime minister urges the EU to make clear that a further extension beyond January is simply not on offer. EU leaders, though, are highly unlikely to do as the PM asks. Why? Well, in this very long Brexit process, there have been so many false dawns. More than three years on since the UK voted to leave the EU, the issue of ""Brexit: yes or no and if yes, then what kind of Brexit?"" has yet to be resolved in the UK. Can anyone guarantee that it will definitely have been resolved in three months' time? Or that the newly negotiated Brexit deal will have been ratified by the UK Parliament and the EU Parliament by then? They can't. And what has been the main focus of the EU in these many months of negotiations? To avoid a politically and economically damaging no-deal Brexit, while safeguarding the bloc's core interests. Which is why the EU will want to keep the possibility of another extension up its sleeve come January. Not because EU leaders relish the idea. Quite the opposite, actually. In the EU's ideal world, if the UK is definitely leaving (which EU leaders assume it is), then MPs would now be forced to focus on the new Brexit deal. They would then ratify the deal along with the European Parliament, meaning that the UK's exit process was finished and phase two of Brexit could begin: negotiations for a comprehensive EU-UK trade deal. What's going on with Brexit? What is in Boris Johnson's new Brexit deal? But if that doesn't happen and a UK general election proves inconclusive when it comes to Brexit, EU leaders want the option of another Brexit delay in their back pocket to avoid a no-deal scenario. Even if EU leaders were to acquiesce, do what Mr Johnson has asked and solemnly declare that this was ""the last extension, honest!"", then you'd know they had their fingers crossed behind their backs. It would be a promise easily broken under pressure. Rather like the EU's insistence that it would ""never reopen the withdrawal agreement"" negotiated with Theresa May. Essentially the EU makes compromises when it believes it has little choice and when those compromises are not really harmful to the bloc. Reopening the Brexit withdrawal agreement for renegotiations? ""A pain but do-able,"" thought the EU, if, as Mr Johnson initially threatened, the alternative was no deal at all. Another Brexit extension? ""A bore and more costly uncertainty,"" thinks the EU, ""but less costly than a no-deal Brexit"". Note though, that in the recent renegotiations, the EU was not willing to compromise on single market exposure on the island of Ireland. Despite the no-deal threat. That is why deal-hungry Prime Minister Johnson backed down over the customs issue and accepted the EU proposal of a customs border in the Irish Sea. His red line was broken there, not theirs. Brexit dance goes on as EU approves new extension Now, as they prepare to sign off individually on the new Brexit extension (a mere formality at this stage) EU leaders have a sinking sense that not only is another Brexit extension beyond this one a possibility, but so is the risk of having to re-re-open the Brexit withdrawal agreement again following a general election in the UK. This video can not be played EU negotiator ""happy"" Brexit extension has been granted Brussels would never openly admit to this now. But the possibility cannot be ruled out completely. For now, the EU must stand again at the sidelines and watch to see where the unfolding drama in Westminster takes them. One outstanding EU prod for the prime minister: he's been told to select a UK candidate for the new European Commission, expected to take over in a month or so. It seems an almost perverse request, considering the UK has at least one-and-a-half feet out the door by now. But just as it appeared questionable for the UK to take part in European elections back in April, the incoming European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen insists she needs a UK commissioner in her team to avoid compromising the EU in legal terms as long as the UK remains a member.

"Bloomsbury Publishing has become an unexpected victim of the ongoing trade war between the US and China. Nigel Newton, chief executive of the firm, which publishes Harry Potter among other titles, said books printed in China for the USA became 15% more expensive overnight on 1 September. This was as a result of tariffs being imposed by the countries on each other. ""It is not a cost we anticipated, and it's one we hope to take in our stride,"" he told the BBC. The company expects the tariffs to have only a small impact on the current financial year, and says it has various ways to mitigate the impact in the future. This video can not be played Bloomsbury Publishing profits hit by 15% tariffs The tariffs have previously been imposed on items such as cars, food and footwear, but many people had not realised books would be targeted as well. Separately, Mr Newton said that some of Bloomsbury's illustrated books are printed in China, ""because the quality is so good and the pricing is so good"". Mr Newton was speaking after the firm said it expected its full-year performance to be in line with expectations. In the six months to the end of August, the publisher reported a 5% drop in sales to Â£71.3m with pre-tax profits falling by nearly 19% to Â£1.3m. However, the firm said it was confident about future sales. Mr Newton told the BBC: ""The publishing year is traditionally second-half weighted with back-to-university in October, and the big Christmas gifting season in the second half - so it's very much a game of two halves."" This month, Bloomsbury has published titles including the illustrated version of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. In its results statement, the company said: ""With our strong consumer list in the second half, our sales are therefore expected to be even more second-half weighted than in previous years."" A quick guide to the US-China trade war JK Rowling to release new Harry Potter e-books Microsoft's eBook store: When this closes, your books disappear Bloomsbury to digitally revive out-of-print books In recent years, there were fears that the publishing industry would be harmed by the introduction of electronic books and other new technology. But Mr Newton said: ""Publishing has been a winner in the digital revolution for several reasons. ""Whether someone buys an e-book or a print book doesn't matter to us - they're still buying a book from us. ""Secondly e-books have made books available to people 24 hours a day, seven days a week, in every country in the world. ""And thirdly the internet itself has created such a huge range of new ways to reach readers through social media and directly targeted email shots. ""For digital resources, which is one of the really exciting growth areas of Bloomsbury, during this period sales were up 73%.""

"Dozens of female MPs have signed a letter in ""solidarity"" with the Duchess of Sussex for ""taking a stand"" against media coverage of her and her family. Led by Labour MP Holly Lynch, the letter criticises the tone of recent stories about Meghan as ""outdated"", ""colonial"" and invading her privacy. ""It cannot be allowed to go unchallenged,"" the group of 72 cross-party MPs say. The duchess recentlybegan legal action against the Mail on Sunday. It is accused of unlawfully publishing a private letter to her father. In the letter,shared on Twitter,externalby Ms Lynch, the MPs say they ""share an understanding of the abuse and intimidation"" faced by many women in public life. Meghan: Friends said 'do not marry Prince Harry' Becoming a mother has been 'struggle' - Meghan William 'worried' about Harry after interview ""With this in mind we expect the national media to have the integrity to know when a story is in the national interest, and when it is seeking to tear a woman down for no apparent reason,"" they say. ""You have our assurances that we stand with you in solidarity on this."" The MPs then pledged to use the ""means at our disposal"" to ensure the press accept her right to privacy, show respect, and that their stories ""reflect the truth"". Among the MPs to sign the letter were Labour MP Yvette Cooper, Lib Dem MP Angela Smith, and Tory MP Tracey Crouch. The duchess recently admitted motherhood was a ""struggle"" due to intense media interest What else did the MPs say in the open letter? The MPs wrote: ""As women MPs of all political persuasions, we wanted to express our solidarity with you in taking a stand against the often distasteful and misleading nature of the stories printed in a number of our national newspapers concerning you, your character and your family. ""On occasions, stories and headlines have represented an invasion of your privacy and have sought to cast aspersions about your character, without any good reason as far as we can see. ""Even more concerning still, we are calling out what can only be described as outdated, colonial undertones to some of these stories. ""As women Members of Parliament from all backgrounds, we stand with you in saying it cannot be allowed to go unchallenged."" The letter follows an emotional ITV documentary last week, when Meghan and the Duke of Sussex described the pressure they had faced from intense media scrutiny. In the film, the duchess admitted motherhood was a ""struggle"" due to intense interest from newspapers. She also said that she was not prepared for the intensity of the tabloid media scrutiny. In a statement released at the beginning of October, when Meghan launched legal action against the Mail on Sunday, Prince Harry said the ""painful"" impact of intrusive media coverage had driven the couple to take action. The duke laterfiled his own proceedings at the High Courtagainst the owners of the Sun, the defunct News of the World, and the Daily Mirror, in relation to alleged phone-hacking dating back more than a decade.

"Amelia Bambridge was last seen on the island of Koh Rong on 23 October Six men are being questioned by police investigating the disappearance of a British backpacker in Cambodia. Amelia Bambridge, 21, from Worthing, Sussex, was last seen at a beach party on the island of Koh Rong on Wednesday. The men quizzed work at restaurants, hotels and guesthouses on the island, a senior officer for the local force said. Ms Bambridge's father, who has flown to the island to help with the search, said he feared she had been abducted. Nearly 200 soldiers and police officers have been looking for Ms Bambridge. The local governor said he thought it was most likely she had drowned. But deputy police chief Nop Panha said: ""We don't know yet if it's a case of drowning, a case of getting lost in the forest, a case of murder. We have not received any information yet."" Amelia's sister, Georgie Bambridge, told the BBC:  ""We need to find her. It has to happen. She needs to come home."" Amelia Bambridge (third from left) had been at a beach party the night she disappeared Ms Bambridge set off on her trip on 27 September and flew first to Vietnam, her family said.

"This video can not be played Supporters of Shia parties attacked protesters and then PM Saad Hariri said he was resigning Lebanon's Prime Minister Saad Hariri has said he is resigning, amid protests that have gripped the country for almost two weeks. Mr Hariri said Lebanon had reached a deadlock and needed a shock to break the crisis. The announcement was met with cheers from protesters in Beirut. The protests over political corruption and economic turmoil, began after now-scrapped plans to tax WhatsApp calls were introduced in mid-October. Jeremy Bowen: Is a new Arab Spring unfolding in the Middle East? Lebanon has one of the highest debt levels in the world. The protests have led to a 10-day closure of banks, with many other offices, schools and universities also shut. In a televised address, the prime minister said he had reached a ""dead end"" and that he would tender his resignation and that of the government to President Michel Aoun. Mr Hariri said: ""For 13 days, the Lebanese people have waited for a decision for a political solution that stops the deterioration. And I have tried, during this period, to find a way out, through which to listen to the voice of the people."" Mr Hariri announces his resignation in a televised address But he added: ""It has become necessary for us to make a great shock to fix the crisis. ""Posts come and go, what matters is the safety and dignity of the people."" President Aoun is still to comment. If the resignation is accepted, the constitution would require Mr Hariri to stay on until a new administration is established. This video can not be played Tear gas is fired amid clashes in Beirut The prime minister's announcement came as the situation on the ground turned increasingly violent, reflecting the deep-seated schism in Lebanese society. 'We are protesting for our rights. And we are going to win.' A country feeling reborn The militant Shia group, Hezbollah, which has dominated the coalition government led by Mr Hariri, a Sunni, has recently hardened its stance against the protests. On Tuesday, black-clad men loyal to Hezbollah and another Shia group, Amal, ransacked a protest camp in central Beirut, chanting slogans, setting tents on fire and beating anti-government demonstrators. A roadblock set up by protesters was also attacked. Do today's global protests have anything in common? How did Lebanon become the third most indebted nation? Riot police and troops fired tear gas to separate the rival groups. The protesters remained defiant in central Beirut. Less than an hour after being attacked they erupted into applause at the announcement of Mr Hariri's resignation. One demonstrator, Tima Samir, told Agence France-Presse: ""This resignation is welcome but it is not enough... We want the entire system to change and we'll stay on the streets until all our demands are met."" Analysis by the BBC's Rami Ruhayem in Beirut Here in the capital, protesters cheered loudly as the PM announced his resignation. But the announcement brought little clarity on the way forward. Mr Hariri said he'd reached a dead end, implying he's pulling back, leaving the mess to his governing coalition partners. But then he said that ""we"" need a way to fix the economy and protect the country, implying that whatever happens next, he will be part of it. The president will now have to consult parliament to form another government - but parliament is made up of the same factions that are in the outgoing coalition. Whatever they do, they will do it under intense pressure - from the protest movement and from a deepening economic and financial crisis. Simmering resentment at corruption, a dysfunctional government and its handling of the economy boiled over on 17 October when the government announced a new tax for calls made via voice-over-internet-protocol (Voip), used by apps like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Apple's FaceTime. This video can not be played Protesters formed a human chain 170km (105 miles) long on Sunday The government backtracked within hours but the protests were soon under way and quickly burgeoned. As one demonstrator said: ""We are not here over the WhatsApp, we are here over everything: over fuel, food, bread, over everything."" Last week, Mr Hariri and his coalition, including Hezbollah, agreed to a plan of reforms to try to placate protesters, but their campaign continued. On Friday, Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said ""someone is trying to pull [Lebanon]... towards a civil war"", suggesting the protests were funded by foreign powers and indicating a harsher policy towards the protesters. Hezbollah had argued against Mr Hariri's resignation, saying it could result in a void in Lebanese government. The BBC's Martin Patience says many in the population are tired of economic stagnation, endemic corruption and a lack of basic public services. He adds that the developments will alarm the West, which regards Lebanon as an island of relative stability in a turbulent Middle East. The power-sharing agreement that ended the country's civil war 30 years ago has kept the peace, but it has failed to halt the slide towards economic crisis.

In a televised address, the prime minister said he had reached a ""dead end"" and that he would tender his resignation and that of the government to President Michel Aoun. Mr Hariri said: ""For 13 days, the Lebanese people have waited for a decision for a political solution that stops the deterioration. And I have tried, during this period, to find a way out, through which to listen to the voice of the people."" Mr Hariri announces his resignation in a televised address But he added: ""It has become necessary for us to make a great shock to fix the crisis. ""Posts come and go, what matters is the safety and dignity of the people."" President Aoun is still to comment. If the resignation is accepted, the constitution would require Mr Hariri to stay on until a new administration is established. This video can not be played Tear gas is fired amid clashes in Beirut The prime minister's announcement came as the situation on the ground turned increasingly violent, reflecting the deep-seated schism in Lebanese society. 'We are protesting for our rights. And we are going to win.' A country feeling reborn The militant Shia group, Hezbollah, which has dominated the coalition government led by Mr Hariri, a Sunni, has recently hardened its stance against the protests. On Tuesday, black-clad men loyal to Hezbollah and another Shia group, Amal, ransacked a protest camp in central Beirut, chanting slogans, setting tents on fire and beating anti-government demonstrators. A roadblock set up by protesters was also attacked. Do today's global protests have anything in common? How did Lebanon become the third most indebted nation? Riot police and troops fired tear gas to separate the rival groups. The protesters remained defiant in central Beirut. Less than an hour after being attacked they erupted into applause at the announcement of Mr Hariri's resignation. One demonstrator, Tima Samir, told Agence France-Presse: ""This resignation is welcome but it is not enough... We want the entire system to change and we'll stay on the streets until all our demands are met."" Analysis by the BBC's Rami Ruhayem in Beirut Here in the capital, protesters cheered loudly as the PM announced his resignation. But the announcement brought little clarity on the way forward. Mr Hariri said he'd reached a dead end, implying he's pulling back, leaving the mess to his governing coalition partners. But then he said that ""we"" need a way to fix the economy and protect the country, implying that whatever happens next, he will be part of it. The president will now have to consult parliament to form another government - but parliament is made up of the same factions that are in the outgoing coalition. Whatever they do, they will do it under intense pressure - from the protest movement and from a deepening economic and financial crisis. Simmering resentment at corruption, a dysfunctional government and its handling of the economy boiled over on 17 October when the government announced a new tax for calls made via voice-over-internet-protocol (Voip), used by apps like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Apple's FaceTime. This video can not be played Protesters formed a human chain 170km (105 miles) long on Sunday The government backtracked within hours but the protests were soon under way and quickly burgeoned. As one demonstrator said: ""We are not here over the WhatsApp, we are here over everything: over fuel, food, bread, over everything."" Last week, Mr Hariri and his coalition, including Hezbollah, agreed to a plan of reforms to try to placate protesters, but their campaign continued. On Friday, Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said ""someone is trying to pull [Lebanon]... towards a civil war"", suggesting the protests were funded by foreign powers and indicating a harsher policy towards the protesters. Hezbollah had argued against Mr Hariri's resignation, saying it could result in a void in Lebanese government. The BBC's Martin Patience says many in the population are tired of economic stagnation, endemic corruption and a lack of basic public services. He adds that the developments will alarm the West, which regards Lebanon as an island of relative stability in a turbulent Middle East. The power-sharing agreement that ended the country's civil war 30 years ago has kept the peace, but it has failed to halt the slide towards economic crisis.

"Bloomsbury Publishing has become an unexpected victim of the ongoing trade war between the US and China. Nigel Newton, chief executive of the firm, which publishes Harry Potter among other titles, said books printed in China for the USA became 15% more expensive overnight on 1 September. This was as a result of tariffs being imposed by the countries on each other. ""It is not a cost we anticipated, and it's one we hope to take in our stride,"" he told the BBC. The company expects the tariffs to have only a small impact on the current financial year, and says it has various ways to mitigate the impact in the future. This video can not be played Bloomsbury Publishing profits hit by 15% tariffs The tariffs have previously been imposed on items such as cars, food and footwear, but many people had not realised books would be targeted as well. Separately, Mr Newton said that some of Bloomsbury's illustrated books are printed in China, ""because the quality is so good and the pricing is so good"". Mr Newton was speaking after the firm said it expected its full-year performance to be in line with expectations. In the six months to the end of August, the publisher reported a 5% drop in sales to Â£71.3m with pre-tax profits falling by nearly 19% to Â£1.3m. However, the firm said it was confident about future sales. Mr Newton told the BBC: ""The publishing year is traditionally second-half weighted with back-to-university in October, and the big Christmas gifting season in the second half - so it's very much a game of two halves."" This month, Bloomsbury has published titles including the illustrated version of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. In its results statement, the company said: ""With our strong consumer list in the second half, our sales are therefore expected to be even more second-half weighted than in previous years.""

But Mr Newton said: ""Publishing has been a winner in the digital revolution for several reasons. ""Whether someone buys an e-book or a print book doesn't matter to us - they're still buying a book from us. ""Secondly e-books have made books available to people 24 hours a day, seven days a week, in every country in the world. ""And thirdly the internet itself has created such a huge range of new ways to reach readers through social media and directly targeted email shots. ""For digital resources, which is one of the really exciting growth areas of Bloomsbury, during this period sales were up 73%.""

"This video can not be played Thousands of people have left their homes An estimated 1.5 million people in California are set to lose power on Tuesday as a utility firm tries to stop damaged cables triggering wildfires. Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) said the shut-offs on Tuesday are a precaution as high winds are forecast. It already faces an investigation by regulators after cutting power to almost a million properties in a bid to reduce the fires. Wildfires fanned by the strong winds are raging in two parts of the state. Thousands of residents near the wealthy Brentwood neighbourhood of Los Angeles have been told to evacuate because of a wildfire that began early on Monday. Why do Santa Ana winds make wildfires worse? California fires 'can now happen any year' Volunteers fighting fires in California's 'forgotten canyon' Celebrities including the actor-turned-politician Arnold Schwarzenegger and basketball star LeBron James are among those who have fled the fast-moving Getty Fire, which started near the Getty Center arts complex. Further north in Sonoma County, a larger fire has forced 180,000 people from their homes. California's governor has declared a state-wide emergency. On Monday regulators announced a formal inquiry into whether energy utilities broke rules by pre-emptively cutting power to an estimated 2.5 million people as wildfire risks soared. They did not name any utilities but analysts said PG&E was responsible for the bulk of the ""public safety power shut-offs"". This video can not be played Smoke from Kincade Fire seen from space The company filed for bankruptcy in January after facing hundreds of lawsuits from victims of wildfires in 2017 and 2018. Of the 970,000 properties hit by the most recent cuts, under half had their services back by Monday, the Associated Press reported. Despite criticism that the precautionary blackouts were too widespread and too disruptive, PG&E said more would come on Tuesday and Wednesday because further strong winds were expected. The company said it had logged more than 20 preliminary reports of damage to its network from the most recent windstorm. In a video posted to Twitter on Saturday, Governor Gavin Newsom said the power cuts were ""infuriating everyone, and rightfully so"". In Los Angeles, the Getty Fire has burned over 600 acres (242 ha) and about 10,000 buildings are in the mandatory evacuation zone. At least eight homes have been destroyed and five others damaged. ""If you are in an evacuation zone, don't screw around,"" Mr Schwarzenegger tweeted. ""Get out."" LA fire chief Ralph Terrazas said fire crews had been ""overwhelmed"" by the scale of the fires. ""They had to make some tough decisions on which houses they were able to protect,"" he said. ""Many times it depends on where the ember lands. I saw homes that were adjacent to homes that were totally destroyed, without any damage."" This video can not be played Sonoma County residents react to raging fire In northern California, schools remain closed in Sonoma County, where tens of thousands of homes and businesses are under threat. Sonoma has been ravaged by the Kincade Fire, which started on Wednesday and has burned through 50,000 acres of land, fanned by the winds. The Kincade Fire began seven minutes after a nearby power line was damaged, but PG&E has not yet confirmed if the power glitch started the blaze. About 180,000 people have been ordered to evacuate, with roads around Santa Rosa north of San Francisco packed with cars as people tried to flee. There are fears the flames could cross the 101 highway and enter areas that have not seen wildfires since the 1940s.

"In 2017, freelance writer Tom de Castella noticed an elderly woman and her son living on a bench in south London. He discovered they had already been there for two yearsâ¦ which was puzzling. Why hadn't anyone done anything to help them? Why did everyone accept it as normal? The more he investigated, the stranger it seemed. A large bulky object wrapped in a bright blue tarpaulin. It is sitting in the middle of the pavement. It could be an old piano, maintenance equipment, a delivery waiting to be unpacked. But then the tarpaulin starts to move, an arm appears and the cover is pulled back to reveal a man and a woman, swaddled in blankets sitting on a bench. They have been living on this bench on a busy London street for more than four years. By day they sit there watching the world go by. At night they pull the cover over and sleep. The bench has become their home. When I first saw them, I assumed they were another tragic homelessness statistic, abandoned by society. But the more you know the more complicated it becomes. So who are they? As I looked into it, I discovered that the bench people are a mother and her adult son, originally from Somalia. The mother is in her 70s, the son in his 30s, although he looks older. And bizarrely, it turns out that they have been offered a series of flats by the council. Each offer has been refused - they haven't even gone to have a look. Living on the bench appears to be a choice. A survey for the Greater London Authority and the charity, St Mungo's, found a total of 3,289 people sleeping rough in the capital at least once between October and December last year, the highest figure since records began. But less than a quarter of London's rough-sleepers have been on the street for two consecutive years. Could it be that the mother and son have lived outdoors, in the same very public place, for longer than anyone else in the UK? I do some checking and the bench people's backstory is this. For a few years they lived in a council flat in Battersea - about three miles north of Tooting. But after the death of a family member rent arrears built up, and in February 2014 Wandsworth Council evicted them. Sources close to the council say temporary accommodation had been lined up for them that same day, but the mother and son never showed up. No-one foresaw what would happen next. The first bench they made their home was outside a TK Maxx store on Upper Tooting Road, a few hundred metres from where they are now. But in December 2014 they were hospitalised because of the cold - and while they were away the council had the bench removed, claiming this was ""in their best interests"". When the mother was discharged - her son remained in hospital for a while longer - she headed home to the bench only to find it had gone. A reporter forthe Wandsworth Guardian described the scene,external: ""The woman is now huddled up on a chair, using an umbrella to shelter her from the rain. She is wrapped up in blankets, alone, on the exact spot where the bench once stood."" There was also, for a time, a bench in Balham. Then, no later than April 2015, the mother and son moved to a bench outside Tooting library. And there they have stayed. It's 2.15pm on a weekday afternoon. The mother and son are pulling the tarpaulin over their heads to have a rest. A bus is stuck in traffic beside them as they do this. Everyone on the lower deck turns to watch. You can see the curiosity on people's faces: ""Is that a shelter? Do these people really live here?"" There's something incongruous about the blue-tarpaulin structure in among the hipster barbers, bao bun places and nearby market stalls serving locally distilled gin. Tooting is rapidly gentrifying. But here are two people with nothing apart from a few blankets. From a distance, the mother and son appear lost in Zen-like contemplation of their surroundings. He occasionally reads a book or brushes his hair. She tends to sit and stare. The practicalities are hard to fathom. How do you fit two sleeping bodies on that bench? Do they sleep sitting up? (They do, with the help of cushions to lean back on, and suitcases to support their feet.) Are they warm enough in sub-zero conditions and can they stay cool at the height of summer? What about noise? There's the beep, beep, beep of the pelican crossing, the bass roar of buses and the screech of food-delivery mopeds that rarely stop, day or night. I am guessing here, but it seems they are able to zone out. Their demeanour suggests they're watching telly in their living room, not feet away from pedestrians and snarled-up traffic. They never beg. There is no drink or drugs problem, people who work with them say. They don't accept food or blankets from passers-by but seem to enjoy talking to them. They survive by having a huge pile of blankets and an array of food and drinks beside their feet donated by local restaurants and fast-food outlets. They use the toilets and washing facilities in the library or local cafes. I learn that minicabs give them free lifts. The son goes to the local mosque each day to pray. They have become a fixture on Mitcham Road, supported by the community, a part of Tooting. But what do they say about the experience? It's the end of January and so cold I can see my breath even though it's almost midday. I'm curious to know how they've been coping. Me: Hi, are you OK? (They smile back.) I can't believe you're in the cold so much. In the night time, is it OK for you? Son: It's cold. Sometimes very cold. Me: How long have you been here for? Son: Long time. Years and years. Me: Years and years. Why? I saw something in the paper. The council said they've given you a flat but you didn't want to move. Son: It's impossible. Me: Why? Son: I can't tell youâ¦ (A bus roars past and I can't hear his full reply.) Me: Would you like to live in a house or live on the bench? Son: We stay here. Me: You stay here? Son: Yeah. Me: Forever? Son: I don't know. Me: Really? Son: We can be lucky. (The rest of his answer gets lost in the noise of the traffic. I'm left wondering exactly what he means.) Me: But if the council gives you a flat would you move into it? Son: I can't tell you now, I'm sorry. At this point the mother starts laughing and the son starts chuckling too. It's contagious, something to do with absurdity - I laugh as well. They can tell I find their situation bizarre and I sense they in turn find my questions bizarre, as if their answers are obvious and I am being obtuse. I tell them I'm writing something about them for the BBC. The son says he knows the BBC. I tell them I worry about them being here in such cold weather. Me: Most people are inside. Son: Yes, we not inside a flat. Me: Would you like to sleep in a bed in a house? Son: House needs heat and outside it's the same. Mother: Yes! Same! (The mother is emphatic. This is the clincher, she seems to be saying. Everywhere needs heat, it doesn't matter whether you are inside or out.) Me: It's difficult when there are no walls and no heating though? Mother: Yes! Same! I try to elicit more information about what it's like living on a bench but the son is not keen to say more. ""No, I'm very sorry,"" he says with a smile. I ask if they're from Somalia and he says yes. He says it was a long time ago that they came.  We part smiling at each other, on good terms but perplexed by each others' questions and answers. In the couple of brief chats I'd had before, I'd wondered if their English was good enough to talk. Now I don't believe that basic comprehension is the problem. Instead I worry about their ability to understand their situation and the options available to them. They've told me that living in the open and living in a house are the same in winter. And that everywhere is cold in the winter. What's the difference between a bench and a flat? Who needs a bed? It's hard to argue back. Are they aware that their lifestyle may be bad for their health, I wonder. An hour later I'm in Al Jazeera Coffee, a cafe in nearby Streatham popular with Somalis. Groups of men in coats and scarves are huddled round tables, warming themselves with glasses of black tea and espresso. I'm directed to Abdiaziz Hashi, a man who knows their story well. He went to see the mother and son, he says, but they wouldn't listen to him. The Somali community feel hurt by the case. They have repeatedly offered the mother and son lodging in people's homes, but, like the council, each time they have been rebuffed. I am shown a Somali language news report on YouTube interviewing Somalis in Tooting about the case. A woman in an embroidered headscarf says: ""I am saddened by it. We have tried everything - she (the mother) refused to listen to our advice."" A man in a leather cap says: ""It's a massive embarrassment. If the Somali community wants to do something about it, they could solve it."" My companion shakes his head. There is not much more the Somali community can do, he says. He is in awe of their resilience but worried about the effect of their lifestyle on their mental well-being. ""If it was me I would have died long ago in that situation. I don't know how they survive."" I ask him what should happen. His answer is emphatic and urgent. ""They should be moved in a humanitarian way. These people are definitely sick."" Later that night I'm walking home from the tube. It's 9.50pm and the temperature is 5C, the temperature of a fridge. Their blue tarpaulin is pulled down. It's going to be a low of -3C tonight, according to the BBC forecast. Whereas, even with the heating off all day, my house will be 13 or 14C. Why would a homeless person refuse accommodation? It may be because the offer ""doesn't fit their needs"" says Hannah Gousy, policy manager at the charity, Crisis. They may prefer sleeping rough to sharing a hostel with others who, like them, could have complex needs arising from trauma, abuse, addiction. They may not trust other homeless people, or the agencies who say they want to help. Having a place of their own could also be a daunting prospect for those accustomed to life on the street. You have to pay bills and get benefits. You have to obey other people's rules. The best approach for getting people into accommodation, Gousy argues, is Housing First - currently being piloted in Liverpool, Manchester and the West Midlands. It gives homeless people with the most entrenched problems their own home, backed with ""wraparound"" support. Maybe Housing First would be able to persuade the mother and son to try moving into a flat, but it's not widely available in London. I find myself pondering another question. Are the mother and son breaking the law by being there? I ask a range of lawyers what would happen if I were to occupy a bench in this way. Gary Rycroft, a solicitor put forward by the Law Society, says it's a clear trespass. ""Trespass will arise wherever there is a landowner whose land is being occupied by an unauthorised party."" But can a bench on a public pavement be seen as somebody's property? ""There will always be a landowner. If a bench has been placed on the land then whoever did that must feel they have the right to do it. Land which the public have a right to access may be owned by the local authority or may be part of the public highway."" Shelter disagrees. Their legal adviser says it is ""not either a criminal offence or a breach of the civil law (not even a trespass) to move your belongings and family on to a park bench, or indeed to pitch a tent in the high street or outside the Council offices - unless there is a local by-law which makes it unlawful"". Wandsworth Council later informs me it has no by-law to prevent people sleeping on a bench. The usual offences used to justify moving rough sleepers on are begging, anti-social behaviour or blocking the public highway. None of these apply here. However, look hard enough and the authorities always seem to find a way, Shelter says. The Vagrancy Act 1824, which refers to ""vagabonds and rogues"", prohibits someone from ""wandering abroad and lodging in any barn or outhouse, or in any deserted or unoccupied building, or in the open air, or under a tent, or in any cart or wagon, and not giving a good account of himself"". And the legal niceties don't always matter: ""The police will often just insist on people 'moving on' because they have been asked by the local authority to clear the street, but without quoting any specific piece of legislation. Naturally (and wisely), people usually don't ask under what legal provision the police officer is asking them to move."" To do so could be interpreted as a breach of the peace or obstructing a police officer, the Shelter expert says. 'Why did my boyfriend die in a homeless hostel?' 'How we ended up sleeping rough by the coast' You're on the verge of losing everything - but you don't understand why Sources close to the council say it would be cruel and futile to move them on. The mother and son would simply find another bench, if necessary in another borough. So Wandsworth Council has followed a course of tolerance and restraint, perhaps learning from its mistake of removing the previous bench. The same people tell me that they have a designated social worker who visits them every two or three weeks. And that local charities are also involved with them. The number of times they have been offered a flat runs into three figures, the sources say. I began by thinking that something must be done. I instinctively felt that the mother and son needed help. Now I know they don't want to be moved, and that they may not be breaking the law, I find myself turning to another question that can no longer be dodged. Are they capable of making a decision in their best interests? By law a person lacks mental capacity if they cannot do one of the following four things: understand, remember, communicate or weigh up information. I talk to two well-placed sources. They say the pair have not been found to have any serious mental health issue. The mother and son see the bench as their home, the sources tell me. They like being part of the community, having social contact, chatting to passers-by and they would not feel safe living in a flat. Soon afterwards, Wandsworth Council sends me a statement about the mother and son. ""Over the last few years Wandsworth Council has offered them four different properties to move into, all very pleasant and fully refurbished, including the original property where they used to live, but they turned all of them down without viewing them. Currently, a property is being held vacant for them and our social work team continues to liaise regularly with the family to try and persuade them to accept it."" The statement adds that if people refuse offers of help, ""that is their decision and choice - we cannot force people to accept our help."" It goes on: ""Wandsworth Council is enormously concerned for their welfare and has done everything it can to try and resolve this issue and get them off the streets. We will continue to work alongside health partners and other agencies, including the police and local charities, as well as the local Somali community, in closely monitoring this situation - including the physical and mental well-being of these two people and their capacity to make decisions."" It is stalemate. The average age of a rough sleeper at death is 44 years for men and 42 years for women, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Last year the ONS estimated that 597 homeless people died in 2017 in England Wales - mainly on the street, but also in shelters and hospitals But fatalities only occasionally catch the headlines, such as when two people died outside Parliament last year A sign of how long this has been going on is that Sadiq Khan - elected London Mayor in 2016 - was involved in their case in December 2014 when he was still MP for Tooting. Shortly after the bench outside TK Maxx had been removed,the Wandsworth Guardian reported Khan saying,external: ""Going forward, my priority is to make sure the family have all of the support they need in the long term, and I will continue to work with the council and the police to help seek a solution sooner rather than later."" Khan declined to comment for this story. Contrary to his hope that this would be resolved ""sooner rather than later"" there is no end in sight. It's arguable that this is upsetting for passers-by and the community as a whole. The way I first became aware of them was when my ex's family came to visit. ""That's awful,"" said her dad - and we all agreed - as we saw them there with their suitcases and blankets, seemingly a pathetic indictment of housing policy in Britain. I felt shocked that I had not noticed them up to that day. The other day I heard three Americans discussing the case as they walked past. One of them, who appeared to live in the area, said: ""It's a protest against the council. They want to get housed and won't move until they do. They're here every day."" The other two, apparently visiting, seemed to find it hard to understand that this could go on in bustling, increasingly prosperous Tooting. This misreading of the signs must happen a lot. It creates an impression of an apathetic, uncaring society. Imagine trying to explain it to your child. ""I always see people with different opinions, some people want the bench screwed off and them kicked off it,"" says Anees Kareem who has worked at a fruit and veg stand across the road from the library for the past few years. ""My personal opinion is that they need to be taken into care,"" he says. ""Who would want to live like that? Maybe a day if you really had to but four-and-a-half years?"" I tell him that the well-placed sources say they have no serious mental health problems and ask if he's surprised. He pauses, apparently taken aback. ""Very much, very much."" My last conversation with them was back on a spring-like February day. The mother smiled in the sunshine and we talked about how nice the weather was. I asked if she was happy here. A flicker of annoyance spread across her face. Was I intruding? She said she didn't speak English and we said our goodbyes. I wanted to solve the mystery of what they want from life, but they remain an enigma. During the summer heatwave, when the temperature reached the high 30s C, they had replaced the tarpaulin with an umbrella, which they used to shelter from the sun. Now they are under cover again as I pass every morning; there has been heavy rain and they are back in hibernation mode. They seem content on the bench. Their behaviour isn't anti-social, the authorities accept their presence and whatever reservations some local people have, they are mostly treated with kindness and tolerance. Some might regard it as a very British compromise, but can this really be the best place for them to live? I find that hard to accept. When the council unscrewed their bench in 2014 it said it was acting in the mother and son's best interests. Now it has concluded that it is in their best interest to leave them as they are. It says it respects their choice, but perhaps it's less a choice than a feeling that moving into a flat would be impossibly difficult? Perhaps both sides, in their own ways, are taking the path of least resistance? If the mother or her son were to become seriously ill or die the community would surely blame itself for doing nothing. But for now it remains numbed to the strange permanence of their blue plastic shelter. Illustrations byHello Emma,external Â© 2025 BBC.

"Le Minh Tuan, pictured here, fears his son, Le Van Ha, was among the dead in Essex Inside the modest home of Le Van Ha there is wrenching despair, as his family tries to come to terms with the likelihood that he was inside the ill-fated container in Essex where 39 people were found dead. His grandmother stares into space, covering her face with her hands. His wife Ha sits unspeaking, refusing the entreaties to eat something. His father Le Minh Tuan hugs his young grandson in desperation, and just weeps. Le Van Ha's story was, until the disastrous end of his journey, very typical of a young man from this poor and mainly agricultural part of Vietnam. He followed a path trodden by thousands of others, overseas in search of better-paid work, leaving for Europe three months ago, just before the birth of his second son. Why do Vietnamese people make hazardous journeys to the UK? Vietnamese families fear relatives among Essex dead Three bailed as work to identify 39 victims goes on The family had borrowed to build their house, and the journey west - facilitated by human traffickers - required Â£20,000 ($25,000) - a huge sum for which Le Minh Tuan had to mortgage his two plots of land. Everything hung on Le Van Ha landing a good job, and saving to pay back the loan. His world has fallen apart. Le Minh Tuan, father of 30-year old Le Van Ha, who is feared to be among the 39 people found dead in a truck in Essex, UK ""He's left us with a huge debt,"" Le Minh Tuan said. ""I don't know when we can ever pay it back. I'm an old man now, my health is poor, and I have to help bring up his children."" Le Minh Tuan is convinced his son is dead. He received a Facebook message shortly before telling him he was about to leave for England. It is believed most of those who died in the container came from the same district, Yen Thanh, in Nghe An province. Neighbours are coming round to offer support, and they share in prayers before family altars, carrying photographs of the missing. There's a large, smiling picture of 19-year-old Bui Thi Nhung, now above the shrine in her house. Her family are praying that somehow she wasn't in that container. Bui Thi Nhung is from Nghe An province Her sister Bui Thi Loan says she had a quick exchange of messages on Facebook on 21 October, when she mentioned that she was ""in storage"". ""No information has been verified yet,"" she says. ""It's only on the internet and social media, so we still have some hope. This video can not be played Thirty nine bodies were found in the trailer container in Essex ""We do know that there were three different lorries going to England that time, so we still hope that there is magic, and she turns out to have been on a different lorry."" She says Nhung was the smartest of the four siblings, and had a lot of friends who helped her raise the money for the journey. Her family did not have to mortgage or sell anything. Now they are hoping for good news, or in the worst case, for help to bring her body back to Vietnam. The newly-built houses you see in this district are evidence of the money to be made, and saved, by working overseas. Britain appears to be the preferred destination. Some have spent time in countries like Russia or Romania, where they say it is very difficult to find well-paid jobs. A Vietnamese woman stands near an under-construction house in Yen Thanh district They describe facing constant harassment in France from the police over their illegal status. But in Britain there are strong existing Vietnamese communities and jobs to be had in nail bars, restaurants or agriculture. The brokers they deal with are part of a global network of underworld facilitators who charge huge sums for moving people illegally across borders. The amounts people pay vary, from around Â£10,000 to well over Â£30,000. The higher sum is supposed to be for a ""VIP service"". How is a dead body identified? How are lorries checked for concealed migrants? 'I almost suffocated in the back of a lorry' Many of them go out of Vietnam via China. But when they reach the English Channel the only reliable way across is by being smuggled inside containers, regardless of what fee is paid. In the aftermath of the tragedy in Essex, the Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc has ordered an investigation into trafficking networks. But trafficking has long been a serious problem, often involving women and children. This year the country was downgraded in the annual US State Department's Trafficking in Persons report. Whatever measures the government is taking, the huge sums of money made from trafficking make it a lucrative and tenacious business that still thrives in Vietnam.

"This video can not be played The second anniversary of the tragedy was marked last June The London Fire Brigade (LFB) has been condemned for ""serious shortcomings"" and systemic failures in its response to the Grenfell Tower fire, in a report after the first phase of an inquiry. Fewer people would have died in the 2017 fire if the LFB had taken certain actions earlier, the report by inquiry chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick said. The head of the Fire Brigades Union said the inquiry was ""back to front"". The BBC has seen sections of the report ahead of Wednesday's publication. The document follows the first phase of the inquiry, which looked at what happened on the night that 72 people died in the tower block fire on 14 June 2017. The second phase will focus on wider circumstances of the fire, including the design of the building. Grenfell gives me sleepless nights, says minister What happened at Grenfell Tower? Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims?' The story of Grenfell Tower flat 113 General secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, Matt Wrack, said: ""The truth is that the fire spread the way it did because it was wrapped in flammable cladding. The firefighters turned up after that had happened, after the building had already been turned, in reality, into a death trap. ""Firefighters' actions on the night, which were remarkable in the circumstances, are now being scrutinised. Nobody is trying to avoid scrutiny, but we think that the ordering of the inquiry is completely back to front."" This video can not be played Nabil Choucair, who lost six members of his family in the fire, says people should have been evacuated earlier Speaking to BBC News, Nabil Choucair, who lost six relatives in the fire, said he believed ""lots of families could have been rescued, without a doubt"". ""It's very hard to go on,"" he added. ""I personally believe they were inadequate in dealing with the fire."" The council, the tower's tenant management organisation, the police and the fire service were all questioned during the inquiry's first phase. The inquiry has criticisedthe Daily Telegraph,external, which first published leaked details of the report, and other media which followed suit. A spokeswoman said publication had deprived ""those most affected by the fire - the bereaved, survivors and residents - of the opportunity to read the report at their own pace"". The families of the 72 victims contributed to the report Sir Martin's report praised the courage of firefighters on the night. But it found many ""institutional"" failures that meant the LFB's planning and preparation for the incident was ""gravely inadequate"". For example, Sir Martin said control room staff who fielded 999 calls ""undoubtedly saved lives"" but ""a close examination"" of operations revealed ""shortcomings in practice, policy and training"". He said staff that night were in an ""invidious"" position when they were outnumbered by 999 calls. ""Supervisors were under the most enormous pressure, but the LFB had not provided its senior control room staff with appropriate training on how to manage a large-scale incident with a large number of FSG [Fire Survival Guidance] calls,"" he said. ""Mistakes made in responding to the Lakanal House fire were repeated,"" he added - referring to a fire in Camberwell, south London, in 2009, which killed three women and three children. This report could not be more critical of the London Fire Brigade. The Grenfell families wanted this level of criticism, especially those whose relatives died when they were told for nearly two hours to stay put in the building as it was covered in flames. But there is also some frustration that this first part of the inquiry wasn't about those who made the cladding and oversaw the refurbishment of Grenfell. That will only happen in the second phase of the inquiry next year and then they've got even longer to wait for the police investigation to finish. So they are seeing some blame apportioned and they hope they will eventually see justice but the Grenfell survivors will always suffer the loss and grief and ask the question how did 72 people die in what was supposed to be the safety of their homes? Sir Martin also criticised the LFB for following a ""stay put"" strategy, where firefighters and 999 operators told residents to stay in their flats for nearly two hours after the blaze broke out. The strategy was rescinded at 02:47 BST, the report said. Sir Martin wrote: ""That decision could and should have been made between 01:30 and 01:50 and would be likely to have resulted in fewer fatalities."" Firefighters who attended the fire did not have training on how best to combat a cladding fire, the report added. Four members of the first crews to have fought the blaze had 52 years of combined experience. However, they had not received any training on the risks posed by exterior cladding or the techniques to be deployed in fighting fires involving cladding, the report found. Among other issues highlighted in the report were: A lack of training in how to ""recognise the need for an evacuation or how to organise one"" Incident commanders ""of relatively junior rank"" being unable to change strategy Control room officers lacking training on when to advise callers to evacuate An assumption that crews would reach callers, resulting in ""assurances which were not well founded"" Communication between the control room and those on the ground being ""improvised, uncertain and prone to error"" A lack of an organised way to share information within the control room, meaning officers had ""no overall picture of the speed or pattern of fire spread"" Sir Martin said the ""principal"" reason the fire spread so quickly ""up, down and around the building was the presence of the aluminium composite material (ACM) rainscreen panels with polyethylene cores, which acted as a source of fuel"". Dany Cotton said she would not have changed anything about the way her brigade responded to the blaze The report also said evidence given by the LFB's commissioner, Dany Cotton, suggested lessons from the fire might be missed. Sir Martin wrote: ""Quite apart from its remarkable insensitivity to the families of the deceased and to those who escaped from their burning homes with their lives, the Commissioner's evidence that she would not change anything about the response of the LFB on the night, even with the benefit of hindsight, only serves to demonstrate that the LFB is an institution at risk of not learning the lessons of the Grenfell Tower fire."" A spokesperson for the LFB said it would be ""inappropriate"" to comment on the report's findings before they were officially released on Wednesday. In remarks to families and survivors on Monday, Sir Martin said the report was long and detailed. He stressed that readers of the report ""should understand as clearly as possible the terrifying conditions faced by those who were in the building, at the time"". The cause of the fire was found by the report to be ""an electrical fault in the large fridge freezer in the kitchen"" in a fourth-floor flat. ""It occurred without any fault on the part of the tenant... and I am pleased to clear him of any blame, given that some people have unfairly accused him of having some responsibility for what happened,"" Sir Martin said.

"The price of the average home rose by Â£800 in the last year, according to the Nationwide, marking a slow period for the UK housing market. In the equivalent period three years ago, the average property price rose by Â£9,100, the building society's data shows. UK house prices have risen by less than 1%, on a year-on-year basis, for each of the last 11 months. The annual increase was 0.4% in October, the Nationwide said. That meant the average home was now valued at Â£215,368. Three generations under one roof to beat the housing crisis The UK cities where rent is rising the fastest The Nationwide figures, which are based on the building society's lending data, show that prices rose by 0.2% in October compared with September, and by the same level in the three months to the end of October compared with the previous quarter. Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said that the number of people in work in the UK had been relatively strong and meant house prices were relatively stable despite the political backdrop. However, he said that any trend of rising unemployment would be ""a significant concern"" for the UK housing market. Commentators said there were few signs of any change from the subdued housing market, although different regions do show different trends. ""It's hard to see the market emerging from this sub-1% annual growth rut until there is clarity on Brexit,"" said David Westgate, chief executive at Andrews Property Group. ""The sheer level of political uncertainty has left the property market in a protracted limbo [but] demand is being powered by cheap mortgages, a strong jobs market and a growing indifference to political events."" On Monday, figures from the Land Registry showed that 545 residential properties were sold in England for Â£1m or more in September. The majority of them - 304 - were in the Greater London area. The most expensive property sold was a Â£17m semi-detached in the Kensington and Chelsea area of London. The cheapest was a flat in Sunderland, sold for Â£16,000.

"This video can not be played Brexit: What happened on Monday? Boris Johnson will try for a fourth time to secure an early general election, after MPs rejected his plan. The PM will now ask MPs to approve a 12 December election through a one-page bill - which needs the support of fewer MPs than his last attempt. But No 10 sources say they would accept an election on 11 December to get opposition parties on-board. Mr Johnson said the ""paralysis"" could not go on, but Labour said a no-deal Brexit had to be taken off the table. This comes after EU leaders accepted the UK's request to extend the Brexit deadline to 31 January - but the UK can leave earlier if a deal is agreed by Parliament. The Commonsbacked the government's election motion by 299 to 70 on Monday- but it was well short of the two-thirds of all 650 MPs whose support is needed to call an election under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act. All Conservative MPs backed the motion, but the vast majority of MPs from Labour - the largest opposition party - abstained, along with the Scottish National Party and Democratic Unionist Party from Northern Ireland. All but one MP from the Liberal Democrats voted against it. LIVE: Latest as MPs prepare for vote on election How did my MP vote? Is this the final Brexit delay? Government 'pauses' Â£100m Brexit ad campaign The government has now said it will abandon its attempt to pass its Brexit deal bill, for the time being. Instead, it has published its Early Parliamentary General Election Bill, which allows for an election to take place on 12 December. Former Chancellor Philip Hammond - who was expelled from the Conservative Party at Westminster after voting against a no-deal Brexit - said the idea of using ""precious time"" to hold an election, rather than passing the government's Brexit bill, ""frankly appals me"". But Home Office Minister Brandon Lewis said: ""We have to have an election to deliver a Parliament that can get Brexit through."" Labour's shadow cabinet are meeting to discuss their position on the early election bill. On Monday, Boris Johnson officially accepted the EU's offer of an extension to the Brexit deadline to 31 January. This means the UK will not now leave the EU on Thursday - 31 October - a promise at the heart of Mr Johnson's campaign to become prime minister. In a letter to EU officials, Mr Johnson said the further delay - which he insists was forced upon him by Parliament - was ""unwanted"". This video can not be played The government failed to secure the necessary two-thirds of MPs' votes MPs are due to begin debating the early election bill after 1230 GMT. The government is aiming to complete all of its Commons stages by the end of the day - a process that normally takes several days. A vote on the second reading of the bill is expected after 1630 GMT - this is the first Commons hurdle - and that will be followed later by a third reading vote. If MPs back that, then there is almost certain to be a pre-Christmas election, although the legislation will still have to clear the House of Lords. The date is a sticking point as things stand, but it is not impossible that will become unglued by the time MPs vote tonight. Conversations are going on through the ""usual channels"" - the party whips - and they may all find a way of climbing down to agree. But for both the government and the smaller opposition parties, they have to be willing to hold hands and jump into this together. The SNP and the Liberal Democrats are nervous as being seen as the PM's little helpers. Parliament is closer than it's ever been to an election. But it doesn't mean that it happens tonight and it is still possible after those MPs have walked through the voting lobbies, we still have no Brexit, no budget and no traditionally functioning government. Read more from Laura here. The legislation the PM will propose on Tuesday requires a lower threshold for approval than the motion he tabled on Monday. Mr Johnson originally tried to hold an election via the Fixed-term Parliament Act route, which is a simpler process than passing a bill as it cannot be amended by MPs. But with the need for two-thirds of all MPs to back it - rather than just a majority of one - his attempts have failed. Crucially for his new plan, the Lib Dems and the SNP have indicated they might be prepared to support it. However, there are arguments over the date of an election. Parliament has to be dissolved a minimum of 25 working days before the date of an election to allow sufficient preparations to take place. The Lib Dems and the SNP want an election on 9 December because they say that will prevent any chance of Mr Johnson's Brexit deal being approved before Parliament is dissolved. Both parties want to fight the election on a platform of stopping Brexit entirely. The government hopes to persuade the Lib Dems and the SNP to agree to the 12 December date by pledging not to bring back its Brexit deal bill before Parliament is dissolved. But No 10 sources have said they would accept a Lib Dem/SNP amendment allowing an election to take place on 11 December. Earlier, Home Office Minister Brandon Lewis said 12 December was ""the right date for a general election"", arguing a poll any earlier would not allow time for the government to pass ""key pieces of legislation"" - including around budget issues in Northern Ireland. However, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson told MPs she did not trust Mr Johnson's assurances. The government maintains it would be very difficult for an election bill to pass through both the Commons and the Lords, and receive Royal Assent by 00:01 on Friday in order to meet a 9 December deadline. Most Labour MPs abstained from Monday's vote. The party's leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said he would consider the legislation, but would only support an election once a no-deal Brexit had been taken off the table. He also called for assurances that students would not be ""disenfranchised"" if the vote was held outside term time. But speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner said a 9 December election ""certainly would"" appeal more than a 12 December vote. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said there was a split in the party over whether to hold an election, with some MPs worried about their standings in the polls and confusion over their Brexit policy - to negotiate a new deal then hold another referendum. The DUP, which opposes Mr Johnson's Brexit agreement and which abstained in Monday's vote, could also potentially come on board - meaning the simple majority of one could be achieved. But the government may also need support from those MPs who had the Conservative whip removed for voting against a no-deal Brexit. One of those MPs, Mr Hammond, said: ""I think the government is trying to create a narrative that Parliament is blocking Brexit and therefore we need an election. But, that is simply untrue."" The former chancellor argued the real motivation for an election was to ""change the shape of the Conservative Party"" and to ""get rid of a cohort of MPs that it regards as not robust enough"" on Brexit. ""There is a piece of blatant entryism to change what the Conservative Party is about,"" he added. However, the now-independent MP also said: ""It really doesn't matter how many times my party kicks me, abuses me, reviles me. They are not going to stop me feeling like a Conservative.""

"The EU has told Boris Johnson to select a UK candidate for the new European Commission Boris Johnson has now written to the EU accepting a new Brexit extension until 31 January. But do EU leaders believe this will be the last delay before Brexit? In his letter to Brussels, the UK prime minister urges the EU to make clear that a further extension beyond January is simply not on offer. EU leaders, though, are highly unlikely to do as the PM asks. Why? Well, in this very long Brexit process, there have been so many false dawns. More than three years on since the UK voted to leave the EU, the issue of ""Brexit: yes or no and if yes, then what kind of Brexit?"" has yet to be resolved in the UK. Can anyone guarantee that it will definitely have been resolved in three months' time? Or that the newly negotiated Brexit deal will have been ratified by the UK Parliament and the EU Parliament by then? They can't. And what has been the main focus of the EU in these many months of negotiations? To avoid a politically and economically damaging no-deal Brexit, while safeguarding the bloc's core interests. Which is why the EU will want to keep the possibility of another extension up its sleeve come January. Not because EU leaders relish the idea. Quite the opposite, actually. In the EU's ideal world, if the UK is definitely leaving (which EU leaders assume it is), then MPs would now be forced to focus on the new Brexit deal. They would then ratify the deal along with the European Parliament, meaning that the UK's exit process was finished and phase two of Brexit could begin: negotiations for a comprehensive EU-UK trade deal. What's going on with Brexit? What is in Boris Johnson's new Brexit deal? But if that doesn't happen and a UK general election proves inconclusive when it comes to Brexit, EU leaders want the option of another Brexit delay in their back pocket to avoid a no-deal scenario. Even if EU leaders were to acquiesce, do what Mr Johnson has asked and solemnly declare that this was ""the last extension, honest!"", then you'd know they had their fingers crossed behind their backs. It would be a promise easily broken under pressure. Rather like the EU's insistence that it would ""never reopen the withdrawal agreement"" negotiated with Theresa May. Essentially the EU makes compromises when it believes it has little choice and when those compromises are not really harmful to the bloc. Reopening the Brexit withdrawal agreement for renegotiations? ""A pain but do-able,"" thought the EU, if, as Mr Johnson initially threatened, the alternative was no deal at all. Another Brexit extension? ""A bore and more costly uncertainty,"" thinks the EU, ""but less costly than a no-deal Brexit"". Note though, that in the recent renegotiations, the EU was not willing to compromise on single market exposure on the island of Ireland. Despite the no-deal threat. That is why deal-hungry Prime Minister Johnson backed down over the customs issue and accepted the EU proposal of a customs border in the Irish Sea. His red line was broken there, not theirs. Brexit dance goes on as EU approves new extension Now, as they prepare to sign off individually on the new Brexit extension (a mere formality at this stage) EU leaders have a sinking sense that not only is another Brexit extension beyond this one a possibility, but so is the risk of having to re-re-open the Brexit withdrawal agreement again following a general election in the UK. This video can not be played EU negotiator ""happy"" Brexit extension has been granted Brussels would never openly admit to this now. But the possibility cannot be ruled out completely. For now, the EU must stand again at the sidelines and watch to see where the unfolding drama in Westminster takes them. One outstanding EU prod for the prime minister: he's been told to select a UK candidate for the new European Commission, expected to take over in a month or so. It seems an almost perverse request, considering the UK has at least one-and-a-half feet out the door by now. But just as it appeared questionable for the UK to take part in European elections back in April, the incoming European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen insists she needs a UK commissioner in her team to avoid compromising the EU in legal terms as long as the UK remains a member.

"Action for Children are rolling out a UK-wide programme to divert young men from organised crime Jamie admits that his motivation for getting involved in gang activity was purely financial. ""Coming from a rough area where there was no money, you had to get it somehow,"" he said. Raised in a Glasgow housing scheme, he had a fraught relationship with his stepfather and by the age of 14, was prone to violence and was on the verge of a drug habit. He started selling cannabis before moving onto harder drugs for cash. Gang violence became part of the territory and eventually, Jamie - whose real identity will be anonymised - found himself in police custody. But during a stint in prison, he made a decision that he claims saved his life. Jamie joined a programme run by Action for Children which aims to prevent children becoming indoctrinated into organised crime. Through the charity's work, he met friends and mentors, was given immediate job opportunities and was assisted on a long-term career path. Now 22, Jamie said that without the programme he would likely have returned to a criminal livelihood as soon as he walked free from jail. The project is now being rolled out across the UK. Prisoners to get work coaching and benefit help before release Age limit removed from scheme to support offenders Prison support scheme 'cuts reoffending' He said: ""I never really looked back on my life too much until I got the jail. I got to think 'what do I want to do with my life? Is this what I want to keep doing and end up dead, addicted to drugs or something worse?' ""So I started developing myself in jail - I did a lot of stuff in the gym, a lot of stuff with the army outreach, got my third year apprenticeship in joinery. ""A lot of young boys don't get the opportunity to realise their potential because they're in schemes - no outreach programmes, no help, no nothing."" He added: ""I think they grow up and whatever their surroundings are they think that's going to be their surroundings for the rest of their lives, you can't get away from it."" Jamie found himself in a similar mindset from an early age. He hated school and the discipline that went along with it -  he also found himself regularly using force to deter bullies. After being expelled from two schools, he decided ""school wasn't for me"". ""From there on it was the streets and whatever you could to make a quick buck,"" he said. ""All the older boys at our scheme would give us all the stuff. We'd sell the drugs for them or they'd say something needs smashed up or they need this brought to them and we'd go do it for money. ""I was addicted to drugs - I was smoking a lot of cannabis, I was taking those fake valium and I was only a young age. There was only one other option - it was jail or dead and jail saved my life."" The charity has reached out to a number of young offenders who served time at HMYOI Polmont Action for Children's Scotland director Paul Carberry said Jamie's life was one example of young boys who are identified as ""good material"" for gang operations. He described them as ""young people who may be violent, entrepreneurial thieves, they can keep their mouths shut, running drugs, theft to order, violence and intimidation on behalf of groups"". He added: ""Most of our young people when we identify them are pro-criminal, come from pro-criminal families and they are trained not to trust people in authority - whether that's police or social work. ""Often these young people will spend the rest of their lives in custody, they will be murdered or will die using their own products."" The charity's Serious Organised Crime Early Intervention service, which has been running since 2013, has intensively worked with dozens of young people in Glasgow, diverting them from crime to education, training and employment. It also employs peer mentors - young people who have successfully come through the programme who can relate to what children in schemes may be going through. Having received Â£4.6m from the National Lottery Community Fund, Action for Children say they will deliver the project in Edinburgh from January and in Cardiff and Newcastle from April. Jamie meanwhile works as a chef and is awaiting an interview with the Army, which he hopes will lead to a trade, a pension and a ""normal"" life. Having lived clean for nine months he says he does not fear any relapse into gang living. He said: ""I still stay in the same surroundings, it's quite negative. Since I've been out I've been offered everything under the sun - to do this, take this - but I've turned my nose to it and kept my head straight. ""I think if you've got the right mindset I don't think it is a challenge but you've got boys who come out with nothing and they've got nothing to look forward to, I think it's a lot easier to get back in jail. ""But I've got two beautiful nephews and a wee niece who look up to me. I've got plenty of things to live for."" Scotland's justice secretary, Humza Yousaf, said that as well as diverting young people from serious organised crime  the scheme could ""deliver financial savings to hard-pressed public services to the benefit of all our communities"". He added: ""The role of the peer mentors cannot be underestimated.

"The price of the average home rose by Â£800 in the last year, according to the Nationwide, marking a slow period for the UK housing market. In the equivalent period three years ago, the average property price rose by Â£9,100, the building society's data shows. UK house prices have risen by less than 1%, on a year-on-year basis, for each of the last 11 months. The annual increase was 0.4% in October, the Nationwide said. That meant the average home was now valued at Â£215,368. Three generations under one roof to beat the housing crisis The UK cities where rent is rising the fastest The Nationwide figures, which are based on the building society's lending data, show that prices rose by 0.2% in October compared with September, and by the same level in the three months to the end of October compared with the previous quarter. Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said that the number of people in work in the UK had been relatively strong and meant house prices were relatively stable despite the political backdrop. However, he said that any trend of rising unemployment would be ""a significant concern"" for the UK housing market. Commentators said there were few signs of any change from the subdued housing market, although different regions do show different trends. ""It's hard to see the market emerging from this sub-1% annual growth rut until there is clarity on Brexit,"" said David Westgate, chief executive at Andrews Property Group. ""The sheer level of political uncertainty has left the property market in a protracted limbo [but] demand is being powered by cheap mortgages, a strong jobs market and a growing indifference to political events."" On Monday, figures from the Land Registry showed that 545 residential properties were sold in England for Â£1m or more in September. The majority of them - 304 - were in the Greater London area. The most expensive property sold was a Â£17m semi-detached in the Kensington and Chelsea area of London. The cheapest was a flat in Sunderland, sold for Â£16,000.

"This video can not be played General David Petraeus on Baghdadi's death Two men were captured during the US military's raid on Islamic State (IS) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's hideout in Syria and are in US custody, says the Pentagon. The Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman said they were now ""in a secure facility"". General Mark Milley also announced that Baghdadi's remains had been disposed of and there were currently no plans to share footage of his death. Baghdadi killed himself during the raid, the US says. ""Baghdadi's remains were transported to a secure facility to confirm his identity with forensic DNA testing, and the disposal of his remains has been done and is complete and was handled appropriately,"" Gen Milley told reporters. Gen Milley - the highest ranking member of the US military - said photos and video were going through ""a declassification process"". President Donald Trump had earlier suggested that some footage from the raid might be released. This video can not be played Body language expert analyses Trump's Situation Room photo There were no further details about the detained men. Baghdadi died from detonating a suicide vest after fleeing into a tunnel while being chased by US military dogs, President Trump announced on Sunday. Who was Baghdadi? What does his death mean for IS? The Pentagon says no US personnel were killed in the raid but one of the dogs pursuing Baghdadi was seriously injured. Gen Milley said the dog's name was classified. In response to a question about Mr Trump's contention that Baghdadi had whimpered and cried before his death, Gen Milley said he was not aware where the information came from but added: ""I assume it was [from] talking directly to unit members."" Gen Milley also said that US troops would continue to protect oilfields from IS militants, though ""at the end of the day, we will be sending troops home"". Mr Trump has said the US should be able to take some of the oil, but critics say doing so would violate the Geneva Convention's laws against pillaging natural resources. Allow Twitter content?

"The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 and is now in an 11-month transition period. During this period the UK effectively remains in the EU's customs union and single market and continues to obey EU rules. However, it is no longer part of the political institutions. So, for example, there are no longer any British MEPs in the European Parliament. MP's back Boris Johnson's plan What is Boris Johnson's deal with the EU? Future trade deal Negotiations on a trade deal with the EU have been proceeding for several months. The UK wants as much access as possible for its goods and services to the EU. But the government has made clear that the UK must leave the customs union and single market and end the overall jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Both sides say there a still significant areas of disagreement - for example, on EU proposals for a so-called ""level playing field"", which would see the UK and EU maintain similar minimum standards on things like workers' rights and environmental protection. Brexit: What is a level playing field? The deadline for the two sides to agree an extension to the transition period has now passed. If no trade deal has been agreed and ratified by the end of the year, then the UK faces the prospect of tariffs on exports to the EU. The prime minister has argued that as the UK is completely aligned to EU rules, the negotiation should be straightforward. But critics have pointed out that the UK wishes to have the freedom to diverge from EU rules so it can do deals with other countries - and that makes negotiations more difficult. It's not just a trade deal that needs to be sorted out. The UK must agree how it is going to co-operate with the EU on security and law enforcement. The UK is set to leave the European Arrest Warrant scheme and will have to agree a replacement. It must also agree deals in a number of other areas where co-operation is needed.

"Check the latest opinion poll trends with the poll tracker, which measures how people say they are going to vote at the next general election. This page is no longer being updated.You can see the latest poll tracker for the UK general election due to be called in 2024 by clicking here. Over the course of the campaign almost every single poll has had the Conservatives ahead by at least 6%. So if they don't end up with the most votes it would be a serious failure. Labour have consistently been in a clear second place, a long way ahead of the Liberal Democrats in third. The Brexit Party started the campaign at around 10% of the vote but have fallen back dramatically - in part as a result of their decision not to contest Conservative-held seats. In Scotland the picture is very different. In the few polls there have been, the SNP has always had a commanding lead with the Conservatives in second place. Again, if that's not the result then the polls will have been badly flawed. For most of the campaign there have been marked differences between the polling companies. But all of them have suggested that the race has narrowed in the final two weeks. Out of 100 people who are likely to vote, about... Please upgrade your browser or enable JavaScript to see the full interactive experience There's about a 90% chance that the true support for each party lies within the ranges shown above, which means there's a one in 10 chance that it lies outside these ranges. * Because the SNP and Plaid Cymru only campaign in Scotland and Wales respectively, the margins of error for their support across Great Britain is likely to be less than +/- 1% What most polls don't tell us is how votes will be converted into seats in the House of Commons. There have been several attempts to do this, though, using large polling samples which allow complex analyses of the levels of support for each party among different demographic groups. The central forecast of the final YouGov projection is a Conservative majority of 28. But it's important to look at the range of possible outcomes their analysis implies. For the Conservatives that range is 311-367 seats. So, on this basis, another hung parliament cannot be ruled out - and neither can a large majority. The BBC won't report on any polls that come out on polling day so this will be the final update to the poll tracker. The exit poll, commissioned by the BBC, ITV News and Sky News will be published when voting ends at 22.00 GMT on Thursday night. Compare where the parties stand on key issues like Brexit, education and the NHS. General election manifesto guide Going into the last few days of the election campaign the Conservative lead over Labour remains solid. The latest polls all put the Conservatives in the low to mid-40s and Labour in the low 30s in percentage terms across Britain as a whole. The Lib Dems are in a narrow 11-14% range and the Brexit Party are in low single digits - a long way down compared to where they started. Over the course of the campaign, both of the main parties have seen their poll ratings go up but the gap between the two is more or less where it was five weeks ago. As Sir John Curtice has pointed out, if the result on Thursday is in line with these numbers then the Conservatives are probably on course for a decent majority in the House of Commons. There should be a few more polls to come over the next three days - as well as another YouGov seat projection - so that could still change. But there would have to be a pretty big shift to point to a different overall result. Of course, they could all be systematically wrong - it wouldn't be the first time if that turned out to be true. But if you're using the polls as a guide to what could happen then their message is clear. The latest batch of polls lends more weight to the suggestion that the Conservative rise, which has been a consistent feature of the election campaign, has levelled off. That doesn't mean they can't go up any further, but for the time being it seems as though support for them is fairly static. Meanwhile, the Labour Party is still moving upwards - apparently mostly at the expense of the Liberal Democrats. If this trend continues, then we could be on course for another election where the two biggest parties capture a very large share of the overall vote. It would still need another big move, though, to reach the 84% that the Conservatives and Labour achieved between them in 2017. And there are only ten days to go. Our poll tracker smoothes out the bumps in polling by including old polls. Their influence decays, halving every week, but that still means our rolling average can look a little behind the latest figures. The differences are all smaller than the margin of error, but if parties are picking up or losing share, we might be a point or two off what a simple average of the latest polls would tell you. That's not so apparent when the parties are all moving in parallel - so we're lagging a little for everyone and the differences between parties will look similar. But, with the Conservatives plateauing, it might take a little while before our tracker starts to show Labour catching up as the most recent polls suggest they might be. YouGov's seat projection has raised a lot of interest. A lot of that is down to the fact that when they did the same exercise in 2017 they were pretty successful at forecasting the overall election result as well as the outcome in most individual constituencies. Their new projection puts the Conservatives on 359 seats, Labour on 211, the SNP on 43, Lib Dems on 13 and other parties on 24. That suggests a Conservative majority of 68. However, this still needs to be treated with caution for several reasons. It's still based on polling which, as we know, is always subject to error. The margin of error for this model ranges from a Conservative landslide to a very slim majority. Whilst the model uses a sophisticated technique to see how national polling trends play out in individual constituencies, it is always going to be very difficult to account for truly local factors - such as a prominent local independent candidate. Also, some other recent polls have suggested that Labour have moved a bit closer to the Conservatives than they are in the YouGov poll. That would clearly have an impact on the size of any overall majority, and the polls will continue to move between now and 12 December. So, whilst the projection is certainly very interesting, it shouldn't be treated as providing a reliable forecast of what the result of the election will be. One other feature of the most recent polls is that, with one clear exception, there seems to be more consistency between the different polling companies. If you look back to the beginning of October, there were very large differences between them. Now, each of the parties seems to be performing in a fairly narrow range across the polls: the low 40s for the Conservatives; close to 30% for Labour, and the mid-teens for the Lib Dems. The outlier is Opinium's latest poll which has the Conservatives on 47% and the Lib Dems down on 12%. Of course, convergence doesn't mean the polls can tell us what the final result will be. There's still more than two weeks to go and the lesson from 2015 is that there can be a consistent error across nearly all polls. Overall, the polls from the last week have shown the same pattern of movement as they have throughout the campaign. In particular, the Conservatives have gone up again in the BBC poll tracker and the Brexit Party continues to fall. There may be the first signs in the raw polling figures, though, that the Conservative shift is beginning to level off. Several of the pollsters have them one or two points below their peak in the latest figures. Even if their rise does stall, though, the Tories are now fairly close to the 43% they actually achieved at the 2017 election. A new Panelbase poll in Scotland also puts them only marginally below the result from last time. However, a result along those lines wouldn't mean their vote share was approximately flat across the country. The national figures can mask big shifts at a local level. There could still be dramatic swings in individual constituencies. Writing updates on the election campaign polls is beginning to get a bit repetitive. Once again, the changes since last week are basically following the same pattern as we've seen before. The Conservatives are up and Labour is also up a bit. The Brexit Party is down, and the Lib Dems are also a bit lower than before. In fact, the Conservatives are now pushing towards the 43% they actually achieved across Britain at the general election in 2017. As we noted last week, pollsters are adjusting their methodologies to take account of the fact that the Brexit Party has withdrawn in Conservative-held seats. That ought to help them hold on to seats they're defending. Perhaps slightly counterintuitively, though, it might mean Boris Johnson needs a bigger lead in the polls to be sure of winning an overall majority of MPs. Piling on extra votes in safe Conservative constituencies, thanks to the absence of a Brexit Party candidate, probably won't translate into extra seats in the House of Commons. A poll by LucidTalk covering the election in Northern Ireland was also published last week. These are few and far between, and the poll was conducted before the official election campaign got underway, so it's very hard to get a good sense of any trends. But compared to the 2017 election, the poll suggested the DUP and Sinn Fein losing vote share with the Alliance and SDLP going up. If the actual election result goes a similar way it could mean the smaller parties making gains in terms of seats at the expense of the big two. We are starting to see the pollsters respond to the tactical voting arrangements by parties. YouGov's latest poll removed the Brexit Party, Liberal Democrats, Green and Plaid Cymru as an option in seats where they have stood down. The most notable, if unsurprising, effect was for the Brexit Party. Their support roughly halved from 9% to 4% as they roughly halved the number of constituencies in which they are standing. Other pollsters have said they will follow suit. We can expect further changes as nominations close and it becomes clear who is standing in each constituency. So there will be even more movements in the poll tracker over the coming weeks. Some of it will be, as ever, down to the changing political landscape. But some will be down to pollsters' efforts to measure that landscape more accurately. We are starting to see the pollsters respond to the tactical voting arrangements by parties.

But some will be down to pollsters' efforts to measure that landscape more accurately. The trends that were noticeable in the polls a week ago have carried on over the last seven days. The Conservatives have continued their steady upward progress. But the tentative signs of a Labour recovery have also become firmer. Both parties' average scores are up, although they're still below the vote shares they recorded at the 2017 election - more than 10% below in Labour's case. Going in the other direction, the Brexit Party are down to 9% in the BBC poll tracker - their lowest score since the party was launched in April. And it's now clear that the Liberal Democrats have fallen away a little from where they were a month ago. YouGov has also published polls for Wales and Scotland. In Wales, they have Labour up four points with the Lib Dems losing the same amount since the last poll. Labour, on 29%, are now roughly on a par with the Conservatives on 28%. Since there are so few Welsh polls probably the best we can say with any confidence is that it looks close between the two main parties - with Plaid Cymru, the Liberal Democrats and the Brexit Party also in a close battle for third place. The Scotland poll gave the SNP a very large lead on 42%, with the Conservatives in a clear second place, and Labour falling to its lowest score since before the last election - just below the Lib Dems. However, that poll was conducted more than two weeks ago, before the election was even confirmed so it's rather likely that these figures are out of date. There can be little doubt, however, that the SNP are currently on course for a strong result. It's nearly a week now since it became clear that there would be a general election on 12 December. There have already been eight polls conducted since then - we can expect that from now on they will be coming thick and fast. Over the last seven days the Conservatives have continued their upward trend in the BBC poll tracker whilst the Brexit Party are still drifting downwards. There are also some early signs of a recovery for Labour. They've hit an average of 26% - their highest figure since the first half of September. Meanwhile the Liberal Democrats have fallen to 17% - their lowest since the start of June. These movements are pretty small so far, though, so we will need to see if they continue in the coming days. There's no doubt that Brexit will be a major issue at this election. But as the campaign gets underway, will other policy areas come to the fore? Opinium has found that Brexit is a more dominant subject as the campaign gets under way than it was at the last general election. Forty per cent of people in their latest poll said it was the single issue that was most likely to influence their vote. That compares with 18% at the start of the 2017 campaign. However, when people were asked to name the three most important issues facing the country, 59% of respondents identified health/NHS compared to only 52% for the EU/Brexit. That's a shift compared to their recent polls where Brexit has come out on top or in equal first place. It's possible that by campaigning on non-Brexit issues the parties will be able to influence how much weight voters give to different subjects. Panelbase's latest poll also puts the NHS/health as the top issue. On the other hand, Deltapoll have Britain leaving the EU clearly ahead of health. The difference here could be explained by the fact they don't namecheck the NHS in their range of options. The last few weeks have seen a gradual, further strengthening of the Conservatives' position in the polls. In the latest poll by Opinium they hit 40% - the highest figure in a single poll since the middle of August. They've also moved up to an average of 36% in the BBC poll tracker. In the meantime, the Liberal Democrats have fallen away a little from their party conference highpoint to settle at that 18%-ish level they've occupied for much of the autumn while the Brexit Party continue to drift downwards. Labour's average rating has essentially stayed flat. Because voting intention polls are fairly scarce in Scotland, it's difficult to identify trends. But the latest Panelbase poll conducted earlier this month suggests that the SNP continues to dominate. Comparing polls to the 2017 general election result suggests Labour and the Conservatives are on course to lose votes, the SNP are roughly level with where they were, whilst the Lib Dems could gain votes. The SNP's share in polls has floated between 36% and 43% for the last two years. In our GB-wide poll tracker, that translates to 4%, occasionally dropping to 3% or rising to 5% since Scotland has just under 10% of the GB population. That's why we don't suggest a margin of error range as we do for parties that field candidates across the whole of Great Britain. Polls are even rarer in Wales - but the latest from YouGov, also conducted earlier this month, broadly matches others from earlier in the year. The Conservatives are down from their 2017 election share but Labour has fallen back much more dramatically. From the 49% they achieved then, their share of the vote has approximately halved according to polls. The Lib Dems are up sharply and the Brexit Party are performing far more strongly than UKIP did when voters last had their say. Our poll tracker lines show an average of results from the polls to date. Each dot in the chart above shows one poll result for a party. There are too many individual dots to keep track of: even on one day there can be very different results for one party from different polls. So we summarise all that information with a line that averages those results. It bounces around less and makes it easier to tell the signal from the noise (or the trends from the blips?). We use polls conducted by members of the British Polling Council. As of September 2019, that's BMG, ComRes, Deltapoll, Hanbury, ICM, Ipsos Mori, Kantar, Opinium, ORB, Panelbase, Sky Data, Survation and YouGov. Most of the polls included cover Great Britain, although some do poll the whole of the UK, but as a result we do not have separate data for parties that only stand in Northern Ireland. We use results that exclude or downweight those who are unlikely to vote and people who do not express a preference. We include data that are in the public domain: some polling companies will not publish all data for all parties at the same time and so we update the poll tracker as data become available. The margin of error is plus or minus four percentage points. This means that there's a 90% chance that an election held tomorrow would give national vote shares within four points of our estimates for each of the parties. And there's a 10% chance that it would be outside that range. We base these figures on aBritish Polling Council analysis,externalof the results of the final set of polls before each of the elections from 2001 to 2017. The approach mentioned above doesn't quite work for parties that only run in Scotland or Wales or are standing in only a few seats, like UKIP or The Independent Group for Change. The electorate they are appealing to is smaller and this makes their possible vote smaller when it is projected across Great Britain or the whole of the UK. This also means that their margin of error is smaller than that of those parties that stand across Britain and is likely to be less than + / - 1%. We have more coverage of politics inScotlandandWaleson their national politics pages. Our estimate of a party's support is a rolling average of polls to date. Bigger and more recent polls have more influence on our figures. We also limit the influence of any one poll or of those polling firms who poll very frequently to prevent our results being too dependent on one source. In a little more detail: the average is weighted by sample size. The more people polled in a particular survey, the more weight we will give it, up to a threshold of 2,000 people. On the other hand, the older a poll is the less influence it has on the average figure we calculate. We also give less value to any polling firm that has data for more than 5,000 people in a fortnight. A typical poll may cover about 1,000 people. Because a party isn't guaranteed to get the same vote share in an election as it did in a poll the previous day. Polling a sample of the population has often been likened to tasting soup. If the soup has been well stirred then you need to have only one spoonful to get a sense of what the whole bowl is like. In the same way, a well-conducted poll of 1,000 people can, most of the time, give us an idea of what the country as a whole is thinking. But it's not 100% precise, so, the margin of error gives a sense of how the results might change with a different sample of 1,000 people. This margin of error only applies to national vote share: converting that into seats in Parliament is much harder and less precise. There are also systematic differences between polling companies who approach people in different ways, who ask different questions and who analyse the results differently. We list the main polling firms and the questions they ask below. Polling companies also analyse their data differently. They make choices about how to weight each respondent. For example, if a poll of 1,000 people is made up of 550 men and 450 women, it is unrepresentative because it does not reflect the profile of the UK population (51% female). So the answers of female respondents should be given slightly more weight than male respondents in the analysis so that the final results are 51% based on female answers rather than 45%. That's not controversial, but adjusting for past vote or likelihood to vote is harder. Some pollsters ask respondents who they voted for last time and weight the sample to try and ensure it matches the political make-up of the general population. One problem with doing this is that a certain number of people will incorrectly recall who they voted for last time - and a few will even lie about it. So polling companies often use a variety of further methods to improve the accuracy of their weighting. That variety of methods leads to a variety of answers. Most companies then weight or filter by likelihood to vote so that the answers of people who are most likely to vote are given the most prominence in the results. Finally, several pollsters reallocate a percentage of ""don't knows"" to the party they voted for last time. This is to get around the problem that emerged following the 1979 election with the phenomenon of ""shy Tories"" or the ""spiral of silence"" - people who do not want to discuss their voting preference but who will still vote. Our approach, excluding ""don't knows"" from our polltracker, is slightly different. It is like saying that they won't vote or, if they did, their voting preferences would look quite like those who do express a preference. Many polling companies changed their methodology when the candidates lists were released to account for those parties that are standing only in a few seats. If a general election were held today, which of the following parties would you vote for? Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat, SNP (if living in Scotland), Plaid Cymru (if living in Wales), Green Party, Brexit Party, another party Prior to August 2019, Green Party and Brexit Party were only prompted for if the respondent answered ""another party"".

"The EU has told Boris Johnson to select a UK candidate for the new European Commission Boris Johnson has now written to the EU accepting a new Brexit extension until 31 January. But do EU leaders believe this will be the last delay before Brexit? In his letter to Brussels, the UK prime minister urges the EU to make clear that a further extension beyond January is simply not on offer. EU leaders, though, are highly unlikely to do as the PM asks. Why? Well, in this very long Brexit process, there have been so many false dawns. More than three years on since the UK voted to leave the EU, the issue of ""Brexit: yes or no and if yes, then what kind of Brexit?"" has yet to be resolved in the UK. Can anyone guarantee that it will definitely have been resolved in three months' time? Or that the newly negotiated Brexit deal will have been ratified by the UK Parliament and the EU Parliament by then? They can't. And what has been the main focus of the EU in these many months of negotiations? To avoid a politically and economically damaging no-deal Brexit, while safeguarding the bloc's core interests. Which is why the EU will want to keep the possibility of another extension up its sleeve come January. Not because EU leaders relish the idea. Quite the opposite, actually. In the EU's ideal world, if the UK is definitely leaving (which EU leaders assume it is), then MPs would now be forced to focus on the new Brexit deal. They would then ratify the deal along with the European Parliament, meaning that the UK's exit process was finished and phase two of Brexit could begin: negotiations for a comprehensive EU-UK trade deal. What's going on with Brexit? What is in Boris Johnson's new Brexit deal? But if that doesn't happen and a UK general election proves inconclusive when it comes to Brexit, EU leaders want the option of another Brexit delay in their back pocket to avoid a no-deal scenario. Even if EU leaders were to acquiesce, do what Mr Johnson has asked and solemnly declare that this was ""the last extension, honest!"", then you'd know they had their fingers crossed behind their backs. It would be a promise easily broken under pressure. Rather like the EU's insistence that it would ""never reopen the withdrawal agreement"" negotiated with Theresa May. Essentially the EU makes compromises when it believes it has little choice and when those compromises are not really harmful to the bloc. Reopening the Brexit withdrawal agreement for renegotiations? ""A pain but do-able,"" thought the EU, if, as Mr Johnson initially threatened, the alternative was no deal at all. Another Brexit extension? ""A bore and more costly uncertainty,"" thinks the EU, ""but less costly than a no-deal Brexit"". Note though, that in the recent renegotiations, the EU was not willing to compromise on single market exposure on the island of Ireland. Despite the no-deal threat. That is why deal-hungry Prime Minister Johnson backed down over the customs issue and accepted the EU proposal of a customs border in the Irish Sea. His red line was broken there, not theirs. Brexit dance goes on as EU approves new extension Now, as they prepare to sign off individually on the new Brexit extension (a mere formality at this stage) EU leaders have a sinking sense that not only is another Brexit extension beyond this one a possibility, but so is the risk of having to re-re-open the Brexit withdrawal agreement again following a general election in the UK. This video can not be played EU negotiator ""happy"" Brexit extension has been granted Brussels would never openly admit to this now. But the possibility cannot be ruled out completely. For now, the EU must stand again at the sidelines and watch to see where the unfolding drama in Westminster takes them. One outstanding EU prod for the prime minister: he's been told to select a UK candidate for the new European Commission, expected to take over in a month or so. It seems an almost perverse request, considering the UK has at least one-and-a-half feet out the door by now. But just as it appeared questionable for the UK to take part in European elections back in April, the incoming European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen insists she needs a UK commissioner in her team to avoid compromising the EU in legal terms as long as the UK remains a member.

"This video can not be played Brexit: What happened on Monday? Boris Johnson will try for a fourth time to secure an early general election, after MPs rejected his plan. The PM will now ask MPs to approve a 12 December election through a one-page bill - which needs the support of fewer MPs than his last attempt. But No 10 sources say they would accept an election on 11 December to get opposition parties on-board. Mr Johnson said the ""paralysis"" could not go on, but Labour said a no-deal Brexit had to be taken off the table. This comes after EU leaders accepted the UK's request to extend the Brexit deadline to 31 January - but the UK can leave earlier if a deal is agreed by Parliament. The Commonsbacked the government's election motion by 299 to 70 on Monday- but it was well short of the two-thirds of all 650 MPs whose support is needed to call an election under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act. All Conservative MPs backed the motion, but the vast majority of MPs from Labour - the largest opposition party - abstained, along with the Scottish National Party and Democratic Unionist Party from Northern Ireland. All but one MP from the Liberal Democrats voted against it. LIVE: Latest as MPs prepare for vote on election How did my MP vote? Is this the final Brexit delay?

Instead, it has published its Early Parliamentary General Election Bill, which allows for an election to take place on 12 December. Former Chancellor Philip Hammond - who was expelled from the Conservative Party at Westminster after voting against a no-deal Brexit - said the idea of using ""precious time"" to hold an election, rather than passing the government's Brexit bill, ""frankly appals me"". But Home Office Minister Brandon Lewis said: ""We have to have an election to deliver a Parliament that can get Brexit through."" Labour's shadow cabinet are meeting to discuss their position on the early election bill. On Monday, Boris Johnson officially accepted the EU's offer of an extension to the Brexit deadline to 31 January. This means the UK will not now leave the EU on Thursday - 31 October - a promise at the heart of Mr Johnson's campaign to become prime minister. In a letter to EU officials, Mr Johnson said the further delay - which he insists was forced upon him by Parliament - was ""unwanted"". This video can not be played The government failed to secure the necessary two-thirds of MPs' votes MPs are due to begin debating the early election bill after 1230 GMT. The government is aiming to complete all of its Commons stages by the end of the day - a process that normally takes several days. A vote on the second reading of the bill is expected after 1630 GMT - this is the first Commons hurdle - and that will be followed later by a third reading vote. If MPs back that, then there is almost certain to be a pre-Christmas election, although the legislation will still have to clear the House of Lords. The date is a sticking point as things stand, but it is not impossible that will become unglued by the time MPs vote tonight. Conversations are going on through the ""usual channels"" - the party whips - and they may all find a way of climbing down to agree. But for both the government and the smaller opposition parties, they have to be willing to hold hands and jump into this together. The SNP and the Liberal Democrats are nervous as being seen as the PM's little helpers. Parliament is closer than it's ever been to an election. But it doesn't mean that it happens tonight and it is still possible after those MPs have walked through the voting lobbies, we still have no Brexit, no budget and no traditionally functioning government. Read more from Laura here. The legislation the PM will propose on Tuesday requires a lower threshold for approval than the motion he tabled on Monday. Mr Johnson originally tried to hold an election via the Fixed-term Parliament Act route, which is a simpler process than passing a bill as it cannot be amended by MPs. But with the need for two-thirds of all MPs to back it - rather than just a majority of one - his attempts have failed. Crucially for his new plan, the Lib Dems and the SNP have indicated they might be prepared to support it. However, there are arguments over the date of an election. Parliament has to be dissolved a minimum of 25 working days before the date of an election to allow sufficient preparations to take place. The Lib Dems and the SNP want an election on 9 December because they say that will prevent any chance of Mr Johnson's Brexit deal being approved before Parliament is dissolved. Both parties want to fight the election on a platform of stopping Brexit entirely. The government hopes to persuade the Lib Dems and the SNP to agree to the 12 December date by pledging not to bring back its Brexit deal bill before Parliament is dissolved. But No 10 sources have said they would accept a Lib Dem/SNP amendment allowing an election to take place on 11 December. Earlier, Home Office Minister Brandon Lewis said 12 December was ""the right date for a general election"", arguing a poll any earlier would not allow time for the government to pass ""key pieces of legislation"" - including around budget issues in Northern Ireland. However, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson told MPs she did not trust Mr Johnson's assurances. The government maintains it would be very difficult for an election bill to pass through both the Commons and the Lords, and receive Royal Assent by 00:01 on Friday in order to meet a 9 December deadline. Most Labour MPs abstained from Monday's vote. The party's leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said he would consider the legislation, but would only support an election once a no-deal Brexit had been taken off the table. He also called for assurances that students would not be ""disenfranchised"" if the vote was held outside term time. But speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner said a 9 December election ""certainly would"" appeal more than a 12 December vote. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said there was a split in the party over whether to hold an election, with some MPs worried about their standings in the polls and confusion over their Brexit policy - to negotiate a new deal then hold another referendum. The DUP, which opposes Mr Johnson's Brexit agreement and which abstained in Monday's vote, could also potentially come on board - meaning the simple majority of one could be achieved. But the government may also need support from those MPs who had the Conservative whip removed for voting against a no-deal Brexit. One of those MPs, Mr Hammond, said: ""I think the government is trying to create a narrative that Parliament is blocking Brexit and therefore we need an election. But, that is simply untrue."" The former chancellor argued the real motivation for an election was to ""change the shape of the Conservative Party"" and to ""get rid of a cohort of MPs that it regards as not robust enough"" on Brexit. ""There is a piece of blatant entryism to change what the Conservative Party is about,"" he added. However, the now-independent MP also said: ""It really doesn't matter how many times my party kicks me, abuses me, reviles me. They are not going to stop me feeling like a Conservative.""

"This video can not be played General David Petraeus on Baghdadi's death Two men were captured during the US military's raid on Islamic State (IS) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's hideout in Syria and are in US custody, says the Pentagon. The Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman said they were now ""in a secure facility"". General Mark Milley also announced that Baghdadi's remains had been disposed of and there were currently no plans to share footage of his death. Baghdadi killed himself during the raid, the US says. ""Baghdadi's remains were transported to a secure facility to confirm his identity with forensic DNA testing, and the disposal of his remains has been done and is complete and was handled appropriately,"" Gen Milley told reporters. Gen Milley - the highest ranking member of the US military - said photos and video were going through ""a declassification process"". President Donald Trump had earlier suggested that some footage from the raid might be released. This video can not be played Body language expert analyses Trump's Situation Room photo There were no further details about the detained men. Baghdadi died from detonating a suicide vest after fleeing into a tunnel while being chased by US military dogs, President Trump announced on Sunday. Who was Baghdadi? What does his death mean for IS? The Pentagon says no US personnel were killed in the raid but one of the dogs pursuing Baghdadi was seriously injured. Gen Milley said the dog's name was classified. In response to a question about Mr Trump's contention that Baghdadi had whimpered and cried before his death, Gen Milley said he was not aware where the information came from but added: ""I assume it was [from] talking directly to unit members."" Gen Milley also said that US troops would continue to protect oilfields from IS militants, though ""at the end of the day, we will be sending troops home"". Mr Trump has said the US should be able to take some of the oil, but critics say doing so would violate the Geneva Convention's laws against pillaging natural resources. Allow Twitter content?

Speaking to reporters before boarding Air Force One, Mr Trump defended his decision to keep the US Congress in the dark about the raid, citing leak concerns. Mr Trump singled out Adam Schiff, who heads the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, one of three panels leading an impeachment probe against the president. ""They were talking about why didn't I give the information to Adam Schiff and his committee, and the answer is I think Adam Schiff is the biggest leaker in Washington,"" he said. Trump takes partisan line after Baghdadi raid Mr Trump did not provide specific evidence against the Democratic congressman. Typically, the White House informs select lawmakers about classified intelligence matters. They normally include the House Speaker, minority and majority leaders of both the House and the Senate, as well as the chairs and ranking members of both chambers' intelligence committees. This video can not be played Mr Trump called Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi a ""brutal killer"" When asked whether he would release the footage of the raid - which he has likened to watching a ""movie"" - the president said: ""We may take certain parts of it and release it, yes."" The IS leader came to prominence in 2014 when he announced the creation of a ""caliphate"" in areas of Iraq and Syria. Although the US declared the ""caliphate"" defeated earlier this year, IS militants remain active in the region and elsewhere. Baghdadi's death is being seen as a policy victory for Mr Trump, who continues to face criticism from political rivals and allies for his decision to pull troops out of northern Syria.

"This video can not be played Brexit: What happened on Monday? Boris Johnson will try for a fourth time to secure an early general election, after MPs rejected his plan. The PM will now ask MPs to approve a 12 December election through a one-page bill - which needs the support of fewer MPs than his last attempt. But No 10 sources say they would accept an election on 11 December to get opposition parties on-board. Mr Johnson said the ""paralysis"" could not go on, but Labour said a no-deal Brexit had to be taken off the table. This comes after EU leaders accepted the UK's request to extend the Brexit deadline to 31 January - but the UK can leave earlier if a deal is agreed by Parliament. The Commonsbacked the government's election motion by 299 to 70 on Monday- but it was well short of the two-thirds of all 650 MPs whose support is needed to call an election under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act. All Conservative MPs backed the motion, but the vast majority of MPs from Labour - the largest opposition party - abstained, along with the Scottish National Party and Democratic Unionist Party from Northern Ireland.

"Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam said the territory is likely to record negative growth for the year as months of protests have knocked the economy. The unrest has disrupted businesses and dealt a particularly heavy blow to the tourism and retail sectors. The warning comes ahead of preliminary gross domestic product figures due on Thursday that are expected to show Hong Kong entered a technical recession. That is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth. In a briefing in Hong Kong on Tuesday, Ms Lam said the third quarter growth numbers are likely to show that outcome. To combat the slowdown, she said the city has so far injected more than HK$20bn ($2.6bn; Â£2bn) to support the economy including the transport, tourism and retail sectors. Ms Lam said the government will deliver more relief measures, without giving specific details. Her comments follow a similar warning from the territory's Finance Secretary Paul Chan over the weekend. He said it would be ""extremely difficult"" to hit the government's pre-protest forecast of growth of between 0% and 1% for 2019. ""The blow to our economy [from the protests] is comprehensive,"" Mr Chan said. The demonstrations began over a proposed extradition bill between the territory and mainland China, and have evolved into demands for greater freedoms. Five months of protests in Hong Kong have hit the territory's economy Hong Kong is part of China, but its citizens have more autonomy than those on the mainland. The background you need on the Hong Kong protests A quick guide to the Hong Kong protests How business is adapting to Hong Kong's new reality Clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent, with police using tear gas and protesters storming parliament. Those protests have led to asharp decline in tourist arrivals, with visitor numbers expected to have slumped 50% in October. Retailers have also been hard hit. Some shops have been forced to shorten trading hours, while workers report fears over their safety as well as getting to work. Mr Chan said in August that retail sales had plunged more than 25% - the biggest monthly drop on record.

"This video can not be played The second anniversary of the tragedy was marked last June The London Fire Brigade (LFB) has been condemned for ""serious shortcomings"" and systemic failures in its response to the Grenfell Tower fire, in a report after the first phase of an inquiry. Fewer people would have died in the 2017 fire if the LFB had taken certain actions earlier, the report by inquiry chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick said. The head of the Fire Brigades Union said the inquiry was ""back to front"". The BBC has seen sections of the report ahead of Wednesday's publication. The document follows the first phase of the inquiry, which looked at what happened on the night that 72 people died in the tower block fire on 14 June 2017. The second phase will focus on wider circumstances of the fire, including the design of the building. Grenfell gives me sleepless nights, says minister What happened at Grenfell Tower? Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims?' The story of Grenfell Tower flat 113 General secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, Matt Wrack, said: ""The truth is that the fire spread the way it did because it was wrapped in flammable cladding. The firefighters turned up after that had happened, after the building had already been turned, in reality, into a death trap. ""Firefighters' actions on the night, which were remarkable in the circumstances, are now being scrutinised. Nobody is trying to avoid scrutiny, but we think that the ordering of the inquiry is completely back to front."" This video can not be played Nabil Choucair, who lost six members of his family in the fire, says people should have been evacuated earlier Speaking to BBC News, Nabil Choucair, who lost six relatives in the fire, said he believed ""lots of families could have been rescued, without a doubt"". ""It's very hard to go on,"" he added. ""I personally believe they were inadequate in dealing with the fire."" The council, the tower's tenant management organisation, the police and the fire service were all questioned during the inquiry's first phase. The inquiry has criticisedthe Daily Telegraph,external, which first published leaked details of the report, and other media which followed suit. A spokeswoman said publication had deprived ""those most affected by the fire - the bereaved, survivors and residents - of the opportunity to read the report at their own pace"". The families of the 72 victims contributed to the report Sir Martin's report praised the courage of firefighters on the night. But it found many ""institutional"" failures that meant the LFB's planning and preparation for the incident was ""gravely inadequate"". For example, Sir Martin said control room staff who fielded 999 calls ""undoubtedly saved lives"" but ""a close examination"" of operations revealed ""shortcomings in practice, policy and training"". He said staff that night were in an ""invidious"" position when they were outnumbered by 999 calls. ""Supervisors were under the most enormous pressure, but the LFB had not provided its senior control room staff with appropriate training on how to manage a large-scale incident with a large number of FSG [Fire Survival Guidance] calls,"" he said. ""Mistakes made in responding to the Lakanal House fire were repeated,"" he added - referring to a fire in Camberwell, south London, in 2009, which killed three women and three children. This report could not be more critical of the London Fire Brigade. The Grenfell families wanted this level of criticism, especially those whose relatives died when they were told for nearly two hours to stay put in the building as it was covered in flames. But there is also some frustration that this first part of the inquiry wasn't about those who made the cladding and oversaw the refurbishment of Grenfell. That will only happen in the second phase of the inquiry next year and then they've got even longer to wait for the police investigation to finish. So they are seeing some blame apportioned and they hope they will eventually see justice but the Grenfell survivors will always suffer the loss and grief and ask the question how did 72 people die in what was supposed to be the safety of their homes? Sir Martin also criticised the LFB for following a ""stay put"" strategy, where firefighters and 999 operators told residents to stay in their flats for nearly two hours after the blaze broke out. The strategy was rescinded at 02:47 BST, the report said. Sir Martin wrote: ""That decision could and should have been made between 01:30 and 01:50 and would be likely to have resulted in fewer fatalities."" Firefighters who attended the fire did not have training on how best to combat a cladding fire, the report added. Four members of the first crews to have fought the blaze had 52 years of combined experience. However, they had not received any training on the risks posed by exterior cladding or the techniques to be deployed in fighting fires involving cladding, the report found. Among other issues highlighted in the report were: A lack of training in how to ""recognise the need for an evacuation or how to organise one"" Incident commanders ""of relatively junior rank"" being unable to change strategy Control room officers lacking training on when to advise callers to evacuate An assumption that crews would reach callers, resulting in ""assurances which were not well founded"" Communication between the control room and those on the ground being ""improvised, uncertain and prone to error"" A lack of an organised way to share information within the control room, meaning officers had ""no overall picture of the speed or pattern of fire spread"" Sir Martin said the ""principal"" reason the fire spread so quickly ""up, down and around the building was the presence of the aluminium composite material (ACM) rainscreen panels with polyethylene cores, which acted as a source of fuel"". Dany Cotton said she would not have changed anything about the way her brigade responded to the blaze The report also said evidence given by the LFB's commissioner, Dany Cotton, suggested lessons from the fire might be missed. Sir Martin wrote: ""Quite apart from its remarkable insensitivity to the families of the deceased and to those who escaped from their burning homes with their lives, the Commissioner's evidence that she would not change anything about the response of the LFB on the night, even with the benefit of hindsight, only serves to demonstrate that the LFB is an institution at risk of not learning the lessons of the Grenfell Tower fire."" A spokesperson for the LFB said it would be ""inappropriate"" to comment on the report's findings before they were officially released on Wednesday. In remarks to families and survivors on Monday, Sir Martin said the report was long and detailed. He stressed that readers of the report ""should understand as clearly as possible the terrifying conditions faced by those who were in the building, at the time"". The cause of the fire was found by the report to be ""an electrical fault in the large fridge freezer in the kitchen"" in a fourth-floor flat. ""It occurred without any fault on the part of the tenant... and I am pleased to clear him of any blame, given that some people have unfairly accused him of having some responsibility for what happened,"" Sir Martin said.
