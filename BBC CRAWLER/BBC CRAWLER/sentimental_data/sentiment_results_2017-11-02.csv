"Labour has suspended an MP after it was alleged he sexually harassed a party activist three years ago. Luton North MP Kelvin Hopkins, 76, has not commented on the claims, which were published in the Telegraph shortly after his suspension was announced. The woman involved, Ava Etemadzadeh, 27, said he had sent her inappropriate text messages and made inappropriate physical contact while hugging her. Mr Hopkins has had the whip withdrawn while an investigation takes place. A party spokesman said Labour ""takes all such complaints extremely seriously and has robust procedures in place"". Fallon: My conduct fell short Labour activist 'warned' over rape claim PM: Take sex abuse claims to police Ms Etemadzadeh told the Telegraph that she met Mr Hopkins in 2013 and invited him to speak at a Labour event at Essex University in 2014, when she was 24, after which, she told the newspaper he had hugged her too tightly and made inappropriate contact. She visited Parliament at his invitation in February 2015 but said later that month he sent a suggestive text message. Having taken advice from another Labour MP, she said she took a complaint about him to Labour's whips office in December 2015. It is understood that at the time, Mr Hopkins was spoken to about why his behaviour was inappropriate and was reprimanded by the then chief whip Dame Rosie Winterton. But he went on to be promoted, albeit briefly, to Labour's front bench in June 2016 - shortly after leader Jeremy Corbyn faced mass resignations following the EU referendum. Sources suggested Labour whips advised the leader's office not to promote him because of what happened. The leader's office say that is not the case. Ms Etmadzadeh said she was frustrated that he had been promoted but when she complained to the chief whip, she was told she could not take action while remaining anonymous. She told the BBC: ""I was shocked to learn that he got promoted afterwards. ""I'm disillusioned by the party not just not doing anything, but then promoting him afterward. They ignored it."" Mr Hopkins has been MP for Luton North since 1997 Labour MP for Luton North since 1997 Spent most of 20-year political career on backbenches Briefly promoted to front bench from July to October 2016 Long history of involvement with trade union movement One of 36 MPs to nominate Jeremy Corbyn for his 2015 leadership bid One of the few Labour MPs to campaign for Leave in the EU referendum Married to Patricia. The couple have two grown up children The BBC has been told that Ms Etmadzadeh had a meeting with the chief whip on Thursday. There has not yet been any comment from Mr Hopkins - who is married and has been Luton North MP for 20 years - despite repeated attempts to contact him. Labour MP Jess Phillips told BBC Radio 4's Today programme Mr Hopkins should probably not have been promoted. But she added: ""I don't think that it was sort of political expediency; I think that people just didn't take it as seriously as it needed to be taken."" Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn declined to answer questions from reporters about Mr Hopkins's promotion on Friday morning. The suspension comes amid various claims of sexual harassment and improper behaviour in Parliament. Sir Michael Fallon quit as defence secretary on Wednesday night, saying his conduct may have ""fallen short"" of the standards expected by the UK military. In another incident, Labour confirmed it had launched an independent inquiry into claims that activist Bex Bailey, 25, was discouraged by a party official from reporting an alleged rape at a Labour event in 2011. Party leaders have vowed to tackle discipline and grievance procedures. In a letter to Commons Speaker John Bercow,Theresa May said disciplinary procedures needed to be reformed.

"This video can not be played Mark Lehner: ""A space that the builders left to protect the grand gallery?"" The mysteries of the pyramids have deepened with the discovery of what appears to be a giant void within the Khufu, or Cheops, monument in Egypt. It is not known why the cavity exists or indeed if it holds anything of value because it is not obviously accessible. Japanese and French scientists made the announcement after two years of study at the famous pyramid complex. They have been using a technique called muography, which can sense density changes inside large rock structures. The Great Pyramid, or Khufu's Pyramid, is thought to have been constructed during the reign of Pharaoh Khufu between 2509 and 2483 BC. At 140m (460 feet) in height, it is the largest of the Egyptian pyramids located at Giza on the outskirts of Cairo. ScanPyramids has already detected a smaller void on the northern face The new cavity is perhaps 30m long and several metres in height All three muon technologies sense the same feature in the same place Khufu famously contains three large interior chambers and a series of passageways, the most striking of which is the 47m-long, 8m-high Grand Gallery. The newly identified feature is said to sit directly above this and have similar dimensions. ""We don't know whether this big void is horizontal or inclined; we don't know if this void is made by one structure or several successive structures,"" explained Mehdi Tayoubi from the HIP Institute, Paris. ""What we are sure about is that this big void is there; that it is impressive; and that it was not expected as far as I know by any sort of theory."" The newly found void is directly above the Grand Gallery The ScanPyramids team,externalis being very careful not to describe the cavity as a ""chamber"". Khufu contains compartments that experts believe may have been incorporated by the builders to avoid collapse by relieving some of the stress of the overlying weight of stone. The higher King's Chamber, for example, has five such spaces above it. The renowned American archaeologist Mark Lehner sits on a panel reviewing ScanPyramids' work. He says the muon science is sound but he is not yet convinced the discovery has significance. ""It could be a kind of space that the builders left to protect the very narrow roof of the Grand Gallery from the weight of the pyramid,"" he toldthe BBC's Science In Action programme. ""Right now it's just a big difference; it's an anomaly. But we need more of a focus on it especially in a day and age when we can no longer go blasting our way through the pyramid with gunpowder as [British] Egyptologist Howard Vyse did in the early 1800s."" This video can not be played Mehdi Tayoubi: ""It's a big void, similar to the Grand Gallery, but what is it?"" One of the team leaders, Hany Helal from Cairo University, believes the void is too big to have a pressure-relieving purpose, but concedes the experts will debate this. ""What we are doing is trying to understand the internal structure of the pyramids and how this pyramid has been built,"" he told reporters. ""Famous Egyptologists, archaeologists and architects - they have some hypotheses. And what we are doing is giving them data. It is they who have to tell us whether this is expected or not."" Much of the uncertainty comes down to the rather imprecise data gained from muography. This non-invasive technique has been developed over the past 50 years to probe the interiors of phenomena as diverse as volcanoes and glaciers. It has even been used to investigate the failed nuclear reactors at Fukushima. Muography makes use of the shower of high-energy particles that rain down on the Earth's surface from space. When super-fast cosmic rays collide with air molecules, they produce a range of ""daughter"" particles, including muons. These also move close to the speed of light and only weakly interact with matter. So when they reach the surface, they penetrate deeply into rock. But some of the particles will be absorbed and deflected by the atoms in the rock's minerals, and if the muon detectors are placed under a region of interest then a picture of density anomalies can be obtained. The muon detectors have to be placed under the region of interest The ScanPyramids team used three different muography technologies and all three agreed on the position and scale of the void. SÃ©bastien Procureur, from CEA-IRFU, University of Paris-Saclay, emphasised that muography only sees large features, and that the team's scans were not just picking up a general porosity inside the pyramid. ""With muons you measure an integrated density,"" he explained. ""So, if there are holes everywhere then the integrated density will be the same, more or less, in all directions, because everything will be averaged. But if you see some excess of muons, it means that you have a bigger void. ""You don't get that in a Swiss cheese."" The question now arises as to how the void should be investigated further. Jean-Baptiste Mouret, from the French national institute for computer science and applied mathematics (Inria), said the team had an idea how to do it, but that the Egyptian authorities would first have to approve it. ""Our concept is to drill a very small hole to potentially explore monuments like this. We aim to have a robot that could fit in a 3cm hole. Basically, we're working on flying robots,"" he said.

"Former Tesco executives Carl Rogberg (left), Christopher Bush (centre) and John Scouler (right), are on trial at Southwark Crown Court Tesco's chief executive has told a court of his ""surprise and shock"" on learning the company's profits had been misstated by Â£246m. David Lewis was told about the issue just weeks after he took up the post in September 2014. Mr Lewis has been giving evidence at the trial into alleged fraud at the supermarket giant. Former Tesco executives Carl Rogberg, Christopher Bush and John Scouler are on trial. All deny the charges. They are accused of fraud by abuse of position and false accounting between February and September 2014. Mr Lewis told jurors at Southwark Crown Court that he took up his post at the beginning of September 2014. He said he had had numerous meetings with Bush and one with Scouler, but he was not told of the accounting issue until 19 September. He recalled he was called into a meeting with Adrian Morris, Tesco's chief counsel, at about lunchtime that day, and presented with a paper detailing the problem. Asked for his reaction to this, he told the court: ""One of surprise and one of shock, really. ""I think the thing that was unique to this paper was the indication that the numbers that had been declared had a potential misstatement within them. ""What was new was the proposition here that Â£246m of income had been included in the first half of the year that on that basis of this paper was deemed to be questionable."" Mr Lewis said: ""I had never experienced anything like this before, but it was quite clear that having read the paper, and the manner in which it was served, I felt that it had to be taken very seriously."" He said he called Tesco's chairman, Sir Richard Broadbent, and told him what the document said, and that a team of internal and external auditors was assembled to work through the weekend. Mr Lewis went on to explain the company had spent a great deal of time between Tesco's public announcement on 22 September stating profits had been overestimated, and when the company was due to issue its interim results on 23 October. He said: ""It was a very intensive amount of investigation of these numbers. It required a huge amount of review of paperwork, documentation between pretty much all of the suppliers to Tesco and the different categories in order to validate the number. ""So that was quite an extensive exercise."" At an earlier hearing, the court heard that two members of its finance department resigned in 2014 over concerns they may be compromising their professional integrity. The two were unhappy about what they were being asked to do by bosses. Carl Rogberg, 50, Chris Bush, 51, and John Scouler, 49, are alleged to have failed to correct inaccurately recorded income figures. The company's former UK finance head, UK managing director and UK food commercial boss deny charges of fraud by abuse of position and false accounting. The court has heard the three men were accused of ""cooking the books"" by bringing forward income not yet earned to artificially inflate its figures. Problems with Tesco's accounts came to light in a regulatory announcement in September 2014, when Tesco shocked the market in admitting it had overstated profits forecast by about Â£250m.

"This video can not be played What exactly is the Bank of England interest rate? The Bank of England has raised interest rates from 0.5% to 0.75% after much speculation. Expectations of a strengthening economy, solid employment levels, more consumer spending and the potential for wages to rise have all played a part in the decision. The Bank's main priority is to keep the rising cost of living - known as inflation - under control. It uses its key interest rate, known as the Bank rate or base rate, which is the reference point for how much banks and building societies pay savers and charge borrowers in interest. Generally, a rise in the Bank rate is good for the UK's 45 million savers and bad for borrowers - but the reality is a bit more nuanced. Here are the key points. More than3.5 millionresidential mortgages are on a variable or tracker rate The average standard variable rate mortgage is4.72% On a Â£150,000 variable mortgage, a rise to 0.75% is likely to increase the annual cost byÂ£224 A Bank rate rise does not guarantee the equivalent increase in interest paid to savers. Half did not move after the last rate rise No easy access savings account at a major High Street bank pays interest of more than0.5% Across the UK, 9.1 million households have a mortgage. Of these, more than 3.5 million are on a standard variable rate or a tracker rate. These are the people who would be most affected, as their monthly payments would increase. The relatively small rise will not be particularly painful for the vast majority of householders, although debt charities say that some squeezed families will find this extra burden a real challenge. Those on such variable rates tend to be older, and with relatively small outstanding mortgage balances. The average outstanding balance is Â£112,000. For somebody with 20 years left on this mortgage, the monthly bill rise by about Â£14 a month. For those with a larger balance, then clearly the rise in the mortgage bill will be greater. The vast majority of new mortgage loans - 96% - are on fixed interest rates, typically for two or five years. Currently half of all outstanding loans are on fixed rates, equating to about 4.7 million households. Some of these rates are expected to rise after the latest announcement. Of course, none of these borrowers would see an immediate rise. However, when such borrowers reach the end of their term, they may find they have to make higher monthly payments. That said, they could - depending on when they took out their loan - end up on a cheaper deal. Lenders offering fixed rates tend to be especially competitive. Some rates may rise on other types of borrowing such as personal loans and credit cards. Should they rise, that would have relatively little impact on a credit card interest rate that is generally about 18%. When base rates rise, so do savings rates, in theory. But it depends on the extent to which banks and building societies want to increase their deposits. So after November's rate increase, banks were slow to pass on any rise to savers, or they typically passed ona fraction of the full increase. In fact, half of all savings accounts did not move at all after the last Bank rate rise in November. Commentators say savers could probably expect something similar this time. According to the Bank of England, returns on longer-term cash Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs) were little changed in December. Yet they jumped significantly in January, with average returns on cash ISAs going up from 0.36% to 0.94%. In February and March they held steady at 0.86%, before falling subsequently to 0.63% by the end of June. For the average cash Isa saver with Â£11,200 locked away, the latest rise - if passed on - could mean Â£28 more a year in interest. Any rate rise might also good for retirees buying an annuity - a financial product that provides an income for life. Annuity rates follow the yields - or interest rates - on long-dated government bonds, otherwise known as gilts. These yields could be expected to rise amid an environment of rising interest rates, giving retirees better value for money when they buy an annuity. Back in November 2011, a 65-year-old buying a joint annuity for Â£100,000 would have got an annual income of Â£5,404. Last year, that had dropped by Â£1,318 to Â£4,086. However, by now this has risen to about Â£4,670. Depending on how the market views the likelihood of further base rate rises, annuity rates may continue to creep up. According to Willliam Burrows, of Better Retirement, a 1% rise in gilt yields translates into an 8% rise in annuity rates - but this remains a long-term consideration. ""Annuity rates have been in the doldrums since the EU referendum in 2016, when gilt yields fell dramatically. Any increase in the bank rate should result in higher gilt yields, which will in turn lead to higher annuities,"" he said. ""However, don't hold your breath waiting for annuity rates to rise, because it is normally a slow process."" But we are still a long way from the heady days of the 1990s, when a Â£100,000 pension pot would have bought an annual income of about Â£15,000 a year.

"This video can not be played New York truck attack: Who is Sayfullo Saipov? US President Donald Trump has repeated calls for the suspect in the New York truck attack to get the death penalty. But Mr Trump backed away from his call a day earlier to send Sayfullo Saipov to Guantanamo Bay, saying ""that process takes much longer"". The suspect, who allegedly drove along a Manhattan cycle path killing eight people, told police he ""felt good"" about Tuesday's Halloween attack. Later, so-called Islamic State (IS) said it had carried out the attack. The attacker was ""one of the caliphate soldiers"", it said in its weekly al-Naba newspaper, without providing evidence to support the claim. The victims were five Argentines who had travelled to New York to celebrate 30 years since their high school graduation, a young mother from Belgium and two Americans. Mr Saipov, 29, an Uzbek immigrant, was shot at the scene by police, according to officials. Investigators say he told them he was inspired by IS. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Saipov, who appeared in court on Wednesday in a wheelchair, faces federal terrorism charges, which means the government could override New York state's ban on capital punishment. ""There is also something appropriate about keeping him in the home of the horrible crime he committed,"" tweeted the Republican president, a native New Yorker, on Thursday morning. Repeating his initial call tweeted overnight for Mr Saipov to be executed, Mr Trump added: ""Should move fast. DEATH PENALTY!"" However, some legal commentators suggest that Mr Trump's comments could be seen as prejudicial to a trial. Earlier this week, a military judge said he would consider a lighter sentence for Bowe Bergdahl, a US soldier who deserted his Afghan base, because of Mr Trump's previous urging for that defendant to face the death penalty. It is unusual for US presidents to hold forth on pending criminal cases, but not unheard of. Mr Saipov, who was shot and injured by police, appeared in court in a wheelchair In 1970, lawyers for mass murderer Charles Manson called for a mistrial after President Richard Nixon declared the cult leader guilty - in the middle of his trial. Nixon backtracked and the judge allowed the case to go ahead. Mr Trump has previously called for capital punishment to be applied in high-profile cases. In 1989, when a group of five black and Latino men were charged with a particularly brutal rape of a woman in New York City, Mr Trump paid $85,000 for an ad in city newspapers with the headline ""Bring Back the Death Penalty!"" The five defendants were later cleared by DNA evidence. Prosecutors say Mr Saipov spoke freely to them, waiving his right to avoid self-incrimination while in custody. According to federal court papers, he said: The attack was a year in the planning and he carried out a trial run with a rental truck last month He originally planned to target the Brooklyn Bridge as well He wanted to display IS flags on the truck, but decided not to draw attention to himself He was inspired by 90 graphic and violent propaganda videos found on his phone - in particular, one in which IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi asks what Muslims are doing to avenge deaths in Iraq. This video can not be played Damian Erskine: ""I gave the NYC attack supect five stars on Uber"". Mr Saipov was charged with one count of providing material support and resources to IS and another count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles. Read more on the suspect Why Uzbek migrants are radicalised CBS News quotes an intelligence source as saying Mr Saipov was known to US authorities after his name was associated with the subjects of FBI counter-terrorism investigations in 2015. The source says the suspect had some contact with individuals who were considered radicalised extremists, at least one of whom was Uzbek. It is unclear whether those being investigated were in the US or overseas.

"This video can not be played In Barcelona's central square, the crowd sings Freedom for Catalonia Eight sacked Catalan ministers have been remanded in custody by a Spanish high court judge over the region's push for independence. Prosecutors had asked the judge to detain eight of the nine former regional government members who turned up for questioning in Madrid. They are accused of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds. Prosecutors are also seeking a European Arrest Warrant for ousted Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont. The request also covers four other dismissed Catalan ministers who did not show up in court in Madrid as requested, but have been in Belgium since Monday. Catalonia sings for its exiled leaders Catalonia crisis in 300 words What next for Spain? Spain has been gripped by a constitutional crisis since a referendum on independence from Spain was held in Catalonia on 1 October in defiance of a constitutional court ruling that had declared it illegal. Last week, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy imposed direct rule on Catalonia, dissolving the regional parliament and calling local elections for 21 December. This came after Catalan lawmakers voted to declare the independence of the affluent north-eastern region. The Catalan government said that of the 43% of potential voters who took part in the referendum, 90% were in favour of independence. Seven of the eight ex-ministers were pictured turning up to court together Those detained are: Former Deputy Vice President Oriol Junqueras Former Interior Minister Joaquim Forn Former Foreign Affairs Minister RaÃ¼l Romeva Former Justice Minister Carles MundÃ³ Former Labour Minister Dolors Bassa Former Government Presidency Councillor Jordi Turull Former Sustainable Development Minister Josep Rull Former Culture Minister Meritxell Borras A ninth official, ex-Business Minister Santi Vila, was granted bail at the request of prosecutors. He resigned before the Catalan parliament voted for independence last Friday. Catalan political parties and civic groups condemned the judicial move, while thousands of people gathered outside the Catalan regional parliament in Barcelona, demanding that they be freed. In a statement broadcast on Catalan TV from an undisclosed location in Belgium, Mr Puigdemont described the detention of the eight ex-ministers as ""an act that breaks with the basic principles of democracy"". He added: ""I demand the release of the ministers and the vice-president."" Five other senior members of the Catalan parliament, as well as Speaker Carme Forcadell, are facing the same charges but, because of their parliamentary immunity, their cases are being handled by the Supreme Court. Their hearings have been postponed until 9 November. Carles Puigdemont was pictured in a Belgian cafe Mr Puigdemont, who was spotted in a Brussels cafe on Thursday, has said he will not return to Spain unless he and four of his fellow sacked colleagues receive guarantees of a fair trial. He did not specify his exact demands. Belgium's federal prosecutor has said the law will be applied once an arrest warrant is received, according to Efe news agency. Mr Puigdemont's lawyer said the climate was ""not good"" for him to appear in court, but he also said his client would co-operate with the authorities in Spain and Belgium. The man who wants to break up Spain In addition to Mr Puigdemont, prosecutors have asked Spain's high court judge to issue European arrest warrants for the following Catalan officials: Meritxell Serret, former agriculture minister Antoni ComÃ­n, former health minister LluÃ­s Puig, former culture minister Clara PonsatÃ­, former education minister If Spain's high court judge issues a warrant, a European Arrest Warrant (EAW) will be sent to Belgian prosecutors, who have 24 hours to decide whether the paperwork is correct. If they do, they then have 15 days to arrest Mr Puigdemont and the four others. If one or all of them appeals against it, that process could last another 15 days. Belgium has a maximum of 60 days to return the suspects to Spain after arrest. But if the suspects do not raise legal objections, a transfer could happen within a few days. A country can reject an EU arrest warrant if it fears that extradition would violate the suspect's human rights. Discrimination based on politics, religion or race is grounds for refusal. So are fears that the suspect would not get a fair trial. There is an agreedEU list of 32 offences,external- in Article Two of the EAW law - for which there is no requirement for the offence to be a crime in both countries. In other words, any of those offences can be a justification for extradition, provided the penalty is at least three years in jail. However, neither ""sedition"" nor ""rebellion"" - two of the Spanish accusations against the Catalan leaders - are on that list. Mr Puigdemont's handling of the crisis has drawn criticism among some other Catalan politicians, with left-wing parliamentary deputy Joan Josep Nuet criticising him for creating ""yet more bewilderment"". Spain's central bank warned on Thursday,externalof the ""significant risks and economic costs"" resulting from the crisis, and that Catalonia's economy could fall into recession. Early numbers suggest that the vital tourism sector of the region has already been affected by the ongoing uncertainty.

"This video can not be played The Bank of England may lift rates twice more over three years For the first time in more than 10 years, the Bank of England has raised interest rates. The official bank rate has been lifted from 0.25% to 0.5%, the first increase since July 2007. It is likely to rise twice more over the next three years, according to Bank of England governor Mark Carney. The move reverses the cut in August of last year, which was made in the wake of the vote to leave the European Union. Almost four million households face higher mortgage interest payments after the rise, but it should give savers a modest lift in their returns. As well as many of the country's 45 million savers, anyone considering buying an annuity for their pension will also see better deals. The main losers will be households with a variable rate mortgage. What will the rate rise mean for you? Kamal Ahmed: Are more rate rises ahead? Five things we have learnt from the Bank Mr Carney expects banks to pass on the rate rise to savers, but said many mortgages, loans and credit cards would not see an immediate impact. He said that British households have been ""savvy"" with their finances and have mostly taken out fixed-rate mortgages, which means it will take some time before the rise has an impact on them. The Bank estimates that almost two million mortgage holders have not experienced an interest rate rise since taking out a mortgage. Of the 8.1 million households with a mortgage, 3.7 million - or 46% - are on either a standard variable rate or a tracker rate - which generally move with the official bank rate. The average outstanding balance is Â£89,000 which would see payments increase by about Â£12 a month, according to UK Finance. The panel which sets interest rates, called the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), justified the rate increase by pointing to record-low unemployment, rising inflation and stronger global economic growth. Seven out of the nine members voted in favour of higher rates. Mr Carney told the BBC that the Bank expected the UK economy to grow at about 1.7% for the next few years, which he said would require ""about two more interest rate increases over the next three years"". This video can not be played We challenged some ten year olds to explain a system that baffles many adultsâ¦ Thepound fell about 1% against the dollar and euro, as some investors had hoped to see hints of more rate rises. Sterling dropped more than a cent against the two currencies to $1.3130 and â¬1.1280 respectively. The financial markets are indicating two more interest rate increases over the next three years, taking the official rate to 1%. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club consultancy, said: ""The Bank of England seemingly sees the hike to 0.50% as more likely to be a case of 'one and a little more to come' rather than 'one and done'."" The MPC also said that the decision to leave the European Union is having a ""noticeable impact"" on the economic outlook. Interest rates: How they voted Quiz: Are you a monetary maestro? Savings rates start to creep up Rate rise: Winners and losers Mr Carney said ""Brexit-related constraints"" on investment and workers appeared to be holding back the potential growth of the economy. Looking ahead, he said: ""The biggest determinate of our outlook is going to be those negotiations ongoing on Brexit - both a transition deal to a new arrangement and what is the longer form arrangement with the European Union."" The Bank of England is tasked with keeping consumer price inflation at around 2%. However, inflation has been running higher than that since February, and in September it hit 3% - the highest rate since April 2012. Mr Carney said inflation was unlikely to return to 2% without raising rates, because the economy was growing at levels ""above its speed limit"". This video can not be played Where were you when interest rates last went up? Business bodies said the rise was expected, but warned that companies could be hit if further increases came too soon. The Federation of Small Businesses said some would struggle to ""absorb more hikes in the short term"", while the CBI said ""what's important is the pace of any future rises"". Economists said the rise was unlikely to have a big effect on the economy, because rates are still at the lows seen since the financial crisis. Lucy O'Carroll, chief economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments, said: ""The symbolism of this hike is more significant than its economic impact."" The Bank has been reluctant to raise interest rates until now, arguing that inflation had been boosted by the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote in June of last year. That weaker pound has driven up the costs of imported food, fuel and other goods. The Bank says this effect is probably at its peak at the moment. The other issue holding back the Bank has been the weakness in wage growth. While inflation hit 3% in September, wage growth was only 2.1%. However, the Bank sees wage growth ""gradually"" increasing over the 2018 and says there are signs of that happening already. In its Quarterly Inflation Report, released with the announcement on rates, the Bank estimated inflation was likely to peak this month at 3.2%.

"This video can not be played The dram was bought for Â£7,600 A dram of vintage Scotch bought by a Chinese millionaire in a Swiss hotel bar for Â£7,600 was a fake, laboratory tests have concluded. Analysts from Scotland were called in by the Waldhaus Am See hotel in St Moritz after experts questioned the authenticity of the 2cl shot. It had been poured from an unopened bottle labelled as an 1878 Macallan single malt. It is believed to be the largest sum ever paid for a poured dram of Scotch. But analysis found that it was almost certainly not distilled before 1970. The hotel said it had accepted the findings and reimbursed the customer in full. Zhang Wei, 36, from Beijing - one of China's highest-earning online writers - had paid just under 10,000 Swiss francs (Â£7,600, $10,050) for the single shot while visiting the hotel's Devil's Place whisky bar in July. But suspicions about the spirit's provenance surfaced soon after the purchase, when whisky industry experts spotted discrepancies in the bottle's cork and label from newspaper articles. Mr Zhang was photographed with hotel manager Sandro Bernasconi after buying the dram That prompted the Waldhaus to send a sample to Dunfermline-based specialists Rare Whisky 101 (RW101) for analysis. Carbon dating tests were then carried out by researchers from the University of Oxford, which suggested a 95% probability that the spirit was created between 1970 and 1972. Further lab tests by Fife-based alcohol analysts Tatlock and Thomson indicated that it was probably a blended Scotch, comprising 60% malt and 40% grain - ruling it out as a single malt. RW101 said the tests had shown that the bottle was ""almost worthless as a collector's item"". Had the bottle been genuine, it would have carried a bar-value of about 300,000 Swiss francs (Â£227,000). The dram was poured from an unopened bottle that purported to be an 1878 Macallan Mr Zhang, who writes martial arts fantasy novels under the pen name Tang Jia San Shao, earned the equivalent of about $16.8m in 2015,according to China Daily,external. He bought the dram while on holiday with his grandmother at the Swiss hotel, which stocks 2,500 different whiskies. Waldhaus manager Sandro Bernasconi told BBC Scotland that the hotel had no idea the bottle was a fake. He said: ""My father bought the bottle of Macallan 25 years ago, when he was manager of this hotel, and it had not been opened. ""When Mr Zhang asked if he could try some, we told him it wasn't for sale. When he said he really wanted to try it, I called my father who told me we could wait another 20 years for a customer like that so we should sell it. ""Mr Zhang and I then opened the bottle together and drank some of it."" Mr Zhang wrote about his experience with the ""1878"" Macallan a few days after his visit to the Waldhaus hotel A few days after tasting the whisky, Mr Zhang posted a message on the Chinese micro-blogging platform Weibo about his experience. He wrote in Mandarin: ""When I came across a fine spirit from over 100 years ago, there wasn't much struggle inside. ""My grandma who accompanied me on this trip was only 82, yet the alcohol was 139 years old - same age as my grandma's grandma. ""To answer you all, it had a good taste. It's not just the taste, but also history."" The dram was bought from the Devil's Place whisky bar in St Moritz Mr Bernasconi broke the bad news to Mr Zhang when he flew out to China to reimburse him recently. He added: ""When I showed him the results, he was not angry - he thanked me very much for the hotel's honesty and said his experience in Switzerland had been good. ""When it comes to selling our customers some of the world's rarest and oldest whiskies, we felt it was our duty to ensure that our stock is 100% authentic and the real deal. ""That's why we called in RW101. ""The result has been a big shock to the system, and we are delighted to have repaid our customer in full as a gesture of goodwill."" RW101 co-founder David Robertson said: ""The Waldhaus team did exactly the right thing by trying to authenticate this whisky. ""We would implore that others in the market do what they can to identify any rogue bottles. ""The more intelligence we can provide, the greater the chance we have to defeat the fakers and fraudsters who seek to dupe the unsuspecting rare whisky consumer.""

"The prosecution claims Emile Cilliers wanted to kill his wife and start a new life with his lover An Army instructor accused of trying to murder his wife told police he would ""never, ever"" try to harm her, a court has heard. Former Army officer Victoria Cilliers suffered multiple injuries in 2015 when her parachute failed to open and she fell 4,000ft (1,200m). Emile Cilliers is accused of tampering with the equipment to cause her death. But in statements given to police in September last year, Mr Cilliers said he loved his wife and children. During a police interview, a transcript of which was read out at Winchester Crown Court, Mr Cilliers was asked: ""Did you try to kill your wife?"" He replied: ""No."" He was then asked: ""Did you try to kill your children?"" He again replied: ""No."" Victoria Cilliers suffered multiple injuries when her parachute failed to open The jury has already heard that Mr Cilliers had been having an affair with another woman in the months before the parachute failed during a jump over Netheravon airfield in Wiltshire. Mr Cilliers is also accused of trying to murder his wife a week before the fall by tampering with a gas fixture at their home in Amesbury. In his interview, Mr Cilliers said traces of his blood found on the fixture may have been from when he tried to fix it. He said he tried to release a nut on the pipe, but could not manage it. He denies two counts of attempted murder and one of recklessly endangering life. The trial continues.

"The actor won Oscars in 1996 and 2000 Kevin Spacey has said he is seeking treatment after facing allegations of sexual misconduct from a string of men. A representative for the actor said he ""is taking the time necessary to seek evaluation and treatment"". They did not give any information about what kind of treatment he wants. He is one of several Hollywood figures who have been accused of sexual misconduct. Dustin Hoffman has issued an apology while director Brett Ratner has been accused by six women. A lawyer for Ratner, the director of the Rush Hour films and X-Men: The Last Stand, has ""categorically"" denied all of the accusations. The allegations have been sparked by multiple women speaking out against the Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, and a subsequent campaign encouraging victims to share their stories of sexual harassment under the #metoo hashtag. So who has been accused of misconduct? New allegations have emerged from a number of men accusing Kevin Spacey of sexual misconduct. US filmmaker Tony Montana claims he was groped by the actor in a Los Angeles bar in 2003. He says he was left with PTSD for six months after Spacey ""forcefully"" grabbed his crotch. Mr Montana told Radar Online,externalthat he was in his 30s when the incident took place at the Coronet Bar in LA. It follows an allegation made by Anthony Rapp that the House of Cards actor tried to ""seduce"" him when he was 14 years old. Kevin Spacey says he has no recollection of that encounter, and was ""beyond horrified"". Netflix halts House of Cards production Incidents regarding Spacey are also alleged to have taken place in the UK while the two-time Oscar winner was the artistic director at the Old Vic in London between 2004 and 2015. Mexican actor Roberto Cavazos, who acted in several plays at the theatre, claims Spacey ""routinely preyed"" on young male actors. One mantold the BBC about his experienceof being invited to spend the weekend with Spacey in New York when he was a teenager in the 1980s. The Old Vic has set up a confidential complaints process for anyone connected to the theatre, and said on Thursday that it is ""already seeing the great benefits of the new policy of openness and the safe sharing of information"". Read more about the allegations against Kevin Spacey here. Six women have accused Hollywood filmmaker Brett Ratner of sexual harassment or misconduct. The women, including The Newsroom actress Olivia Munn, made the allegationsin the Los Angeles Times,external. Natasha Henstridge, who appeared in Species and The Whole Ten Yards, claimed she had been forced into a sex act with Ratner as a teenager. The actress, now 43, was a 19-year-old model at the time she alleges Ratner stopped her from leaving a room at his New York apartment and then made her perform a sex act on him. ""He strong-armed me in a real way,"" she told the LA Times. ""He physically forced himself onto me."" Ratner's lawyer ""categorically"" denied all of the accusations on his behalf in response to the article. Separately,Ratner has filed a libel case in Hawaii,externalagainst a woman who accused him on Facebook of rape more than 10 years ago. Ratner says he has stepped away from dealings with movie studio Warner Bros since the allegations came to light. Read more about the allegations against Brett Ratner here. Dustin Hoffman has been accused of sexually harassing an intern on the set of one of his films in 1985. Anna Graham Hunter, a writer, says that when she was 17, the Oscar-winning actor groped her and made inappropriate comments about sex to her. She told The Hollywood Reporter,external: ""He was openly flirtatious, he grabbed my ass, he talked about sex to me and in front of me."" Hoffman apologised, and said he was sorry if he ""put her in an uncomfortable situation"". In a statement to the magazine, Hoffman said: ""I have the utmost respect for women and feel terrible that anything I might have done could have put her in an uncomfortable situation. I am sorry. It is not reflective of who I am."" The BBC has contacted representatives of Dustin Hoffman for his response to these allegations. Senior editor Michael Oreskes has resigned following accusations he kissed female colleagues without their consent during business meetings. The 63-year-old was asked to step down by the National Public Radio (NPR) network in response to the allegations. He has previously worked for the Associated Press and the New York Times. Two women spoke to the Washington Post on condition of anonymity,external, and reported stories of abrupt and unexpected kisses during business meetings. They said they were worried about career development if their names were made public. One of the women said that while she met Mr Oreskes in the hope of getting a job with the New York Times, he suggested that they eat room service lunch in a hotel, before he unexpectedly kissed her and ""slipped his tongue into her mouth"". He has not commented publicly on the allegations, and journalists at NPR report that they have tried to contact him for comment, without success.

"Labour has suspended an MP after it was alleged he sexually harassed a party activist three years ago. Luton North MP Kelvin Hopkins, 76, has not commented on the claims, which were published in the Telegraph shortly after his suspension was announced. The woman involved, Ava Etemadzadeh, 27, said he had sent her inappropriate text messages and made inappropriate physical contact while hugging her. Mr Hopkins has had the whip withdrawn while an investigation takes place. A party spokesman said Labour ""takes all such complaints extremely seriously and has robust procedures in place"". Fallon: My conduct fell short Labour activist 'warned' over rape claim PM: Take sex abuse claims to police Ms Etemadzadeh told the Telegraph that she met Mr Hopkins in 2013 and invited him to speak at a Labour event at Essex University in 2014, when she was 24, after which, she told the newspaper he had hugged her too tightly and made inappropriate contact. She visited Parliament at his invitation in February 2015 but said later that month he sent a suggestive text message. Having taken advice from another Labour MP, she said she took a complaint about him to Labour's whips office in December 2015. It is understood that at the time, Mr Hopkins was spoken to about why his behaviour was inappropriate and was reprimanded by the then chief whip Dame Rosie Winterton. But he went on to be promoted, albeit briefly, to Labour's front bench in June 2016 - shortly after leader Jeremy Corbyn faced mass resignations following the EU referendum. Sources suggested Labour whips advised the leader's office not to promote him because of what happened. The leader's office say that is not the case. Ms Etmadzadeh said she was frustrated that he had been promoted but when she complained to the chief whip, she was told she could not take action while remaining anonymous. She told the BBC: ""I was shocked to learn that he got promoted afterwards. ""I'm disillusioned by the party not just not doing anything, but then promoting him afterward. They ignored it."" Mr Hopkins has been MP for Luton North since 1997 Labour MP for Luton North since 1997 Spent most of 20-year political career on backbenches Briefly promoted to front bench from July to October 2016 Long history of involvement with trade union movement One of 36 MPs to nominate Jeremy Corbyn for his 2015 leadership bid One of the few Labour MPs to campaign for Leave in the EU referendum Married to Patricia. The couple have two grown up children The BBC has been told that Ms Etmadzadeh had a meeting with the chief whip on Thursday. There has not yet been any comment from Mr Hopkins - who is married and has been Luton North MP for 20 years - despite repeated attempts to contact him. Labour MP Jess Phillips told BBC Radio 4's Today programme Mr Hopkins should probably not have been promoted. But she added: ""I don't think that it was sort of political expediency; I think that people just didn't take it as seriously as it needed to be taken."" Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn declined to answer questions from reporters about Mr Hopkins's promotion on Friday morning. The suspension comes amid various claims of sexual harassment and improper behaviour in Parliament. Sir Michael Fallon quit as defence secretary on Wednesday night, saying his conduct may have ""fallen short"" of the standards expected by the UK military. In another incident, Labour confirmed it had launched an independent inquiry into claims that activist Bex Bailey, 25, was discouraged by a party official from reporting an alleged rape at a Labour event in 2011. Party leaders have vowed to tackle discipline and grievance procedures. In a letter to Commons Speaker John Bercow,Theresa May said disciplinary procedures needed to be reformed.

"This video can not be played New Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson arrives at the MoD Chief Whip Gavin Williamson has been appointed as the new defence secretary after Sir Michael Fallon's resignation. Sir Michael quit on Wednesday saying his past behaviour may have ""fallen short"" of the standards expected by the UK military. He became the first politician to quit following recently revealed claims of sexual harassment in Parliament. South Staffordshire MP Mr Williamson, 41, said he was ""both honoured and excited"" by the promotion. He has been replaced as chief whip by his former deputy, Julian Smith, who will now be in charge of enforcing party discipline in the Commons. Mr Smith's deputy will be Tatton MP - and former GMTV presenter - Esther McVey. Laura Kuenssberg: Appointment is no 'safety first' move Fallon: My conduct 'fell short' and I quit A profile of Sir Michael Fallon 'Politician put his hand on my thigh' In a statement, Mr Williamson said he was ""determined to ensure that the armed forces receive the recognition they deserve for the great work they do, including through the Armed Forces Covenant, and that they evolve both to meet the changing threats that we face and to ensure that they properly represent the modern society that they defend"". He told reporters it was an ""immense privilege"" to be able to work with Britain's armed forces. He said his priority would be to continue to focus on ""countering"" Daesh, or so-called Islamic State, and ""making sure national security is at the forefront of everything we do"". BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said that while Mr Williamson was seen as an effective operator some Conservatives were furious that an MP with no ministerial experience had been promoted to the cabinet. One senior Conservative told her: ""MPs are deeply unhappy he has used the position of chief whip to benefit himself and has deserted his post at such a crucial time"". Asked about claims he lacks ministerial experience, Mr Williamson said: ""I've been a minister as chief whip, but it was a little bit quieter when you're chief whip, not so much publicity."" This video can not be played Some MPs 'furious' at Gavin Williamson appointment One Tory MP, Sarah Wollaston, told BBC Radio 4's World at One that Penny Mordaunt and Tobias Ellwood had been possible alternatives adding: ""These are decisions that are made through patronage. Part of the role of the chief whip is to advise the prime minister about the suitability of the candidate."" But Conservative MP Bob Stewart - a former Army colonel - described Mr Williamson as a ""decent, calm man... he's also a very thoughtful man"". ""He won't know much about defence but I believe the civil service in the Ministry of Defence, the generals and the Armed Forces themselves won't mind that too much because he's the sort of person that will listen carefully, take advice but then make his own decision."" BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale Gavin Williamson has no military background and has never been a secretary of state. But he is youthful, a rising star and trusted by Number 10. He arrives at the Ministry of Defence at a difficult time. His first challenge will be to try to stave off more defence cuts. The Cabinet Office is currently carrying out a defence and security review which is due to report by the end of the year. All three services have been asked to put forward options for cuts. Although there has been a modest rise in the MoD's budget, it has still got to make more than Â£20bn of efficiency savings. There's also pressure to fund an increase in pay for the armed forces. They've been  struggling with both recruitment and retention. That also hasn't been helped by a political reluctance to put troops in harm's way - something they train for. There is still unfinished business against so-called Islamic State and Gavin Williamson will be the man who now oversees the RAF airstrikes. Few inside the military or the MoD will know much about him - even fewer on the international stage. The prime minister's official spokesman said Mr Williamson was not involved in reshuffle discussions, and said he was ""an excellent and hard-working chief whip and the prime minister thinks he will make an excellent defence secretary"". ""The PM is confident in the operation of the whips' office during her premiership."" In his resignation letter, Sir Michael Fallon said a number of allegations that had surfaced about MPs, including himself, had been false, but added: ""I accept that in the past I have fallen below the high standards that we require of the Armed Forces that I have the honour to represent."" Who is Gavin Williamson? Gavin Williamson keeps a tarantula - not this one - on his desk 41 years old Married with two children Born near Scarborough Ran a Staffordshire pottery business before entering Parliament MP South Staffordshire since 2010 and was Parliamentary aide to ex-PM David Cameron Chief whip - in charge of party discipline - since July 2016 Keeps a pet tarantula called Cronus on his desk at Westminster Also a patron of the World Owl Trust and has built a house for hedgehogs in his garden Read a full profile of Gavin Williamson Recap: Reaction to announcement Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said Sir Michael had a record to be proud of as defence secretary. ""I've known Michael for many years,"" he said. ""He has been a great colleague and a great defence secretary."" Asked by the BBC if his own behaviour had always been of a standard expected of cabinet ministers, Mr Johnson replied: ""You bet.""

"This video can not be played In Barcelona's central square, the crowd sings Freedom for Catalonia Eight sacked Catalan ministers have been remanded in custody by a Spanish high court judge over the region's push for independence. Prosecutors had asked the judge to detain eight of the nine former regional government members who turned up for questioning in Madrid. They are accused of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds. Prosecutors are also seeking a European Arrest Warrant for ousted Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont. The request also covers four other dismissed Catalan ministers who did not show up in court in Madrid as requested, but have been in Belgium since Monday. Catalonia sings for its exiled leaders Catalonia crisis in 300 words What next for Spain? Spain has been gripped by a constitutional crisis since a referendum on independence from Spain was held in Catalonia on 1 October in defiance of a constitutional court ruling that had declared it illegal. Last week, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy imposed direct rule on Catalonia, dissolving the regional parliament and calling local elections for 21 December. This came after Catalan lawmakers voted to declare the independence of the affluent north-eastern region. The Catalan government said that of the 43% of potential voters who took part in the referendum, 90% were in favour of independence. Seven of the eight ex-ministers were pictured turning up to court together Those detained are: Former Deputy Vice President Oriol Junqueras Former Interior Minister Joaquim Forn Former Foreign Affairs Minister RaÃ¼l Romeva Former Justice Minister Carles MundÃ³ Former Labour Minister Dolors Bassa Former Government Presidency Councillor Jordi Turull Former Sustainable Development Minister Josep Rull Former Culture Minister Meritxell Borras A ninth official, ex-Business Minister Santi Vila, was granted bail at the request of prosecutors. He resigned before the Catalan parliament voted for independence last Friday. Catalan political parties and civic groups condemned the judicial move, while thousands of people gathered outside the Catalan regional parliament in Barcelona, demanding that they be freed. In a statement broadcast on Catalan TV from an undisclosed location in Belgium, Mr Puigdemont described the detention of the eight ex-ministers as ""an act that breaks with the basic principles of democracy"". He added: ""I demand the release of the ministers and the vice-president."" Five other senior members of the Catalan parliament, as well as Speaker Carme Forcadell, are facing the same charges but, because of their parliamentary immunity, their cases are being handled by the Supreme Court. Their hearings have been postponed until 9 November. Carles Puigdemont was pictured in a Belgian cafe Mr Puigdemont, who was spotted in a Brussels cafe on Thursday, has said he will not return to Spain unless he and four of his fellow sacked colleagues receive guarantees of a fair trial. He did not specify his exact demands. Belgium's federal prosecutor has said the law will be applied once an arrest warrant is received, according to Efe news agency. Mr Puigdemont's lawyer said the climate was ""not good"" for him to appear in court, but he also said his client would co-operate with the authorities in Spain and Belgium. The man who wants to break up Spain In addition to Mr Puigdemont, prosecutors have asked Spain's high court judge to issue European arrest warrants for the following Catalan officials: Meritxell Serret, former agriculture minister Antoni ComÃ­n, former health minister LluÃ­s Puig, former culture minister Clara PonsatÃ­, former education minister If Spain's high court judge issues a warrant, a European Arrest Warrant (EAW) will be sent to Belgian prosecutors, who have 24 hours to decide whether the paperwork is correct. If they do, they then have 15 days to arrest Mr Puigdemont and the four others. If one or all of them appeals against it, that process could last another 15 days. Belgium has a maximum of 60 days to return the suspects to Spain after arrest. But if the suspects do not raise legal objections, a transfer could happen within a few days. A country can reject an EU arrest warrant if it fears that extradition would violate the suspect's human rights. Discrimination based on politics, religion or race is grounds for refusal. So are fears that the suspect would not get a fair trial. There is an agreedEU list of 32 offences,external- in Article Two of the EAW law - for which there is no requirement for the offence to be a crime in both countries. In other words, any of those offences can be a justification for extradition, provided the penalty is at least three years in jail. However, neither ""sedition"" nor ""rebellion"" - two of the Spanish accusations against the Catalan leaders - are on that list. Mr Puigdemont's handling of the crisis has drawn criticism among some other Catalan politicians, with left-wing parliamentary deputy Joan Josep Nuet criticising him for creating ""yet more bewilderment"". Spain's central bank warned on Thursday,externalof the ""significant risks and economic costs"" resulting from the crisis, and that Catalonia's economy could fall into recession. Early numbers suggest that the vital tourism sector of the region has already been affected by the ongoing uncertainty.

"Nguyen met Prince Charles when he visited survivors A serial conman has admitted pretending his family died in the Grenfell Tower fire to obtain about Â£12,500 from funds meant for victims. Anh Nhu Nguyen claimed his wife and son were killed in the blaze. He posed as a victim of the disaster for almost two weeks and was given the money by charities and Kensington and Chelsea Council. The 52-year-old, of Beckenham, south-east London, pleaded guilty at Southwark Crown Court on Thursday. The blaze on 14 June claimed the lives of at least 80 people He admitted two counts of fraud by false representation and one count of making an untrue statement for the purpose of obtaining a passport. Nguyen posed as a victim of the fire and shook the Prince of Wales' hand when he visited a relief centre set up in the wake of the disaster. He claimed the fire had destroyed ""everything"" he owned, and that he was so upset about having lost his wife and son that he could not eat or concentrate. Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? What happened to the people on the 21st floor? Inquiry 'can and will provide answers' Nguyen was given a hotel room, clothing, food, electrical items and money after posing as one of the survivors. He was discovered to be a fake when he gave several different flat numbers, some of which did not exist and one where a real victim lived. Nguyen showed no emotion as he entered his pleas through a translator. He will be sentenced on 15 December. Nguyen met the Prince of Wales at a relief centre set up in the wake of the disaster Nguyen was born in Vietnam, and has been in the UK since the 1980s. He is a British citizen and has 17 aliases. He has 28 previous convictions for 56 offences spanning more than 30 years, including theft, arson and grievous bodily harm. Kate Mulholland from the Crown Prosecution Service said: ""Nguyen's deceit in the aftermath of such a catastrophic loss of life was breathtaking. ""He was willing to lie again and again, adapting his story when it was questioned, in order to profit from the huge aid efforts and outpouring of sympathy for true victims."" Elizabeth Campbell, leader of Kensington and Chelsea Council, said: ""It is disgraceful.

"Strictly Come Dancing is one of the top UK shows of the year Favourite British TV shows like Strictly Come Dancing and Broadchurch could be under threat due to a funding shortfall, the BBC is warning. The rise of services like Netflix and Amazon could mean British content faces ""an uncertain future"", director general Tony Hall will say in a speech later. There could be a funding shortfall of Â£500m over the next 10 years, according to new research. Lord Hall is to call for a ""new golden age for British production"". ""The BBC has always shown a great ability to adapt to new challenges and make them opportunities,"" he will say. Speaking in Liverpool,  he will say if there is an immediate response to the issue, then the future of British content could be protected. He calls the figures on funding, from consultants Mediatique and published by the BBC, ""worrying"". ""We have to face the reality that the British content we value and rely upon is under serious threat."" Lord Hall will add that global services like Netflix, Amazon and Apple are not likely to make up the funding shortfall. Lord Hall is to say the BBC should remain a 'bastion of brilliant British content' ""The reality is that their investment decisions are likely to focus increasingly on a narrow range of very expensive, very high-end content - big bankers that they can rely on to have international appeal and attract large, global audiences. ""Even the most generous calculations suggest they are barely likely to make up half of the Â£500m British content gap over the decade ahead. And a more realistic forecast points to substantially less."" The top five shows in the UK this year so far have all been British - the One Love Manchester concert, Broadchurch, Britain's Got Talent, Sherlock and Strictly. Lord Hall will say that the BBC ""should remain a guardian of UK production"", and a ""bastion of brilliant British content"". ""But to achieve this, we have to recognise that the environment around the BBC has changed dramatically, and we must change in response,"" he will say. ""In the UK we often think of the BBC as a big player, but today the media market is truly global. ""And in that vast solar system, we are tiny compared to the huge gas giants of the US. And every day they're getting bigger."" While about 83% of independent production companies in the UK were British or European-owned 10 years ago, today that figure is less than 40% - the rest are owned by US multinationals.

Debt charities have been warning of the impact the rate rise could have on struggling families.

Here's what current Fed chair Janet Yellenhas to say about the nominee to take over from her,external: ""I congratulate my colleague Jay Powell on his nomination to be Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. ""Jay's long and distinguished career has been marked by dedicated public service and seriousness of purpose. ""I am confident in his deep commitment to carrying out the vital public mission of the Federal Reserve. ""I am committed to working with him to ensure a smooth transition."" Wall Street traders have reacted positively to the nomination of continuity candidate Jerome Powell as the new Fed chair - but not by much. The Dow Jones is up 0.28% ate 23,500, the S&P 500 has climbed into positive territory after lagging, as has the Nasdaq. Mr Powell was appointed to the Fed board in 2012 by then-President
Barack Obama. He emerged as Mr Trump's choice from five possible nominees that included current chair Janet Yellen as well as others who
would have represented a sharp change in monetary policy. ""He has proved to be a consensus builder for the sound
monetary and financial policy that he believes in ... based on
his record I am confident that Jay has the wisdom and leadership
to guide our economy,"" Mr Trump said. Mr Powell, a 64-year-old lawyer and former investment banker,
has backed Ms Yellen's general direction on monetary policy and, in
recent years, shared her concerns that weak inflation justified
a continued cautious approach to raising interest
rates. Donald Trump'd decision on Jerome Powell as Fed chair needs to be confirmed by the US senate. Mr Trump is the first president in more than forty years to fail to reappoint a Federal Reserve chair brought in by his predecessor. Janet Yellen's term in office expires in February. Mr Trump said she was a wonderful woman who had done a terrific job. US President Donald Trump has been very praiseworthy of his Fed chair nominee Jay Powell. ""He's strong, he's committed, he's smart,"" Mr Trump said. ""There are few more important positions than this, believe me, in our government."" ""Jay has earned the respect and admiration of his colleagues,"" Mr Trump adds. Mr Powell said he ""is both honoured and humbled"" and then thanked his wife. US President Donald Trump has nominated Fed insider Jerome Powell as next chair of the Federal Reserve. Goldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd Blankfein has said would
not be ""one bit disappointed"" if President Donald Trump
nominated Jerome Powell as the new Federal Reserve chair. ""His background is a terrific background - again a lot of
government service, service in the Fed, service in the private
sector,"" Mr Blankfein told Bloomberg TV. ""I think he is a very great, credible
candidate. There were other credible candidates as well but I am
not one bit disappointed if it turns out to be J. Powell."" The nomination of Jay Powell as Federal
Reserve chair is expected to be confirmed by Donald Trump later today. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says this is seen as ""a
continuity choice"" because Mr Powell has been a member of theFederal Open Market Committee,externalsince 2012 ""and he
has always voted alongside Yellen."" ""However, we should not get too complacent, as the
chair position is not the only one up for grabs at the Fed,"" Ms Brooks says. ""There is still a
vice chair that needs to be filled along with four other Fed seats, so Mr Trump
and the Republicans could yet shake up the Fed. ""If Mr Trump decides to announce John Taylor as the vice chair then we could see
expectations about the future direction of the Fed shift sharply. ""Based on his
âTaylor ruleâ interest rates should be much higher so Mr Taylorâs addition to the
Fed would be a seen as a major changing of the guard even if he is only
vice-chair."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies.

"Scientists who have been puzzling for years over the genetic ""peculiarity"" of a tiny population of orangutans in Sumatra have finally concluded that they are a new species to science. The apes in question were only reported to exist after an expedition into the remote mountain forests there in 1997. Since then, a research project has unpicked their biological secret. The species has been named the Tapanuli orangutan - a third species in addition to the Bornean and Sumatran. Researchers have studied these great apes in detail for 20 years It is the first new great ape to be described for almost a century. Publishing their workin the journal Current Biology,external, the team - including researchers from the University of Zurich, Liverpool John Moores University and theSumatran Orangutan Conservation Programme,external- pointed out that there are only 800 individuals remaining, making this one of the world's most threatened ape species. Early on in their study, researchers took DNA from the orangutans, which showed them to be ""peculiar"" compared to other orangutans in Sumatra. So the scientists embarked on a painstaking investigation - reconstructing the animals' evolutionary history through their genetic code. One of the lead researchers, Prof Michael KrÃ¼tzen from the University of Zurich, Switzerland, explained to BBC News: ""The genomic analysis really allows us to look in detail at the history. ""We can probe deep back in time and ask, 'when did these populations split off?'."" The analysis of a total 37 complete orangutan genomes  - the code for the biological make-up of each animal - has now shown that these apes separated from their Bornean relatives less than 700,000 years ago - a snip in evolutionary time. The Tapanuli orangutan has distinguishing anatomical features - revealed by a close examination of its skull For his part in the study, Prof Serge Wich, from Liverpool John Moores University, focused on the orangutans' signature calls - loud sounds the male apes make to announce their presence. ""Those calls can carry a kilometre through the forest,"" Prof Wich explained. ""If you look at these calls, you can tease them apart, and we found some subtle differences between these and other populations."" The final piece of the puzzle, though, was very subtle but consistent differences in the shape of the Sumatran, Bornean and Tapanuli orangutan skulls. Prof Wich told BBC News that the decades of collaborative genetic, anatomical and acoustic studies had achieved an ""amazing breakthrough"". ""There are only seven great ape species - not including us,"" he said. ""So adding one to that very small list is spectacular. ""It's something I think many biologists dream of."" But this newly described great ape will be added to the list of Critically Endangered species, just as it is added to the zoological textbooks. ""It's very worrying,"" said Prof Wich, ""to discover something new and then immediately also realise that we have to focus all of our efforts before we lose it.""

Here's what current Fed chair Janet Yellenhas to say about the nominee to take over from her,external: ""I congratulate my colleague Jay Powell on his nomination to be Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. ""Jay's long and distinguished career has been marked by dedicated public service and seriousness of purpose. ""I am confident in his deep commitment to carrying out the vital public mission of the Federal Reserve. ""I am committed to working with him to ensure a smooth transition."" Wall Street traders have reacted positively to the nomination of continuity candidate Jerome Powell as the new Fed chair - but not by much. The Dow Jones is up 0.28% ate 23,500, the S&P 500 has climbed into positive territory after lagging, as has the Nasdaq. Mr Powell was appointed to the Fed board in 2012 by then-President
Barack Obama. He emerged as Mr Trump's choice from five possible nominees that included current chair Janet Yellen as well as others who
would have represented a sharp change in monetary policy. ""He has proved to be a consensus builder for the sound
monetary and financial policy that he believes in ... based on
his record I am confident that Jay has the wisdom and leadership
to guide our economy,"" Mr Trump said. Mr Powell, a 64-year-old lawyer and former investment banker,
has backed Ms Yellen's general direction on monetary policy and, in
recent years, shared her concerns that weak inflation justified
a continued cautious approach to raising interest
rates. Donald Trump'd decision on Jerome Powell as Fed chair needs to be confirmed by the US senate. Mr Trump is the first president in more than forty years to fail to reappoint a Federal Reserve chair brought in by his predecessor. Janet Yellen's term in office expires in February. Mr Trump said she was a wonderful woman who had done a terrific job. US President Donald Trump has been very praiseworthy of his Fed chair nominee Jay Powell. ""He's strong, he's committed, he's smart,"" Mr Trump said. ""There are few more important positions than this, believe me, in our government."" ""Jay has earned the respect and admiration of his colleagues,"" Mr Trump adds. Mr Powell said he ""is both honoured and humbled"" and then thanked his wife. US President Donald Trump has nominated Fed insider Jerome Powell as next chair of the Federal Reserve. Goldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd Blankfein has said would
not be ""one bit disappointed"" if President Donald Trump
nominated Jerome Powell as the new Federal Reserve chair. ""His background is a terrific background - again a lot of
government service, service in the Fed, service in the private
sector,"" Mr Blankfein told Bloomberg TV. ""I think he is a very great, credible
candidate. There were other credible candidates as well but I am
not one bit disappointed if it turns out to be J. Powell."" The nomination of Jay Powell as Federal
Reserve chair is expected to be confirmed by Donald Trump later today. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says this is seen as ""a
continuity choice"" because Mr Powell has been a member of theFederal Open Market Committee,externalsince 2012 ""and he
has always voted alongside Yellen."" ""However, we should not get too complacent, as the
chair position is not the only one up for grabs at the Fed,"" Ms Brooks says. ""There is still a
vice chair that needs to be filled along with four other Fed seats, so Mr Trump
and the Republicans could yet shake up the Fed. ""If Mr Trump decides to announce John Taylor as the vice chair then we could see
expectations about the future direction of the Fed shift sharply. ""Based on his
âTaylor ruleâ interest rates should be much higher so Mr Taylorâs addition to the

Away from UK rates, US president Donald Trump's tax reform plans have reached a milestone as Republicans unveiled long-awaited legislation to overhaul the tax code. The bill called for slashing the corporate tax rate to 20% from 35%. Tax rates on individuals and families will go down to four brackets from seven: 12%, 25%, 35% and a top rate of 39.6%. The fall in the pound helped push up shares in the
multinationals on the FTSE, which closed up 0.9% at at 7,555.32 points. Laith Khalaf of Hargreaves Lansdown says: ""In theory an interest rate rise should be positive for
the pound and the banking sector, and negative for gilts and the FTSE 100. ""Today the pound fell, as did Lloyds and RBS shares,
while gilts and the broader Footsie rallied, turning the investment textbook on
its head. ""This is largely
because markets wanted more than a rate rise from the Bank of England today,
and were pricing in a more hawkish stance on the future path of monetary
policy. ""As things now stand, it looks like weâre only going to
get two rate rises in the next three years."" The pound has been on a downward trajectory against the dollar since the interest rate announcement, and has now slipped about 1.5%. Analysts have been saying the Bank has been ""dovish"" - that is, cautious - in its outlook for further rate rises, and investors were expecting a more ""hawkish"" stance. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Savers with the Nationwide, the TSB, the Skipton and the Yorkshire Building Society will be among the first to benefit from the rise in base rates. The Yorkshire said all savers on variable rate accounts would receive the full increase of 0.25%. The same will apply to the Yorkshire's two other building societies, the Chelsea and Norwich & Peterborough. The Nationwide has already promised to increase rates by 0.25% for all those who received a cut in August 2016. Savers with TSB will see an increase of 0.15%. The bank said it was not passing on the full increase, as it had previously protected savers from the full 0.25% base rate cut in 2016. The Skipton said savings rates would rise by the full 0.25% from 5 December. Savers in the building society's cash Lifetime Isa will see the rate go up from 0.5% to 0.75% on the same date. First interest rate rise in 10 years What will the rate rise mean for you? Are more interest rate rises ahead? Mike Regnier, chief executive at Yorkshire Building Society, said: ""It has been a tough few years for savers, so we're delighted to be able to pass on the full bank rate increase."" HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and Barclays said they were reviewing their savings rates. Earlier Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, said he expected all providers to increase returns for savers after the Bank's Base Rate was increased from 0.25% to 0.5%. ""We do expect it to be passed on,"" he told reporters. ""Banks did pass on the cuts to their depositors, and we expect competition to push it in the other direction. Obviously we will watch it closely."" Borrowers with the Yorkshire Building Society will likewise see an increase in their standard variable rate (SVR) mortgages of 0.25% to 4.99%. The Skipton has promised not to raise variable rate mortgages SVR mortgage holders with the TSB and the Nationwide will also see a 0.25% rise. Most of those on tracker rates will see an immediate and automatic rise. HSBC said such borrowers would face higher borrowing costs from Friday. Lloyds Banking Group - which includes the Halifax and Bank of Scotland - said tracker rates would rise on 1 December. RBS - which includes NatWest - and Barclays also confirmed that tracker rates would go up, but neither have specified a date. Most lenders are expected to announce rises in variable rate mortgages over the next few weeks. However the Skipton Building Society said it had no plans to increase costs on its variable rate products.

"He's the Tory enforcer who kept a tarantula on his desk and joked about using a ""sharpened carrot"" to get his way. Now Gavin Williamson has been propelled into his first cabinet role in the wake of Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon's sudden resignation. So what more do we know about a politician seen as rising star but whose rapid elevation has apparently upset some of his colleagues? Williamson named defence secretary Live updates and reaction Theresa May's chief whip, first elected to Parliament in 2010, wasn't among the bookmakers' favourites for the Ministry of Defence vacancy. The South Staffordshire MP has no military background and had little opportunity to build up a public profile because his role in the whips office meant he did not speak in Parliament. Raised near Scarborough by Labour-supporting parents, he ran a Staffordshire pottery firm, making and selling ceramic tableware, before becoming an MP. After entering Parliament, Mr Williamson was given a role in the Northern Ireland Office in 2011, and then became David Cameron's backbench aide. He was appointed a CBE in the ex-PM's controversial resignation honours list,telling the Stourbridge News he was,external""extremely honoured and humbled"" at the award. And he didn't fall out of favour as Theresa May took over in July 2016 - ""literally walking out with one prime minister and in with the next"" in the words of friend and fellow Tory MP James Wharton. Date of birth:25 June 1976 (aged 41) Job:MP for South Staffordshire, since 2010. Chief whip from June 2016, now defence secretary Education:Went to to Raincliffe Comprehensive School and Scarborough Sixth Form College; studied social sciences at the University of Bradford Family:Married with two children. His father worked at the local council, his mother at a job centre. Both were Labour voters Honours:Awarded a CBE in 2016 in David Cameron's resignation honours for political and public service After a disappointing general election for the Conservatives, he played a key role in brokering the Â£1bn deal with the DUP to prop up their minority government. But until now, that tarantula might have been the most commonly-cited fact about the 41-year-old - whose successor as chief whip tweeted a picture of his desk on taking over. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played ""Marie"" says her counsellors offered to bath her The ineffective regulation of those practising talking therapies - such as counselling and psychotherapy - is leaving patients at risk of harm, the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme has been told. For two sexual abuse victims, painful memories were brought back to the surface. Sitting in a room with three female counsellors, ""Marie"" hoped her counselling would help her deal with at least some of the emotional pain caused by the sexual abuse she had endured from the age of nine to 18. They had begun by saying ""all the right things"", she explains. But looking back on the session now, she feels like she had been in a ""place of terror"". The main practitioner sat so close, she says, that she was able to feel their breath - reigniting memories of past sexual assaults. ""It was very intimidating, my space being invaded,"" says Marie. When she repeatedly sat with her legs crossed, contrary to the therapist's orders, she says the counsellor ""actually got hold of me, holding my arms, looking in my eyes"". ""I was getting very, very distressed, and feeling very sick, very ill, shaking. ""It's at that point they actually brought a sick bowl in because I was so distressed and traumatised."" The therapists later asked her if she wanted to be given a bath by all three of them, ""as a way of showing nurturing towards me"", she says. The government has recently begun a consultation into the regulation of healthcare professionals, calling for an improved system ""to protect patients"". ""While the healthcare regulators are generally effective in protecting the public from serious harm,"" the Department of Health says in the foreword, ""there has been criticism, not least from the regulators themselves, that the system is slow, expensive, complicated, reactive, overly adversarial and confusing for patients, professionals and employers."" The main therapist was suspended following a hearing after Marie made complaints against her. Some psychotherapists continue practising after they have been struck off, campaign group Safe Spaces says But after an appeal process - which Marie was not allowed to attend - this was withdrawn, and she was allowed to continue to practise. ""It's appalling, it's disgraceful,"" she says. ""They've caused me so much harm and yet the sanctions they give - it's like a slap on the wrist. ""Most therapists are ethical, but the ones that aren't - there's no deterrent."" In a 2016 report, campaign group Unsafe Spaces said""at least one in four"" of those struck off appeared to still be practising,external. As a child, Kate was sexually, physically and emotionally abused. She sought professional help through the NHS years later as an adult, each week meeting a psychotherapist who knew she had a long history of mental health problems because of her traumatic childhood. Yet she says he too sexually abused her. ""The person who was supposed to help me recover did no more than perpetuate the abuse."" In 2010 he pressured her into having sex with him, she says, which continued for three months. ""I was terrified but I didn't have the strength to stop it. It took me back to the abuse I had suffered as a child. ""I thought he cared about me but all he wanted me for was sex."" When Kate finally found the strength to report him, he was immediately suspended by the NHS Trust and sacked for gross professional misconduct. Kate was paid damages. Two years later she decided to go to the police, who investigated. But prosecutors decided not to take the case to court, leaving Kate devastated. ""Victims of sexual abuse in childhood who suffer severe mental health problems in adult life should be able to receive treatment from NHS services without being abused again. The law is in place and should be used,"" she says. Kate says that after her psychotherapist was sacked, he was still able to work privately. Gary Fereday, chief executive of the British Psychoanalytic Council, says the current regulatory system ""allows unscrupulous people to claim they're psychotherapists"". ""If they've been struck off from one register they can simply register with another body, or call themselves something different, and continue to practise."" The Department of Health said it had created ""a comprehensive public record of accredited professionals, overseen by the independent Professional Standards Authority."" Marie now wants to make sure no-one else has to go through what she did. ""I think it would break most people. And they've been broken once - that's why they're going into therapy.""

"The new defence secretary is welcomed to the MoD Here's the theory. Gavin Williamson is a smart operator, a talented politician, who has proved himself loyal to Theresa May by running her leadership campaign and then getting through the nightmare of holding the Tories together with no majority, so far. This very fragile government has not lost a vote on its own business. Theresa May's programme has been much curtailed by the political reality. But she has not, so far, been humiliated in Parliament in the way that, the morning after the election, it seemed quite feasible that she would be. Williamson is named defence secretary Profile: Who is Gavin Williamson? Fallon resigns saying conduct 'fell short' The restive right have been held back from making significant attacks. And ardent Remainers have been handled carefully enough not to blow up (so far). That is a kind of achievement, and it is in large part down to the capabilities of Gavin Williamson. So why not reward him? Secondly, the prime minister also wants to promote the next generation in the Tory party, to give the impression they aren't simply a busted flush. Promoting one of their number is a move in that direction. And Williamson is not from the Tory Home Counties either. And beyond keeping a tarantula as a pet - pictured here by his successor... ...and suggesting that he is a fan of the ""sharpened carrot"", rather than the stick, there is not much that Gavin Williamson has said or done in his previous political career that is in the public domain that means any embarrassments or problems will be hung around his neck in his new job. (So far at least). For all those reasons therefore, it is good logic to allocate the former chief whip, Yorkshireman and Staffordshire MP this hefty promotion. Sources within the MoD say it's a good appointment because he is regarded as a very good politician who has shown that ""he can get things done"". Here's the other theory though - the decision isn't smart, it's hugely risky. Problem one, Gavin Williamson has never worked in a government department, he's never been a minister before. Undoubtedly clever, but moving him into such a huge government job straight away is a gamble. As the Tory MP Sarah Wollaston suggested in a gently cutting way, ""there are times when offered a job that it would be better to advise that another would be more experienced and suited to the role"". This video can not be played Some MPs 'furious' at Gavin Williamson appointment A former government insider who knows him well suggested the move shows Number 10's judgement is ""whacko"". Second, when all the political parties are in the grip of allegations of sexual misdemeanours and trying to keep a lid on - shall we say - personnel issues, is it really a good time to be moving the man who is charge of party discipline? And third, while promotions are always going to make some people unhappy, some Tory MPs are furious, believing that Mr Williamson manoeuvred himself into the job, playing on the prime minister's vulnerability. One minister told me it was ""appalling"": ""She is so weak she has let Gavin Williamson appoint himself"". Another MP said: ""She is too weak and overwhelmed to spot his scheming"". A senior Tory said: ""MPs are deeply unhappy he has used the position of chief whip to benefit himself and has deserted his post at such a crucial time"". There is no shortage of critics of the appointment, a former minister told me it was ""outrageous - we are in the grip of a bunch of boys, when we need serious big beasts leading us. Defence needs someone who is able to fill at least one of Fallon's shoes"". Ouch. And while Mr Williamson would deny or laugh off any suggestion that he has leadership ambition, others in the Tory party see this move (perhaps inevitably) as part of his attempt to build a bigger power base for a run at the leadership after Theresa May. Gavin Underwood doesn't have quite the same ring as Frank, but jokes and conspiracy theories are already doing the rounds about his secret plans for world domination, tracing the fictional footsteps of the main character in the American version of House of Cards. (Take with at least a sprinkle, if not a large pinch of salt.) Despite all the talk of Gavin Williamson's loyalty, this is not a safety first announcement. The prime minister could have moved other ministers from the Ministry of Defence upwards. But for all the calculations today about whether it is a smart move or something she will come to regret, it is time to see what the new defence secretary is made of. He has learnt as chief whip that being effective is not the same as being popular. That may well come in handy. And here's the irony, the man who was meant to make sure that Tory MPs behaved themselves has found himself a rather good new job - because one of them did not.

" Had things turned out differently, the quiet man shivering beside me in London’s autumn chill could have been the King of Burma, a head of state for more than 50 million people. A neat black moustache is the only thing about U Soe Win that might hint at royal lineage. I’ve spent years in Myanmar, the country once known as Burma, and have met only a handful of men capable of growing one, though portraits of Soe Win’s ancestors suggest that a noble set of whiskers was a key part of the king’s job spec. Moustache aside, my 70-year-old friend has spent his whole life blending into the background and keeping a low profile. Burma’s ruling generals didn’t want royal competition, so for three decades he worked quietly in the diplomatic service - one official among many, representing a country that was for much of that time an international pariah. As we stand on the street waiting for John Clarke, curator of South-East Asia at the Victoria & Albert Museum, Soe Win shifts his weight from one blue-looking sandaled foot to another, taking care to keep his traditionallongyiout of icy puddles. “I can see why you British came to Burma,” he says. He chuckles. We agree that shoes might be sensible for the rest of his visit. Over the three years I’ve known him, I’ve grown deeply fond of this unassuming man, 40 years my senior, whose eyes perpetually twinkle with humour. Our goal at the museum is to see valuable artefacts that once belonged to Soe Win’s family - and, some might argue, rightfully still do. But we are also on a treasure hunt for a ruby, a very big ruby. King Thibaw As Clarke whisks us through galleries and down corridors, he explains how for many years the V&A was home to the most extensive collection of Burmese art in the world - the Mandalay Regalia. Some 167 gold and gem-studded items ranging from weaponry, to cutlery, to footwear, were seized from the last king - Soe Win’s great-grandfather - when he was sent into exile by the British in 1885. In 1964, however, they were given back to Burma’s strongman ruler General Ne Win as a gesture of goodwill. All except one piece, which the general returned to the museum as a gift - a gold and bejewelledhintha, a chubby, mystical goose-like creature with a sardonic expression. Could this, I wonder, have been a typically Burmese ironic jab at the former colonial master? John Clarke shows Soe Win the V&A's Burmese artefacts Eventually, Soe Win asks the question. What happened to his great-grandfather’s jewel - the Nga Mauk ruby? A precious stone the size of a duck egg or betel nut, famously said to be “worth a kingdom” in its own right. A stone that glowed red, according to those who saw it, cured various ailments and bestowed great fortune on the owner? Had it been noticed at some point? “The Nga Mauk is not, nor ever has been, here I’m afraid,” Clarke replies. “I think the most likely thing is it may be somewhere like the Royal Collection. I think that’s possible, because I seem to remember a reference to it being given to Queen Victoria.” When I first met Soe Win back in 2014, in his little house by Yangon’s circular commuter railway, he told me he’d never go to London. Already long retired, he’d spent his diplomatic career worrying that he might be posted to live among the people who had exiled his great-grandfather, ruined his family and occupied his country. It’s a chapter of colonial history that few in the UK know the first thing about. In November 1885 10,000 soldiers were sent to topple Burma’s king from his throne in Mandalay Palace. The invasion was the culmination of six decades of tension and sporadic conflict between the British and the Burmese, caused among other things by the refusal of British dignitaries to remove their shoes in the presence of the Burmese monarch. King Thibaw and Queen Supayalat But the main consideration was commerce. In the eyes of the British government and the merchants of the great imperial cities, King Thibaw was an unpredictable obstacle to British trade with China. There was also a risk that he would open a back door to the French, who were expanding their own imperial territories west from Indo-China - worryingly close to India, the jewel in Britain’s crown. Thibaw had to go. The Third Anglo-Burmese War, as it’s known, was a hopelessly one-sided affair. In just two weeks, Thibaw was surrounded in his palace, and surrendered to Queen Victoria’s generals. On 29 November 1885, Thibaw, his heavily pregnant queen, Supayalat, and his two daughters were loaded on to bullock carts and escorted under armed guard to a ship that would take them thousands of miles to a small fishing town on the farthest shores of India. For the king it would be a permanent exile – he died 30 years later, and his body remains buried in a crumbling tomb in a run-down corner of Ratnagiri. All of which explains why Soe Win had dreaded being posted to London. But now he’s here of his own free will, on the trail of his great-grandfather’s most precious possession. After the V&A, our search for clues takes us to the warren of basements beneath the British Museum, and to the British Library, which holds many of the administrative records relating to the annexation and British rule of Burma. Among them is a curious object, about the size of a large take-away menu. This parabaik, a folded illustrated manuscript made from mulberry-bark paper, is thought to have been painted by a Burmese artist shortly after the annexation, and tells the story of Thibaw’s downfall. I unfold it for Soe Win in the quiet of the reading room, and his eye is drawn to one figure – a man talking to the king, resplendent in white khakis, holding his pith helmet in one hand. “Colonel Sladen,” he whispers. The British Library He retells a story I’ve heard many times from Burmese friends. Col Edward Sladen, a decorated veteran of Indian and Burmese campaigns, was the chief political officer of the invasion force. He was a familiar face to the king, spoke Burmese, and was entrusted with persuading him to surrender with the minimum of fuss. Sladen would oversee the king’s hurried packing of his most valuable possessions – including the Nga Mauk ruby - in preparation for exile. What happens next is as infamous in Burma as in India is the tale of Britain’s acquisition of the Koh-i-Noor diamond - the dazzling 106-carat gem now set in the front of the Queen Mother’s Crown. The king’s youngest daughter wrote years later: Sladen asked my parents to let him have a look at [the ruby] and they gave it to him. My parents said that, after looking at it for a while, Sladen put it into his pocket, pretending to be absent-minded, and did not return it.” This is the story most often told in Burma, and many see Sladen’s knighthood just a few months later - for “special service in Burma” - as proof that he must have taken the ruby, donated it to Queen Victoria, and been gonged in return. There are variations on the story, however. One says Sladen put the ruby in his pocket, and then - conscious that he was being watched - gave it back a few moments later. King Thibaw himself said he had given the ruby to Sladen for safekeeping. From his Indian exile in June 1886 he sent a desperate letter to the British Viceroy pleading for the ruby’s return. “The list of property forwarded herewith,” writes his secretary, “was made over to Colonel Sladen to keep for him [Thibaw] as he was afraid of losing it during the journey… Colonel Sladen promised him that the property would be returned to him when he wanted it… He hopes that His Excellency the Governor General will see fit to issue an order for the property to be returned.” He attaches a list said to have been made by the Burmese royal treasurer on 29 November 1885, and signed off by a British political officer. It includes:“1 ruby ring known by the name of ‘Nagamauk’”. Thibaw never stopped trying to get his property back. In late 1911, he made one final desperate bid, writing directly to the newly-crowned George V. Once again he described how “my precious ruby ring (Ngamauk) was taken” and again named Sladen as the culprit. By this stage, however, the British authorities were deaf to the king’s pleas, and the man he accused wasn’t about to own up, having been dead for 21 years. The king himself, ever more reclusive as his three-decade exile wore on, would pass away five years later, in 1916. After Thibaw’s death, his youngest daughter, Soe Win’s grandmother, would take up the search for the Nga Mauk ruby, even writing a letter to the League of Nations. And when she died, Soe Win’s uncle, Taw Phaya Galae, took up the baton. It’s thanks to this man - a fascinating figure known as the Red Prince on account of his years as a committed Communist - that Soe Win and I make a trip to the Tower of London, to inspect the Crown Jewels. After writing numerous letters to the Queen and Prince Philip, and asking friends who visited London to check whether Sladen’s descendants were suspiciously well off, Taw Phaya Galae wrote a book setting out his theories about the fate of the ruby. “However hard the British Imperialists tried to erase the trail of the Nga-Mauk ruby, there is compelling evidence of its existence,” he writes in The Nga Mauk Ruby in London. His theory is that the Nga Mauk may be hiding in plain sight – embedded in the Crown Jewels of Britain. An internet search for “Nga Mauk ruby” tends to bring up multiple images of a ruby-studded Queen Elizabeth II and of the Imperial State Crown adorned with an enormous red stone - which suggests the Red Prince isn’t alone in making this supposition. But the huge red jewel in the Imperial State Crown is the “Black Prince’s Ruby” worn by Henry V on his helmet at the Battle of Agincourt. So instead Taw Phaya Galae posits that the Nga Mauk ruby was used to decorate the Imperial Crown of India – a special crown made in 1911 for George V to wear in Delhi, when he and Queen Mary were proclaimed Emperor and Empress. Imperial Crown of India Although he gives no evidence for the hunch, the timing would work. An enormous spare ruby knocking around since the 1880s in the Royal Collection could theoretically have been donated for a new crown. There is an obvious flaw in this theory: there is no ruby the size of the Nga Mauk in the Imperial Crown of India. The man who translated Taw Phaya Galae’s book into English has an answer, though. It was chopped into four, he suggests, and the parts became the centrepiece of each of the crown’s four sides. We do know that the rubies in the crown are “of Burmese origin”, because this is stated in an official two-volume history of the Crown Jewels published in 1998. But that in itself proves little, as most of the world’s rubies come from Burma. All the Royal Collection Trust will say is that “There is no archival documentation to indicate the origin of the rubies in the Imperial Crown of India.” They decline a request for an interview. As Soe Win and I stand outside the battlements of the Tower of London, squat and brooding on the banks of the Thames, we cannot help wondering whether the Royal Collection is hiding something. “I really believe it might be in here,” Soe Win confides and marches off through the portcullis gates. I have to run to catch him up. I haven’t been to see the Crown Jewels since I was a child, and I now experience a curious mix of feelings, walking through this display of the power, pomp and prestige of the British monarchy, alongside a man who could have been a monarch himself. Stepping on to the conveyor belt, we act like two excitable school-children, although with a combined age of 100. The regalia drift past in a sparkling blur of red, gold and silver. But we’re only interested in one piece. When we reach the Imperial Crown of India, we linger as long as we can without causing a pile-up, and then rush round for a second go. Four rubies, each about 1.5cm in diameter twinkle out through the glass – could this be it? I stand staring so long that I lose track of Soe Win. Soe Win's  reaction to the crown jewels I find him outside in the courtyard looking concerned. “I don’t want to go in there again,” he says. “It was like a horror movie. It was so dark, I had a bad feeling.” He clutches his chest. He’s convinced that what he’s seen was not the Nga Mauk. He would surely have felt its presence, he says. “I want to see what they’re not showing, that’s what I came here for!” The chuckle, absent for a moment, returns. To my mind, Soe Win’s gut instinct isn’t proof that the Nga Mauk ruby wasn’t sliced up and set in the Crown of India. But wouldn’t it be an act of folly to take an invaluable,enormous ruby and cut it into pieces? Who would do that? We have to keep digging. More than 130 years later, it's hard to know exactly what happened in Mandalay on 29 November 1885, the day Thibaw was exiled. But it certainly helps that a reporter from The Times was present at one of the conversations between Sladen and the king. The Times, 5 December 1885 I call up his report online and show it to Soe Win. “I have given up all the Crown Jewels, and I am sure the English, who are a great people, will not object to me, as a King, keeping my ring,” Thibaw is quoted as saying. At this point, the reporter says, Thibaw showed him “a magnificent ruby ring”. Sladen then replies: “I am certain that the English people would not wish you to be deprived of those jewels.” At this, Soe Win arches an eyebrow. This has to be the ring that Thibaw wrote to the Viceroy of India about in June the following year - the one listed as “1 ruby ring known by the name of ‘Nagamauk’”. Thibaw’s letter kicked off a wonderfully British bureaucratic paper trail, most of which is carefully preserved in the “Political and Secret” collection of the India Office Records, held in the British Library. Opening the fragile and musty tomes, it's hard not to experience a thrill at trespassing on what were once sensitive state secrets. In December 1886, the Viceroy asked his officers to investigate the disappearance of the ruby. All the key players in Mandalay the previous November are contacted - including the newly knighted Sladen, now back in London and preparing for retirement. Among his personal papers, also held in the British Library, are three drafts of a letter he wrote in reply to the Viceroy’s inquiries, written over several days. It seems to me from the rephrasing and deletions that Sir Edward is having difficulty in deciding how to respond, and the final draft is a cautiously worded exercise in plausible deniability. King Thibaw is given 10 minutes' grace Due to the chaos of the day, Sladen writes, the king made “no attempt at handing over particular items or a given quantity of anything”. He denies having seen the list Thibaw attached to the letter, insists that he handed over everything in his possession, and suggests that any number of people could have made off with something so small and valuable as a ruby ring. In a telling paragraph deleted from the final version of the letter, he says: I looked upon the prize I had secured for the government in the person of King Thibaw, as a jewel of greater price and importance than all the other baubles in the world.” Focus on Thibaw, he seems to be saying, and don’t fuss about baubles. Even more curious is a large beige book – a Lett’s No.43 Colonial Rough Diary & Scribbling Journal, from 1885, the year of the annexation. It’s battered and stained with what looks like red wine. It’s a book that, like its author, has been places and seen things. Turning carefully through the pages, I feel like I’m invading the privacy of this bewhiskered Victorian officer, who for so long has been the pantomime villain of Burmese retellings of the Nga Mauk story. Inside is a breathtaking account of the preparations for the invasion, mixed with comments on the weather, his health, and the odd spot of lawn tennis. Having read Sladen’s letters, I’ve grown accustomed to his spidery handwriting, but interpreting the fine pencil script takes countless hours of staring and guesswork. Finally, I reach Sunday 29 November, the day after Sladen has accepted Thibaw’s surrender, and the king’s last day in his kingdom. My friend, Sudha Shah, who spent seven years researching Thibaw’s story for her book, The King in Exile, has warned me what to expect. And there it is - the middle third of the page, a full 12 lines, has been industriously blacked out. The first three lines are covered with dark ink, and then perhaps running out, the vandal has switched to pencil. In the whole diary, this is the only page that has been redacted. It’s deeply suspicious. John O’Brien, archivist at the British Library, offers to peer at the scribbling out, using a technique called multi-spectral imaging - examining the text under light of different wavelengths in the hope of revealing the original words.

John O’Brien, archivist at the British Library, offers to peer at the scribbling out, using a technique called multi-spectral imaging - examining the text under light of different wavelengths in the hope of revealing the original words. When I see what the conservation team sends back a few days later, I cannot wait to share it with Soe Win. Where the original pencil has been scribbled out with pencil, nothing can be made out. But where the pencil has been covered in ink Sladen’s handwriting can now be seen, and a few intriguing words jump out for the first time in more than a century. King asks me to receive over… Regalia – I agree – asks me personally to take K…” The next three words are illegible. I want to read “King’s Nga Mauk…” but honestly, it could be anything. “Is this proof enough for you that Sladen took the Nga Mauk?” I ask Soe Win. “That's why he blacked it out, it's very simple.”  he responds. Soe Win looks at the diary But I’m left with a feeling of having snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. In my mind’s eye, I can see an ageing Sir Edward worriedly chewing his pen in his London club, struggling to compose a response to the Viceroy. I can imagine him looking back at his diary from the year before and hurriedly scribbling out an admission that he knows will haunt him. But it seems we’ll never know what the hidden text says. We’ll never even know for sure whether it was Sir Edward himself who did the scribbling out What if Sladen did take the ruby, though? What might he have done with it? It’s a question I put to Sladen’s great-grandson, the Earl of Portsmouth, at his house in Farleigh Wallop deep in the Hampshire countryside. We’re standing by a wall-mounted display box, containing three of Sir Edward’s medals awarded by Queen Victoria. “Clearly he must have been an able soldier and administrator, hence his knighthood,” says Lord Portsmouth, leaning closer to examine the medals. The earl continues: There was some vague family rumour about Sir Edward ‘stealing Thibaw’s throne’ but the first I’d heard of the ruby was from you.” “Besides, if he’d stolen it and kept it then where’s the money? The Sladens, my mother’s family, were a hard-up bunch. Sir Edward’s son, my grandfather, turned to elephant hunting in Kenya to make a living.” So perhaps, if Sladen did take the ruby, we should conclude he gave it to the Queen, as might any loyal Victorian officer. But why would he have needed to hide this from the Viceroy and to scrub the record from his diary? Like everything else about this story, it’s puzzling. Soe Win and I have not quite exhausted all our leads. Still nagging is what John Clarke at the V&A told us about a large ruby being donated to Queen Victoria. If we couldn’t prove who took the Nga Mauk, could we at least prove who received it? After doing some digging of his own, Clarke sends me an obscure article written in 2003 by a man called Michael Nash. Like me, Nash had caught Nga Mauk fever, and had written to the Royal Collection with the same questions as I had. He had more luck however. I find out that Nash is now a professor at the University of East Anglia and call him instantly to hear more about his search, and his theory about the fate of the ruby. When everyone says nobody knows, it's not true. Somebody knows, we just don't know who that is!” The high point of his hunt had been an intriguing letter from Caroline de Guitaut at the Royal Collection, revealing that she had found a reference in an 1896 inventory of Queen Victoria’s jewellery to a “cabochon ruby (75)”. This may refer to the number of carats of the stone, de Guitaut says. Seventy-five carats is slightly smaller than the Nga Mauk, which was once more than 80 carats, but it could have been recut. “The inventory states that the stone is from the King of Burmah (sic) and was presented to the Queen ‘by the Burmese Ambassadors’ and was reset in the original style,” de Guitaut goes on. So where is it now? “The bracelet was bequeathed to Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll, and therefore passed out of the Royal Collection.” Nash wrote to the current Duke of Argyll, who told him no such jewel remained in the family’s possession. Princess Louise, Queen Victoria’s artistic fourth daughter, appears to have given or bequeathed the ruby to someone, but whom? “As a member of the immediate royal family, Princess Louise’s Will remains sealed,” says Nash, the author of a book on royal wills published earlier this year. “Never say never, but it will be very difficult indeed to discover who Louise left the ruby to.” Did Princess Louise’s bracelet contain the Nga Mauk ruby? Princess Louise It’s certainly possible. It would be interesting to learn more about the circumstances in which “the Burmese Ambassadors” made their gift. If it took place in 1872, when Thibaw’s father, King Mindon, sent an embassy to London, the ruby cannot be the Nga Mauk. But then, maybe the reference to the ambassadors is just a smokescreen. In Burma, the British colonialists are suspected of all kinds of subterfuge. The loss of the Nga Mauk continues to stir huge emotion, mixed with anger at the British annexation. The famous Burmese historian, U Than Tun, wrote that “the only reasonable conclusion to be made was that a massive collective fraud was perpetrated by the British government…” Another historian concludes: “Sladen and his cohorts carried out trickery and theft on a massive scale; destroying and distorting all existing evidence as much as possible and covering their tracks.” Daw Ni Ni Myint, a historian twice-married to Burma’s General Ne Win, strikes a more wistful note. The ruby that is worth a kingdom must be somewhere in the world. How I long to see if for myself and I am convinced that every Myanmar citizen will share my fervent wish.” Soe Win certainly does. Though when I ask him why he wants to find the priceless jewel that was once the personal property of his great-grandfather, his answer is not the one many might expect. “You have so much to show from your history, we have nothing,” he says. It was something he’d been pondering since we followed the crowds through Buckingham Palace, a royal dwelling stuffed with carefully curated artefacts from all over the world. Later, after being guided through racks upon racks of Burmese artefacts in the British Museum and the V&A, he told me Myanmar would be eager even to have replicas of these things. For him, the chief value of the Nga Mauk would be educational, motivational - a talisman that could help unite and rebuild the nation. “The Nga Mauk reminds us of what we had, and what we could do. It reminds us that once we were a proud, independent nation with a rich history. We have nothing to show from that now to teach the next generations in Myanmar,” he says. I’ve heard this many times from the last king’s descendants. They don’t want to get rich or take back power, they just want people in Myanmar to be able to remember where they came from, in the hope they may then know where they’re going. This is more important now than ever, as Myanmar's ethnic and religious conflicts - this time in Rakhine - dominate the headlines. To mark Soe Win’s final day in London, we order stout, his favourite beer, in a traditional English pub. For the man who swore he’d never come to London, he’s taken to it well. “We have shared history, you and I. Not all good! But you and I are friends, and we must work together,” he tells me. Soe Win might be 70 but he has no plans to rest – while the Nga Mauk may stay hidden for now, he’s determined to bring his great-grandfather’s remains back from India, to restore Mandalay Palace to its former glory, and to support museums in his country - perhaps with the help of the old enemy. “We can forgive,” he says, taking a thoughtful sip, “but we mustn’t forget.” Built with Shorthand",Negative,1.3057196e-11
"The Hospital Club is one of a new breed of trendy private members' clubs A new breed of fashionable private members clubs are growing in popularity around the world, promising to be more inclusive and diverse than their stuffy older counterparts. Yet while the newer venues certainly have a far more youthful membership, and you certainly don't need to have gone to a posh school or university, they still have high joining fees and strict vetting processes. So how less elitist are they? And what are the benefits of getting your name on the list? ""I like how organically relationships happen at Soho House,"" says tech entrepreneur Tyler McIntyre. ""You can't wear business suits, you can't hand out business cards, and you can't take phone calls."" The 26-year-old joined Soho Beach House in Miami two years ago, after visiting with friends who were members. ""It's a laidback place to network but it's also given me the opportunity to try things I typically wouldn't do by myself, like wine tastings or a jam-making class. Soho House New York has a rooftop pool ""And sometimes I'll go to the sunset DJ parties by the pool, which are loud and pretty crazy."" Welcome to the new breed of private members' club, which claim to be less restrictive and more diverse than the stuffy gentlemen's clubs of the past. These modern venues - with their co-working spaces, screening rooms and rooftop pools - are fast becoming the places where many of today's young creative class choose to work and play. Membership isn't cheap though, with some charging more than $2,000 (Â£1,500) per annum, along with joining fees of $300. Tech entrepreneur Tyler McIntyre joined Soho House Miami two years ago ""In the past, members' clubs were seen as being elitist and populated by people who went to the same public schools and universities,"" says Richard Cope, a senior trends consultant at Mintel. ""But these places are more for entrepreneurs and self-made people. The only thing you have to be able to do is pay the fee, and it can be fairly expensive."" While trendy members' clubs have been around for years, they became much more common after the launch of Soho House in London in 1995. The trend has also gained a foothold in the US and other countries. ""We've see a huge jump in the number of the new types of club coming online, as compared to the traditional model,"" says Zack Bates of Private Club Marketing, a firm that promotes members' clubs. Soho House Barcelona looks to attract creative entrepreneurs ""In Los Angeles, you can't get into Soho House. So others are being built, the Hospital Club, Griffin Club and Norwood, to keep up with the appetite for these spaces."" Soho House itself now boasts 18 venues around the world, including in New York, Istanbul, Berlin, and soon Mumbai. Group revenue rose 3% in 2016 to Â£293.4m, while global membership jumped from 56,000 to 70,000. However, you have to do more than just fill out an application to join its venues. Membership costs between Â£400 to Â£1,580 per annum, depending on the club, although there are discounts for under-27s. The gym at Soho House Barcelona More stories from the BBC'sBusiness Brainseries looking at interesting business topics from around the world: The companies making bicycles from wood Ever fancied owning the Joker's costume from Batman? The firms that donate as many goods as they sell How do you like your wine - with a cork or screw-cap? The Hospital Club has a TV and music studio on site And there's a tough background check to ensure potential members are part of the creative class - Soho House frowns on those who work in financial services, for instance. Once accepted, members enjoy a host of perks. Soho House Barcelona, for example, one of the chain's newest venues, boasts a retro-themed gym, pool and free classes like yoga. Members pay full price for food and drink but get discounts on the club's hotel rooms. Mr Cope says: ""These clubs offer people a discreet place to network and wind down, typically in cities where personal space is at a premium."" However, they are also about ""showing off to a degree"". ""In an age of social media, people like to let others know where they hang out or which restaurants they eat at. So there's an element of satisfying those peacock tendencies."" The Hospital Club says it provides its members with networking opportunities The newer clubs do serve more practical functions, though, such as offering young entrepreneurs a place to work. Take London's Hospital Club, based in Covent Garden, which offers its own meeting and conference rooms, and even an in-house TV and music recording studio. Standard membership costs Â£865 plus a Â£250 joining fee. While some might find such fees high, it's still cheaper than forking out for your own office space, says Mr Bates. ""It suits today's digital nomads, who work remotely via their laptops. Paying for an office can be prohibitively expensive, especially in a major city."" Members' clubs also offer vital networking opportunities that help further your career, says Zikki Munyao, 40. The remote IT worker joined Common House, a private member's club in Charlottesville, USA, largely for this purpose. The co-working space at Common House ""There are areas to socialise and meeting spaces where I can have privacy,"" he says of the club, where membership costs $150 (Â£113) a month, plus a $600 joining fee. ""I even met my estate agent over a game of pool."" The new breed of members' clubs does face challenges, though. Some warn that as clubs proliferate, their exclusivity is becoming diluted, and they struggle to attract the celebrities that once lent them cachet. The social commentator Peter York tells the BBC: ""Traditionally private members' clubs have played on their exclusivity and being able to attract the 'magic people'. ""But as more and more of them pop up, you get blase. The magical people also can't be corralled in one place anymore."" He adds that as clubs like Soho House keep on expanding, they seem to be ""more about business"", which further dilutes their brand. ""The danger is that a new challenger, which looks younger and groovier, arrives and steals your limelight."" But Mr Cope believes the market for these new clubs is going to expand. ""Having somewhere where you can unwind and host friends in the centre of cities is useful. So there are a lot of practicalities around this. ""It is also about expressing your individuality, so I think the emotional need for this is only going to grow.""

"American firework laws may seem strict - but as the UK prepares for Bonfire Night, has the US got the right idea? In Delaware, you don't need a licence to own a shotgun. You don't need a permit to buy a shotgun or carry a shotgun. If you're over 18, and you pass the background check, the state won't interfere with your shotgun. Sparklers, however, are a different matter. ""A person has the right to keep and bear arms for the defense of self, family, home and state""(Delaware constitution, article 1, section 20),external ""No person shall store, sell, offer or expose for sale, or have in possession...any fireworks""(Delaware code, title 16, section 6901),external Unless you have a permit for a public display, it is illegal to sell or possess fireworks in Delaware. That includes sparklers - which the law specifically mentions. The maximum fine is $100. Last year, 17 people were arrested in Delaware for fireworks offences. While the US constitution does uphold the right to bear arms, it doesn't uphold the right to bear roman candles. The offices at Patriotic Fireworks in Maryland In the US, firework laws vary from state to state, even town to town. Like Delaware, Massachusetts bans all consumer fireworks - including sparklers. Illinois, Ohio, and Vermont ban everything but sparklers and novelty items. Other states ban anything that flies. The laws mean firework stores are often found on state lines, so customers from one state can take advantage of laws in another. Patriotic Fireworks is in Elkton, Maryland - six miles from the Delaware state line. It's a small, friendly store, found down a long, tree-lined track. A pig-tailed dog called Princess Sofia says hello to customers. A sign on the door says: ""Let freedom ring"". But they take the law seriously. Firstly, they don't sell to people from Maryland. They could, butthe state law is so complex,,externaland so strict, it's not worth their time. ""I would have to dedicate a person to go round with each customer, to make sure they bought legal items,"" says owner April Frederici. ""It's just easier not to."" They do sell to Delaware residents - ""I can't be the world's policeman,"" says April - but every customer must sign a contract. It states that fireworks will be used ""in accordance with all state and local laws"". It also says Patriotic will not be liable for any ""accident or injury"". And when it comes to fireworks, accidents do happen. Just ask American football player Jason Pierre-Paul. Warning:Graphic photo below In 2015, Pierre-Paul celebrated Independence Day in his home town of Deerfield Beach, Florida. At the end of the night, he decided to set off one last firework. He tried seven times to light the fuse. Then it exploded in his hand. Pierre-Paul lost his index finger and the tip of his thumb. His middle finger was badly damaged. He still plays football, returning with his hand wrapped in a club. In 2016, he became the face of afireworks safety campaign,external. ""Jason Pierre-Paul is a great example of the dangers of fireworks,"" says Michael Chionchio, the assistant state fire marshal in Delaware. Jason Pierre-Paul and his damaged hand Michael and the state fire marshal's office are based on the edge of the state capital, Dover. In the car park, a sign keeps tally of the number of fire deaths in Delaware. Last year: nine. This year: seven (six without a smoke detector). Michael is proud of his state's fireworks law. ""I can sum it up in a few words,"" he says. ""Fireworks are unsafe."" In 2004, Republicans in the state legislature tried to legalise sparklers, but failed. This year,they are trying again,external. The fire marshal opposes the change. Not only are sparklers a ""gateway"" to other fireworks, says Michael, but they are unsafe. ""A sparkler can burn up to 1,800 degrees (980 celsius),"" he says. Bonfire Night, also known as Guy Fawkes Night, takes place on 5 November every year It marks the failure of an attempt in 1605 to blow up Parliament Most communities hold bonfires and firework displays Private displays - and sparklers - are also common Michael leans across the wooden table and points to theConsumer Product Safety Commission's 2016 report,externalon firework safety. It says fireworks were involved in 11,100 injuries treated in US hospitals in 2016 (92% of victims were seen at the emergency department then released). In the 30 days around 4 July, sparklers caused 900 injuries, with 400 of those in children aged 0-4. ""We can't consciously tell you that we accept fireworks and sparklers being legalised,"" says Michael. ""We just can't do that. We're fire marshals. We protect people from fires. We can't support something that will hurt somebody."" Although the constitution allows guns, the US has a safety-conscious streak. In the ""land of the free"", the following are banned: Buying alcohol under the age of 21 Kinder Eggs,external(because of the choking risk) Scottish haggis(because of food safety fears) Slowly, though, firework laws are being liberalised. Since 2000, nine stateshave legalised sparklers,external- New Jersey was the most recent. Another seven states have relaxed laws on other fireworks. Julie Heckman from the American Pyrotechnics Association says legalising fireworks makes them safer. ""Everyone celebrates their pride and patriotism on 4 July with backyard fireworks,"" she says. ""If fireworks are banned, people are just breaking the law. And where there was complete prohibition there was no safety message."" Like Michael Chionchio, she hasstatistics to make her case,external. The number of firework-related injuries is the same as in 1976 - 11,100. But at the same time, the consumption of fireworks has increased massively. Pound for pound, says Julie, the injury rate has fallen ""dramatically"". The association attributes the decline to better education and safer products. It also points out that other things are risky, too.

"This video can not be played The Balfour Declaration: 100 years of conflict The British peer Arthur Balfour barely makes an appearance in UK schoolbooks, but many Israeli and Palestinian students could tell you about him. His Balfour Declaration, made on 2 November 1917, is taught in their respective history classes and forms a key chapter in their two very different, national narratives. It can be seen as a starting point for the Arab-Israeli conflict. The declaration by the then foreign secretary was included in a letter to Lord Walter Rothschild, a leading proponent of Zionism, a movement advocating self-determination for the Jewish people in their historical homeland - from the Mediterranean to the eastern flank of the River Jordan, an area which came to be known as Palestine. It stated that the British government supported,external""the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people"". The key 67 words of Balfour's letter At the same time, it said that nothing should ""prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities"". Palestinians see this as a great betrayal, particularly given a separate promise made to enlist the political and military support of the Arabs - then ruled by the Ottoman Turks - in World War One. The Balfour Declaration: My ancestor's hand in history This suggested Britain would back their struggle for independence in most of the lands of the Ottoman Empire, which consisted of much of the Middle East. The Arabs understood this to include Palestine, though it had not been specifically mentioned. ""Do you think Britain committed a crime against the Palestinian people?"" asks a teacher during a lesson in a Palestinian school in the West Bank city of Ramallah. Palestinians regard the declaration as an historical injustice Everyone puts up a hand. ""Yes,"" a 15-year-old girl answers. ""This declaration was illegitimate because Palestine was still part of the Ottoman Empire and Britain did not control it."" ""Britain considered the Arabs as a minority while they formed over 90% of the population."" Israeli children, inevitably, tend to see British involvement more positively when they study the Balfour Declaration in a lesson towards the end of their high-school years. In Balfouria, a village in northern Israel, nine-year-old Noga Yehezekeli is already proudly able to recite a Hebrew version of the text off by heart. ""In the moment it was given, the declaration gave huge hope and a huge push for the Zionist movement,"" says her father, Neve. ""People saw that if the British government gave such a declaration there was a chance that one day the Jewish nation would be established, which really happened later in '48"" - the year the State of Israel was formed. The declaration gave Zionists huge hope, says Neve Yehezekeli (right) Residents of Balfouria - including Neve's grandfather - were part of a growing Jewish community in Palestine when Lord Balfour visited in 1925. They gave him a hero's welcome. By that time, the area was under British administration. The Balfour Declaration had been formally enshrined in the British Mandate for Palestine, which had been endorsed by the League of Nations. During the first half of the Mandate period, Britain allowed waves of Jewish immigration. But amid an Arab backlash and rising violence, Israelis remember how it later blocked many fleeing persecution, particularly during the Holocaust. At the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, inaugurated by Balfour, Professor Ruth Lapidoth has studied the 67-word document. An expert on international law, Prof Lapidoth argues it was a legally binding declaration, but says Britain found it hard to deliver on its pledge. Lord Balfour was given a hero's welcome by the Jewish community in Jerusalem in 1925 ""The political situation was very bad when the Nazis came to power and then England needed the help, the friendship of the Arab countries,"" she says. ""Then they had to limit the implementation of the declaration, which is a pity."" Prof Lapidoth left Germany in 1938, a year before the start of World War Two, and so has a personal interest in the pronouncement. ""I'm still very grateful for it,"" she says. ""It was really the source of our right to come back to Palestine, including my own."" Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, describes the Balfour Declaration as ""a central milestone"" in the process of establishing his country. The British government has invited him to London for events to mark the centenary on Thursday. That decision, at a time of dimming hopes for Israeli-Palestinian peace, has infuriated Palestinians, who plan a day of protests. Palestinians say Britain's declaration deprived them of a state They want Britain to apologise for the Balfour Declaration. ""As the time passes, I think British people are forgetting about the lessons of history,"" says Palestinian Education Minister Sabri Saidam. He points out that Palestinians still seek the creation of a state of their own - which alongside Israel would form the basis of the so-called two-state solution to the conflict, a formula supported by the international community. ""The time has come for Palestine to be independent and for that long-due promise to be fulfilled,"" he says.

"Two 14-year-old boys from Northallerton have appeared in court charged with conspiracy to murder following a counter-terrorism investigation in North Yorkshire. Are they the youngest in the Britain to have been arrested and charged in such circumstances? Surprising though it may sound, they are not. In 2015, a teenager from Blackburn was charged with inciting terrorism by encouraging another teenager in Australia to carry out an attack there. ""Boy S"" was 14 years and eight months old at the time of his arrest in March of that year and a month older when he was charged. By the time he had pleaded guilty and received the juvenile version of a life sentence, he had turned 15. Two boys charged after probe by Northallerton terror police Boy, 14, from Blackburn held over Australia 'terror plot' Could teen jihadist have been saved himself? The two boys who appeared in court in Leeds, known as A and B, are a little older than Boy S. Assuming their case progresses, they will have turned 15 by the time they face trial. Very few of those arrested on suspicion of committing a terrorism-related offence are under 18 years old. In the year to June 2016 across England, Wales and Scotland, only 12 of the 222 arrested under counter-terrorism powers were younger than 18. Since 11 September 2001, more than 3,650 people have been arrested in counter-terrorism investigations in the Great Britain. Of those: 132 were under the age of 18 35 of these juveniles were subsequently charged 18 of them were ultimately convicted of a crime The rise of the so-called Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq prompted a slight shift in the age range of those coming under suspicion in the UK. The group wanted to attract young people from across Europe to its cause - it wanted fit men to fight and young women willing to start families. That led to more younger people trying to travel to Syria - and that was reflected to some extent in the corresponding arrests statistics. Not all of those who were arrested were investigated for links to jihadism. One significant investigation from 2016 was focused on the activities of a 17-year-old who had become a follower of the banned neo-Nazi group National Action. Why is the media not naming the two boys who have appeared in court on Thursday? The law prohibits identifying anyone under the age of 18 who is charged or convicted of a criminal offence unless a judge gives permission. It's very rare for such an anonymity restriction to be lifted, because judges tend to take the view that the very youngest offenders should be given the chance to be rehabilitated as they mature. There are exceptions, including the decision to name in 1993 the 10-year-olds who murdered James Bulger. More recently, a judge refused to lift a reporting restriction prohibiting the media from naming two teenage girls whotortured a vulnerable woman to death in Hartlepool.

"How should the international community treat the defeated fighters of so-called Islamic State? Countries must remember ""our shared humanity"" when dealing with captured fighters from so-called Islamic State, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). At a briefing in Geneva, the ICRC's deputy director for the Middle East, Patrick Hamilton, insisted that international law on the treatment of combatants must be followed, and rejected calls for the ""annihilation"" of fighters. He acknowledged that the campaign against IS had left ""huge devastation in its wake"", with ""catastrophic humanitarian consequences"". But while Mr Hamilton's remarks did touch on the appalling suffering of civilians who have had to live through the brutal regime of IS in Mosul or Raqqa - and the bloody battles for those cities - his focus was the future treatment of IS fighters, including those who travelled to Syria and Iraq from other countries. 'Islamic State': Raqqa's loss seals rapid rise and fall Which countries have fleeing IS fighters gone to? Thousands of foreign IS fighters return The ICRC is already visiting more than 1,300 women and children of several dozen nationalities detained near Mosul. They are believed to be the families of foreign fighters. As the coalition against IS gains more ground, more and more IS fighters and their families are expected to be captured. So what should happen to them? The ICRC, said Patrick Hamilton, was concerned about a ""public discourseâ¦ on the desirability of annihilating those enemies still standing"", and he warned against treating the fighters as ""if they were outside our shared humanity"". He did not identify specific names of those carrying on such a discourse. But when Mr Hamilton warned about ""dehumanising rhetoric"", he was probably referring to comments made by a number of Western politicians - including Rory Stewart, minister of state at the UK's foreign office - who recently said that UK citizens fighting for IS were a ""serious danger to us"". ""Unfortunately,"" he said, ""the only way of dealing with them will be, in almost every case, to kill them."" At least 800 people from the UK have travelled to support or fight for jihadist organisations in Syria and Iraq Who are Britainâs jihadists? The French Defence Minister Florence Parly has also suggested that if IS fighters ""perish in this fight, I would say that's for the best"". Brett McGurk, the US envoy to the coalition against IS, has said the coalition wants to ensure that foreign fighters ""die here in Syria"". The secret lives of young IS fighters IS wives: Why I joined the 'caliphate' in Raqqa Inside 'Islamic State': A Raqqa diary The comments from politicians may find a good deal of sympathy among voters. Citizens and survivors of terror attacks in Paris, London or New York are understandably nervous about the prospect of individuals who joined IS returning home once the battle for the caliphate is lost. An estimated 30,000 foreign fighters are believed to have joined IS. The security services view even a few hundred returning to Europe as a huge challenge: putting them in jail risks further radicalisation but allowing them to go free will almost certainly involve the police in round-the-clock surveillance work. Many may struggle to identify any ""shared humanity"" with people whose ideology appears to include enslaving women, decapitating prisoners or driving trucks into crowds of tourists. But at the ICRC, the guardian of the Geneva Conventions, the mood is different. ""Exceptional crimes do not justify exceptions to the law,"" said Patrick Hamilton. In his view, any fighter ""left standing"" must be captured, detained, and, if crimes are suspected, brought to justice in the usual way. Agnes Callamard, the UN's special rapporteur on extra-judicial, summary or arbitrary executions, shares the ICRC's concerns. The UN's Agnes Callamard is also concerned about any desire to circumvent due process She believes the current rhetoric focusing specifically on IS is ""problematic"". ""In Syria and Iraq,"" she argues, ""vast numbers of atrocities have been committed, by all sides - why single one out?"" People who are not actually fighting, she explains, are ""hors de combat"" - or ""out of action"" - and international law is very clear about how they should be treated. She agrees with the ICRC that there should be no exceptions to this, and that there should be no arbitrary killing just because someone is believed to be a member of IS. On a practical level, both Agnes Callamard and Reed Brody of Human Rights Watch fear that the apparent desire, as expressed by US President Donald Trump, to ""annihilate Islamic State"" could, if really carried out, destroy valuable evidence of war crimes. ""In terms of uncovering the truth and ensuring the victims or their relatives get justice,"" said Ms Callamard, ""that can only be done through an open and transparent judicial process."" Raqqa has been devastated by three years of IS rule and the action to recapture the city Mr Brody agrees that returning IS fighters present ""challenges"", but argues they also offer ""opportunities"". Inside the Iraqi courts sentencing IS suspects to death He talks of the possibility of finding a way ""to work with some of these former fighters to find out all we can about how Isis operates, and even to build criminal cases against high-ranking Isis officials who have been involved in war crimes and other atrocities"". ""We have a right to know,"" adds Ms Callamard. ""For history, how IS operated, who funded them. All of this is crucial information."" Despite their apparent contradiction, underlying both the comments made by Western politicians and the pleas for humanity from the ICRC and others is a common desire for peace, both in the Middle East and on our city streets. Eradication of a group that has caused so much horror may be an attractive solution, but the ICRC views it as short-sighted, as well as illegal under international law. Nazi leader Hermann Goering was sentenced to death for crimes against humanity at the Nuremberg trials in 1946 ""How a conflict is fought and brought to an end [is] important to future peace,"" Patrick Hamilton points out. ""Talk of annihilation or extermination risks perpetuating the conflict."" ""Our justice system is predicated on the fact that even the worst perpetratorsâ¦ should have their day in court, for all to see,"" says Agnes Callamard. And, she points out, we have had the vision and the energy to bring the perpetrators of history's most horrific crimes to justice in the past. ""We did it after World War Two [with the Nuremberg trials]. We did not have a choice then, and we do not have a choice now.""

"This video can not be played In Barcelona's central square, the crowd sings Freedom for Catalonia Eight sacked Catalan ministers have been remanded in custody by a Spanish high court judge over the region's push for independence. Prosecutors had asked the judge to detain eight of the nine former regional government members who turned up for questioning in Madrid. They are accused of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds. Prosecutors are also seeking a European Arrest Warrant for ousted Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont. The request also covers four other dismissed Catalan ministers who did not show up in court in Madrid as requested, but have been in Belgium since Monday. Catalonia sings for its exiled leaders Catalonia crisis in 300 words What next for Spain? Spain has been gripped by a constitutional crisis since a referendum on independence from Spain was held in Catalonia on 1 October in defiance of a constitutional court ruling that had declared it illegal. Last week, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy imposed direct rule on Catalonia, dissolving the regional parliament and calling local elections for 21 December. This came after Catalan lawmakers voted to declare the independence of the affluent north-eastern region. The Catalan government said that of the 43% of potential voters who took part in the referendum, 90% were in favour of independence. Seven of the eight ex-ministers were pictured turning up to court together Those detained are: Former Deputy Vice President Oriol Junqueras Former Interior Minister Joaquim Forn Former Foreign Affairs Minister RaÃ¼l Romeva Former Justice Minister Carles MundÃ³ Former Labour Minister Dolors Bassa Former Government Presidency Councillor Jordi Turull Former Sustainable Development Minister Josep Rull Former Culture Minister Meritxell Borras A ninth official, ex-Business Minister Santi Vila, was granted bail at the request of prosecutors. He resigned before the Catalan parliament voted for independence last Friday. Catalan political parties and civic groups condemned the judicial move, while thousands of people gathered outside the Catalan regional parliament in Barcelona, demanding that they be freed. In a statement broadcast on Catalan TV from an undisclosed location in Belgium, Mr Puigdemont described the detention of the eight ex-ministers as ""an act that breaks with the basic principles of democracy"". He added: ""I demand the release of the ministers and the vice-president."" Five other senior members of the Catalan parliament, as well as Speaker Carme Forcadell, are facing the same charges but, because of their parliamentary immunity, their cases are being handled by the Supreme Court. Their hearings have been postponed until 9 November. Carles Puigdemont was pictured in a Belgian cafe Mr Puigdemont, who was spotted in a Brussels cafe on Thursday, has said he will not return to Spain unless he and four of his fellow sacked colleagues receive guarantees of a fair trial. He did not specify his exact demands. Belgium's federal prosecutor has said the law will be applied once an arrest warrant is received, according to Efe news agency. Mr Puigdemont's lawyer said the climate was ""not good"" for him to appear in court, but he also said his client would co-operate with the authorities in Spain and Belgium. The man who wants to break up Spain In addition to Mr Puigdemont, prosecutors have asked Spain's high court judge to issue European arrest warrants for the following Catalan officials: Meritxell Serret, former agriculture minister Antoni ComÃ­n, former health minister LluÃ­s Puig, former culture minister Clara PonsatÃ­, former education minister If Spain's high court judge issues a warrant, a European Arrest Warrant (EAW) will be sent to Belgian prosecutors, who have 24 hours to decide whether the paperwork is correct. If they do, they then have 15 days to arrest Mr Puigdemont and the four others. If one or all of them appeals against it, that process could last another 15 days. Belgium has a maximum of 60 days to return the suspects to Spain after arrest. But if the suspects do not raise legal objections, a transfer could happen within a few days. A country can reject an EU arrest warrant if it fears that extradition would violate the suspect's human rights. Discrimination based on politics, religion or race is grounds for refusal. So are fears that the suspect would not get a fair trial. There is an agreedEU list of 32 offences,external- in Article Two of the EAW law - for which there is no requirement for the offence to be a crime in both countries. In other words, any of those offences can be a justification for extradition, provided the penalty is at least three years in jail. However, neither ""sedition"" nor ""rebellion"" - two of the Spanish accusations against the Catalan leaders - are on that list. Mr Puigdemont's handling of the crisis has drawn criticism among some other Catalan politicians, with left-wing parliamentary deputy Joan Josep Nuet criticising him for creating ""yet more bewilderment"". Spain's central bank warned on Thursday,externalof the ""significant risks and economic costs"" resulting from the crisis, and that Catalonia's economy could fall into recession. Early numbers suggest that the vital tourism sector of the region has already been affected by the ongoing uncertainty.

"Nguyen met Prince Charles when he visited survivors A serial conman has admitted pretending his family died in the Grenfell Tower fire to obtain about Â£12,500 from funds meant for victims. Anh Nhu Nguyen claimed his wife and son were killed in the blaze. He posed as a victim of the disaster for almost two weeks and was given the money by charities and Kensington and Chelsea Council. The 52-year-old, of Beckenham, south-east London, pleaded guilty at Southwark Crown Court on Thursday. The blaze on 14 June claimed the lives of at least 80 people He admitted two counts of fraud by false representation and one count of making an untrue statement for the purpose of obtaining a passport. Nguyen posed as a victim of the fire and shook the Prince of Wales' hand when he visited a relief centre set up in the wake of the disaster. He claimed the fire had destroyed ""everything"" he owned, and that he was so upset about having lost his wife and son that he could not eat or concentrate. Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? What happened to the people on the 21st floor? Inquiry 'can and will provide answers' Nguyen was given a hotel room, clothing, food, electrical items and money after posing as one of the survivors. He was discovered to be a fake when he gave several different flat numbers, some of which did not exist and one where a real victim lived. Nguyen showed no emotion as he entered his pleas through a translator. He will be sentenced on 15 December. Nguyen met the Prince of Wales at a relief centre set up in the wake of the disaster Nguyen was born in Vietnam, and has been in the UK since the 1980s. He is a British citizen and has 17 aliases. He has 28 previous convictions for 56 offences spanning more than 30 years, including theft, arson and grievous bodily harm. Kate Mulholland from the Crown Prosecution Service said: ""Nguyen's deceit in the aftermath of such a catastrophic loss of life was breathtaking. ""He was willing to lie again and again, adapting his story when it was questioned, in order to profit from the huge aid efforts and outpouring of sympathy for true victims.""

"So, the Bank proved it could be a ""reliable boyfriend"" and did what it suggested it would. Increasing interest rates became almost inevitable after the governor, Mark Carney, announced on BBC Radio 4's Today programme in September that, if economic growth kept on track, then ""you could expect interest rates to increase"". And given that recent growth figures were slightly ahead of expectations, to not act would have been a surprise. And the Bank of England should rarely be in the surprise industry. It makes the markets uncomfortable. This rise takes the rate back to where it was before the referendum, and at 0.5% is still at low levels historically. Economic support for the economy from the Bank via asset purchases (quantitative easing) and ultra-low interest rates remains. The effects of the financial crisis a decade ago still weigh on the economy - and the Bank has again warned that the Brexit process ""is having a noticeable impact on the economic outlook"". We still do not live in normal times. For that reason, the Bank has taken care to signal that any future rate rises will be ""gradual and limited"". Five things we have learnt from the Bank How the Bank policymakers voted What will the rate rise mean for you? The expectation is that rates will rise to just 1%, in two increases of 0.25%, one next year and one in 2020. The Bank believes that the economy is unlikely to reach pre-financial crisis growth rates anytime soon, if at all. Yes, inflation is above target - but the Bank argues that the main driver of that is sterling's 18% decline in value since late 2015, with the biggest fall coming directly after the Brexit referendum. Currency inflation effects tend to push through the economy relatively quickly - sterling's rapid fall leading to an increase in import prices which the Bank says is likely to see inflation peak next month. It predicts inflation will hit 3.2%, before falling back to the target of 2% over subsequent years. Although there is some evidence of global energy inflation adding to price pressures - the oil price is up 17% compared with three months ago and global growth is stronger, which can lead to a more general increase in commodity price inflation as demand rises - many of the other price pressures are weak. Real incomes are still falling. Productivity is poor. Growth remains subdued. Today's rise is a small dab of good news for savers who will see an uptick in the rates they receive on their cash. But for many millions of others it will mean a rise in the cost of living. Yes, many will only see a small increase in monthly repayments if they are on a variable mortgage (on average between Â£10 and Â£20 a month). But do not forget that Financial Conduct Authority survey which revealed that many millions of people would find it difficult to find the money to pay an unexpected bill of just Â£50. The rise will also generally increase the cost of credit, as it pushes through to the rates banks and other providers charge for people to borrow money - which many millions are doing to make ends meet. Many households live on very fine economic margins. The decision by the Bank of England today will make those margins just that little bit tighter.

"This video can not be played Carles Puigdemont said on Tuesday that Spain had a ""democratic deficit"" Spain's state prosecutor has requested a European arrest warrant for ousted Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont and four others over their role in a disputed independence referendum. All five failed to show up at Spain's high court on accusations of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds. Mr Puigdemont's lawyer said the climate was ""not good"" for him to appear. Nine other sacked members of Catalonia's regional government did turn up for questioning at the court. Prosecutors in Madrid asked for eight of them to be held in custody following their testimony. Spain has been gripped by a constitutional crisis since the referendum was held on 1 October in defiance of a constitutional court ruling that had declared it illegal. Last week, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy imposed direct rule on Catalonia, dissolving the regional parliament and calling local elections for 21 December. Catalonia crisis in 300 words What next for Spain? This came after Catalan lawmakers voted to declare the independence of the affluent north-eastern region. The Catalan government said that of the 43% of potential voters who took part in the referendum, 90% were in favour of independence. Mr Puigdemont is in Belgium and says he will not return to Spain unless he and four of his fellow sacked colleagues receive guarantees of a fair trial. Belgium's federal prosecutor has said the law will be applied once the arrest warrant has been received, according to Efe news agency.

"This video can not be played New Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson arrives at the MoD Chief Whip Gavin Williamson has been appointed as the new defence secretary after Sir Michael Fallon's resignation. Sir Michael quit on Wednesday saying his past behaviour may have ""fallen short"" of the standards expected by the UK military. He became the first politician to quit following recently revealed claims of sexual harassment in Parliament. South Staffordshire MP Mr Williamson, 41, said he was ""both honoured and excited"" by the promotion. He has been replaced as chief whip by his former deputy, Julian Smith, who will now be in charge of enforcing party discipline in the Commons. Mr Smith's deputy will be Tatton MP - and former GMTV presenter - Esther McVey. Laura Kuenssberg: Appointment is no 'safety first' move Fallon: My conduct 'fell short' and I quit A profile of Sir Michael Fallon 'Politician put his hand on my thigh' In a statement, Mr Williamson said he was ""determined to ensure that the armed forces receive the recognition they deserve for the great work they do, including through the Armed Forces Covenant, and that they evolve both to meet the changing threats that we face and to ensure that they properly represent the modern society that they defend"". He told reporters it was an ""immense privilege"" to be able to work with Britain's armed forces. He said his priority would be to continue to focus on ""countering"" Daesh, or so-called Islamic State, and ""making sure national security is at the forefront of everything we do"". BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said that while Mr Williamson was seen as an effective operator some Conservatives were furious that an MP with no ministerial experience had been promoted to the cabinet. One senior Conservative told her: ""MPs are deeply unhappy he has used the position of chief whip to benefit himself and has deserted his post at such a crucial time"". Asked about claims he lacks ministerial experience, Mr Williamson said: ""I've been a minister as chief whip, but it was a little bit quieter when you're chief whip, not so much publicity."" This video can not be played Some MPs 'furious' at Gavin Williamson appointment One Tory MP, Sarah Wollaston, told BBC Radio 4's World at One that Penny Mordaunt and Tobias Ellwood had been possible alternatives adding: ""These are decisions that are made through patronage. Part of the role of the chief whip is to advise the prime minister about the suitability of the candidate."" But Conservative MP Bob Stewart - a former Army colonel - described Mr Williamson as a ""decent, calm man... he's also a very thoughtful man"". ""He won't know much about defence but I believe the civil service in the Ministry of Defence, the generals and the Armed Forces themselves won't mind that too much because he's the sort of person that will listen carefully, take advice but then make his own decision."" BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale Gavin Williamson has no military background and has never been a secretary of state. But he is youthful, a rising star and trusted by Number 10. He arrives at the Ministry of Defence at a difficult time. His first challenge will be to try to stave off more defence cuts. The Cabinet Office is currently carrying out a defence and security review which is due to report by the end of the year. All three services have been asked to put forward options for cuts. Although there has been a modest rise in the MoD's budget, it has still got to make more than Â£20bn of efficiency savings. There's also pressure to fund an increase in pay for the armed forces. They've been  struggling with both recruitment and retention. That also hasn't been helped by a political reluctance to put troops in harm's way - something they train for. There is still unfinished business against so-called Islamic State and Gavin Williamson will be the man who now oversees the RAF airstrikes. Few inside the military or the MoD will know much about him - even fewer on the international stage. The prime minister's official spokesman said Mr Williamson was not involved in reshuffle discussions, and said he was ""an excellent and hard-working chief whip and the prime minister thinks he will make an excellent defence secretary"". ""The PM is confident in the operation of the whips' office during her premiership."" In his resignation letter, Sir Michael Fallon said a number of allegations that had surfaced about MPs, including himself, had been false, but added: ""I accept that in the past I have fallen below the high standards that we require of the Armed Forces that I have the honour to represent."" Who is Gavin Williamson? Gavin Williamson keeps a tarantula - not this one - on his desk 41 years old Married with two children Born near Scarborough Ran a Staffordshire pottery business before entering Parliament MP South Staffordshire since 2010 and was Parliamentary aide to ex-PM David Cameron Chief whip - in charge of party discipline - since July 2016 Keeps a pet tarantula called Cronus on his desk at Westminster Also a patron of the World Owl Trust and has built a house for hedgehogs in his garden Read a full profile of Gavin Williamson Recap: Reaction to announcement Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said Sir Michael had a record to be proud of as defence secretary. ""I've known Michael for many years,"" he said. ""He has been a great colleague and a great defence secretary.""

"He's the Tory enforcer who kept a tarantula on his desk and joked about using a ""sharpened carrot"" to get his way. Now Gavin Williamson has been propelled into his first cabinet role in the wake of Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon's sudden resignation. So what more do we know about a politician seen as rising star but whose rapid elevation has apparently upset some of his colleagues? Williamson named defence secretary Live updates and reaction Theresa May's chief whip, first elected to Parliament in 2010, wasn't among the bookmakers' favourites for the Ministry of Defence vacancy. The South Staffordshire MP has no military background and had little opportunity to build up a public profile because his role in the whips office meant he did not speak in Parliament. Raised near Scarborough by Labour-supporting parents, he ran a Staffordshire pottery firm, making and selling ceramic tableware, before becoming an MP. After entering Parliament, Mr Williamson was given a role in the Northern Ireland Office in 2011, and then became David Cameron's backbench aide. He was appointed a CBE in the ex-PM's controversial resignation honours list,telling the Stourbridge News he was,external""extremely honoured and humbled"" at the award. And he didn't fall out of favour as Theresa May took over in July 2016 - ""literally walking out with one prime minister and in with the next"" in the words of friend and fellow Tory MP James Wharton. Date of birth:25 June 1976 (aged 41) Job:MP for South Staffordshire, since 2010. Chief whip from June 2016, now defence secretary Education:Went to to Raincliffe Comprehensive School and Scarborough Sixth Form College; studied social sciences at the University of Bradford Family:Married with two children. His father worked at the local council, his mother at a job centre. Both were Labour voters Honours:Awarded a CBE in 2016 in David Cameron's resignation honours for political and public service After a disappointing general election for the Conservatives, he played a key role in brokering the Â£1bn deal with the DUP to prop up their minority government. But until now, that tarantula might have been the most commonly-cited fact about the 41-year-old - whose successor as chief whip tweeted a picture of his desk on taking over. Allow Twitter content?

Gavin Williamson (right) shakes hands with the DUP's Jeffrey Donaldson And spiders aren't the only animals close to his heart - he's also a patron of the World Owl Trust and has built a house for hedgehogs in his garden. He might be kind to animals, but there was a hint of a less accommodating approach in his speech to the Conservative Party conference as he described his methods in the whips office. ""We take a carrot and stick approach,"" he told delegates. ""Personally I don't much like the stick, but it is amazing what can be achieved with a sharpened carrot."" On being appointed as chief whip: ""I was absolutely flabbergasted, but I accepted immediately."" On his pet tarantula: ""You have to look at all different ways to persuade people to vote with the government and it's great to have Cronus as part of the team"" In the Commons: ""It's very important to use our gardens which are a specific habitat for hedgehogs.

"Sir Michael, with a reputation for being unflappable, earned the title of Minister for the Today programme. He was considered Mr Reliable, surviving three decades on the political frontline and serving under four Conservative prime ministers. But it was a hand on the knee 15 years ago that proved to be the beginning of the end for Sir Michael Fallon. Amid a flurry of revelations of sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour in the political world - themselves prompted by the Harvey Weinstein allegations - he confirmed he was rebuked by journalist Julia Hartley-Brewer for touching her knee during a dinner in 2002. A day later he became the first politician to resign in a scandal that looks set to dog Westminster, acknowledging ""what might have been acceptable 15, 10 years ago is clearly not acceptable now"". Michael Fallon resigns, saying his conduct 'fell short' Michael Fallon 'apologised for touching journalist's knee' The Conservative MP entered office when Margaret Thatcher was prime minister in 1983, and for more than 30 years he worked his way up the ranks of the party. His time as defence secretary was characterised by his role overseeing UK military efforts against the so-called Islamic State in the Middle East. With a reputation for being unflappable, he earned the title of Minister of the Today programme. Michael Fallon campaigning during the 1983 Darlington by-election Date of birth:14 May 1952 (aged 65) Job:MP for Sevenoaks, Kent, since 1997. Defence secretary from July 2014 to 1 November 2017 Education:Privately educated at Epsom College, in Surrey; Studied classics and ancient history at the University of St Andrews Family:Married to Wendy Payne. The couple have two sons Honours:Knighted in 2016 in David Cameron's resignation honours Like many of his peers, he came to Parliament first as a researcher in the late 1970s. In 1983 he unsuccessfully fought a by-election in Darlington, only to win it 77 days later after Mrs Thatcher called a general election. Four years later, he was serving as private parliament secretary to Energy Secretary Cecil Parkinson, before becoming a minister in the education department in July 1990. That autumn, when pressure was mounting on Mrs Thatcher to resign, Sir Michael was among a group of supporters, alongside Michael Portillo, who tried to persuade the long-serving prime minister to stay on. John Major took over as prime minister and kept Sir Michael in his government. This video can not be played Sir Michael Fallon: ""Not right for me to go on as defence secretary"". ""I accept that in the past I have fallen below the high standards that we require of the Armed Forces that I have the honour to represent,"" written in his resignation letter. ""This election shows that Labour is now a serious risk to our national security, to our economic security and to the security of your family,""speaking in September 2015. ""It is through the EU that you exchange criminal records and passenger records and work together on counter-terrorism... We need the collective weight of the EU when you are dealing with Russian aggression or terrorism. You need to be part of these big partnerships,""making his case in February 2016 to remain in the European Union. ""We must always be ready to answer the call from further away, from fragile democracies, from the very poorest, from the hardest hit. That means deploying our ships, our planes, and yes, our troops on the ground where we and our allies are asked to help."" In his 2017 Conservative Party conference speech. But his political career stalled when he lost his Darlington seat to Labour's Alan Milburn in the 1992 General Election. After leaving the House of Commons, he founded a group of children's nurseries called Just Learning. But he bounced back in 1997 as MP for Sevenoaks, although his party were now out of power with Tony Blair's Labour Party running the country. It was another 13 years before the Conservatives returned to power - Sir Michael was one of a limited number of ministers from the Major years to return to the front benches. He was made deputy chairman and given a number of ministerial posts before being handed the defence brief in 2014. Sir Michael was seen by his party as a good media performer, and was often the person trusted to appear on TV and radio at difficult times. Amid the turmoil of two difficult general elections and the EU referendum - and the changes of prime minister that followed - he remained as defence secretary. That was, until he decided to resign on Wednesday evening. Julia Hartley-Brewer says she has a good, friendly, bantery relationship with Sir Michael ""I like Sir Michael Fallon, I have always got on very well with him andâ¦ I have always had a good, friendly, bantery relationship [with him], which is why I didn't take the issue seriously at the time and haven't since.""

"University officials said Brianna Brochu was no longer a student A white US university student is facing a hate crime charge after admitting to smearing bodily fluids on her black roommate's possessions, in an apparent attempt to force her out of the room. Brianna Brochu, 18, has already been charged with misdemeanour criminal mischief and breach of peace. Police in West Hartford, Connecticut, said they had asked a judge to add a felony bigotry charge. University president Greg Woodward said Ms Brochu was no longer a student. Her campaign against roommate Chennel Rowe apparently came to light via Instagram posts in which she bragged about her actions. Chennel Rowe suspects she was made ill by her roommate's actions In one post, published by local media and described by Ms Rowe in a Facebook video, she reportedly wrote: ""Finally did it yo girl got rid of her roommate!! After 1 Â½ month of spitting in her coconut oil, putting moldy clam dip in her lotions... putting her toothbrush places where the sun doesn't shine, and so much more I can finally say goodbye Jamaican Barbie."" In astatement,externaladdressed to students, Mr Woodward said Ms Brochu's actions were ""reprehensible"" and the incident ""deeply disturbing"". ""As of this morning, Brianna Brochu is no longer a student at the University of Hartford. She will not be returning to the institution,"" he said. Ms Brochu appeared at Hartford Community Court on Wednesday morning but did not comment during the brief appearance. In the Facebook video, Ms Rowe said she had felt ""unwanted"" and ""disrespected"" by Ms Brochu after moving into the room. She described becoming sick and said she had suffered ""extreme throat pain"", which she alleged was connected to Ms Brochu's actions. ""I keep looking at this paragraph, right, because the paragraph said so much stuff she'd done, at the same time she said she's done so much more. ""But I don't know the so much more.

"This video can not be played Only childhood videos of Hamza bin Laden had been seen before this wedding footage Osama Bin Laden's personal diary, video of his son Hamza's wedding and documentaries about himself were among files found on the al-Qaeda leader's computer, the CIA has revealed. Nearly half a million of the files have been released, the fourth such tranche. Bin Laden's computer was taken duringthe 2011 US raid in the Pakistani town of Abbottabadin which he died. Some contents are being withheld over security or because they are corrupted or pornographic, the CIA said. CIA director Mike Pompeo said the release included 18,000 documents, 79,000 audio files and images and more than 10,000 videos which shed light on the ""plans and workings of this terrorist organisation"". The videos include a clip from the wedding of his son Hamza - thought to be his favourite son. Hamza has been mooted as a future al-Qaeda leader. Analysis of objects shown in the video suggest it was filmed in Iran. Previously only childhood videos of Hamza had been publicly seen. Bin Laden himself is not seen in the video but one of the wedding attendees says that the ""father of the groom, the prince of the mujahideen"" is joyous at his son's marriage and his joy will ""spread to all the mujahideen"", AP said. Osama Bin Laden was killed during a raid by US special forces Other senior al-Qaeda figures can also be seen in the footage,external, according to analysts from the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) who have been studying the newly released files. The militants include Mohammed Islambouli, the brother of the man who killed Egyptian leader Anwar Sadat in 1981, the FDD says. In recent years al-Qaeda has released audio messages from Hamza Bin Laden threatening the US, calling for the Saudi government to be overthrown and encouraging jihadist action in Syria. An image of him as a boy was superimposed onto a picture of the New York World Trade Center on the recent anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. The al-Qaeda leader had a series of animated films on his hard drive including Antz, Cars, Chicken Little and The Three Musketeers. There were also several YouTube videos, including a viral clip from the UK called ""Charlie bit my finger"" and videos about crocheting, including one entitled ""How to crochet a flower"". The role-playing computer game Final Fantasy VII was also on the computer. Bin Laden also had copies of three documentaries about him, including one called Where in the World is Osama bin Laden, as well as National Geographic documentaries including Kung Fu Killers, Inside the Green Berets and World's Worst Venom, AP reported. The al-Qaeda leader lived in the walled compound with several members of his family. Three other men - one of Bin Laden's sons and two couriers - and a woman were also killed in the raid. The 228 pages of Bin Laden's handwritten notes cover an array of topics, including the 2011 Arab uprisings, which Bin Laden did not see coming, the FDD says. The documents also show that Bin Laden was still in charge of al-Qaeda up until his death and was in regular communication with subordinates around the world. He spent time trying to understand US strategy in Afghanistan and Iraq and had parts of the investigative journalist Bob Woodward's book Obama's Wars translated for him. Another document written by a senior militant examines al-Qaeda's relationship with Iran, according to the FDD analysts, saying that despite disagreements their ""interests intersect"", particularly because they are both ""enemies of America"". Last year the US state department said Iran had since at least 2009enabled al-Qaeda to move funds and fighters through the country to South Asia and Syria,external. The CIA said the released documents also gave an insight into ideological differences between Bin Laden's al-Qaeda and the more recently formed so-called Islamic State (IS) group, as well as disagreements within al-Qaeda itself over tactics.

"This video can not be played New York truck attack: Who is Sayfullo Saipov? The main suspect in the New York truck rampage that killed eight people on Tuesday has told investigators he began planning the attack a year ago. Sayfullo Saipov, 29, said he intended to kill as many people as possible and ""felt good"" about the Halloween attack. The Uzbek immigrant, who faces federal terrorism charges, says he was inspired by so-called Islamic State. He was shot and injured by police at the scene. US President Donald Trump tweeted that he should receive the death penalty. The charges filed against Mr Saipov are federal, which means the government can override New York state's ban on capital punishment. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Saipov appeared in court in a wheelchair 24 hours after mowing down cyclists and pedestrians on a bike lane in Lower Manhattan on Tuesday. Six people died at the scene and two more in hospital. Twelve people were injured, four of whom remain in critical condition. What we know and don't know Prosecutors say Mr Saipov spoke freely to them, waiving his right to avoid self-incrimination while in custody. According to federal court papers, he said: The attack was a year in the planning and he carried out a trial run with a rental truck last month He intentionally chose Halloween because he believed there would be more people in the streets He originally planned to target the Brooklyn Bridge as well He wanted to display Islamic State (IS) flags on the truck, but decided not to draw attention to himself He was inspired by 90 graphic and violent propaganda videos found on his phone - in particular, one in which IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi asks what Muslims are doing to avenge deaths in Iraq. Mr Saipov was charged with one count of providing material support and resources to IS and another count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles. Read more on the suspect Why Uzbek migrants are radicalised New York Police's Deputy Commissioner John Miller said the suspect appeared ""to have followed almost exactly to a 'T'"" IS instructions on how to carry out such an attack. The FBI says they have located a second Uzbek man, 32-year-old Mukhammadzoir Kadirov, who was wanted for questioning in connection with the attack. Sayfullo Saipov had reportedly lived in Tampa, Florida, before moving to Paterson, New Jersey. He arrived in America from Uzbekistan in 2010 and is a legal resident of the country. Uber confirmed he had been working as a driver for them. Mr Saipov, who was shot and injured by police, appeared in court in a wheelchair CBS News quotes an intelligence source as saying he was known to US authorities after his name was associated with the subjects of FBI counter-terrorism investigations in 2015. The source says he had some contact with individuals who were considered radicalised extremists, at least one of whom was Uzbek. It is unclear whether those being investigated were in the US or overseas. It is not known if Mr Saipov, who was not the main focus of the investigation, was interviewed at that time by the FBI. New York has increased the police presence at key transport hubs, and there will be additional uniformed and plain-clothes police on duty at Sunday's New York Marathon. President Trump said he was taking steps to end the diversity lottery programme - the immigration system under which the suspect entered the country. What is the diversity green card lottery? How did Trump do in his terror response? But on Thursday, the US president drew back from an earlier call to send the suspect to the US military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, suggesting it would take too long. Allow Twitter content?

The administration says it has not ruled out adding Uzbekistan to a list of countries in the president's proposed travel ban. The mayor of New York City and the governor of New York state have both praised the resilience of New Yorkers - and urged people not to ""politicise"" a tragedy that took eight lives. Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio also suggested New York's strict gun control laws had ensured that high-powered weapons could not get into the hands of terrorists. The attacker rented the truck from a New Jersey branch of retailer Home Depot on Tuesday afternoon before driving to New York City and entering the bike lane, police said. Video cameras show the van driving at very high speed, appearing to target bike riders and pedestrians. After the truck collided with a school bus, the truck driver emerged and brandished what appeared to be two weapons.

"This video can not be played What exactly is the Bank of England interest rate? The Bank of England has raised interest rates from 0.5% to 0.75% after much speculation. Expectations of a strengthening economy, solid employment levels, more consumer spending and the potential for wages to rise have all played a part in the decision. The Bank's main priority is to keep the rising cost of living - known as inflation - under control. It uses its key interest rate, known as the Bank rate or base rate, which is the reference point for how much banks and building societies pay savers and charge borrowers in interest. Generally, a rise in the Bank rate is good for the UK's 45 million savers and bad for borrowers - but the reality is a bit more nuanced. Here are the key points. More than3.5 millionresidential mortgages are on a variable or tracker rate The average standard variable rate mortgage is4.72% On a Â£150,000 variable mortgage, a rise to 0.75% is likely to increase the annual cost byÂ£224 A Bank rate rise does not guarantee the equivalent increase in interest paid to savers. Half did not move after the last rate rise No easy access savings account at a major High Street bank pays interest of more than0.5% Across the UK, 9.1 million households have a mortgage. Of these, more than 3.5 million are on a standard variable rate or a tracker rate. These are the people who would be most affected, as their monthly payments would increase. The relatively small rise will not be particularly painful for the vast majority of householders, although debt charities say that some squeezed families will find this extra burden a real challenge. Those on such variable rates tend to be older, and with relatively small outstanding mortgage balances. The average outstanding balance is Â£112,000. For somebody with 20 years left on this mortgage, the monthly bill rise by about Â£14 a month. For those with a larger balance, then clearly the rise in the mortgage bill will be greater. The vast majority of new mortgage loans - 96% - are on fixed interest rates, typically for two or five years. Currently half of all outstanding loans are on fixed rates, equating to about 4.7 million households. Some of these rates are expected to rise after the latest announcement. Of course, none of these borrowers would see an immediate rise. However, when such borrowers reach the end of their term, they may find they have to make higher monthly payments. That said, they could - depending on when they took out their loan - end up on a cheaper deal. Lenders offering fixed rates tend to be especially competitive. Some rates may rise on other types of borrowing such as personal loans and credit cards. Should they rise, that would have relatively little impact on a credit card interest rate that is generally about 18%. When base rates rise, so do savings rates, in theory. But it depends on the extent to which banks and building societies want to increase their deposits. So after November's rate increase, banks were slow to pass on any rise to savers, or they typically passed ona fraction of the full increase. In fact, half of all savings accounts did not move at all after the last Bank rate rise in November. Commentators say savers could probably expect something similar this time. According to the Bank of England, returns on longer-term cash Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs) were little changed in December. Yet they jumped significantly in January, with average returns on cash ISAs going up from 0.36% to 0.94%. In February and March they held steady at 0.86%, before falling subsequently to 0.63% by the end of June. For the average cash Isa saver with Â£11,200 locked away, the latest rise - if passed on - could mean Â£28 more a year in interest. Any rate rise might also good for retirees buying an annuity - a financial product that provides an income for life. Annuity rates follow the yields - or interest rates - on long-dated government bonds, otherwise known as gilts. These yields could be expected to rise amid an environment of rising interest rates, giving retirees better value for money when they buy an annuity. Back in November 2011, a 65-year-old buying a joint annuity for Â£100,000 would have got an annual income of Â£5,404. Last year, that had dropped by Â£1,318 to Â£4,086. However, by now this has risen to about Â£4,670. Depending on how the market views the likelihood of further base rate rises, annuity rates may continue to creep up. According to Willliam Burrows, of Better Retirement, a 1% rise in gilt yields translates into an 8% rise in annuity rates - but this remains a long-term consideration. ""Annuity rates have been in the doldrums since the EU referendum in 2016, when gilt yields fell dramatically. Any increase in the bank rate should result in higher gilt yields, which will in turn lead to higher annuities,"" he said. ""However, don't hold your breath waiting for annuity rates to rise, because it is normally a slow process."" But we are still a long way from the heady days of the 1990s, when a Â£100,000 pension pot would have bought an annual income of about Â£15,000 a year.

"The Bank of England will deliver one of the most closely watched interest rate decisions since the financial crisis later on Thursday. Economists and investors are expecting the first increase in a decade. In September, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) laid the groundwork for an increase ""over the coming months"" if economic growth remained stable. If the Bank raises rates from the current 0.25%, it would represent the first increase since July 2007. Commercial banks use the Bank of England's base rate as a reference point for their accounts and loans. Higher rates are expected to hit the 3.7 million households with a standard variable rate (SVR) or tracker mortgage. However, they will also benefit a large share of the 45 million savers who are likely to enjoy higher returns from accounts that pay variable interest rates. Charities and business groups have warned the Bank against raising rates, which they claim will put a strain on homeowners and companies struggling to make ends meet. However, mortgage lenderNationwide has described the impact of a small rise in interest rates as ""modest""for borrowers whose repayments are linked to the base rate. Official data show more homeowners are fixing the interest rate charged on their mortgage than a decade ago. The total share of new mortgages taken out on a fixed rate was just under 88% in the second quarter of 2017, according to the Bank of England. This compares with 46% at the start of 2008. Financial markets believe there is more than a 90% chance that the Bank will increase rates to 0.5%, just over a year after reducing them to a new low of 0.25% in the wake of the Brexit vote. Not all economists favour a rise though. Danny Blanchflower, a former member of the MPC and now economics professor at Dartmouth college in the US, said he saw ""nothing"" in the recent economic data to justify higher interest rates. ""We've seen an inflation jump due to a fall in the value of the pound. But that's a once-off jump that's going to drop off in the next few months. Real wages are falling. Retail sales are falling. ""Growth in the UK is anaemic at best,"" Prof Blanchflower said. But Dame DeAnne Julius, also a former MPC member and chair of University College London, is ""absolutely"" in favour of a rate rise. ""Although I'm sure that the fall in sterling has been part of the story, it's certainly not the whole story,"" she said. ""The degree of slack in the economy... is down. Unemployment is at a 40-year low. Also the negative effects of having such low interest rates for such a long period of time are really showing up."" This video can not be played Where were you when interest rates last went up? Official economic growth figures showedthe UK economy expanded by 0.4% in the three months to the end of Septembercompared with the previous quarter. This is stronger than the 0.3% expansion expected by the Bank. In September, the MPC said that a ""majority"" of members believed that some withdrawal of stimulus would be appropriate if the economy continues to grow at a steady pace. A 0.4% increase in gross domestic product (GDP) may sound unspectacular. The average quarterly growth rate since 1993 has been about 0.6%. But weaker investment and productivity means the economy and living standards may never grow at the same pace as seen before the financial crisis. This means the Bank may have to raise rates to keep a lid on inflation, even if growth remains subdued. As Bank of England governor Mark Carney put it: ""The speed limit, if you will, of the economy has slowed."" In other words, this may be as good as it gets. Prices have been rising faster than pay in recent months, and this has put pressure on UK households. Inflation,as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI), stood at a five-year high of 3% in September. This is also above the Bank's estimate of 2.8%. Policymakers believe inflation will peak just above 3% in the coming months. The UK's jobs-rich recovery has continued, with unemployment falling to a four-decade low of 4.3% in recent months. But pay growth has remained weak. Average total weekly earnings grew by 2.2% in the three months to August compared with the same period a year earlier, while the Bank of England's agents noted in September that pay deals had ""clustered around 2% to 3%"". In the decade before the financial crisis, earnings growth averaged 4.25%. However, there are tentative signs that pay could be picking up, particularly for the 82% of workers in the private sector. Whatever the Bank of England decides on Thursday, one thing is clear. Any rate rises will be ""limited and gradual"". Uncertainties remain on the horizon. The Bank's current forecasts are predicated on a smooth Brexit, and it is likely to stress that future changes to monetary policy are not on a pre-determined course and will be dependent on developments within the economy.

"Cpl James Dunsby, L/Cpl Edward Maher and L/Cpl Craig Roberts died in July 2013 Two men have been charged with negligence over the deaths of three soldiers during an SAS selection march in the Brecon Beacons. L/Cpl Edward Maher, L/Cpl Craig Roberts and Cpl James Dunsby were taking part in a 16-mile (25km) recruitment exercise on the hottest day of 2013. The Service Prosecution Authority confirmed charges had been brought. The case will be heard in a military court and the maximum sentence is two years detention. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ""Any decision to prosecute any personnel, veteran or serving, is made by the Service Prosecution Authority (SPA), an independent body."" L/Cpl Roberts, 24, from Penrhyn Bay, Conwy county, and L/Cpl Maher, 31 of Winchester, died on the exercise in July, while Cpl Dunsby, 31, from Wiltshire, was taken to hospital and died 17 days later. All had suffered from hyperthermia, where the body no longer controls core temperature. Initially, the SPA decided charges were not going to be directed against the pair, but relatives of the soldiers who died asked for the case to be reviewed. The soldiers will appear in a military court, which provides jurisdiction for all members of the UK's armed forces, for both service and criminal matters.

"This video can not be played Carles Puigdemont said on Tuesday that Spain had a ""democratic deficit"" Spain's state prosecutor has requested a European arrest warrant for ousted Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont and four others over their role in a disputed independence referendum. All five failed to show up at Spain's high court on accusations of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds. Mr Puigdemont's lawyer said the climate was ""not good"" for him to appear. Nine other sacked members of Catalonia's regional government did turn up for questioning at the court. Prosecutors in Madrid asked for eight of them to be held in custody following their testimony. Spain has been gripped by a constitutional crisis since the referendum was held on 1 October in defiance of a constitutional court ruling that had declared it illegal. Last week, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy imposed direct rule on Catalonia, dissolving the regional parliament and calling local elections for 21 December. Catalonia crisis in 300 words What next for Spain? This came after Catalan lawmakers voted to declare the independence of the affluent north-eastern region. The Catalan government said that of the 43% of potential voters who took part in the referendum, 90% were in favour of independence. Mr Puigdemont is in Belgium and says he will not return to Spain unless he and four of his fellow sacked colleagues receive guarantees of a fair trial. Belgium's federal prosecutor has said the law will be applied once the arrest warrant has been received, according to Efe news agency. In addition to Mr Puigdemont, prosecutors have asked Spain's high court judge to issue arrest warrants for the following Catalan officials: Meritxell Serret, former agriculture minister Antoni ComÃ­n, former health minister LluÃ­s Puig, former culture minister Clara PonsatÃ­, former education minister Reports suggest some of them requested to appear before the judges at the Madrid court appearance via video conference. Mr Puigdemont's Belgian lawyer told Reuters news agency that he would co-operate with the authorities in Spain and Belgium. The deposed leader was seen in a cafe in Brussels while other Catalan government members appeared in court. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Prosecutors asked the high court judge to jail eight of the nine sacked members who turned up for questioning. They included Deputy Vice President Oriol Junqueras, Interior Minister Joaquim Forn, Foreign Affairs Minister RaÃ¼l Romeva, and Justice Minister Carles MundÃ³. Members of the deposed Catalan regional government arrive at court in Madrid The ninth, Catalonia's former Business Minister Santi Vila, should be granted a â¬50,000 ($58,000; Â£44,000) bail, prosecutors said. He resigned before the Catalan parliament voted for independence on Friday. The Catalan leaders are yet to be formally charged. They are accused of rebellion - which carries a maximum 30-year jail term - as well as sedition and misuse of funds. A judge will decide whether the officials should go to jail, pending an investigation that could potentially lead to a trial. She can also grant them conditional bail and order them to surrender their passports. The court summons had given the sacked leaders three days to pay a deposit of â¬6.2m to cover potential liabilities. Mr Puigdemont's handling of the crisis has drawn criticism among some other Catalan politicians, with left-wing parliamentary deputy Joan Josep Nuet criticising him for creating ""yet more bewilderment"". This video can not be played Senior Catalan figure Alfred Bosch says European leaders ""are wrong"" on Catalonia Despite Mr Puigdemont's position, the Spanish government insists it has no influence over the country's judiciary, the BBC's Tom Burridge in Barcelona says. But if those Catalan politicians appearing in court are denied bail it will cause further anger among those who want Catalonia to break away, our correspondent adds. Meanwhile, five other senior members of the Catalan parliament, as well as speaker Carme Forcadell, are facing the same charges but, because of their parliamentary immunity, their cases are being handled by the Supreme Court. Their hearings have been postponed until 9 November. The man who wants to break up Spain Protesters in support of - but also against - the Catalan leaders gathered outside the high court Spain's central bank warned on Thursday,externalof the ""significant risks and economic costs"" resulting from the crisis, and that Catalonia's economy could fall into recession.

"A phrase consistently in the headlines - and one Twitter feed in particular - has been named the word of the year by dictionary publisher Collins. ""Fake news"" became synonymous with statements from US President Donald Trump, as he railed against the media. And it appears the rest of the world has followed suit, with its use rising by 365% in 2017. As with previous words of the year picked by the publisher, ""fake news"" will feature in their next dictionary. Politics had a big influence on the short list, with ""Antifa"" and ""Echo-chamber"" also taking their spots. But even ""Insta"" - linked to the photo-sharing app Instagram - and ""fidget spinner"" could not beat the top phrase, defined by Collins as ""false, often sensational, information disseminated under the guise of news reporting"". It is the fifth year that Collins has highlighted a trending word or phrase, with previous winners including ""Brexit"" and ""Geek"". The rise and rise of fake news Fake news worries 'are growing' 'What's the best way to tame the beast? President Trump has not been alone in using the term. Both Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have included it in speeches, and social media has been littered with accusations. Helen Newstead, Collins' head of language content, said: ""'Fake news', either as a statement of fact or as an accusation, has been inescapable this year, contributing to the undermining of society's trust in news reporting."" 2016- Brexit: Noun meaning ""the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union"". 2015- Binge-watch: Verb meaning ""to watch a large number of television programmes (especially all the shows from one series) in succession"". 2014- Photobomb: Verb meaning ""spoiling a photograph by stepping in front of them as the photograph is taken, often doing something silly such as making a funny face"". 2013- Geek: Countable noun meaning ""someone who is skilled with computers, and who seems more interested in them than in people"". The Labour leader will also be pleased to hear that ""Corbynmania"" enjoyed a resurgence thanks to general election coverage, after surfacing in 2015. Other new words hitting the shortlist included ""gig economy"", ""gender fluid"" and ""cuffing season"" - when single people look for a partner just to keep them warm in the winter months.

"Sir Michael, with a reputation for being unflappable, earned the title of Minister for the Today programme. He was considered Mr Reliable, surviving three decades on the political frontline and serving under four Conservative prime ministers. But it was a hand on the knee 15 years ago that proved to be the beginning of the end for Sir Michael Fallon. Amid a flurry of revelations of sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour in the political world - themselves prompted by the Harvey Weinstein allegations - he confirmed he was rebuked by journalist Julia Hartley-Brewer for touching her knee during a dinner in 2002. A day later he became the first politician to resign in a scandal that looks set to dog Westminster, acknowledging ""what might have been acceptable 15, 10 years ago is clearly not acceptable now"". Michael Fallon resigns, saying his conduct 'fell short' Michael Fallon 'apologised for touching journalist's knee' The Conservative MP entered office when Margaret Thatcher was prime minister in 1983, and for more than 30 years he worked his way up the ranks of the party. His time as defence secretary was characterised by his role overseeing UK military efforts against the so-called Islamic State in the Middle East. With a reputation for being unflappable, he earned the title of Minister of the Today programme. Michael Fallon campaigning during the 1983 Darlington by-election Date of birth:14 May 1952 (aged 65) Job:MP for Sevenoaks, Kent, since 1997. Defence secretary from July 2014 to 1 November 2017 Education:Privately educated at Epsom College, in Surrey; Studied classics and ancient history at the University of St Andrews Family:Married to Wendy Payne. The couple have two sons Honours:Knighted in 2016 in David Cameron's resignation honours Like many of his peers, he came to Parliament first as a researcher in the late 1970s. In 1983 he unsuccessfully fought a by-election in Darlington, only to win it 77 days later after Mrs Thatcher called a general election. Four years later, he was serving as private parliament secretary to Energy Secretary Cecil Parkinson, before becoming a minister in the education department in July 1990. That autumn, when pressure was mounting on Mrs Thatcher to resign, Sir Michael was among a group of supporters, alongside Michael Portillo, who tried to persuade the long-serving prime minister to stay on. John Major took over as prime minister and kept Sir Michael in his government. This video can not be played Sir Michael Fallon: ""Not right for me to go on as defence secretary"". ""I accept that in the past I have fallen below the high standards that we require of the Armed Forces that I have the honour to represent,"" written in his resignation letter.

""It is through the EU that you exchange criminal records and passenger records and work together on counter-terrorism... We need the collective weight of the EU when you are dealing with Russian aggression or terrorism. You need to be part of these big partnerships,""making his case in February 2016 to remain in the European Union. ""We must always be ready to answer the call from further away, from fragile democracies, from the very poorest, from the hardest hit. That means deploying our ships, our planes, and yes, our troops on the ground where we and our allies are asked to help."" In his 2017 Conservative Party conference speech. But his political career stalled when he lost his Darlington seat to Labour's Alan Milburn in the 1992 General Election. After leaving the House of Commons, he founded a group of children's nurseries called Just Learning. But he bounced back in 1997 as MP for Sevenoaks, although his party were now out of power with Tony Blair's Labour Party running the country. It was another 13 years before the Conservatives returned to power - Sir Michael was one of a limited number of ministers from the Major years to return to the front benches. He was made deputy chairman and given a number of ministerial posts before being handed the defence brief in 2014. Sir Michael was seen by his party as a good media performer, and was often the person trusted to appear on TV and radio at difficult times. Amid the turmoil of two difficult general elections and the EU referendum - and the changes of prime minister that followed - he remained as defence secretary. That was, until he decided to resign on Wednesday evening. Julia Hartley-Brewer says she has a good, friendly, bantery relationship with Sir Michael ""I like Sir Michael Fallon, I have always got on very well with him andâ¦ I have always had a good, friendly, bantery relationship [with him], which is why I didn't take the issue seriously at the time and haven't since."" Julia Hartley-Brewer ""You have championed our brave armed forces. You should take particular pride in the way the United Kingdom has risen to the challenge of tackling the barbaric threat of Daesh."" Theresa May, in a written reply to his resignation letter ""Michael Fallon is a decent man. But today I think he has demeaned himself and he has demeaned his office.""Former Labour leader Ed Miliband, who Sir Michael accused of stabbing his brother in the backand suggested he was also willing to stab the UK in the back.

"Actors Dustin Hoffman (L) and Kevin Spacey (R) have been accused of sexual misconduct Two Oscar-winning actors, a Hollywood filmmaker and a senior US news editor are the latest high-profile figures to be accused of sexual harassment. The actors Kevin Spacey and Dustin Hoffman have been accused of sexual misconduct and have issued apologies. Meanwhile, six women have accused Brett Ratner, director of the Rush Hour film series and X-Men: The Last Stand, of sexual harassment or misconduct. Ratner's lawyer ""categorically"" denied all of the accusations on his behalf. A representative for Spacey released a short statement to the US media, saying the actor ""is taking the time necessary to seek evaluation and treatment. No other information is available at this time"". A growing number of allegations have been made against public figures in recent weeks. The allegations have been sparked by multiple women speaking out against the Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, and a subsequent campaign encouraging victims to share their stories of sexual harassment under the #metoo hashtag. So who has been accused of misconduct? New allegations have emerged from a number of men accusing Kevin Spacey of sexual misconduct. US filmmaker Tony Montana claims he was groped by the actor in a Los Angeles bar in 2003. He says he was left with PTSD for six months after Spacey ""forcefully"" grabbed his crotch. Mr Montana told Radar Online,externalthat he was in his thirties when the incident took place at the Coronet Bar in LA. It follows an allegation made by Anthony Rapp that the House of Cards actor tried to ""seduce"" him when he was 14 years old. Kevin Spacey says he has no recollection of that encounter, and was ""beyond horrified"". Netflix halts House of Cards production Incidents regarding Spacey are also alleged to have taken place in the UK while the two-time Oscar winner was the artistic director at the Old Vic in London between 2004 and 2015. Mexican actor Roberto Cavazos, who acted in several plays at the theatre, claims Spacey ""routinely preyed"" on young male actors.

Natasha Henstridge, who appeared in Species and The Whole Ten Yards, claimed she had been forced into a sex act with Ratner as a teenager. The actress, now 43, was a 19-year-old model at the time she alleges Ratner stopped her from leaving a room at his New York apartment and then made her perform a sex act on him. ""He strong-armed me in a real way,"" she told the LA Times. ""He physically forced himself onto me."" Ratner's lawyer ""categorically"" denied all of the accusations on his behalf in response to the article. Separately,Ratner has filed a libel case in Hawaii,externalagainst a woman who accused him on Facebook of rape more than 10 years ago. Ratner says he has stepped away from dealings with movie studio Warner Bros since the allegations came to light. Read more about the allegations against Brett Ratner here. Dustin Hoffman has been accused of sexually harassing an intern on the set of one of his films in 1985. Anna Graham Hunter, a writer, says that when she was 17, the Oscar-winning actor groped her and made inappropriate comments about sex to her. She told The Hollywood Reporter,external: ""He was openly flirtatious, he grabbed my ass, he talked about sex to me and in front of me."" Hoffman apologised, and said he was sorry if he ""put her in an uncomfortable situation"". In a statement to the magazine, Hoffman said: ""I have the utmost respect for women and feel terrible that anything I might have done could have put her in an uncomfortable situation. I am sorry. It is not reflective of who I am."" The BBC has contacted representatives of Dustin Hoffman for his response to these allegations. Michael Oreskes resigned following accusations he kissed female colleagues without their consent Senior editor Michael Oreskes has resigned following accusations he kissed female colleagues without their consent during business meetings. The 63-year-old was asked to step down by the National Public Radio (NPR) network in response to the allegations. He has previously worked for the Associated Press and the New York Times. Two women spoke to the Washington Post on condition of anonymity,external, and reported stories of abrupt and unexpected kisses during business meetings. They said they were worried about career development if their names were made public. One of the women said that while she met Mr Oreskes in the hope of getting a job with the New York Times, he suggested that they eat room service lunch in a hotel, before he unexpectedly kissed her and ""slipped his tongue into her mouth"".

"This video can not be played Sir Michael Fallon: 'I've fallen below high standards' Theresa May is expected to name a new defence secretary after the resignation of Sir Michael Fallon on Wednesday. He stood down, saying his conduct had ""fallen short"" of the required standards after allegations of inappropriate sexual behaviour. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said a ""radical reshuffle"" was not expected, but instead a ""sideways move or single shuffle up"". Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson said the ""tone of politics had changed"". Fallon resigns saying conduct 'fell short' Rolling updates as new defence secretary named Kuenssberg: Fallon's 'painful' decision to resign Sir Michael is the first politician to quit following recently revealed claims of sexual harassment in Parliament. He told the BBC that what had been ""acceptable 15, 10 years ago is clearly not acceptable now"". Ruth Davidson said it was time to ""clean out the stables"" in British politics. She told the BBC: ""It isn't actually about sex.  It's about power.  It's always about power. And we as elected representatives have to hold ourselves to a higher standard. ""We're in positions of power so we can make things better for who comes after, not so that we can exert that power in a nefarious way."" In his resignation letter, Sir Michael said a number of allegations that had surfaced about MPs, including himself, had been false, but added: ""I accept that in the past I have fallen below the high standards that we require of the Armed Forces that I have the honour to represent."" This video can not be played Sir Michael Fallon: ""Not right for me to go on as defence secretary"". Sir Michael later told the BBC it ""was right"" for him to resign, adding: ""Parliament now has to look at itself and the prime minister has made very clear that conduct needs to be improved and we need to protect the staff of Westminster against any particular allegations of harassment."" When asked if he thought he should apologise, Mr Fallon said: ""I think we've all got to look back now at the past, there are always things you regret, you would have done differently."" Mrs May said she appreciated the ""serious manner"" in which Sir Michael had considered his Cabinet role and paid tribute to ""a long and impressive ministerial career"". Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external Laura Kuenssberg said that sources close to him do not believe he is ""some kind of predator"", but that he had not felt that he would be able to account for every encounter in his long ministerial career. She said there was already a ""fragile balance"" in Cabinet and that the prime minister would be wary when naming Sir Michael's successor. It was not just about appointing a figurehead for the military, she added, but with big issues like Brexit on the table, the appointment would be about ""keeping the political peace."" On Tuesday, a spokesman for Sir Michael confirmed that he was once rebuked by a journalist, Julia Hartley-Brewer, for putting his hand on her knee during a dinner in 2002. Ms Hartley-Brewer, a former political editor of the Sunday Express and regular political commentator, told BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight: ""If he has gone because he touched my knee 15 years ago, that is genuinely the most absurd reason for anyone to have lost their job in the history of the universe, so I hope it is not because of that."" The BBC understands fresh claims about his behaviour were raised on Wednesday, but Downing Street refused to comment.

"The decline in EU nurses and midwives wanting to work in the UK since the referendum is continuing, figures show. The trend wasfirst noticed earlier this year, and now a new batch of figures released by the Nursing and Midwifery Council have reinforced the idea that Brexit is having an impact. In September the register showed just over 36,200 EU nurses and midwives - over 2,700 less than a year before. But ministers said a rise in training places would compensate for the drop. That will take some time to start having an impact though, and union leaders believe the government in England may struggle to fill these places as they have removed bursaries for nursing degrees and introduced fees. The data released by the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) cover the number of nurses and midwives registered to work in the UK, not the numbers actually working. Rises in the numbers of nurses and midwives leaving the register was seen among all types of staff - those trained in the UK, in the EU and in the rest of the world.  Can't find your health trust?Browse the full list Rather search by typing?Back to search If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. But what marked the EU trend out was the rate of change being seen. There was a 67% rise in the number of EU nurses and midwives leaving the register in the 12 months up to September compared to the same period the year before. By comparison the number of UK-trained staff leaving the register rose by less than 10%. That rise in leavers was off-set by just over 1,000 new joiners from the EU, but that in itself was an 89% drop in the numbers who signed up the year before. The NMC pointed out this change in new joiners was also likely to have been influenced by the introduction of English language testing around the same time as the Brexit vote in the summer of 2016. Overall, the number of nurses and midwives on the register has started to drop for the first time in a decade. There were just under 690,000 nurses and midwives registered to work in the UK in September - over 1,600 less than there were the year before. This comes at a time when unions report there are significant shortages in the number of nurses employed by the NHS. Research by the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) said there were over 40,000 unfilled vacancies - one in nine posts. The NMC said the rising numbers leaving the profession across the board was ""worrying"" and needed to be responded to. An ageing workforce, which is seeing growing numbers reach retirement age, and the pressures of working in the health service have been cited as factors for UK-trained nurses leaving the register. RCN general secretary Janet Davies said it was ""no surprise"" EU nurses were also turning their backs on the UK given what was happening with Brexit. ""These alarming new figures represent a double whammy for the NHS and patients."" But the Department of Health played down the significance of the overall drop, pointing out it represented a ""mere"" 0.2% fall in the numbers registered to work. A spokeswoman said the number of training places would increase by 25% in the coming years and that ministers had been ""very clear"" that EU nationals would remain a valued part of the workforce after Brexit.

"The raid took place in Blantyre Road An armed gang tied up a family in their home in South Lanarkshire before stealing jewellery worth more than Â£100,000. Four men forced their way into the house in Blantyre Road, Bothwell, at about 19:30 on Tuesday. The father, 59, and mother, 56, were threatened with weapons including a knife before being tied up. Their 11-year-old son was also bound before they raided the property. Police said jewellery and watches worth a six-figure sum were taken from the home. The family were uninjured but left ""extremely"" shaken. The suspects all spoke in what is described as broken English. Det Insp Susie Cairns said: ""This was a very traumatic experience for this family and I would like to reassure the public that we are doing everything possible to track down the four men responsible. ""Officers are currently carrying out enquiries into this robbery and gathering CCTV footage to gather more information on the four men responsible. ""There are also additional police patrols in the area to provide public reassurance. ""We do, however, need the help of the local community and at this time we are urging anyone who may have seen these men in the area prior to the robbery taking place, or who may have seen them leaving afterwards, to contact police immediately."" All the suspects are said to be about 5ft 10in tall. The first is said to be stocky with an olive complexion, wearing dark-coloured clothing including a jacket, scarf, hat, tracksuit trousers and black boots. He was carrying a black-and-white rucksack.

"Sir Michael Fallon's resignation is the main story on the front pages of Thursday's newspapers. ""Commons sex furore: the first scalp"" is the headline inthe Daily Mail,external, whilstthe Sun,externalgoes for: ""Fallon his sword"". The Times,externalsays Sir Michael appeared to have weathered an apology issued earlier this week for repeatedly putting his hand on the knee of the journalist, Julia Hartley-Brewer, during a dinner in 2002. But - according tothe Daily Telegraph,external- friends of Sir Michael said that while no new allegations had been made against him, there were concerns that other incidents which he had previously considered to be ""flirtation"" were about to become public. The Sun says it understands Sir Michael had spent the past 48 hours contemplating his past behaviour. The newspaper quotes a source as saying that Sir Michael had told the prime minister he could not guarantee there would not be more stories like the one involving Ms Hartley-Brewer. The Daily Mail reports on one source claiming Chief Whip Gavin Williamson had advised Theresa May to fire the minister, although others insisted Sir Michael had resigned of his own accord following a face-to-face showdown in Number 10. The Spectator,externalsays the resignation is a clear indication that the government is keen to show that it takes a hard line approach when dealing with allegations of inappropriate behaviour from those in positions of power. According tothe Daily Mirror,external, the fear in Downing Street is that Sir Michael will not be the only scalp of the Westminster sleaze scandal. The Times quotes one minister as saying: ""This feels a lot like MPs' expenses scandal.  The mood in the tearoom is awful, the worst it's been since then."" The Guardian,externalreports that Mrs May is expected to appoint a new defence secretary without embarking on a wider reshuffle. According to the Daily Mail, Immigration Minister Brandon Lewis and Security Minister Ben Wallace are tipped as possible replacements. The Telegraph suggests Penny Mordaunt could become Britain's first female defence secretary as she is a former minister in the department and seen as reliable and a competent media performer. But the Times speculates about a move for Boris Johnson from the Foreign Office. The Telegraph,externalsays it can disclose that Buckingham Palace is understood to be ""not happy"" after Labour MPs tried to involve the Queen in a row about Brexit. On Wednesday, the party used an ancient parliamentary procedure known as the ""humble address"" to try to force the government to release secret documents about the economic impact of Brexit. The newspaper explains that, by convention, the Queen must respond to humble addresses, prompting concern that she will, in effect, have to pass comment on a political issue. Many City analysts are expecting the Bank of England to raise interest rates on Thursday - butthe Financial Times,externalbelieves that, on balance, it would be an unnecessary move and jumping the gun. It says underlying inflation has been so weak that there cannot be much risk in waiting to see some signs that it is picking up before increasing rates. The newspaper says that if the bank does put up rates, it should make clear that this is not the first of a series of increases. The Sun,externalreports that middle-class shoplifters are on the rise - stealing luxury items such as cheese, wine and Swiss chocolate. It says supermarket bosses have reported an increase in affluent, middle-aged shoppers who ""get a kick out of not paying for a bottle of wine of their Friday night steak"". One manager tells the newspaper: ""We are not talking about a few people stealing to feed themselves - they will clear whole shelves, go behind checkouts and take spirits, coffee, detergents, wine, chocolate.""

"This video can not be played New York truck attack: Who is Sayfullo Saipov? The main suspect in the New York truck rampage that killed eight people on Tuesday has told investigators he began planning the attack a year ago. Sayfullo Saipov, 29, said he intended to kill as many people as possible and ""felt good"" about the Halloween attack. The Uzbek immigrant, who faces federal terrorism charges, says he was inspired by so-called Islamic State. He was shot and injured by police at the scene. US President Donald Trump tweeted that he should receive the death penalty. The charges filed against Mr Saipov are federal, which means the government can override New York state's ban on capital punishment. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Saipov appeared in court in a wheelchair 24 hours after mowing down cyclists and pedestrians on a bike lane in Lower Manhattan on Tuesday. Six people died at the scene and two more in hospital. Twelve people were injured, four of whom remain in critical condition. What we know and don't know Prosecutors say Mr Saipov spoke freely to them, waiving his right to avoid self-incrimination while in custody. According to federal court papers, he said: The attack was a year in the planning and he carried out a trial run with a rental truck last month He intentionally chose Halloween because he believed there would be more people in the streets He originally planned to target the Brooklyn Bridge as well He wanted to display Islamic State (IS) flags on the truck, but decided not to draw attention to himself He was inspired by 90 graphic and violent propaganda videos found on his phone - in particular, one in which IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi asks what Muslims are doing to avenge deaths in Iraq. Mr Saipov was charged with one count of providing material support and resources to IS and another count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles. Read more on the suspect Why Uzbek migrants are radicalised New York Police's Deputy Commissioner John Miller said the suspect appeared ""to have followed almost exactly to a 'T'"" IS instructions on how to carry out such an attack. The FBI says they have located a second Uzbek man, 32-year-old Mukhammadzoir Kadirov, who was wanted for questioning in connection with the attack. Sayfullo Saipov had reportedly lived in Tampa, Florida, before moving to Paterson, New Jersey. He arrived in America from Uzbekistan in 2010 and is a legal resident of the country. Uber confirmed he had been working as a driver for them. Mr Saipov, who was shot and injured by police, appeared in court in a wheelchair CBS News quotes an intelligence source as saying he was known to US authorities after his name was associated with the subjects of FBI counter-terrorism investigations in 2015. The source says he had some contact with individuals who were considered radicalised extremists, at least one of whom was Uzbek. It is unclear whether those being investigated were in the US or overseas. It is not known if Mr Saipov, who was not the main focus of the investigation, was interviewed at that time by the FBI. New York has increased the police presence at key transport hubs, and there will be additional uniformed and plain-clothes police on duty at Sunday's New York Marathon. President Trump said he was taking steps to end the diversity lottery programme - the immigration system under which the suspect entered the country. What is the diversity green card lottery? How did Trump do in his terror response? But on Thursday, the US president drew back from an earlier call to send the suspect to the US military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, suggesting it would take too long. Allow Twitter content?

The administration says it has not ruled out adding Uzbekistan to a list of countries in the president's proposed travel ban. The mayor of New York City and the governor of New York state have both praised the resilience of New Yorkers - and urged people not to ""politicise"" a tragedy that took eight lives. Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio also suggested New York's strict gun control laws had ensured that high-powered weapons could not get into the hands of terrorists. The attacker rented the truck from a New Jersey branch of retailer Home Depot on Tuesday afternoon before driving to New York City and entering the bike lane, police said. Video cameras show the van driving at very high speed, appearing to target bike riders and pedestrians. After the truck collided with a school bus, the truck driver emerged and brandished what appeared to be two weapons.

"The 31-page indictment against Paul Manafort contained one surprising detail - that he listed one of his New York City properties for rent on the website Airbnb. The BBC spoke to a family who unwittingly rented the former Trump campaign manager's flat for a long weekend. Like any cautious Airbnb user, Suzanne was initially suspicious when she read the ad for an ""amazing full floor loft in Soho"". ""It took me a really long time to believe what I was seeing,"" says Suzanne, who asked her full name be withheld to protect her family's privacy. ""It was too good to be true."" It was December 2014, her father had just recovered after a long stay in hospital, and she wanted to give her family a break. So she and her husband Jeff began planning a whirlwind tour of the Big Apple with their three children. Four nights for a family of five in New York City can get very expensive, so Suzanne started combing through ads on Airbnb. Despite her fears the Soho listing might be a scam, Suzanne decided to take the risk. Jeff, Suzanne and their three kids were floored by the ""rock-star apartment"" When they arrived at 29 Howard Street in Manhattan, Suzanne says they met their Airbnb host James - or ""Jimmy"" as he introduced himself - who showed them how to take the keyed elevator up to the fourth floor, where the doors opened right into the flat. What they saw blew them away. The sprawling two-bedroom, two-bathroom loft was replete with a working fireplace, a professional-grade kitchen and stunning fourth-floor views of one of Manhattan's trendiest neighbourhoods. A portrait of Kurt Cobain hung on one wall; everything seemed to be brand new. ""I think we called it 'the rock star apartment',"" Suzanne recalls. ""It was exactly as pictured. It was wonderful, perfect."" Even meeting Jimmy was a bit like a rock star experience - he told Suzanne and Jeff he was an actor with a starring role in the 1999 comedy Detroit Rock City under his belt. Suzanne says he explained that he split his time between New York and Los Angeles, and made his living in property. Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? The biggest news wasn't about Manafort Manafort: Trump's former campaign chair Looking back now, Suzanne doesn't know why she didn't wonder how someone as young as Jimmy could afford the enormous, luxury flat. It was clear to the couple that no-one lived in apartment 4D - Jeff found the plastic packaging their sheets had come in. There were no clothes in the apartment, save for a couple of designer jackets hanging in a hallway closet. For the next four days, the family hit the town. They saw a performance of Hedwig and the Angry Inch, wandered the Museum of Modern Art, and dined at Soho's trendiest restaurants. After the family checked out and flew home to Chicago, Suzanne penned a rave review on Airbnb. Jeff reclines in the main living area of 4D ""The apartment made New York feel like ours,"" she wrote. ""Can't wait to come back and stay here again."" Suzanne says she did try to reach out to Jimmy to find out about returning, but doesn't remember hearing back. Eventually, the listing disappeared. Three years and a phone call from the BBC later, Suzanne and Jeff now know that their dream vacation apartment may in fact have belonged to Paul Manafort, Donald Trump's former campaign manager. On Monday, Mr Manafort turned himself in to the FBI after being charged with 12 counts, including money laundering and conspiring against the US government. He denies all the charges. According to the indictment, he paid $2.85m (Â£2.14m) for the fourth floor apartment at 29 Howard Street, allegedly using a shell company to make the purchase in 2012. This video can not be played Manafort's indictment: Where did all the money go? ""All the money used to purchase the condominium came from MANAFORT entities in Cyprus,""says the indictment,external. ""MANAFORT used the property from at least January 2015 through 2016 as an income-generating rental property, charging thousands of dollars a week on Airbnb, among other places."" The indictment goes on to allege that Manafort then applied for and received a $3.18m mortgage on the condominium, after telling his daughter and son-in-law to tell a bank appraiser that 29 Howard Street was their second home. Although the listing for the ""amazing full floor loft in Soho"" has disappeared, ""James"" - full name James DeBello - still has an active profile on Airbnb. In a phone call, Mr DeBello confirmed that he once had a starring role in Detroit Rock City (according to his lengthyIMDB profile,external, he also had parts in American Pie and Cabin Fever) and that in the past, he has given Airbnb guests keys to 29 Howard Street. James Debello (third from left) in his most known role as an actor - Detroit Rock City However, he claims that a friend named Kevin set up Airbnb rentals using DeBello's account and he only let people into 29 Howard Street as a favour to Kevin. DeBello says he has never met Manafort and no longer has contact information for Kevin, having not talked to him in three years. ""I think it's funny,"" he says of his bit part in the unfolding Manafort scandal. Multiple real estate companies havepublished listings,externalover the years of the fourth floor of 29 Howard Street, andmultiple US,externaloutlets have reported that this is indeed Manafort's apartment. Both the layout and decor of the flat in the real estate photos match Suzanne and Jeff's holiday pictures. ""It absolutely is the same apartment,"" says Jeff. Manafort pleaded not guilty in a federal courthouse on Monday, and was placed on house arrest, though it's unlikely he'll be doing so on Howard Street. A spokesman for Manafort says that he ""looks forward to having these allegations tried before a judge and jury"". As for Suzanne and Jeff, they still thought about their magical Soho apartment even before they knew it was a tiny part of a major American political scandal. ""When I'm in Soho, I stand there longingly,"" says Suzanne. ""This is good cocktail party fodder for sure."" Airbnb has not responded to BBC's request for comment.
