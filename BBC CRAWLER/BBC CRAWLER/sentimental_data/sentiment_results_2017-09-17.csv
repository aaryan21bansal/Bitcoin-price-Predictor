"This video can not be played Watch: The islanders caught between hurricanes Hurricane Maria has strengthened to a major category three hurricane, US forecasters say, as it heads towards the Leeward Islands in the Caribbean. It is due to hit on Monday night local time. Maria is moving roughly along the same path as Irma, the hurricane that devastated the region this month. The authorities fear Maria could whip up and throw the debris left behind by Hurricane Irma. Lieutenant Colonel Paul Maynard, a Royal Marine deployed to the British Virgin Islands, told the Press Association the hurricane could pick the debris up, ""spin it around, and throw it like ammunition"". ""It could cause potentially more casualties and fatalities than Irma did,"" he added. Hurricane Irma: A visual guide Damage mapped The UK's International Development Secretary, Priti Patel, said: ""British troops, police and aid experts are working relentlessly to get help to the victims of Hurricane Irma. Those same individuals will now be tasked with also preparing for the impact of Maria."" Hurricane warnings have been issued for Guadeloupe, Dominica, St Kitts and Nevis, Montserrat, Martinique, St Lucia and the US and British Virgin Islands. A hurricane watch is in effect for Puerto Rico, St Martin, St Barts, Saba, St Eustatius and Anguilla. Some of these islands are still recovering after being hit by Irma - a category five hurricane which left at least 37 people dead and caused billions of dollars' worth of damage. In itslatest update on Monday,external, the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said that Maria had maximum sustained winds of 200km/h (125mph). They warned that heavy rainfall caused by the hurricane ""could cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides"". The eye of the storm is 100 miles east of Martinique, and Maria is moving west-northwest at about 13mph. ""Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion,"" the NHC said. In the French territory of Guadeloupe, schools, businesses and government buildings have all been closed and severe flooding is predicted in low-lying parts of the islands. Preparations have also begun in Puerto Rico, where Maria is expected to bring strong winds on Tuesday. The Leeward Islands - where Maria will first strike - includes Antigua and Barbuda. The latter island was evacuated after beingdevastatedby Irma. The NHC says that Maria could produce a ""dangerous storm surge accompanied by large and destructive waves"" that would raise water levels by as much as 2.7 metres (9ft). It also forecasts a maximum potential rainfall of 51cm (20in) in some areas of the central and southern Leeward Islands - including Puerto Rico and the US and British Virgin Islands - through to Wednesday night. The destruction of Barbuda Drone footage of Saint-Martin after Irma Earlier this month, Irma left more than two-thirds of homes on the Dutch side of the island of St Martin (known as Sint Maarten) uninhabitable, with no electricity, gas or drinking water. The French government has said its side of St Martin - known as Saint-Martin - sustained about â¬1.2bn ($1.44bn; Â£1.1bn) in damage, with nine deaths across Saint-Martin and nearby St Barts. This video can not be played A BBC team visited Caribbean islands that have been devastated by Hurricane Irma On the British Virgin Islands, entire neighbourhoods were flattened. After a visit to the area, UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson described the damage as something ""you see in images from the First World War"".

The Puerto Rican government has issued a statement saying it expects the hurricane to make landfall there as a category three on Tuesday. The US territory escaped the worst of the damage from Irma - although it experienced widespread power cuts - and it has been an important hub for getting relief to islands that were more badly affected. ""Puerto Rico is our lifeline,"" Judson Burdon, a resident of Anguilla, told Reuters news agency. ""We had two volunteer flights cancel because of the weather that is coming."" American military units were evacuated from the US Virgin Islands on Sunday Irma also hit the US, where several dozen deaths were linked to the hurricane. Nearly 6.9 million homes were left without power in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Alabama. A second hurricane, Jose, is also active in the Atlantic, with maximum sustained winds of 90mph. The centre of the storm wasabout 265 miles east-south-east of Cape Hatteras,externalin North Carolina, the NHC said in its advisory at 18:00 GMT on Monday.

"This video can not be played The Home Secretary says the second arrest suggests the attacker was 'not a lone wolf' The UK terror threat level has been lowered to severe after being raised to critical, its highest level, following Friday's attack on a London Tube train. A second man has been arrested as part of the investigation into the attack. The 21-year-old was arrested in Hounslow, west London, on Saturday night on suspicion of a terror offence and is in custody in south London. An 18-year-old man is also being held on suspicion of a terror offence over the Parsons Green explosion. The ""severe"" terror threat level means an attack is no longer imminent but is still highly likely. LIVE: Latest on Parsons Green investigation Residents in Sunbury told to get out of homes Police are searching a residential address in Stanwell, Surrey, in connection with the 21-year-old man's arrest. Home Secretary Amber Rudd said that over the next few days the military would return to their original positions. She said the police had made ""good progress"" in the investigation but urged ""everybody to continue to be vigilant but not alarmed"". Assistant Metropolitan Police Commissioner Mark Rowley said police had gained a ""greater understanding"" of how the bomb was prepared but said there was ""still much more to do"" in the investigation. By BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani The lowering of the threat level is an important sign. It means that intelligence chiefs have looked at the developing picture in the Met's huge operation - and other threads we will never see, from perhaps MI5 and GCHQ - and concluded that detectives now have a good handle on what happened on Friday at Parsons Green. Or, to put it another way, the threat level would not have been reduced if anyone within the counter-terrorism network still thought there was a bomber, or accomplices, on the loose. This is not the same as an ""all clear"" - intelligence is only ever fragmentary. Detectives now appear to have time on their side. Providing they make evidential progress, they could conceivably hold both suspects for up to a fortnight before they have to charge or release them. Of the 30 people injured in Friday's attack, one remains in hospital, NHS England said. Speaking to the Andrew Marr Show earlier, Ms Rudd said there was ""no evidence"" to suggest so-called Islamic State were behind the attack. ""But as this unfolds and as we do our investigations, we will make sure we find out how he was radicalised if we can,"" she said. This video can not be played Officers are searching a residential property in Stanwell near Heathrow Airport Jack Durston, 16, was on board the train at Parsons Green. On Sunday hetold the BBC: ""I had moved to the middle of the second carriage to get a seat. Now I realise I was lucky to be further away from the blast. ""I didn't hear the blast but I saw the flames and heard the screaming. It was crazy and very scary. ""Everyone tripped out of the doors. Once we were on the platform there was this horrible chemical smell. It was on my clothes and skin."" Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said internet giants such as Google, Microsoft and Facebook, were not doing enough to help in the fight against terrorism. On a trip to Qatar, Sir Michael said they need to ""take down information that allows terrorists to construct the sort of device we saw on the Tube"". Police are continuing to search a house in Sunbury-on-Thames in Surrey. It is thought the 18-year old, who was arrested in the port of Dover on Saturday morning, lives there. Police investigations are ongoing at a property in Sunbury-on-Thames The BBC's home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani, who was at the scene, said a large number of officers have been working inside the property and a forensics tent is in place in the back garden. The house belongs to an elderly couple known for fostering hundreds of children, including refugees. Ronald Jones, 88, and Penelope Jones, 71 were rewarded for their service to children when they weremade MBEs in 2010,external. Penelope and Ronald Jones were made MBEs by the Queen in 2010 Penelope Jones and her husband have fostered hundreds of children over the past 40 years The couple are said to be staying with friends following the police raid, during which surrounding houses were evacuated. Friend Alison Griffiths said the couple had an 18-year-old and a 22-year-old staying with them recently. She described Mr and Mrs Jones as ""great pillars of the community"", adding: ""They do a job that not many people do."" This video can not be played ""An officer banged on the door quite severely and said 'Out now you've got two minutes'"" Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott raised concerns about police resources amid a rise in terrorist attacks. She told BBC Breakfast that cuts in policing have ""possibly jeopardised our ability to respond to terrorism"". But Ms Rudd said the government is ""committed to making sure the security services and the police have the right resources"". She announced Â£24m of funding for counter-terrorism operations across the country. She added that US PresidentDonald Trump's,externalsuggestion that the terrorist behind the attack was ""in the sights of Scotland Yard"" was ""pure speculation"".

"The attack is reported to have happened at Saint-Charles Station in Marseille Two US tourists have had hydrochloric acid thrown in their faces at Marseille train station, French media say. The victims, both in their early 20s, received treatment in hospital, but were released later in Sunday. Two other members of their group were also attacked at Saint-Charles station, but did not get acid in their faces. The incident is not believed to be terror-related. The attacker, described by police as a mentally unstable 41-year-old woman, has been arrested. The report says she remained at the site after the attack, and showed photographs of herself with burns. The group are Boston College students who are on a year in Europe, the college said in a statement. ""It appears that the students are fine, considering the circumstances, though they may require additional treatment for burns,"" it said.

"This video can not be played Bodybuilder 'Flex' Lewis' targets Schwarzenegger record A Welsh bodybuilder has followed in the footsteps of Arnold Schwarzenegger by winning a sixth consecutive title at Mr Olympia. James 'Flex' Lewis from Llanelli won the 212lb weight category in Las Vegas on Saturday. The 33-year-old started bodybuilding as a teenager in a bid to improve his rugby playing. But it soon turned to his sport of choice and 'Flex' is now a bodybuilding celebrity in the United States His success in the sport has led to him appearing on magazine covers and television in the US. Yet, his fame has hardly caused a ripple in his home country. Mr Lewis with his Mr Olympia medal Flex Lewis goes from an off-season weight of up to 240lb to the 212lb category in competitions ""I get a lot of love around the world. I'm on US television, on the front cover of magazines, but in my own country I get a small column in my local paper, the Llanelli Star,"" he said. Mr Lewis took up bodybuilding when he was a student. He was a keen rugby player and had dreams of playing for Wales at rugby, earning the nickname of Flex after being able to dodge tackles as a winger on the pitch. In a bid to improve his rugby skills, he started lifting weights. ""It was a fluke really how I got into bodybuilding,"" he explained. ""When I was 19, the owner of the local gym said if I entered one competition I'd get free membership. ""I just thought 'how hard can it be?' I was just thinking of the money I'd save and getting it over with so I could eat a big bag of chocolates."" But when he won the competition in Port Talbot and was offered the chance to represent Wales, his sense of national pride took over. By 20, he had won junior Mr Wales and junior Mr Great Britain twice, and junior Mr Universe. By 22 he was competing against men in their late 30s in the senior category and had turned professional by 24. Coach Neil Hill spotted Flex Lewis in his first competition and has been with him ever since Describing it as ""a whirlwind"", he said: ""Even looking back to my nickname playing rugby, I think I had a path to follow. ""Being a Llanelli boy moulded me as well, being from a hardworking town gave me that focus and determination."" Mr Lewis settled in America after going on a trip to Muscle Beach in Santa Monica and Gold's Gym, California and now has a family and several businesses he runs as well as training for the competitions. He said he has ""a love-hate relationship"" with the gym, with every training day like ""groundhog day"" - his motto is ""get in and get it done"". In 2012, he won his first title at the Mr Olympia competition. But it took a trip back to Llanelli for him to realise the significance. ""I had left home at 19, slept on sofas, chased the dream,"" he said. ""It was probably not until two weeks later that winning it it sank in. ""I'd gone back to Llanelli; I was walking the dog along the coast and it suddenly hit me and I had tears streaming down my face."" Five years later and he has claimed a sixth title and emulated his hero, Arnold Schwarzenegger, who won seven titles overall. ""I used to watch WWF, but then I saw Arnold's films, and he blew my mind. he looked un-human, like a cartoon,"" he explained. ""There is nothing better than meeting someone you idolise. But I already have one up on him. ""We were on stage (at an event) and he tried to pull a joke on me. But I got to the punch line first. So it's 1-0 to Flex on jokes."" Before the competition, Mr Lewis hoped his success would be shared by his fans, some of whom travelled to the competition from Wales. ""There are no better fans in the world than the Welsh - it won't be aConor McGregordraw, but I will have an area in Vegas that will be the loudest,"" he said. Mr Lewis said afterwards he was ""buzzing"" to have defended his title for another year. ""My accomplishments are a true testament to what dedication and hard work can get you,"" he said. ""If you want something bad enough and set your mind to it, it can be achieved."" He added: ""To equal Arnie's record of consecutive wins at Olympia is a dream come true for me as I have always been inspired by him. ""I am so thrilled to have made Wales and the people of Great Britain proud"".

"Ryanair cancelled 82 flights on Sunday after admitting it had ""messed up"" the planning of its pilots' holidays. The budget airline said on Saturday that it wouldcancel 40-50 flights every dayfor the next six weeks. Marketing officer Kenny Jacobs said affected customers with bookings up to 20 September had been informed. ""We have messed up in the planning of pilot holidays and we're working hard to fix that,"" he said. Most of the cancellations are due to a backlog of staff leave which has seen large numbers of the airline's staff book holidays towards the end of the year. The airline is changing its holiday year, which currently runs from April to March, to run from January to December instead. Rynanair said the shift meant it had to allocate annual leave to pilots in September and October. The cancellations could affect up to 285,000 passengers, who will be offered alternative flights or refunds. Mr Jacobs said affected customers would have been sent an email. ""We advise customers to check the email address used to make their booking,"" he added. A page on the Ryanair website,externaldetails flights cancelled up until 20 September. It says 56 flights are cancelled on Monday, 55 on Tuesday, and 53 on Wednesday. Ryanair has said that fewer than 2% of its flights would be cancelled and the move would help it hit its annual punctuality target of 90%. But passengers have complained about the resulting uncertainty. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Gary Cummings was due to fly from Leeds to Bratislava on Friday morning. On Thursday night he received a text message from Ryanair, saying his flight had been cancelled. The only alternative flight he was offered was on Monday - when he was originally due to be returning to Leeds. ""We were left in limbo really,"" he told BBC Radio 5 live. UK Aviation Minister Lord Callanan said he expected ""all airlines to fulfil their obligations to their customers"". ""In the event of any disruption or cancellation airlines must ensure customers are fully compensated and every effort is made to provide alternative travel arrangements."" Customers do have rights under the European Passenger Rights legislation. ""The rules say if the airline doesn't have a suitable alternative flight, you have to be booked on a rival airline,"" said Simon Calder, travel editor of the Independent. He said passengers should also be able to claim compensation for the cancellations. ""It's a really odd thing in terms of customer care, to say we want to improve the operation by keeping more planes on the ground,"" he told the BBC. Ryanair is the biggest airline in Europe and the king of low cost carriers. But the new kid on the no-frills block is Norwegian. They've grown almost exponentially in the last three years and even plan to set up a new base in Dublin - Ryanair's back yard. To rub it in, they boasted last week of taking on 140 Ryanair pilots so far this year. Furthermore Norwegian said that the newly hired pilots would get, unlike most new Ryanair pilots, a full time job (as opposed to contractor status) and a competitive salary. Ryanair flatly denies that there has been an exodus of staff and that that might lie behind the sudden decision to ground up to 50 flights a day for 6 weeks. It says it's cancelling hundreds of flights due to personnel and air traffic control issues. What rights do passengers have? The EU compensation rules for cancelled flights are as follows: Passengers are entitled to assistance and compensation, if the disruption was within an airline's control. Airlines have to offer full refunds, paid within seven days, or rebookings for a flight cancelled at short notice. In addition, passengers can also claim compensation. Cancellation amounts are: 250 euros (Â£218) for short-haul, 440 euros (Â£384) for medium-haul and 600 euros (Â£523) for long-haul. Passengers who reach their destination more than three hours late can be compensated from 200 to 600 euros, depending on the length of flights and delay.

"The UK's statistics watchdog has stood by its criticism of Boris Johnson in a growing row over the possible financial windfall the NHS may get from Brexit. Sir David Norgrove said he was ""disappointed"" the foreign secretary had revived Vote Leave's pledge of Â£350m a week extra for the NHS. Mr Johnson hit back at ""a wilful distortion of the text of my article"", asking for the claim to be withdrawn. The mention of Â£350m came in aDaily Telegraph piece,externalby Mr Johnson. In it, he wrote: ""Once we have settled our accounts, we will take back control of roughly Â£350 million per week. ""It would be a fine thing, as many of us have pointed out, if a lot of that money went on the NHS."" Reality Check: Boris Johnson's Â£350m a week claim Laura Kuenssberg: What was behind the article? The article, in which he also said he opposed paying the EU to secure temporary access to the single market during a transitional phase after the UK's departure, divided Tory MPs. Some claimed it undermined Theresa May's leadership ahead of a crucial speech later this week and amounted to a leadership challenge. Home Secretary Amber Rudd accused her cabinet colleague of being a Brexit ""back-seat driver"", telling the BBC that while it was fine for Mr Johnson to show his enthusiasm for Brexit, he should remember he was not ""driving the car"". Defence Minister Tobias Ellwood criticised what he called ""party discord"", tweeting: ""We are not witnessing our finest hour-at a testing time when poise, purpose and unity are called for."" But a leading figure in last year's Brexit campaign, Environment Secretary Michael Gove, urged people to focus on what Mr Johnson had written, ""not the headlines"". ""Debate should be forward looking on how to make most of life outside EU - not refighting referendum"", he added on Twitter. By Chris Mason, BBC political correspondent This is an extraordinary row. A senior cabinet minister and the most senior civil servant responsible for official statistics, engaged in a public slanging match on a Sunday afternoon. At lunchtime, Sir David's letter, accusing the foreign secretary of ""a clear misuse of official statistics."" Then the first counter attack: a spokesman for Mr Johnson claimed that Sir David was actually complaining about the headlines provoked by the foreign secretary's article. No he wasn't, responded a spokeswoman for the UK Statistics Authority. And then Mr Johnson's formal written reply to Sir David accusing him of ""a complete misrepresentation of what I said"" and asking him ""to withdraw it."" Who will people trust the most? The civil servant or the politician? That is your call. Thechair of the UK Statistics Authority wrote on Sunday,externalto Mr Johnson setting out his concerns about the Â£350m figure. The authority, which is an independent statutory body, previously criticised use of the figure - which was displayed on the side of a campaign bus -during the 2016 referendum campaign,external. Sir David wrote in the letter: ""I am surprised and disappointed that you have chosen to repeat the figure of Â£350 million per week, in connection with the amount that might be available for extra public spending when we leave the European Union"". The watchdog said the article ""confused"" the size of the UK's annual gross and net contributions to the EU's budget. His letter continued: ""It also assumes that payments currently made to the UK by the EU, including for example for the support of agriculture and scientific research, will not be paid by the UK government when we leave. It is a clear misuse of official statistics."" In Mr Johnson's reply, he wrote: ""I must say that I was surprised and disappointed by your letter of today, since it was based on what appeared to be a wilful distortion of the text of my article. ""You say that I claim that there would be Â£350 million that 'might be available for extra public spending' when we leave the EU. ""This is a complete misrepresentation of what I said and I would like you to withdraw it."" He continued: ""Once we leave the EU we will take back control of all such UK-funded spending, and, although of course I have no doubt that we will continue to spend significantly on UK priorities such as agriculture and research, that spending will be done under UK control. ""As for the rebate - whose value you did not know - it only forms part of the EU's financing arrangements with the agreement of all other EU member states. ""We do not control it ourselves."" Labour MP Yvette Cooper said Mr Johnson ""just thinks it's OK to repeatedly lie"". Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said the foreign secretary's credibility was ""shot to pieces"". Several Tory MPs have praised Mr Johnson's vision of what can be achieved after the UK leaves and said his objectives are largely in tune with those of the government. Writing in the Telegraph, backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg said the article was ""tremendous"" and had ""magnificently rejected"" the ""depressing view"" that Britain could not cope without the protection of the European Union. This video can not be played Amber Rudd told the BBC's Andrew Marr ""you could call it back-seat driving (by Boris Johnson)"" Speaking on the Andrew Marr Show, Ms Rudd said she did not believe it was a prelude to a leadership challenge. ""I know what an irrepressible enthusiast (Johnson) is about Brexit, and what he's done is set it out there, I think it's absolutely fine, I would expect nothing less from Boris,"" she said. But she added: ""I don't want him managing the Brexit process, what we have got is Theresa May managing the process, driving the car. ""I am going to make sure, as far as I and the rest of the cabinet is concerned, we help her do that."" Several prominent Leave campaigners have distanced themselves from the Â£350m figure in the wake of the referendum result although others have continued to insist it is legitimate. The prime minister is due to make a major speech on Brexit in Florence, amid speculation she is prepared to announce some kind of deal on transitional trade payments. First she is due to meet Mr Johnson in New York, where the foreign secretary is expected to be in the audience when she addresses the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday.

"This video can not be played Drivers rushed to help those caught in the crash The M5 motorway in Gloucestershire has reopened following a crash on Saturday which claimed four lives and left three people critically injured. The road was shut after a lorry travelling south crashed through barriers and collided with two vehicles heading northwards, police said. The southbound carriageway between junctions 16 and 14 reopened on Sunday morning, but one lane northbound will remain shut into Monday. Drivers were warned to expect delays. No details of the four people killed in the crash, which happened at 14:30 BST between junctions 15 and 14, have been released by police. The injured woman and children were taken to Southmead Hospital and Bristol Children's Hospital where their conditions were described as ""critical but stable"". The driver of the lorry was taken to hospital to be checked over as a precaution. The 18-tonne lorry is to be checked for defects, police said Supt Simon Ellis from Avon and Somerset Police said: ""This was a horrific incident which has tragically claimed the lives of four people and seriously injured three others. ""Our thoughts are very much with their families and friends during what is an extremely difficult time."" He praised the emergency effort following the crash, and added: ""I'd also like to once again praise the members of the public who courageously went to the aid of those involved in this collision and in some cases rescued them from their vehicles. ""Their bravery and composure must be commended."" Supt Ellis said one lane would remain closed but he expected ""the carriageway to reopen completely"" later on Monday. It took hours to clear the affected stretch of the northbound carriageway Earlier, Insp Mark Whitfield said the 18-tonne lorry had collided with the two cars killing three people from one vehicle and one person from the other. He said: ""The main issue for us is why the lorry has crossed over from the central reservation.

"This video can not be played ""Let's hang him at once to end his woes"" Hartlepool is known by many as the place where a monkey was mistaken for a French spy and hanged. As some of the team behind the hit stage show War Horse launch a play based on the story, BBC News asks whether the hanging actually happened. One stormy day during the Napoleonic Wars, a French ship was wrecked off the coast of an old fishing village clinging to the north-east coast of England. The only survivor was the ship's mascot, a monkey that was washed ashore. The people of Hartlepool had never seen a monkey before - nor, for that matter, had they ever set eyes on a Frenchman. Mistaking its chattering for the language of the enemy, they convicted the monkey of being a French spy and hanged the animal on the beach. Or so the story goes. A new stage show, The Hartlepool Monkey, opens next week The townsfolk became known as the ""monkey hangers"", and what was once a term of mockery would become a proud part of Hartlepool's history. As well as inspiring the play, the story has been the subject of books, songs and a graphic novel. The town's football club's monkey mascot H'angus - real name Stuart Drummond - was even elected as Hartlepool mayor, not once butthree times. Rugby union club Hartlepool Rovers features the monkey on its badge But did the hanging really happen? ""Of course it happened,"" said Mr Drummond. ""It is too bizarre a story to make up so there must be some element of truth in it. ""There are always going to be naysayers and people trying to prove it's wrong but there is not anyone alive now who was there who could confirm or deny it."" H'angus the monkey is the mascot at Hartlepool United Others are not so sure. ""There is no evidence whatsoever that the people of Hartlepool hanged a monkey,"" said Keith Gregson, an author, historian and retired teacher from the town. So where did the bizarre story come from? Touring performer Edward ""Ned"" Corvan is credited with the first recorded mention of the hanging story The first recorded mention of the hanging was in 1855 in a song by Victorian entertainer Edward ""Ned"" Corvan, a touring performer who liked to lampoon whichever town he was in by writing a song about it. For his performance in Hartlepool he wrote a song about the monkey. Some of his phrases, such as ""hairy French spy"" and ""Napoleon's uncle"", were eerily reminiscent of another song from up the coast in Newcastle, Mr Gregson said. That song, The Baboon, written in about 1825, was based on the apparently true story of a baboon that visited Tyneside with some Cossack soldiers. All the artworks depict the hanging place as this beach So it could be that Corvan took certain aspects of the baboon tale, added some of his own and set the whole thing in Hartlepool. Certainly, the story was gleefully seized upon by the people of West Hartlepool, the new industrial town growing around the traditional fishing port of Old Hartlepool. The people of the new town considered those in the old one to be somewhat intellectually impaired, Mr Gregson said, and so of course they were stupid enough to hang a monkey. As time passed, though, the towns merged and the story became attached to the whole of Hartlepool. In the new play, a monkey and a French cabin girl are the only survivors of a shipwreck. A debate ensues about what to do with the monkey. Producers Finn Caldwell and Toby OliÃ©, both of whom are from the North East, said the questions raised about issues such as immigration and xenophobia are particularly pertinent today. Mr OliÃ© said: ""We do not want to make any moralistic judgement but rather have a conversation about it and explore the issues through humour."" Mr Caldwell said: ""The story is valid in its own right and has its own power - whether it actually happened or not is maybe not so important."" So what evidence is there that the monkey hanging actually happened? The date of the supposed hanging was never given more explicitly than as being during the Napoleonic Wars, Britain's conflict with Napoleon Bonaparte's France between 1803 and 1815. According to Historic England's records of 38,000 shipwrecks around Britain's coast, 14 ships sank in the Hartlepool Bay area during that time. They were all English, the vast majority either merchant or fishing vessels linking English and Scottish ports, and there were no reports of any having monkeys on them. There was some excitement in 2005 when an animal bone was found buried on the beach but it wasfound to be that of a prehistoric deer.,external The story of the monkey has been told in songs, books and postcards And, despite the fact the story has stuck in the North East town, Hartlepool is not the only place where a washed-up monkey was said to have been hanged. The most similar tale, from 1772, centres on Boddam, near Peterhead in Aberdeenshire. Villagers supposedly hanged a monkey as it was the only survivor of a shipwreck - no survivors meant they could claim salvage rights. And monkeys were also said to have been killed in the Cornish village Mevagissey, and Chalvey near Slough (in that case the unfortunate primate was an organ-grinder's monkey that bit a child). The monkey's legacy can still be felt in Hartlepool Ultimately, does it matter if Hartlepool's story is true? ""It matters that people are aware of the legend as it is a part of Hartlepool's identity,"" Mr Drummond said. ""For people to pour sand on it and try and rubbish it is to miss the point. I'm quite happy to believe it."" But it is a question that will probably never be conclusively answered, Mr Gregson said. ""Sometimes we just have to say we do not know and probably will never know."" The Hartlepool Monkeystarts with a run at the Stratford Circus Arts Centre in east London, from 19 September, before going on a national tour, including performances at Hartlepool Town Hall on 14 and 15 November.

Highways England said it expected the northbound carriageway between junctions 16 and 14, just north of Bristol, toremain shut on Sunday,external. The southbound carriageway reopened shortly before 06:00. Highways England earlier tweeted,externaldelays were building up from junction 17 and warned drivers about delays on the diversion route along the A38. No details of the four people killed in the crash, which happened between junctions 15 and 14, have yet been released by police. Insp Mark Whitfield said Highways England had repaired the central reservation Insp Mark Whitfield, from Avon and Somerset Police, said the 18-tonne lorry had collided with the two cars killing four people - three people from one vehicle died and one person from the other. ""The main issue for us is why the lorry has crossed over from the central reservation. There are a number of lines of inquiry we're looking at, one of which will be if the vehicle had defects."" He said the main challenge now was the ""scene clear-up"" because of the ""significant damage"". He added they hoped that could be done by the end of Sunday but ""we can't be certain"". Mr Whitfield thanked members of the public for ""their support and patience"" and said the force was grateful for ""a significant amount of evidence from mobile phone footage"". The crash is believed to have involved a lorry which crossed the central reservation The injured woman and children were taken to Southmead Hospital and Bristol Children's Hospital after the crash, where they were described as ""critical but stable"". The driver of the lorry was taken to hospital to be checked over as a precaution. At least two other vehicles along with the lorry were said to be involved in the collision Motorists were stuck for hours on the motorway following the crash. Cardiologist Dr Amer Hamed, who was in a car travelling northbound, seconds behind the vehicles caught up in the collision, said: ""There was a lorry involved and at least two other cars. One was absolutely destroyed and another had flipped over."" Dr Hamed said that he and a GP, who was also in a car at the scene, treated an injured woman. He said motorists who had been stuck on the carriageway for several hours were ""very helpful"" and had offered food and water to other people who were stuck. Motorists were left stuck on the M5 for hours after the crash Jasper Foxx was travelling southbound with friends Daniel Stephenson and Stephen Dibley at the time, and were some of the first on the scene after the collision. Mr Foxx said: ""The crash was utterly horrific - it is not anything I'd wish anyone to see. We've been quoted as heroes but it is just human nature. ""It was our instinct to stop - you can't drive past something like that. It was like something out of a disaster movie. The cameras and pictures just don't do it justice."" Mr Stevenson, who is first aid trained, said they were ""all trying to do our best"". He said: ""It was harrowing. It was autopilot for me - just get people out, get people safe."" Mr Dibley, who was driving, said: ""Jasper gave us the heads-up to start braking and I pulled on to the hard shoulder.

"The East German secret police went to extraordinary lengths to track down people who wrote letters to the BBC during the Cold War. One of those arrested and jailed was a teenager who longed to express himself freely - and paid a high price. It was the last day of the summer holidays. For 18-year-old Karl-Heinz Borchardt that should have meant an afternoon on a windswept Baltic beach with his girlfriend, or a few hours spent trying to catch the latest pop songs on his portable radio. Instead his childhood came to a sudden end. His mother hurried into his room unusually early and told him to get dressed. Five uniformed agents were waiting downstairs. Borchardt bought himself time. ""I needed time to think,"" he says. ""It could have been for any number of reasons."" Insisting he needed a wash, he started to fling sheets of incriminating texts out of the window. He couldn't know that the secret police already had all the evidence they needed. It was two years earlier, in September 1968, that Borchardt had written his first letter. It wasn't easy to keep anything hidden in the cramped two-room flat Borchardt shared with his family in Greifswald, a small town on Germany's northern coastline. So as he sat down to write at the living room table he covered the sheet of paper with his homework whenever someone poked their head round the door. The radio sat to his left and Borchardt was glued to the crackly foreign broadcasts coming out of Prague, where Soviet guns and tanks had rolled in to crush an attempt to introduce liberal reforms. ""To the staff of Radio London's German service!"" he wrote. I have only just started listening to your programme, 'Letters without signatures', but I like it a lot, since it airs opinions you don't find in our media. I am 16 years old. I will write to you regularly, mainly about young people and their views on world affairs. In my view, the west did not intervene strongly enough in Czechoslovakia. Does a country which fought so hard for its freedom have to carry on marching to the tune of the Soviets? Warm regards from a schoolboy Borchardt signed off with a codename, and addressed the envelope to a Rolf Degner in Kantstrasse 45, West Berlin. Borchardt didn't know Rolf Degner, he probably didn't even exist. But this was the address he had noted down at the end of the BBC's latest transmission of the programme on its German service. Listening to a foreign broadcaster was a crime in communist East Germany, let alone writing to one. Yet Borchardt didn't see any personal risk. He believed he was shielded by anonymity. How could they possibly find him? He dropped the letter in his local postbox. Kantstrasse 45 was in central Berlin but it was still a pile of post-war rubble. The BBC arranged with the West Berlin post office to divert all the letters with this address to a private postbox. These were delivered to the BBC's West Berlin office and then on to Bush House in London. The west Berlin BBC office at Savignyplatz The London-based presenter of Letters without Signatures, Austin Harrison, announced different postal addresses every few weeks at the end of the show and East German listeners wrote in their thousands, filling the weekly programme with 20 minutes of anonymous and uncensored letters from people behind the Wall. Of course the Stasi were listening in too, immediately alerting the post offices to the new addresses so that the letters could be filtered out and passed on to them. But the programme was broadcast on a Friday night and it took a little while for the message to get through to all the regional branches, giving the early correspondents a better chance of getting their post to the desired West Berlin address. Others handed their letters to West Berlin visitors to smuggle back over the border. Much to the ire of the East German regime, the BBC programme gave an extraordinary insight into the physical and emotional lives of a cross-section of GDR society for more than 25 years. Austin Harrison ""It was like coming up for air,"" says Borchardt - a form of release for a young, curious mind locked in the suffocating atmosphere of the communist state. ""Freedom of speech didn't exist in east Germany, so they did a detour via London,"" says Susanne SchÃ¤dlich, herself a child of the GDR and the author of Briefe ohne Unterschrift (German for Letters without Signatures) a detailed analysis of the BBC programme. Susanne SchÃ¤dlich grew up in the GDR and has written a book about the programme ""I felt like I was unearthing treasures,"" says SchÃ¤dlich. ""The letters are authentic and unfiltered. The writers knew there was no censorship here and they spoke from their hearts."" Many wrote in desperation, appealing to the outside world not to be forgotten as the Berlin Wall was going up. Others grumbled about shortages of butter, onions and soap and then offered creative substitutes. A sample letter from the BBC archives There was widespread despondency and the fear of being trapped in a repeating cycle of history. We're being held in a huge concentration camp. There's no escape. We vote for who we're told to. We're simply a herd of cattle which must obey. (Anonymous letter) Teachers wrote in, as did farmers, doctors, shopkeepers, even soldiers. An astonishing number of disillusioned children also put pen to paper. We're being educated in lies. I can't tell truth and lies apart any more. The whole world is dishonest. Politics is just a lying contest. What's the point of life? (Anonymous letter) Listen to Witness:The German Schoolboy Arrested for Writing a Letteron the BBC World Service In its own way, the programme offered a small piece of democracy, crafting debate between the opposing views of its varied listeners. ""Some people wrote practically weekly,"" says GÃ¼nter Burkart, right-hand man to the presenter, who recalls many years of fascinating work with a group of brilliant and eccentric characters. The Letters without Signatures team in the studio Austin Harrison was the only presenter on the show for its 25-year run and he developed a real bond with his listeners, Burkart remembers. ""He thought it was very important that it was always him, that they always wrote to Harrison. ""He talked about 'us'. The family. He and his listeners. It was quite fantastic."" Burkart kept the letters under lock and key in the London office, fearful of spies. Producer GÃ¼nter Burkart kept the letters under lock and key The Stasi not only viewed the BBC as an enemy broadcaster, they specifically saw this programme as a form of psychological warfare aimed to destabilise the regime and incite resistance. They were convinced Harrison was an undercover spy, wooing agents in East Germany. In the end it was the letter writers they really knuckled down on, and the Stasi were extraordinarily fastidious in their pursuit. They took saliva samples from the licked envelopes to identify blood groups which they cross-checked with doctor's records. They traced fingerprints on the paper, sourced the ink and collated an extensive archive of handwriting samples. The Stasi took saliva samples from the licked envelopes It was his handwriting that caught out Borchardt. ""It just seemed like an ordinary piece of homework,"" he says, when the pupils in his class were asked to write an essay describing themselves and their later goals in life. ""The thing is, my father thought I had such terrible handwriting he wanted my sister to write it up for me. He nearly got his way."" As ordered, the school passed the essays on to a Stasi agent. Documents show a painstaking analysis of every curve and stroke of Borchardt's pen, comparing it to the intercepted letters from the anonymous schoolboy. Borchardt wrote to the BBC three more times and with each letter he revealed bolder political convictions. Dear Mr. Harrison! I am 17 years old, I grew up in this country (..) but don't think it's fun, always having to say the opposite of what you think. (...) My honest opinion is that only violence will help us. (...) If Hitler had been overthrown by the people, millions of lives would have been saved. Warm regards, a schoolboy. Six months later he was alone in the car with the Stasi. Not a word was spoken. On arrival at Rostock Stasi prison, he was stripped and searched and put in isolation. ""I was still thinking, I need to get to school tomorrow,"" he says. ""It took me a while to understand what was going on."" Alone in his cell, Borchardt had endless hours to fill. He counted the squares on his blanket, made chess moves in his head, recited maths tables and poetry. Soon he started to long for the interrogations. After eight months he was convicted for ""attempted subversive activities"" in conjunction with an enemy broadcaster. He was sentenced to two years in a youth prison in Dessau. ""You should be happy to live under socialism,"" were the words of welcome from a young officer as he arrived at the prison. ""Under the Nazis we'd have had you up in smoke a long time ago."" Those words have stuck in his head. The identification with the Nazis. ""The Stasi terminated biographies,"" says Susanne SchÃ¤dlich, also drawing links with the methods and terminology of the Third Reich. ""The way they went after people, for example, and shut them up."" A sample letter from the BBC archives And so it was for Borchardt. School and university were replaced by the daily violence and hard physical labour typical of a GDR youth prison. He was put on a production line, assembling gas appliances. Safety regulations were unheard of and none of the prisoners really knew how the machines worked. ""I saw bits of machinery flying through the air, fast as a gunshot,"" he says. ""I was lucky, but there were a lot of injuries."" Towards the end of his sentence, Borchardt was offered a golden ticket to West Germany. Brokered by Amnesty International, the West German government had agreed to buy his freedom. But he refused the offer. He so desperately wanted to get back to his family and friends, he went on a hunger strike. The GDR relented and he was allowed to stay. Karl-Heinz Borchardt after his release ""There have been moments when I've regretted that,"" he says now. ""I overestimated a lot of my friends. When I was walking around town, they would look right through me. They feared for their future, most of them were at university."" Yet his family welcomed him back and he tuned into all the old Western stations he had missed inside. The Stasi hadn't stifled the rebel in him. Then quite abruptly, in 1974, ""Letters without Signatures"" was taken off the air by the BBC. The number of letters had reduced, according to former producer GÃ¼nter Burkart. Maybe because more were intercepted by the Stasi, but he suggests the foreign office may have had a hand in it. ""Perhaps it was thought with diplomatic relations coming up and recognition of the GDR, it was time to end it,"" he says. For many listeners it was a bitter disappointment. The letters kept coming. ""I could just cry. Where is the England which in recent history fought so honourably and bravely against suppression, slavery and injustice? Good night. It feels like 1939 all over again. The lights went out for years."" (Anonymous letter) With the end of the show Borchardt stopped listening to the BBC altogether. For the next 15 years he worked as an electronics engineer, and against all the odds studied and got a PhD in East German literature. Still, he could only get a low-status university job. He was a glorified ticket-seller, he says. It was only after the collapse of communism and the reunification of Germany in 1989, that he was able to start working as an academic at the University of Greifswald. He is still lecturing in German literature there today. Die Toten Hosen in 1989 When music captures the spirit of freedom it can cross any border. In 1961, Communist East Germany built a wall across Berlin, and tried to seal itself off from the West. But new research shows how concrete, barbed wire and a huge effort by the secret police, the Stasi, failed to silence the seductive beat of rock and roll and punk.

"This video can not be played Sir Vince Cable was speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr Sir Vince Cable has insisted it is ""perfectly plausible"" that he could become the next prime minister. The Liberal Democrat leader said politics was in a ""remarkable state of flux"", with both major parties divided. On day two of its conference, the party leadership saw off a challenge to its policy on a second EU referendum. Members backed the idea of an ""exit from Brexit"" poll, although former leader Tim Farron warned them not to treat Leave voters ""like idiots"". Asked how Brexit could be stopped, given that Article 50 has been triggered and both the Tories and Labour are opposed to another vote, Sir Vince said ""sensible"" figures within Labour were coming round to the idea. Lib Dems mull how to stop Brexit Although public opinion had not changed much since the Brexit referendum, he told the BBC's Andrew Marr show this would happen once the economic reality of withdrawal from the EU sank in. He argued that the public should be given a second chance to settle the issue once and for all, with an option to stay put. Despite winning four more seats in June's general election, where a second referendum was the centrepiece of its campaign, the Lib Dem vote share fell to 7.4%. Pushed on whether it was realistic to go from such a low level to winning a majority, Sir Vince - who served in the coalition government for five years - said it was ""perfectly plausible"". Tim Farron said the party had to win over ""hearts and minds"" on Europe The Lib Dems, he suggested, were well placed to capitalise on the ""open civil war"" within the Conservative government and the ""suppressed"" divisions within Jeremy Corbyn's Labour party. He said: ""As leader of the third UK party my job is to be the alternative PM. ""It's possible...that we could break through. If British party politics starts to break up, if traditional structures start to break up, that could well happen. ""We are extremely well positioned - with moderate sensible policies, a good track record in government, we have government experience, experience at local government level. ""I think what you may find is a big shift of opinion in our direction - so I am very confident talking about being an alternative PM."" Lib Dem activists overwhelmingly endorsed the leadership's policy of seeking another referendum on the final Brexit deal, although not without dissent from several activists, including some from heavy Leave-voting areas. One member from Sunderland, which voted by a margin of 61% to 39% to leave, warned that the idea of staging another referendum was a ""dead horse the party should stop flogging"". Another said that the idea had proved ""toxic"" to voters during the election campaign and urged MPs and peers in Westminster to ""end their love affair"" with the concept. But senior figures rallied behind the party leadership, with former leader Sir Menzies Campbell saying the odds of the Lib Dems forming a government before the conclusion of Brexit talks was remote and the party's energies were better directed at ""winning a referendum in association with other parties"". While backing the policy, Tim Farron warned his party against ""lecturing the country"" about the issue. The only way to ""save"" the UK from the damage Brexit would do would be to ""change the hearts and minds of the people"", he told activists. Amid calls for more radical thinking from the party, the Lib Dem leader has also announced a review of tuition fees policy, saying none of the parties is in ""a good place"" over the issue. It comes amid unconfirmed reports that the government is looking at ways of reducing the financial burden on students - either potentially by reducing the Â£9,250 maximum fee chargeable by universities or the 6.1% interest rate on re-payments. Sir Vince said the party'sU-turn on tuition feeincreases in 2011, while in coalition with the Conservatives, had caused lasting damage and a new approach was needed. He said the current system, in which there are no upfront costs and graduates do not have to pay anything until they earn Â£21,000, had many good elements. But he suggested that a graduate tax could be a ""good option"". Meanwhile, the party's former leadership contender Norman Lamb has said he will stand down as Lib Dem health spokesman to concentrate on his new role as chairman of the Commons science and technology committee. The BBC's political correspondent Andrew Sinclar said Mr Lamb has been known to be unhappy with aspects of party policy, particularly over Brexit, but that the MP insisted there was no rift with his party leader.

"Nguyen Quoc Phi's sister and father (second and third from left) took part in a protest calling for answers Footage apparently showing police and paramedics failing to give medical treatment to a Vietnamese migrant worker, who had been fatally shot by a police officer, has prompted outrage in Taiwan. Former factory worker Nguyen Quoc Phi, 27, was shot nine times in Hsinchu County near Taipei on 31 August, after the officer and a government worker responded to a reported car theft. Dashcam video from the first ambulance shows a police officer telling paramedics not to approach Nguyen because he had not been restrained. They stood by for several minutes not offering the man any help. The ambulance then took away the slightly injured government worker without attending to the severely wounded man lying on the ground. Despite his injuries, the casualty was handcuffed. A second ambulance later arrived but Nguyen was pronounced dead when he arrived at hospital. Taiwan's government watchdog Control Yuan has launched an investigation into what happened amid protests by rights groups. Prosecutors have also begun an inquiry. The dead man's father, Nguyen Quoc Dong, said: ""I only have one demand: Taiwan's government should say clearly what happened and why."" Taiwan's 'slave fishermen' After British man abused, Taiwan debates its hidden racism The case has sparked debate about the treatment of migrant workers in the country. Asked why emergency crews did not help Nguyen immediately, a paramedic from the Hsinchu County Fire Bureau's San Chi substation told the BBC: ""The police officer told us not to get close. ""What if [the migrant] suddenly became crazy and did something? And he hadn't been handcuffed, so we couldn't do anything."" The National Police Agency had said Nguyen had attacked the officer and the government worker when they tried to stop him from vandalising and stealing a car. Dashcam footage from the ambulance shows a government worker being driven away while the dying man (top) lies in a pool of blood next to a police car But his father questioned the police's version of events. ""I don't believe what the police said that my son tried to steal a car. He can't even drive,"" he said. ""I think there was excessive use of force."" The Taiwan International Workers Association (TIWA), which organised a protest on Friday, urged the authorities to release any footage related to the case.Ambulance dash cam footage,externalwas later obtained by the BBC but was not broadcast due to its distressing nature. It is not clear whether the police officer or his car were equipped with a camera. Taiwan is a major destination for migrant workers, employing more than 600,000 in factories, homes and in other manual labour. Activists say they are often trapped into paying off huge debt to employment brokers, so many run away from their jobs to avoid having big chunks deducted from their salary. They instead work in the black market illegally but they risk getting arrested. Nguyen had run away from his job three years ago. Speakers at the protest on Friday criticised the government and law enforcement authorities' practice of treating runaway migrants like criminals. ""I ask Taiwanese people, how come some people can change employers and some can't? And those who run away from their jobs are arrested and even shot by police. These incidents are happening in so called democratic Taiwan,"" said the TIWA's researcher Hsu Wei-dung. ""Only when the whole Taiwanese society and government really face up to this problem can we really change this,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Amber Rudd told the BBC's Andrew Marr ""you could call it back-seat driving (by Boris Johnson)"" Boris Johnson has been accused of being a Brexit ""back-seat driver"" by the home secretary. Amber Rudd said it was fine for Mr Johnson to show his enthusiasm but he was not ""driving the car"" after he set out his vision for the UK post-Brexit in an articlein the Daily Telegraph.,external She said ministers must be united in their approach and help the prime minister manage the Brexit process. The BBC understands Mr Johnson will not be sacked despite anger among some MPs. Lib Dem leader Vince Cable urged the prime minister to ""fire this guy on Monday morning"", warning that if she did not act her authority would be ""reduced to zero"". Meanwhile the chairman of the UK Statistics Authority has written to Mr Johnson, questioning his decision in the 4,000 word article in Saturday's Telegraph to refer again to a disputed figure used by Leave campaigners during the referendum about the UK's EU budget contributions. ""I am surprised and disappointed that you have chosen to repeat the figure of Â£350m per week in connection with the amount that might be available for extra public spending when we leave the European Union,"" Sir David Norgrove said. ""It is a clear misuse of official statistics,"" he added. Ms Rudd said she had been too busy dealing with the terror attack in London to read the foreign secretary's article. But asked about Mr Johnson's intervention, she said: ""You could call it back-seat driving, absolutely."" ""I don't want him managing the Brexit process, what we have got is Theresa May managing the process, driving the car. I am going to make sure, as far as I and the rest of the cabinet is concerned, we help her do that."" Asked whether she shared the concerns of those - including Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson - who have criticised the timing of the intervention. she said they had a point. ""I know what an irrepressible enthusiast (Johnson) is about Brexit, and what he's done is set it out there, I think it's absolutely fine, I would expect nothing less from Boris,"" she said. Mr Johnson has been accused by some of undermining the prime minister By BBC political correspondent Chris Mason When politicians criticise colleagues on their own side, in public, they often indulge in a little understatement. When you hear, for instance, a reference to a ""robust exchange of views"", you can assume the encounter actually bordered on the violent. So, when Mrs May's de facto deputy, Damian Green, told BBC Radio 5 live that the timing of Mr Johnson's intervention ""could have been better for all sorts of reasons"", you can imagine that the reaction privately, from some, has been rather more salty. And it has. Two of the government's most senior figures, in the space of an hour, publicly admonishing a cabinet colleague tells you all you need to know about how unwelcome Mr Johnson's 4,000 word treatise was in Downing Street. When asked if the article was a leadership challenge, Rudd said ""no, I don't think it is"". ""I think that he, like I, supports the prime minister at this difficult time as we try to conclude the negotiations with the EU."" After his article's publication Mr Johnson later tweeted he was ""all behind Theresa for a glorious Brexit"". In his article, Mr Johnson had said the UK should not be giving the EU any money to gain access to the single market after Brexit and said he would like to see a lot of the money recovered from Brussels going to the NHS, repeating the disputed referendum claim that exit could provide an extra Â£350m for the health service. Damian Green told BBC Radio 5live Mr Johnson's article ""could have been better"" The intervention comes just days before the prime minister makes a major speech on Brexit in Florence, amid speculation she is prepared to announce some kind of deal on transitional trade payments. Damian Green, a close ally of the prime minister, told Radio 5live's Pienaar's Politics, that the timing of Mr Johnson's article ""could have been better for all sorts of reasons not least the terrible terrorist incident we've had"". But he insisted the cabinet was united around the prime minister. ""There is a huge challenge facing this country that we have got to get these negotiations right,"" he said. ""That whatever we said during the referendum campaign, whichever side we were on, the duty of everyone in government is to make sure we get the best deal for Britain."" Ms Rudd has also announced the UK wants to agree a new treaty with the EU after it leaves in March 2019 to ensure existing security co-operation is fully maintained. Details will be published on Monday on how the UK will aim to continue to share information and evidence on wanted criminals with its EU partners after leaving and ensure suspects can still be extradited quickly. She said a new treaty would ""lock in"" existing cross-border crime-fighting and intelligence-sharing arrangements and enable the UK to remain a member of Europol outside of the EU. ""I want the French man in London to be safe and the English man in Berlin. They (the EU) want the same outcomes."" She conceded the UK's security would be weakened if it was unable to agree an over-arching Brexit deal but she was ""absolutely confident"" this would not happen.

"Carlos MuÃ±oz Portal had worked in major film productions in Mexico and the US A location scout for the Netflix crime drama Narcos has been shot dead while working in central Mexico. The bullet-riddled body of Carlos MuÃ±oz Portal, 37, was found in his car in a rural area in the town of Temascalapa, in Mexico state, one of the country's most violent. Mexican officials were reportedly having difficulties investigating the case given a lack of witnesses. Netflix said the facts surrounding his death were ""still unknown"". A friend of Mr MuÃ±oz told the Spanish newspaperEl PaÃ­s (in Spanish),externalthat the victim was travelling in the region taking photographs for locations. The death happened on Monday but news of it has only recently emerged. Mr MuÃ±oz's 10-year career included scouting locations for high-profile movies such as the latest James Bond movie, Spectre, as well as the action series Fast & Furious and Sicario, a movie about an FBI agent sent on a dangerous mission to bring down a Mexican drug cartel. Narcos is a hit series about the rise and fall of Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar, and Mr MuÃ±oz was working as a freelancer for its fourth season, which will reportedly focus on the notorious JuÃ¡rez drug cartel in northern Mexico.

"This video can not be played The Home Secretary says the second arrest suggests the attacker was 'not a lone wolf' The UK terror threat level has been lowered to severe after being raised to critical, its highest level, following Friday's attack on a London Tube train. A second man has been arrested as part of the investigation into the attack. The 21-year-old was arrested in Hounslow, west London, on Saturday night on suspicion of a terror offence and is in custody in south London. An 18-year-old man is also being held on suspicion of a terror offence over the Parsons Green explosion. The ""severe"" terror threat level means an attack is no longer imminent but is still highly likely. LIVE: Latest on Parsons Green investigation Residents in Sunbury told to get out of homes Police are searching a residential address in Stanwell, Surrey, in connection with the 21-year-old man's arrest. Home Secretary Amber Rudd said that over the next few days the military would return to their original positions. She said the police had made ""good progress"" in the investigation but urged ""everybody to continue to be vigilant but not alarmed"". Assistant Metropolitan Police Commissioner Mark Rowley said police had gained a ""greater understanding"" of how the bomb was prepared but said there was ""still much more to do"" in the investigation. By BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani The lowering of the threat level is an important sign. It means that intelligence chiefs have looked at the developing picture in the Met's huge operation - and other threads we will never see, from perhaps MI5 and GCHQ - and concluded that detectives now have a good handle on what happened on Friday at Parsons Green. Or, to put it another way, the threat level would not have been reduced if anyone within the counter-terrorism network still thought there was a bomber, or accomplices, on the loose. This is not the same as an ""all clear"" - intelligence is only ever fragmentary. Detectives now appear to have time on their side. Providing they make evidential progress, they could conceivably hold both suspects for up to a fortnight before they have to charge or release them. Of the 30 people injured in Friday's attack, one remains in hospital, NHS England said. Speaking to the Andrew Marr Show earlier, Ms Rudd said there was ""no evidence"" to suggest so-called Islamic State were behind the attack. ""But as this unfolds and as we do our investigations, we will make sure we find out how he was radicalised if we can,"" she said.

"RE can bring better understanding of other religions and cultures More than a quarter of England's secondary schools do not offer religious education, despite the law saying they must, suggestsresearch,externalgiven to BBC local radio. The National Association for RE,externalteachers obtained unpublished official data under Freedom of Information law. It says that missing the subject leaves pupils unprepared for modern life. But the main union for secondary head teachers said many schools covered religious issues in other lessons. ""They might be teaching through conferences, they might be using citizenship lessons, they might be using assemblies,"" said Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders. Bylaw,,externalRE must be taught by all state-funded schools in England, with detailed syllabuses agreed locally. NATRE says the FOI data, gathered by the Department for Education in 2015 but not published until now, showed that, overall, 26% of secondaries were not offering RE lessons. Among academies, which make up the majority of secondary schools, more than a third (34%) were not offering RE to 11 to 13-year-olds and almost half (44%) were not offering it to 14 to 16-year-olds. As more schools become academies, the problem could escalate, NATRE warns. RE teacher Joe Kinnaird says the subject can help teenagers with fundamental questions TheCoopers Company and Coborn School,externalin Upminster, Essex, is an academy which bucks the trend. As part of a GCSE in RE, students have been studying religious festivals and teacher Joe Kinnaird believes the subject is vital. ""RE in schools provides the best and the perfect opportunity to explore those issues which students see in in the wider world,"" he said. ""RE and philosophy provide students the chance to explore fundamental questions such as what happens after we die, does God exist, how do we cope with the problem of evil? ""These questions are both philosophical and ethical and the RE classroom is where we can explore these issues."" His pupils agree, with one, Lisa, saying: ""Not being religious myself, I think it's really interesting to learn about other religions, other cultures, I feel like it can be vital in life to understand other religions."" Her classmate, Benjamin, said that not being taught about religion could result in people being ""heavily influenced by what they find on social media"". Fellow pupil Luke added: ""Once you're educated about a certain religion you actually know the true meanings of it. While for Nicole, better religious education could help cut the number of racially and culturally motivated crimes. ""Religion affects politics, so you have to think of it that way. It's really important to know the diverse cultural traditions of other people because it's really relevant today,"" she said. Fiona Moss of NATRE said too many schools were ""breaking the law"", resulting in pupils ""missing out on religious education"". ""It means they are not religiously literate,"" she said. ""They don't have the opportunity to learn about religions and beliefs, to learn what's important to people or to have the chance to develop their own ideas, beliefs and values. ""It's going to be important for them to understand what people believe they think and what encourages them to behave in the particular ways that they do. ""We're not teaching people to be religious. We're teaching children about religions and beliefs that exist in this country. ""You don't only teach geography to children who are going to be world explorers."" Fiona Moss of NATRE was shocked by figures showing how many schools fail to teach RE Ms Moss said the data showed a shortage of specialist RE teachers throughout the state system. ""If you are an academy, there's a freedom about how you can teach RE and I think some schools struggle with that freedom and think they don't have to be as committed to RE. ""They're under financial pressures and maybe this is an easy loss."" But Mr Barton called the idea that schools were deliberately breaking the law ""a real oversimplification"". ""It might result from the report trying to find a very traditional delivery model of RE. Or it could be that they find it hard to recruit an RE teacher, for example, and most head teachers would agree they'd prefer to have provision which is better quality, taught by other people in different ways, if they can't get specialist staff."" A Department for Education spokesman said the government firmly believed in the subject's importance. ""Good quality RE can develop children's knowledge of the values and traditions of Britain and other countries, and foster understanding among different faiths and cultures. ""Religious education remains compulsory for all state-funded schools, including academies and free schools, at all key stages and we expect all schools to fulfil their statutory duties,"" said the spokesman.

"Try to swat a fly and it will soon become clear that they're faster than you. Much faster. But how on Earth do these tiny creatures - with their minuscule brains - outwit us so easily? You've probably pondered it after chasing a fly around your house and flailing your shoe with repeated, unsuccessful swats. How does it move so fast? Can it read my mind? It was the question put to theBBC World Service CrowdScienceteam for our most recent episode addressing the apparent super powers of tiny animals. The answer is that, compared with you and me, flies essentially see the world in slow motion. To illustrate this, have a look at a clock with a ticking hand. As a human, you see the clock ticking at a particular speed. But for a turtle it would appear to be ticking at twice that speed. For most fly species, each tick would drag by about four times more slowly. In effect, the speed of time differs depending on your species. This happens because animals see the world around them like a continuous video. But in reality, they piece together images sent from the eyes to the brain in distinct flashes a set number of times per second. Humans average 60 flashes per second, turtles 15, and flies 250. The speed at which those images are processed by the brain is called the ""flicker fusion rate"". In general, the smaller the species, the faster its critical flicker fusion rate - and flies, in particular, put us to shame. Professor Roger Hardie, from the University of Cambridge, investigates how flies' eyes work, and he has an experiment to determine their flicker fusion rate. ""How d'ya like them apples?"" For flies, time drags more slowly than for people ""The flicker fusion rate is simply how fast a light has to be turning on and off before it's perceived or seen as just a continuous light"" says Prof Hardie. Roger inserts tiny glass electrodes into the living light sensitive cells of their eyes - photoreceptors - before flashing LED lights at faster and faster speeds. Each flash of the LED produces a tiny electrical current in the photoreceptors that a computer can graph onto a screen. Tests reveal the fastest fly records distinct responses to flickering up to 400 times per second, more than six times faster than our own rate. The fastest vision of all is found in a species literally called a ""killer fly"". It's a tiny predatory species found in Europe that catches other flies out of the air with super-fast reactions. In her ""fly lab"" at Cambridge University, Dr Paloma Gonzales-Bellido demonstrates the killer flies' hunting behaviour by releasing fruit fly prey into a special filming box with a female killer fly. This video can not be played Some flies see six times faster than us, catching prey in mid-air in less than a second. Paloma records the behaviour at 1,000 frames per second using slow motion video cameras with a recording buffer. The attached computer constantly saves the video, over-writing itself every twelve seconds. When the fly moves, Paloma clicks a button to permanently save the last 12 seconds. ""Our reaction time is so slow that if we were to stop it when we think something is happening it would have happened already,"" says Dr Gonzales-Bellido. Essentially, we can't even click a button before the behaviour has happened, it's that fast. With the killer flies and their prey in the filming box, initially the killer fly just sat around motionless, but as one of the fruit flies flew about 7cm above it, there was a flash of movement and suddenly the killer fly was at the bottom of the box chomping into the quivering fruit fly. Only looking at the slowed-down footage on the computer did it become clear what happened; the killer fly took off, circled the fruit fly three times as it tried to grab it repeatedly, before succeeding in capturing the elusive fruit fly with its front legs. The whole behaviour from take-off to landing took just one second. It appears as a flash to our eyes, so conversely, the swatting hand of a human must appear at a snail's pace. The killer fly's eyes contain many more mitochondria than in the eyes of other fly species Paloma Gonzales-Bellido uses a special filming box to study killer flies To enable this incredible speed of the killer fly, which is faster even than other fly species, the light-detecting cells in the killer fly eyes contain many more mitochondria (the ""batteries"" of biological cells) than are present in the same cells of other flies. These are the batteries of the cell, so the speedy vision must take more energy than slow vision, explaining why all eyes aren't just set to the highest flicker fusion rate. The carnivorous diet of the killer fly provides the large amounts of energy it needs to power these high-energy cells. But even if we had the same number of mitochondria in the cells or our own eyes, we wouldn't have the same vision speed because flies' light-sensitive cells have a totally different design to those of vertebrates. Behind the structural differences in the eyes of flies is their evolutionary origin. Arthropods and vertebrates, the groups holding flies and humans, evolved their eyes entirely separately around 700-750 million years ago. Flies' eyes evolved to pick up light with a series of tiny string-like structures that lie horizontal to the path that light travels through the eye. These structures react to light mechanically whereas vertebrates have long tube-like cells facing the light, with chemicals that react to light at the base. This structure in the fly eye is something Roger studies in his lab. ""It's more sensitive in terms of being able to give a large signal to the tiniest amount of light and it can also respond faster than the rods and cones in the vertebrate eye,"" he explains. Roger Hardie studies the structure of the fly visual system There are a few reasons for this higher sensitivity, but what Prof Hardie discovered is that they respond mechanically to light, as opposed to chemically as in cones and rods. Mechanical responses enable faster neural signals. On top of that, there's a limit to the speed at which neural impulses can travel and the smaller nerve distances from fly eye to fly brain speeds up processing compared to larger vertebrates. Some vertebrates experience much faster vision than our own. Whether the species is able to fly seems to correlate with faster vision, as does being small. This may be because small flying animals have to react so quickly during flight to avoid approaching obstacles. The fastest vision of all is found in species that catch flies in the air. Back with vertebrates, when investigating the vision of the pied flycatcher, a small perching bird that catches flies in flight, scientists at Uppsala University in Sweden discovered that it was able to identify a light flashing on and off 146 times per second from a continuous light source. The birds were trained to associate a flashing light source with a tasty treat, and would accurately identify the flashing light up to this rate, placing their flicker fusion rate at 146. That's about twice the rate humans can see but still not as fast as the average fly. This means the birds, like flies, experience each tick of the clock more slowly than humans. There is an evolutionary pressure on the flycatchers to experience the ticking hand of the clock as slowly as possible in order to outwit their speedy prey. Over evolutionary time, birds that experienced 'slower ticking' could react faster to their prey, allowing them to eat more, raise more chicks and pass this speedy vision to future generations. The flies that have been chased by the fast-sighted birds will be evolving faster reactions to get away. Creating an evolutionary arms race that has gone on longer even than the existence of birds. Prey flies have been evolving faster vision and reactions to escape predatory flies like the killer fly since they evolved flight. Next time you try inanely to swat a fly, try not to be so disheartened. Your lumbering, slow motion swats are being thwarted by hundreds of millions of years of natural selection letting the flies watch your attempts in slow motion. Between you and the fly, time, it seems, is relative.

"This video can not be played Amber Rudd told the BBC's Andrew Marr ""you could call it back-seat driving (by Boris Johnson)"" Boris Johnson has been accused of being a Brexit ""back-seat driver"" by the home secretary. Amber Rudd said it was fine for Mr Johnson to show his enthusiasm but he was not ""driving the car"" after he set out his vision for the UK post-Brexit in an articlein the Daily Telegraph.,external She said ministers must be united in their approach and help the prime minister manage the Brexit process. The BBC understands Mr Johnson will not be sacked despite anger among some MPs. Lib Dem leader Vince Cable urged the prime minister to ""fire this guy on Monday morning"", warning that if she did not act her authority would be ""reduced to zero"". Meanwhile the chairman of the UK Statistics Authority has written to Mr Johnson, questioning his decision in the 4,000 word article in Saturday's Telegraph to refer again to a disputed figure used by Leave campaigners during the referendum about the UK's EU budget contributions. ""I am surprised and disappointed that you have chosen to repeat the figure of Â£350m per week in connection with the amount that might be available for extra public spending when we leave the European Union,"" Sir David Norgrove said. ""It is a clear misuse of official statistics,"" he added. Ms Rudd said she had been too busy dealing with the terror attack in London to read the foreign secretary's article. But asked about Mr Johnson's intervention, she said: ""You could call it back-seat driving, absolutely."" ""I don't want him managing the Brexit process, what we have got is Theresa May managing the process, driving the car. I am going to make sure, as far as I and the rest of the cabinet is concerned, we help her do that."" Asked whether she shared the concerns of those - including Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson - who have criticised the timing of the intervention. she said they had a point. ""I know what an irrepressible enthusiast (Johnson) is about Brexit, and what he's done is set it out there, I think it's absolutely fine, I would expect nothing less from Boris,"" she said. Mr Johnson has been accused by some of undermining the prime minister By BBC political correspondent Chris Mason When politicians criticise colleagues on their own side, in public, they often indulge in a little understatement. When you hear, for instance, a reference to a ""robust exchange of views"", you can assume the encounter actually bordered on the violent. So, when Mrs May's de facto deputy, Damian Green, told BBC Radio 5 live that the timing of Mr Johnson's intervention ""could have been better for all sorts of reasons"", you can imagine that the reaction privately, from some, has been rather more salty. And it has. Two of the government's most senior figures, in the space of an hour, publicly admonishing a cabinet colleague tells you all you need to know about how unwelcome Mr Johnson's 4,000 word treatise was in Downing Street. When asked if the article was a leadership challenge, Rudd said ""no, I don't think it is"". ""I think that he, like I, supports the prime minister at this difficult time as we try to conclude the negotiations with the EU."" After his article's publication Mr Johnson later tweeted he was ""all behind Theresa for a glorious Brexit"". In his article, Mr Johnson had said the UK should not be giving the EU any money to gain access to the single market after Brexit and said he would like to see a lot of the money recovered from Brussels going to the NHS, repeating the disputed referendum claim that exit could provide an extra Â£350m for the health service. Damian Green told BBC Radio 5live Mr Johnson's article ""could have been better"" The intervention comes just days before the prime minister makes a major speech on Brexit in Florence, amid speculation she is prepared to announce some kind of deal on transitional trade payments. Damian Green, a close ally of the prime minister, told Radio 5live's Pienaar's Politics, that the timing of Mr Johnson's article ""could have been better for all sorts of reasons not least the terrible terrorist incident we've had"". But he insisted the cabinet was united around the prime minister. ""There is a huge challenge facing this country that we have got to get these negotiations right,"" he said. ""That whatever we said during the referendum campaign, whichever side we were on, the duty of everyone in government is to make sure we get the best deal for Britain."" Ms Rudd has also announced the UK wants to agree a new treaty with the EU after it leaves in March 2019 to ensure existing security co-operation is fully maintained. Details will be published on Monday on how the UK will aim to continue to share information and evidence on wanted criminals with its EU partners after leaving and ensure suspects can still be extradited quickly. She said a new treaty would ""lock in"" existing cross-border crime-fighting and intelligence-sharing arrangements and enable the UK to remain a member of Europol outside of the EU. ""I want the French man in London to be safe and the English man in Berlin. They (the EU) want the same outcomes."" She conceded the UK's security would be weakened if it was unable to agree an over-arching Brexit deal but she was ""absolutely confident"" this would not happen.

"The Paris deal commits the signatories to keeping rising global temperatures ""well below"" 2C above pre-industrial levels The US has insisted it will leave the Paris climate accord, despite reports that it may be softening its stance. Following a meeting of environment ministers on Saturday, the EU climate commissioner, Miguel Arias Canete, said Trump officials had indicated the US would either stay in the 2015 accord or review its terms. But the White House insisted there had been ""no change"" in the US position. In June President Donald Trump said the US would withdraw from the deal. He said it was part of his ""solemn duty to protect America"" and he would seek a new deal that would not disadvantage US businesses. But opponents say withdrawing from the accord is an abdication of US leadership on a key global challenge. The Paris agreement commits the US and 187 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures ""well below"" 2C above pre-industrial levels and ""endeavour to limit"" them even more, to 1.5C. Only Syria and Nicaraguadid not sign up to the deal. Speakingin the White House Rose Garden,he characterised the Paris agreement as a deal that aimed to hobble, disadvantage and impoverish the US. He claimed the agreement would cost the US 6.5 million jobs and $3tn (Â£2.2tn) in lost GDP - while rival economies like China and India were treated more favourably. This video can not be played Trump: The world won't laugh any more at US ""In order to fulfil my solemn duty to protect America and its citizens, the United States will withdraw from the Paris climate accord... but begin negotiations to re-enter either the Paris accord or a really entirely new transaction on terms that are fair to the United States,"" he said. During his visit to France in July, however,Mr Trump hintedthat the US could shift its position on the deal - but did not elaborate. ""Something could happen with respect to the Paris accord... We'll see what happens."" Five effects of US pullout How did world react? What is climate change? On Saturday,the Wall Street Journal quoted,externalMr Arias as saying that Trump administration officials said the US would not pull out of the agreement, and were offering to re-engage in the deal. The WSJ said the shift in the position came at a meeting of environment ministers from about 30 countries at a gathering in Montreal, Canada. That meeting was attended by a US observer. This video can not be played Matt McGrath explains why we should care about climate change The US ""stated that they will not renegotiate the Paris Accord, but they [will] try to review the terms on which they could be engaged under this agreement,"" Mr Canete said. He said that ""there would be a meeting on the sidelines of next week's UN General Assembly with American representatives ""to assess what is the real US position"", according to the AFP news agency. ""It's a message which is quite different to the one we heard from President Trump in the past,"" Mr Canete added. What is in the Paris climate deal? Will this hurt Trump? At the same time, Chilean Environment Minister Marcelo Menatweeted (in Spanish):,external""I was in the meeting, and the [US] negotiator effectively did not close the door on continuing in the agreement, and ruled out looking for a new agreement."" But in a statement later on Saturday, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said: ""There has been no change in the United States' position on the Paris agreement, ""As the president has made abundantly clear, the United States is withdrawing unless we can re-enter on terms that are more favourable to our country."" Bloombergreported,externalthat the US is ""no longer seeking to withdraw from the pact and then renegotiate it, but rather wants to re-engage with the Paris Agreement from within"". While the White House insists its stance has not changed, deciding not to withdraw from the Paris deal and instead focus on negotiating while remaining a signatory would represent a significant about-turn. TheLos Angeles Times said,externalstaying in the Paris deal would be ""one of the most controversial"" reversals of the Trump presidency.

"This video can not be played Drivers rushed to help those caught in the crash Four people have died in a crash on the M5. Police said a lorry travelling southbound crashed through the central reservation and hit at least two vehicles heading the opposite way. A woman and two children were also injured in the crash and taken to hospitals in Bristol, where they are in a life-threatening condition. Emergency services were called just after 14:30 BST on Saturday to junctions 15 and 14 in Gloucestershire. The lorry driver was taken to hospital to be checked over as a precaution. The motorway was shut for hours after the crash in both directions between junctions 16 and 14 to allow the recovery operation and investigations to be carried out. The southbound side of the carriageway reopened at about 05:30. Highways England said it expected the northbound side to remain shut throughout Sunday. Supt Simon Ellis, of Avon and Somerset Police, said the rescue and recovery operation was ""painstaking work"". ""Our priority is to ensure the victims' next of kin are notified and supported, as well as the ongoing management of the scene, and this important work is ongoing,"" he said. Supt Ellis thanked the emergency services, as well as members of the public who ""courageously went to the aid of those involved"" in the crash. Motorists have been stuck on the M5 for hours Cardiologist Dr Amer Hamed was in a car travelling ""10 to 20 seconds behind"" when the crash happened. He was one of the first at the scene along with a passing GP and other medics to help an injured woman who was in one of the cars. Paramedics arrived on the scene about six minutes later and the woman Dr Hamed had been helping was taken away by ambulance to hospital. He said: ""There was a lorry involved and at least two other cars. One was absolutely destroyed and another had flipped over."" He said motorists who had been stuck on the carriageway for several hours were ""very helpful"". ""People are helping as much as they can,"" he said. ""Several people offered us water and one man came out of his car to give food. We're going to be stuck here for a few hours yet."" South Western Ambulance Service said it was called just after 14.30 BST. The most striking thing about the scene is the almost complete silence here. Looking over the bridge, the police, fire and ambulance crews are patiently doing their work at quite a disturbing scene. The lorry that has crashed has hit what M5 commuters will know as a familiar landmark, a windsock next to the road. But alongside that are several cars crushed from the impact. On the other side of the bridge, motorists patiently wait with some eager to help. I overheard one asking if any prayer support was needed. While others talk to police officers about the sadness of what has happened.

"A number of London firefighters had to take leave after Grenfell The number of UK fire and rescue staff taking long-term sick leave due to mental illness has risen by nearly a third over the last six years, figures show. In London, the figure has doubled since 2011-12. Some 103 London fire staff have taken mental health leave this year, some after working at Grenfell Tower. The Home Office said it was the responsibility of fire services to put wellbeing services in place. Two-thirds of fire services provided data following a Freedom of Information request submitted by 5 live Investigates. They reveal the number of firefighters and other staff taking long-term mental health leave rose from 600 to 780 over the last six years. At least 126 staff have left the service due to mental health issues since 2011. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service and Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service only provided comparable figures for one full year. In 2016-17, 97 Scottish fire staff took long-term mental health sick leave while in Northern Ireland that figure was 111. Andy Graham served as a firefighter for 30 years before retiring with PTSD Andy Graham, 52, is a former firefighter, who served in the Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service. He has suffered from PTSD for the last 30 years. Mr Graham, who has a son and a daughter, retired last year and now trains others in mental health first aid. ""When I started in the fire service in 1987 there was no proper debriefing system in place,"" he explained. ""The first fatal incident I attended was a particularly traumatic suicide. ""Within a matter of weeks, I started suffering from nightmares and panic attacks, and it snowballed from there, after attending more fatal incidents."" He said that he was afraid to go to bed at night because of the nightmares. ""It meant I started staying up late, drinking alcohol to help me sleep. ""Through the daytime, there would be triggers that would set me off having flashbacks and panic attacks. Those triggers were blue lights, sirens, loud bangs. Seeing certain situations being depicted on TV even would set me off."" His son, John, was only five when his father had a breakdown. ""It's horrible to bring it back, being so young and coming through the front door and seeing your dad lying on the couch with a blank look on his face, someone that you're so used to being bubbly and happy, and he doesn't even say hello to you."" Andy explained that he tried to keep a lid on his issues for years. ""But they were always there, bubbling under the surface. When you're in the fire service, you're told that you're the strong one, the one there to help others. ""So it goes really against the grain to be asking for help. ""I've been in therapy four times now, and I'm in a better place than I have been for 29 years. ""Fire services have better debriefing systems than they used to, but the support is not where it needs to be yet."" This video can not be played Andy Graham pictured with his son John, is now on the road to recovery Richard Welch, London Fire Brigade commander for Lambeth said that following the incident at Grenfell Tower, 200 of their staff have received counselling - and that 80 were still seeing counsellors. Sean Starbuck, mental health lead for the Fire Brigades Union said: ""The stigma attached to mental health needs to be consigned to the bins of history where it belongs. It's not going to get there on its own. ""Fire services need to create an environment where firefighters feel able to disclose if they are suffering as a result of traumatic scenes they witness as part of the job. ""At the moment it appears many are unable to."" Faye McGuinness, programme manager for mental health charity Mind's Blue Light programme, said: ""Our survey of over 1,600 staff and volunteers across emergency services shows nearly nine in 10 have experienced stress, low mood or poor mental health while working in their current role. ""A shocking one in four told us that they had contemplated taking their own lives. ""Not everyone involved in a traumatic event will develop post-traumatic stress disorder. It can take a long time - sometimes years - for symptoms to emerge."" A Home Office spokesperson said: ""It is the responsibility of fire and rescue services to have wellbeing services in place that meet their workforce needs. ""The government has provided an additional Â£1.5m to pay for mental health support through Mind's Blue Light Programme to ensure our emergency services workers have the counselling and emotional support they require."" Ann Millington of the National Fire Chiefs Council (NFCC) said the increase could reflect a change in behaviour with more firefighters prepared to seek assistance. She said fire and rescue services had put a lot of work into ensuring help and support are available to staff and they were working hard to reduce the stigma around mental health issues. She added: ""The days following the Grenfell fire saw a lot of open discussion about support being made available to firefighters and firefighters openly discussing it. The fact that people were talking about it openly and willing to accept help is an encouraging sign for the wider fire sector."" A spokesperson for the London Fire Brigade said: ""The welfare of staff is of paramount importance to the brigade. Our counselling and wellbeing service provides accredited counselling to all staff to help with their psychological wellbeing. ""Firefighters can and do see some traumatising things and it is important to give them the support they need and for them to know that there are always people available to listen to them. ""Seeing an increase in the number of people coming forward because they need help is positive, as rather than suppressing their feelings, staff want to seek help and use the services available to them."" The service says that of the 103 staff members identified in 5 live's FOI figures, five were as a result of the Grenfell Tower disaster. All of these staff members are continuing to receive occupational health and counselling support. 5 live Investigates: Firefighter Mental Healthis broadcast on BBC Radio 5 live on Sunday, 17 September at 11:00 BST.
