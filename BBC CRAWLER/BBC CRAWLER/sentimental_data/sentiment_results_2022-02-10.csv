"A High Court ruling in 2021 cleared founder Camilla Batmanghelidjh and seven trustees of any personal wrongdoing The collapsed Kids Company charity was mismanaged, a watchdog has concluded. The charity, set up by Camila Batmanghelidjh, folded in 2015 amid financial problems. A police investigation found no evidence of criminality or safeguarding failures. A new report by the Charity Commission,externalfound Kids Company had repeatedly failed to pay tax and its workers. Ex-trustees said they were pleased it found no basis for action to be taken but rejected the mismanagement finding. The report said there was no basis for regulatory action having found ""no dishonesty, bad faith, or inappropriate gain in the operation of the charity"" but added that trustees should have acted sooner to to improve its financial stability. The trustees said they were ""disappointed that the commission, in criticising some decisions we took, has chosen to discount the clear findings of the High Court that completely exonerated us"". Ms Batmanghelidjh has said she intends to seek a judicial review, calling the report a ""corrupted attempt"" to ""justify its mistaken decision to conduct an investigation in the first place"". Kids Company closure: What went wrong? Kids Company was founded in 1996 in south London, to provide support to up to 36,000 deprived and vulnerable inner-city children and young people. It ran youth centres in London, Bristol and Liverpool and employed more than 600 people. BBC presenter Alan Yentob was chairman of the trustees. In June 2015 local authorities in London were warned the charity was having financial difficulties but the government approved a Â£3m grant. The following month, it emerged the charity was told it would not get more public funding unless its chief executive, Ms Batmanghelidjh, was replaced. Ms Batmanghelidjh announced she would step down, but denied the charity was mismanaged. Later that month, a police investigation was triggered by an interview by Newsnight and Buzzfeed News with a former employee who made claims of physical and sexual abuse at the charity. The charity shut down in August 2015, saying its finances had become stretched because of the number of children ""pouring"" through its doors for help. In October of that year, the National Audit Office said Kids Company had received at least Â£46m of public money despite repeated concerns about how it was run. The Metropolitan Police closed its investigation into abuse in January 2016 saying it found""no evidence of criminality"". In 2021, the founder and former trusteeswon a High Court battle against being disqualified from other organisations. The Official Receiver argued they were ""unfit"" to hold directorships because of their handling of the charity. But the ruling cleared former chief executive Ms Batmanghelidjh and the seven others of personal wrongdoing. The judge said the charity might have survived had it not been for unfounded allegations of criminal activity. Now, the Charity Commission's official report has made a formal finding of ""mismanagement in the administration of the charity"". It found the charity had repeatedly failed to pay tax it owed and had failed to pay its own workers. It owed the Â£850,000 to HMRC when it collapsed. It said the charity operated a high-risk business model and the trustees had allowed spending to increase without funds to cover increased costs or a fall in fundraising. It said they should have acted sooner to improve the charity's financial stability. A statement from the former trustees said they were concerned that by criticising them and ""disregarding or dismissing"" the High Court's findings, the report would discourage good people from becoming charity trustees. Ms Batmanghelidjh called the commission's report a ""travesty"", said it ""ignores clear evidence"" and has ""invented findings"".

"This video can not be played Â£150 cost of living payments for households in Scotland Three quarters of Scottish households will be given a Â£150 payment in a bid to tackle the rising cost of living. Finance Secretary Kate Forbes said the cash would go to households in council tax bands A to D and all of those eligible for council tax reduction. It means some 1.85 million households - 73% of the total - will receive Â£150 of support when those elements are combined. An extra Â£10m is also to be targeted at people struggling with fuel bills. The cash is in addition to Â£120m allocated to local governmentin a bid to hold down council tax increasesin the coming year. Ms Forbes said that the payments were honestly ""not enough"" with households across the UK struggling, and called for ""urgent"" action from the UK government to help. Why are energy bills going up? Why are prices rising so quickly? Concerns about the cost of living are mounting,amid rising pricesand energy bills and coming changes to National Insurance. Ms Forbes said these costs would ""hit the most vulnerable in our society the hardest"", potentially pushing households into fuel poverty. The finance secretary said there was still uncertainty about how much extra funding is on offer from the UK government, but committed to spending Â£290m in ""targeted assistance"" for those on the lowest incomes. The Â£150 payments will go to all occupied households in council tax bands A to D, as well as all of those in receipt of council tax reduction. Local authorities will have the choice of delivering this either as a direct cash payment or as a credit to council tax accounts. Ms Forbes said this was ""clearly an imperfect scheme"", but said it was ""the only route we have to make sure we reach those for whom it will make a difference, quickly and simply"".

An extra Â£10m is being added to the ""fuel insecurity fund"", which helps households which have to ration their energy use or face being cut off due to ""unaffordable"" fuel prices. The UK government is also looking at offeringa repayable Â£200 discount on energy billsfor households in England, Wales and Scotland from October.

"Many health staff feel exhausted after two years of intense work during the pandemic, says the BMA There were almost 300 consultant vacancies across Northern Ireland's five health trusts last year, according to analysis from the British Medical Association (BMA). A report published by the organisation foundthere were 291 posts not filled by a permanent consultant in 2021,external. The Department of Health's vacancy data for the same period showed there were 126 consultant vacancies. The BMA in Northern Ireland said its analysis was more accurate. The head of its consultants committee, Dr David Farren, said the department's data was based on the number of vacancies actively being recruited for. ""We have about 270 consultants missing from the workforce in Northern Ireland, which means the remaining workforce has to work harder,"" he said. ""They are exhausted. ""They are burnt-out from having worked so intensely over the past two years and a lot of them are now looking at retirement and saying: 'That is what I should be doing, going away a bit earlier.'"" The BMA's Dr David Farren says a failure to plan has led to a shortage of consultants Dr Farren said a failure to ""properly plan"" had led to a shortage of consultants along with a different rate of pay compared to elsewhere in the UK. ""A consultant will earn considerably less here, so it's very difficult to recruit people from the rest of the UK or bring people in from overseas and all of these things have come together now at a time when the workforce is overly stressed,"" he added. A decision toremove emergency surgery from Daisy Hill hospitalwas taken by the Southern Health Trust last month, as it could not recruit enough consultant surgeons in Newry. Health Minister Robin Swann has said a number of hospitals in Northern Ireland face an ""ongoing challenge"" in recruiting and retaining specialist clinicians, particularly those on smaller sites. The Northern Health Trust recently launched a social media recruitment campaign for four consultant posts at the Causeway hospital in Coleraine, selling the benefits of living on the north coast. A previous campaign saw the trust fill five vacant consultant posts in the emergency department following past recruitment difficulties. On Thursday, the Department of Health said recruitment for permanent vacancies is led by each individual health trust. ""In the longer term, it is through increased investment in pre-registration education programmes that will create the labour supply necessary to meet the growing demand for services,"" a spokesperson said. ""The ability to grow our workforce supply depends on the availability of significant, recurrent investment in pre and post-registration training. ""The department and minister will continue to strive to ensure that the department receives the financial resources required to make this essential investment."" Dr Fergal Dunn, a consultant in emergency medicine, said smaller hospitals needed to emphasise what they were good at, as well as marketing the surrounding area and lifestyle. ""We set out to actively recruit emergency medical consultants to the Causeway site, it wasn't easy. it was a slow process to begin with, but the interesting thing was once we started to get one or two people over the line it kind of snowballed,"" he said. ""We went from having one person on the rota to six and actually there are more people interested in coming up here to work. ""There's the golf courses, the beaches, restaurants, we've great schools so we took all that and we're trying to sell the area as much as the hospital and were trying to sell the area as much as the hospital."" The trust's director of medicine, Audrey Harris, said that while there were ongoing issues around recruitment and pay across the health service, it was important to make the post attractive. ""You have to make the post where those people who apply can see they can have a work-life balance, especially medical staff, it is around the job planning, it is looking at special interest, it is looking at career pathways, it is looking at career development."" Dr Fergal Dunne says smaller hospitals need to emphasise what they're good at A new medical school at Ulster University's Magee campus in Londonderryopened for 70 students last yearand will provide additional doctors into the workforce from 2025. Prof Louise Dubras, foundation dean of the School of Medicine, said the bulk of students would stay within 20 miles of where they trained. ""Where we choose to live and choose to work are influenced by a number of factors but certainly the quality of the working environment and the nature of the support that you get from the leadership in that environment are all really important,"" she said. ""If we send students to a placement and they have a good experience there and they can see that it's a supportive environment, then they're certainly more likely to want to go back and work,"" she added. The Department of Health said no amount of additional funding or workplace planning could resolve the ongoing challenge in recruiting and retaining specialist clinicians. ""It is for this reason the department has commissioned a clinician-led review of general surgery to improve sustainability across the HSC system,"" said a department spokesperson. ""The department is very aware that the implementation of annual pay awards in Northern Ireland lags behind the other jurisdictions, while every effort is made to implement the awards as soon as possible, the nature of our devolved systems, with annual budgets and approvals locally for pay remits, does impact on the department's ability to respond in a more timely fashion."" In 2018, the department published the 2026 Strategy, a workforce plan for the HSC sector.

"Sting is a British singer-songwriter and actor Sting has sold his entire songwriting back catalogue, including solo work and material by The Police, to the Universal Music Group (UMG). The Tyneside-born singer's old band had hits with tracks including Every Breath You Take and Roxanne. He then went on to enjoy solo success with songs like Fields Of Gold, and has won 17 Grammys and three Brit Awards. The move marks the publishing group's latest big acquisition, after itstruck a deal with Bob Dylan in 2020. It also comes amidst a years-long record industry spending spree, with record labels and investment firms snapping up the rights to songs and recordings by the likes of David Bowie, Fleetwood Mac and Tina Turner, as well as Blondie, Taylor Swift, David Guetta and Shakira. Bowie estate sells rights to entire body of work Neil Young sells song rights in '$150m' deal Shakira is the latest star to sell her songs Tina Turner sells music rights for reported $50m ""It is absolutely essential to me that my career's body of work have a home where it is valued and respected - not only to connect with long-time fans in new ways, but also to introduce my songs to new audiences, musicians and generations,"" said 70-year-old Sting, who has been on the Universal music label for most of his career. ""Throughout my career, I have enjoyed a long and successful relationship with UMG as my label partner, under the watchful guidance of Lucian (Grainge), so it felt natural to unite everything in one trusted home, as I return to the studio, ready for the next chapter."" Sting, whose real name is Gordon Sumner, was the frontman, bass player and chief songwriter in The Police in the late 1970s and early 1980s, before going solo. The UK band won song of the year at the 1984 Grammys, for their haunting classic Every Breath You Take. Sir Lucian Grainge, boss of the Universal Music Group, commented that after having had ""the privilege"" to work with Sting for more than 20 years, he was ""thrilled"" to expand their relationship to now include music publishing.

"The Super Bowl is one of the world's biggest sporting events The US Department of Homeland Security has warned that a convoy of truckers protesting against Covid-19 vaccine mandates could impact the Super Bowl. The department said a protest similar to ongoing demonstrations in Canada could start in California in the coming days, and then travel to Washington DC. Truckers protesting in Canada's capital Ottawa have been blocking main roads. The Super Bowl, the final game of the US National Football League, is planned for Sunday 13 February in Los Angeles. In a bulletin issued to law enforcement agencies across the US, the department said it had received reports of truck drivers planning to potentially block roads in major cities in protest against mandatory Covid vaccinations in their industry. First reported by Yahoo News, the bulletin said thataction could continue until mid-March,external, and threaten both the Super Bowl - one of the world's biggest sporting events - and President Joe Biden's State of the Union address, scheduled for 1 March. How do you remove a 30-tonne truck? Why Canadian truckers are protesting in Ottawa Patience running thin at Canada's truckers' protest The department told the BBC it was ""tracking reports of a potential convoy"" but that it had ""not observed specific calls for violence"". Its bulletin added that such a convoy could ""severely disrupt transportation"" across the country and that the department would continue to monitor the situation. Canada's protests were sparked by a vaccine mandate for truckers crossing the US-Canada border, implemented by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government last month. The so-called Freedom Convoy movement has since morphed to include anger at other Covid restrictions and at Mr Trudeau's government more generally. The vast majority of Canadian truckers are vaccinated, and trucking organisations have distanced themselves from the protests. The protesting truckers and their supporters have been blocking main roads in Ottawa, the national capital, for almost two weeks. They have also been blocking border crossings including the Ambassador Bridge - the largest international suspension bridge in the world that carries about a quarter of US-Canada trade. It connects Windsor, Ontario, to Detroit, in the US state of Michigan. On Thursday, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer urged Canadian authorities to reopen the bridge to traffic. ""The blockade is having a significant impact on Michigan's working families,externalwho are just trying to do their jobs,"" Ms Whitmer wrote in a statement posted to Twitter. She called on Canada to ""take all necessary and appropriate steps to immediately and safely reopen traffic"". Ottawa police said in a statement on Thursday that25 people had been arrested over the protests,external, with charges including public mischief and driving while disqualified, and that 126 separate criminal investigations were under way. They added that several vehicles had been seized and more than 1,550 tickets issued for offences ranging from excessive noise to ""stunt driving"".

"The Super Bowl is one of the world's biggest sporting events The US Department of Homeland Security has warned that a convoy of truckers protesting against Covid-19 vaccine mandates could impact the Super Bowl. The department said a protest similar to ongoing demonstrations in Canada could start in California in the coming days, and then travel to Washington DC. Truckers protesting in Canada's capital Ottawa have been blocking main roads. The Super Bowl, the final game of the US National Football League, is planned for Sunday 13 February in Los Angeles. In a bulletin issued to law enforcement agencies across the US, the department said it had received reports of truck drivers planning to potentially block roads in major cities in protest against mandatory Covid vaccinations in their industry. First reported by Yahoo News, the bulletin said thataction could continue until mid-March,external, and threaten both the Super Bowl - one of the world's biggest sporting events - and President Joe Biden's State of the Union address, scheduled for 1 March. How do you remove a 30-tonne truck? Why Canadian truckers are protesting in Ottawa Patience running thin at Canada's truckers' protest The department told the BBC it was ""tracking reports of a potential convoy"" but that it had ""not observed specific calls for violence"". Its bulletin added that such a convoy could ""severely disrupt transportation"" across the country and that the department would continue to monitor the situation. Canada's protests were sparked by a vaccine mandate for truckers crossing the US-Canada border, implemented by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government last month. The so-called Freedom Convoy movement has since morphed to include anger at other Covid restrictions and at Mr Trudeau's government more generally. The vast majority of Canadian truckers are vaccinated, and trucking organisations have distanced themselves from the protests. The protesting truckers and their supporters have been blocking main roads in Ottawa, the national capital, for almost two weeks. They have also been blocking border crossings including the Ambassador Bridge - the largest international suspension bridge in the world that carries about a quarter of US-Canada trade. It connects Windsor, Ontario, to Detroit, in the US state of Michigan. On Thursday, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer urged Canadian authorities to reopen the bridge to traffic. ""The blockade is having a significant impact on Michigan's working families,externalwho are just trying to do their jobs,"" Ms Whitmer wrote in a statement posted to Twitter. She called on Canada to ""take all necessary and appropriate steps to immediately and safely reopen traffic"". Ottawa police said in a statement on Thursday that25 people had been arrested over the protests,external, with charges including public mischief and driving while disqualified, and that 126 separate criminal investigations were under way. They added that several vehicles had been seized and more than 1,550 tickets issued for offences ranging from excessive noise to ""stunt driving"".

"Debbie Richards has welcomed the bonus payment but questions whether it is enough, especially as the cost of living is going up About 53,000 care workers will receive a Â£1,000 bonus from April, the Welsh government has announced. The payment will be made to registered care home and home care workers alongside the introduction of the real living wage. One care home manager said it was not enough to cope with rises in the cost of living. But the government hopes that it will help with the recruitment and retention crisis in social care. The Welsh government has also confirmed the bonus will not be offered to auxiliary staff such as kitchen and cleaning workers. Deputy minister Julie Morgan MS said the bonus, which will cost Â£96m, was part of a drive to recognise the value of the care workforce. Care worker shortage is watchdog's biggest worry Care workers dreading winter amid staffing crisis 'My shame over long Covid 18-month work absence' ""It's been difficult to recruit and retain staff, particularly during the pandemic. It's always been fragile but people are exhausted,"" Ms Morgan said. She said the bonus showed a commitment to ""supporting and encouraging"" more people to consider a career in care. She admitted the bonus and introduction of the real living wage and was not enough on its own to attract people to the sector, but said it was ""a big step forward"" and would help alongside improving terms and conditions. There has been a desperate need for more social care staff as many have left the sector to work in hospitality and retail. It has led to an increase in the number of medically fit people who have had to wait in hospital for appropriate care at home and there have been warnings some older people could end up in residential care sooner than necessary. Care home worker Roberta in Cwmtwrch, Powys,told BBC Radio Wales: ""I work in a care home with adults who are autistic and with learning difficulties. It's a privilege to look after them, they're wonderful people."" She added that carers were under a lot of stress due to being short staffed, with sickness and self-isolation. ""I'm supposed to be retiring in April but I don't think I'll be able to because you can't leave that home in that predicament,"" she said. ""The government needs to do something to get people into care. ""It's got a got a bit of bad name, when you hear on the news about abuses going on and everyone seems to think it's just wiping backsides and putting them to bed. ""It's so much more than that, you get attached to clients. I worry they're suffering as well, with Covid they're not doing their daily activities and we haven't got enough staff to take them out."" Debbie Richards manages The Fields Nursing Home in Newport, which was clear of Covid-19 until December 2021 when 22 residents and 20 staff tested positive. Ms Richards said the extra money for staff was ""excellent news"" but it was a challenging time covering shifts and making sure everyone was safe and well. ""I think with everything going up now, is it going to be enough?"" she said. ""Energy prices are soaring and the cost of living is going up hugely, so I don't know."" She added that while she had a ""stable staff team"" the care sector struggled because of the wage it offered. ""Other industries with far less responsibilities are paying more,"" she said. Care Forum Wales represents more than 450 independent care providers. Mary Wimbury says care workers receive a lot of training in order to care for vulnerable patients or those with complex health needs Chief executive Mary Wimbury told BBC Radio Wales: ""Care home workers aren't required to register until next October but my understanding that those who will be required to register by October will still get this bonus."" Ms Wimbury added that the bonus and the Real Living Wage should be seen as a ""first step"" as the care sector was still fragile. ""We want that professional workforce but they've got to be rewarded appropriately and we've got to have that career structure there. ""People are dealing with complex conditions, really vulnerable people, there's a lot of training involved. ""Training and experience contributes to what people can bring to the sector. We need to recognise that financially."" A total of 52,987 registered care workers and care managers are eligible for a real living wage pay increase from April. They will also receive the bonus. The payment will be Â£1,498 before tax and national insurance deductions so care workers on the basic tax rate can expect to take home about Â£1,000. It is expected that the payment will be processed in people's pay from April to June and will be available as a single payment or monthly instalments to minimise disruption to Universal Credit payments. The Unison union has welcomed the payment but has said more is needed to help the care sector. Mark Turner from Unison says he hopes the bonus will encourage people to stay in the care sector Mark Turner, care lead, said he hoped it would persuade people to return to the sector but that the Real Living Wage was ""not enough"". ""It is a start but the Welsh government has to address the poor terms and conditions of those in the care sector in Wales and that's why Unison is calling for a publicly delivered national care service."" He added that many of them were ""struggling to make ends meet"". ""A lot of care workers have decided that they've had enough and have left,"" he said. ""They've gone to work in retail, in shops and in hospitality. I'm hoping the introduction of the Real Living Wage and this payment may encourage some people to come back and encourage care workers who are struggling to stay. ""We are hoping this is the first step in trying to improve things for care workers.""

"Unilever, the firm behind brands such as Marmite and Dove Soap, has said it will put up its prices again this year as its overheads continue to rise. The consumer goods giant, which already raised prices in 2021, said the cost of some its goods would climb but it would vary from country to country. Many firms are struggling with rising raw material, wage and energy costs. Unilever said: ""We don't want to put prices up but we're seeing the highest inflation we've seen in a decade. ""There will be price increases on some products and in some markets but it will not be uniform across the world."" Unilever, which also makes Ben & Jerry's ice cream and Hellmann's mayonnaise, said it was facing â¬3.5bn (Â£2.95bn) of extra costs in 2022 alone. It said it expected strong growth in sales this year as it raises prices, but also forecast a sharp decline in its profit margins. Other big firms have already revealed price rises to offset increased costs, including High Street giant Next, which said its prices would jump by up to 6% this year. Greggs, Britain's biggest bakery chain, said it had boosted prices between 5p and 10p on items across its range of sausage rolls and cakes, while Pret a Manger is upping the price of its coffee subscription service to Â£25 a month from Â£20. Next and Greggs raise prices as costs spiral Shoppers hit with sharpest price rises in a decade Don't ask for a big pay rise, warns Bank boss Food prices are also set to rise further, with the boss of Tesco warning supermarket prices could increase by as much as 5% by the spring. It comes as pay rises are failing to keep up with the rise in the cost of living, recent official figures show, putting the biggest squeeze on household finances in decades. However, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) also warned of a ""cost-of-doing-business crisis"" and called on the chancellor to help companies. Hannah Essex, the co-executive director of the BCC, told the BBC's Today programme: ""These price pressures have been building over the course of the last year, and it has now reached the point where businesses are passing that cost onto other businesses and to consumers."" It was partly due to global issues, she said, but added that there are ""levers that the government can pull to make things better"". Ms Essex called for an energy cap for smaller businesses and for the National Insurance increase set for April to be postponed for at least a year, adding that businesses could no longer absorb costs. ""It has reached the point where [firms] simply don't have a choice [but to put up prices],"" she said. She gave examples of a laundrette in Kent that has had a 250% increase in energy costs and companies seeing a 70% increase in the cost of raw materials. According to a BCC survey of 1,000 of its members, three in four businesses are putting up their prices to cover higher costs. The most commonly reported cost pressure was wages: 63% of firms overall - and 70% of manufacturers - reported rising wage demands causing pressure. This was closely followed by energy costs. The survey found 62% of companies said soaring energy bills were creating pressure, while 90% of manufacturing firms said higher raw material costs were an issue. In response to these pressures, 73% of firms said they were raising prices, while one in 20 respondents to the poll said they were considering ceasing trade completely. Consumer price inflation is on course to rise above 7% this year, a threat that recently prompted the boss of the Bank of England to urge workers to not ask forbig pay rises, to try to stop prices rising out of control. However, a new report by recruiters said starting salaries for permanent and temporary staff were being driven up due to a scarcity of candidates. ""With competition for staff still hot, companies are having to raise pay rates for new starters to attract the best people, and the cost of living crisis means there is also more pressure from jobseekers who want a pay rise,"" said Neil Carberry, chief executive of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC), which worked on the report with KPMG. The Treasury said it was aware of the strains caused by higher energy bills and was in ""regular contact"" with business groups and energy suppliers to ""see how they can best be supported"". A spokesman said the government had backed businesses through the pandemic with ""unprecedented"" support and would ""continue to stand firmly behind them"".

"The last remaining Covid restriction in England could be gone in weeks, after the prime minister announcedthe legal requirement to isolate after a positive test may be scrapped early. The plan had been to end it on 24 March - but if the trends remained positive, Boris Johnson said, it could go a month early. The move has taken many experts by surprise, with one describing it as either brave or stupid. When will the self-isolation rules be scrapped? What Covid rules remain across the UK? As often with Covid, the evidence is unclear. Certainly questions are being asked about the politics of the move, with the prime minister under continuing pressure. But there is plenty of positive news in the latest data - as the prime minister suggested. Hospital cases are falling and, despite the large wave of Omicron infections, overall deaths have not risen above what would normally be seen in winter. With new treatments and a huge amount of immunity in the population, from both vaccination and infection, the risk from the virus is lessening all the time. Other nations are also relaxing rules around self-isolation. Denmark, for example, now requires people to stay at home only if they have symptoms. Nonetheless, there are also grounds for caution. Infection levels remain high. And the Office for National Statistics (ONS) monitoring programme suggests they may even be rising again, with about one out of every 19 people in England positive last week. Coupled with this is the rise of a sub-variant of Omicron, BA.2, thought to be even more transmissible than the version, first identified in South Africa, that caused the Christmas surge. BA.2 now accounts for an estimated one out of every six infections - a proportion that is growing every week. This is one of the reasons Prof Paul Hunter, an expert in infectious disease, at the University of East Anglia, was surprised by the announcement on self-isolation. ""At some point, it is going to be the case that all remaining restrictions are dropped, including the need to self-isolate, though I certainly didn't expect that to happen this month,"" he says. Prof Hunter would have preferred to wait a little bit longer to see what happens with infections and the sub-variant. Dr Simon Clarke, from the University of Reading, who says that the move is either ""brave or stupid"", explains that the problem is nobody knows for sure what the impact will be. Some believe people could now feel pressurised into returning to work before they are physically ready or no longer infectious. It is worth bearing in mind, though, not every infected person was isolating anyway. This winter, the testing system has been picking up only half of all infections - so at the peak, an estimated 200,000 people a day in England who should have been were not being formally asked to isolate. Furthermore, about one in five of those who test positive does not fully adhere to the isolation requirements, according to the ONS. It is easy to overestimate the impact of government rules and the significance of removing them. After all, at Christmas there were no limits on mixing in England - but contact levels were still at incredibly low rates, similar to those seen in the first lockdown. Just because the public is no longer under a legal requirement to isolate, it does not mean they will suddenly stop staying home when ill. After all, when the rules do end, there will be guidance about the importance of staying at home if you are ill. Those willing and able to follow the rules - some say there has been insufficient financial support to help people on low incomes isolate when they risk losing earnings - may largely continue with their current behaviours, University College London epidemiologist Prof Tim Colbourn says. ""Ending legal isolation requirements doesn't meant everyone will freely spread Covid everywhere,"" he says. ""People still care about family, friends and colleagues. ""Given the availability of rapid tests and current isolation law being largely unenforceable, it might not actually make much difference."" Follow Nickon Twitter,external. Read morefrom Nick.

"This video can not be played Â£150 cost of living payments for households in Scotland Three quarters of Scottish households will be given a Â£150 payment in a bid to tackle the rising cost of living. Finance Secretary Kate Forbes said the cash would go to households in council tax bands A to D and all of those eligible for council tax reduction. It means some 1.85 million households - 73% of the total - will receive Â£150 of support when those elements are combined. An extra Â£10m is also to be targeted at people struggling with fuel bills. The cash is in addition to Â£120m allocated to local governmentin a bid to hold down council tax increasesin the coming year. Ms Forbes said that the payments were honestly ""not enough"" with households across the UK struggling, and called for ""urgent"" action from the UK government to help. Why are energy bills going up? Why are prices rising so quickly? Concerns about the cost of living are mounting,amid rising pricesand energy bills and coming changes to National Insurance. Ms Forbes said these costs would ""hit the most vulnerable in our society the hardest"", potentially pushing households into fuel poverty. The finance secretary said there was still uncertainty about how much extra funding is on offer from the UK government, but committed to spending Â£290m in ""targeted assistance"" for those on the lowest incomes. The Â£150 payments will go to all occupied households in council tax bands A to D, as well as all of those in receipt of council tax reduction. Local authorities will have the choice of delivering this either as a direct cash payment or as a credit to council tax accounts. Ms Forbes said this was ""clearly an imperfect scheme"", but said it was ""the only route we have to make sure we reach those for whom it will make a difference, quickly and simply"". She added: ""I will be writing to the Chief Secretary to the Treasury highlighting that we must work together urgently so we can use our joint powers to do more to tackle the cost of living."" Teacher Danielle Fletcher-Horn can see the effects of the cost-of-living crisis daily both at school and in her charity work Danielle Flecher-Horn is a teacher, and founder of Aberdeen charity AberNecessities, which has been handing out hot water bottles since fuel prices soared. ""People are not turning their heating on and we are providing hot water bottles,"" she said. ""So at least children are going to bed relatively warm, but they're certainly not warm when they're waking up."" She said the charity was experiencing an increase in applications for really basic food essentials. As a teacher, she has seen children coming into school asking for food. ""There might have been one or two cases throughout my 12 years of teaching where children have come in hungry, but this is daily, they are coming in asking members of staff for a cereal bar, a bit of fruit, anything, because they haven't eaten the night before."" ""We are asking children to come in to learn, it's not possible when you've got an empty tummy. It's heartbreaking."" An extra Â£10m is being added to the ""fuel insecurity fund"", which helps households which have to ration their energy use or face being cut off due to ""unaffordable"" fuel prices. The UK government is also looking at offeringa repayable Â£200 discount on energy billsfor households in England, Wales and Scotland from October. However UK ministers have dismissed calls for a one-off ""windfall tax"" on oil giants which have posted big profits - proposed by Labour andbacked by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon- saying it would only raise prices for consumers and hit investment. An additional Â£10m will be targeted at people struggling with fuel bills Citizens Advice Scotland said that while extra support was welcome, ""the stark reality is that lots of people are still going to be significantly worse off"". Chief executive Derek Mitchell said: ""The spring is going to see a cost of living crisis which will squeeze household budgets to breaking point. People are already struggling badly."" And the Poverty Alliance said it was ""deeply disappointing"" that Ms Forbes plans mirrored UK government plans to funnel support through the council tax system. They said: ""The measures fail to properly target support at people on the lowest incomes - this was a missed opportunity to protect people living in poverty from the waves of hardship that threaten to overwhelm them."" It may seem surprising that the Scottish government says it will fund council tax discounts to help households deal with rising energy bills. They were decidedly lukewarm about using the council tax when the Westminster government announced a similar scheme in England last week. Some had expected them to use the money from Westminster to support those struggling with their fuel bills in other ways. By the Scottish government's admission, using the council tax for this is imperfect. The Scottish scheme will not operate in quite the same way as in England though. In Scotland, it should benefit everyone who receives council tax reduction regardless of which band their home is in - while in England the risk is that those in larger houses who are ""asset rich but cash poor"" like some retired people might get no extra help. The advantage of using the council tax is that it is relatively quick and straightforward. Targeted help for individual households could be harder to administer and take longer to be effective. With fuel bills rising, there is an urgency in providing help. Ms Forbes made her announcement at Holyrood during the final debate of the Scottish government's tax and spending plans for the coming year. The finance secretary said the budget ""provides a platform to accelerate our recovery from the pandemic, tackle inequalities, invest in the economy and public services and continue a just transition to net-zero"". The budget bill passed with the SNP and their Green partners holding a majority at Holyrood, but opposition parties hit out at the plans. Scottish Conservative finance spokeswoman Liz Smith said the SNP had been ""profligate with taxpayers money"" and had wasted cash which could have been spent in the budget. She added: ""Because of the unholy alliance between the SNP and the Greens, this budget has been a fait accompli from day one. It's a budget that has failed to put economic recovery first and failed to put forward the delivery of local services."" And Scottish Labour's Paul Sweeney said the budget was ""timid, regressive and unambitious"". He added: ""It doesn't do nearly enough to tackle the cost of living crisis which is no longer looming in the distance, but is staring us directly in the face. We all have a duty to do everything we possibly can to address the hardship faced by families.""

By BBC London's Home Affairs correspondent Lauren Moss Over the past few weeks I've lost count of the number of times I've spoken about various apologies the Met has made. Ongoing reviews, police watchdog reports and so on - this is the first time we've heard from the commissioner and she has no intention of going. Quite a bit of fighting talk too amid mounting pressure on her. Only yesterday, Sadiq Khan stopped short of saying he had confidence in Dame Cressida and he wanted a plan of action to root out the real issues.

"Many households are facing a squeeze on their finances as energy bills soar and inflation rises Plans aimed at helping people in Scotland cope with the cost-of-living crisis are to be unveiled later. Finance Secretary Kate Forbes said an extra Â£290m will be allocated to the plans - of which Â£120m was previously said to be going to councils. Ms Forbes will give further details on Thursday afternoon of how the money will be spent. It will come as the Scottish government's budget for the coming year is formally approved by Holyrood. The cost of living crisis has been caused by spiralling energy bills and rising inflation combined with flat or falling incomes. Scottish budget 2022-23: At a glance Why are your energy bills going up? The UK government said last week that an additional Â£290m would be going to Scotland as the result of Barnett consequentials from the Â£150 cut to council tax bands A to D announced for England by Chancellor Rishi Sunak last week as part of efforts to tackle the problem. It said this would be on top of a Â£200 reduction on energy bills for customers in England, Scotland and Wales in October, which will be repaid at Â£40 a year over five years from April 2023. The announcement was welcomed at the time by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon - although she said it did not go far enough towards helping the hundreds of thousands of people in Scotland who are expected to be pushed into fuel poverty by rising energy bills. However, Ms Forbes appeared to suggest in a tweet on Wednesday that there would actually be no additional money for Scotland as a result of the council tax cut in England. She said the Scottish government would still ""honour our commitment to allocate Â£290m to deal with the cost of living crisis in Scotland"". But she said this would ""require us to revise the latest budget position I set out to the Scottish Parliament last week."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

However, her claim was dismissed by the UK government, which insisted that the Scottish government ""will receive Â£296m of Barnett consequentials as a result of the council tax rebate announced by the chancellor."" A spokesman added: ""This is new funding for the Scottish government. ""People in Scotland expect both governments to be working together for them, their families and communities so we will continue engage with them on this support."" Ms Forbes - who announced earlier this week that she is pregnant - also said her budget would ""provide a platform to accelerate our recovery from the pandemic, tackle inequalities, invest in the economy and public services and continue a just transition to net-zero."" It will include doubling the Scottish Child Payment to Â£20 from April 2022 for families in poverty with children under the age of six - which will be extended to under 16s by the end of 2022. The minimum wage will rise to Â£10.50 an hour for social care staff and all people covered by the public sector pay policy. And income tax rates will remain unchanged next year - although the thresholds at which it is paid will increase for lower earners. The UK government insists Scotland will get Â£296m of additional money from Rishi Sunak's council tax announcement last week Council leaders had hit out at the ""totally unacceptable"" settlement they were offered by the government, warning that a real-terms cut in their funding meant a mixture of council tax rises and cuts to services were inevitable. The government later said it would give councils - who have complete control over local tax rates for the first time since the SNP came to power in 2007 - an additional Â£120m. The Scottish Conservatives backed the extra council funding, with finance spokeswoman Liz Smith ""warmly welcoming the actions of the UK government in assisting with this budget"". However she said her party would be voting against the package as a whole, as the government had ""created many more problems within this budget than it has actually solved"". Meanwhile, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar has unveiled his party's five-point plan to tackle the cost of living crisis - including a so-called ""windfall tax"" on the profits of oil and gas firms such as Shell and BP, and a cut to VAT on energy prices. How would a windfall tax on energy firms work? Sturgeon: Big profit energy firms should pay more Labour also wants to see targeted support for the hardest-hit Scots by providing a Â£400 Scottish Fuel Payment to those in need, and for the Scottish Welfare Fund to be topped up to ""ensure local government is empowered to help those in financial difficulty"". Mr Sarwar said: ""Across Scotland, people will be wondering where they are going to find the extra Â£693 to keep the heating and lights on; just months after bills rose by Â£139. ""They will look at rising travel costs, water charges and food bills and wonder why they are paying the price for government inaction. ""They are left to foot the bill because Scotland has two bad governments who would rather play politics with the cost of living crisis than take action.""

"Cwmystwyth offers beautiful views, but is about 30 minutes' drive away from the nearest town Residents of a remote village fear they will be effectively cut off if plans go ahead to switch off copper phone lines. BT is proposing to switch off the Victorian era network across the UK, including in Cwmystwyth, Ceredigion, and move people on to fibre. But villagers said they were worried that a poor mobile signal would leave them with no means of communication in the event of frequent power cuts. BT said it would work with residents to resolve any issues. Internet revamp for the humble landline Old TV caused village broadband outages The feelings in Cwmystwyth are echoed by other communities in Wales and across the UK. Cwmystwyth is in one of Wales' most remote valleys, about 16 miles (25km) from Aberystwyth, and at an altitude of 300m (985ft) above sea level, poor weather conditions and power cuts are common. The villagers said they were shocked when they found out BT was transferring customers to its Digital Voice service, which needs an electricity supply to work, by 2025. Keith Hicks said the lack of copper lines could cause problems in emergencies Resident Keith Hicks received an email notifying him of the change, which he said ""didn't make any reference to any of the disadvantages except to say that in an event of a power cut you'll have to use a mobile"". He added: ""That's assuming of course that you've got a mobile and a mobile signal, which around here you don't."" He said overhead cables for wind and the internet were often affected by strong winds, but currently, the copper lines keep the village connected even when the power is down. Mr Hicks said this was very important in an emergency, which he crucially found out himself recently. ""Just over a year ago I had a heart attack, completely unexpected. Luckily I had a phone line at the time and was able to call the emergency services. But it did make me wonder what would've happened had that not been the case."" Sandy Neville says villagers can be cut off for days by storms Another resident, Sandy Neville, said: ""If something happened, and it doesn't need to be the most desperate emergency, if somebody broke an ankle, did something like that, if you can't phone you can't get help. ""We're very high, so we get a lot of wind, rain and snow often,"" she added. ""We can be cut off for days. ""The emergency services have enough of a job getting through to us at the best of times. If you can't even get hold of the emergency services it could be absolutely disastrous for people."" But Ofcom's head of regulatory affairs in Wales, Elinor Williams, said the network needed to be upgraded. She said: ""The copper network has reached the end of its journey. It's old, and it's very expensive to maintain. The change from analogue to digital will see consumers benefiting."" She said customers would have better sound quality, and there would be fewer nuisance and scam calls. Cwmystwyth's copper telephone lines have been in place since Victorian times Elin Jones, MS for Ceredigion, said Cwmystwyth was not the only village which would be affected by the plans. She said: ""There will be occurrences especially in the middle of winter, with the windy storms we're getting at the moment, where electricity supplies will be down and people have depended on the copper wire connection for their phone to continue in those circumstances. ""Currently we don't know enough about any back-up solutions, and we need to have BT and Ofcom out in these communities providing advice and assurances to everybody that it can be done by 2025. ""If they can't do that and provide that confidence, then they'll need to delay that 2025 date, because they can't leave communities [and] people without the access to communications that everybody knows everybody is reliable on these days."" BT said it was ""incredibly sorry"" to customers in Cwmystwyth who had been disconnected in recent storms. It added: ""We recognise the move to Digital Voice is a concern for a small amount of people, who believe they are in a coverage not-spot or a high-risk power cut area. Where this is the case, we will pause their upgrade and will work with them to resolve the issue."" Meanwhile, Openreach, which is owned by BT, has announced it will create about 250 jobs in Wales in 2022 as part of its investment in the broadband network. Openreach says the new recruits will include more than 200 apprenticeships.

"Sharon Graham, the Unite General Secretary, said she was prepared to escalate the dispute The head of the Unite union has threatened to withdraw funding for Labour over a pay dispute involving bin lorry drivers in Coventry. Union members in the citystarted a two-month strike at the end of January, saying drivers deserve better pay. Unite, Labour's single biggest donor, said financial support for the party was now ""under review"". In response, Labour said: ""These sort of threats won't work in Keir Starmer's Labour Party."" It wouldnot be the first time the union has cut funding for the partysince Sir Keir became leader. The row in Coventry, which started months ago, has become increasingly bad tempered, with the union and Labour-run council each accusing the other of manipulating the truth, particularly regarding the pay drivers receive. In a message to strikers, Unite General Secretary Sharon Graham said: ""Let me be very clear - the remaining financial support of the Labour Party is now under review."" She said the council had ""time and again totally misrepresented the union's claims for its bin drivers"" and it ""should be ashamed of the spin it has tried to make"" about its own workers' pay rates"". ""These dreadful misrepresentations are deliberately designed to enrage the general public which directly risks the welfare of workers who are taking part in an entirely legal dispute, and this, a Labour council."" Coventry City Council says it is one of the highest paying employers in the West Midlands and strongly disputes the union's numbers. Its decision to use a private contractorwholly owned by the local authority to do some refuse collections has further angered Unite, along with a warning on Wednesday thatjobs might be at risk if the strike continues. The two sides have recently met at independent arbitration service Acas, but for the moment remain at odds. By Elizabeth Glinka, BBC Midlands Political Editor In a dispute that has looked increasingly intractable, this takes it to a whole new level, putting a strike over pay for bin drivers in Coventry very much on the national stage. The official response from the Labour Party is punchy. This may be a relief to the leadership of the council who feared being forced to back-track under pressure, but is unlikely to soften Unite's position. At the end of January, news that both sides had agreed to Acas arbitration in relation to the pay grade element of the dispute brought some hope. The council and Unite were privately making positive noises, but since then the rhetoric seems to have hardened. There is no doubt the decision by the council to employ private drivers to break the strike enraged the union, but the council facing a month of all-out strikes, with no collections at all for its residents, said it was left with ""no option"". Settling any dispute usually comes down to both sides feeling they have succeeded in winning in some aspect. Right now it looks like no-one is winning, least of all council taxpayers in Coventry and a very high stakes game of ""who blinks first"" continues. Ms Graham urged Labour to ""pick up the phone and get this sorted"", saying: ""It's utterly disgusting that this council is putting workers through this misery. ""If we have to escalate, we will escalate and I personally will be getting involved. ""Our wallet is closed to bad employers."" In response to the funding review, the Labour Party said it would ""always act in the public interest"". ""We would have hoped that Unite would have got the message that the Labour Party is under new management,"" a spokesperson added.

"Hong Kong has some of the toughest virus restrictions in the world. Hong Kong has recorded more than 1,000 Covid infections for the first time since the pandemic began - a worrying milestone for officials who are aggressively pushing for zero-Covid. The city has some of the toughest virus restrictions in the world. Those who test positive for Covid are sent straight to hospital and there are strict curbs on dining out and social gatherings. There are fears that the rising cases will overwhelm the health system. The city's isolation wards are already at 90% of their capacity, with cases expected to rise exponentially over the next few days. Local papers report that as of Wednesday evening, there were still 200 confirmed patients waiting to be transported to a hospital, with reports of people who tested positive rushing to accident and emergency units. Health authorities say patients may have to wait up to a few days to be admitted. Hong Kong news outlet the South China Morning Post reported that officials were considering using hotels to house asymptomatic patients to avoid straining the public healthcare system. The latest surge in infections is believed to be due to extended family gatherings over the lunar new year. The city is also expected to tighten Covid restrictions as it shows no signs on letting up on its strategy to follow China's policy of eliminating the virus rather than living with it. Most recently, city officials controversially orderedthe mass culling of hamsters from a pet shopover fears of animal-to-human Covid transmission. Additionally, not more than two people can gather in public, restaurants are shut for dine-in with only takeaways allowed, and facilities like libraries, museums and gyms have been shut. Many public facilities have been shut in Hong Kong This has caused massive strain on business owners, with some experts saying prolonged restrictions of this nature could threaten the city's status as an Asian financial hub and drive smaller local businesses to ruin. However, officials are doubling down. More expats may quit HK over Covid laws: Survey Hong Kong pilots stuck in 'perpetual quarantine' The BBC's Jeff Li in Hong Kong reports that one pro-Beijing Hong Kong lawmaker has said anyone advocating to live with Covid should be charged under the controversial national security law which has been used to persecute dozens of pro-democracy activists. The lawmaker argued such a policy was akin to starting ""biological warfare"". Our correspondent adds that the city's government was quick to assert that ""general discussion"" over the effectiveness of the zero covid policy was not illegal. However, he says that the goal of Hong Kong's ""zero Covid"" pursuit - to allow residents quarantine-free travel to the Chinese mainland - seems further away than ever.

"This video can not be played Covid doctors: ""This wasn't what I signed up for"" A lack of beds in Welsh hospitals meant it was ""inevitable"" Covid patients would come into contact with others, a doctor has said. ""Seeing patients in bed at the time of admission is becoming a rarity,"" Dr Nicky Leopold said. Some patients, including those with Covid, have had to spend nights on chairs in A&E due to a lack of beds. The Welsh government said it aimed to deliver 12,000 more staff by 2024-25. Dr Leopold, a consultant geriatrician, who is a member of the BMA union in Wales, said there had been recent improvements since the number of NHS staff testing positive for Covid fell, but the flow of patients through hospital was still a problem. She said: ""So many patients are stranded in hospital and that's very difficult and frustrating. There just aren't the staff in the community to support the increased level of need."" Outpatient appointments had also been affected by shortages, she added. A lot of patients were in ""dire need"" and staff were ""desperately"" trying to keep clinics running. Patient spent four nights in A&E waiting for a bed The battle to get healthy patients home NHS waiting times in Wales hit record high again Dr Steve Kelly, a respiratory consultant, described ""really difficult working conditions"" with so many beds full of patients who had tested positive for Covid. He said fewer patients needed as much respiratory support as before but staff were ""just overwhelmed with patient numbers"". ""Lots of people are effectively trapped because we can't sort out care packages or help because they remain Covid-positive, so they need to stay with us until they're Covid-free,"" he said. ""It just slows down the process and makes our beds more full and makes the admissions more difficult and means people coming in spend longer in the emergency department than we would like."" Dr Kelly says many patients are effectively trapped Meanwhile, Dr Phil Banfield, the chairman of the BMA Cymru Wales consultants committee, said: ""The impact of the pandemic on the NHS is the tip of the iceberg. ""This predicament is one that was years in the making, the pandemic has just exacerbated the existing issues in the system. ""Health services will not be able to ensure patient safety or protect the fragile recovery of elective services without a well-supported, healthy and safe workforce. ""It is imperative the Welsh government and NHS employers take urgent action to expand the workforce and retain the staff we have."" Wales' health minister, Eluned Morgan, said a plan to tackle waiting lists would be published in April. A similar plan for England was published by the UK government this week. Ms Morgan told the Welsh government's health committee the plan could not be announced sooner as uncertainty remained about omicron's impact and how infection controls would continue to affect hospitals. Wales' health minister, Eluned Morgan, said a plan to tackle waiting lists would be published in April She said: ""Covid is still having an impact on staffing levels in the NHS... which has an impact on our capacity to increase surgical activity."" It's estimated about 1,000 patients in hospital beds are fit to go home but waiting for care to be arranged. Last month figures showed waiting lists for treatment in Wales had hit record levels for the 19th successive month. The latest waiting times statistics will be published next Thursday. Health boards are due to submit their proposals to increase planned activity to the Welsh government by the end of March. NHS Wales's chief executive, Judith Paget, said the plans would include ""specific ambitions and actions"" regarding patients who had been waiting longest. The Welsh government said: ""We are committed to increasing capacity through the recruitment of a range of professions including investing record amounts of more than Â£260m in training places to deliver an additional 12,000 clinical staff by 2024-25. ""We know how hard our health and social care staff have been working throughout the last couple of years and we want to thank them for everything they do.""

"Ruth Wainwright has been told she may have to pay up to Â£50,000 if funding is not made available People living in flats hit by the post-Grenfell fire safety crisis have said they feel ""abandoned"" by the Welsh government. At least 248 building applications have been made for the first phase of a scheme which will fund survey work. But the surveys are yet to begin and campaigners fear that repair work may not start until 2023 or 2024. The Welsh government said progress had been made and details on the repair fund would be announced in the spring. There were 248 expressions of interest in the survey up to 31 December, and the applications can cover more than one building. Leaseholders paying extra charges and living in unsellable flats after fire safety defects were identified have long felt frustrated at the pace of progress. In response to a Freedom of Information request last week, the Welsh government said Â£59m of funding received as a result of spending in England on cladding remediation and building safety work was allocated to its Covid response. Grenfell families angry at demolition talks What happened at Grenfell Tower? Ministers in Cardiff have, however, budgeted Â£375m up to 2024-25 for the ""remediation of blocks of flats"" via its Welsh Building Safety Fund. Redrow, the Celestia developer, says it has given significant financial support But campaign group Welsh Cladiators said it was ""very disappointed"" the Welsh government was yet to spend ""a single penny on remediation work for unsafe private buildings in Wales when England have had buildings receive funds and completed work"". In England, a fund opened in February 2021 and money has been available to remove cladding from buildings over 18m (59ft). Last month,Housing Secretary Michael Gove extended that fund to include those over 11m (36ft)and said he would take ""all steps necessary"" to make developers pay. The Welsh government's fund is intended to cover buildings over 11m (36ft), and cover non-cladding fire safety defects as well. Ministers have already spent more than Â£15m on repairs to social housing blocks, including the removal of the now-bannedACM claddingfrom three blocks. The removal of ACM cladding on 12 private blocks in Wales has been or is being paid for by developers and owners. Ruth Wainwright, 71, who moved into the Celestia complex in Cardiff Bay with her husband, John, in 2011, said she felt ""let down"". After John died in 2020, shortly after retiring, she now lives on her pension and savings. Her service charge to cover insurance and safety measures plus her contribution to a future repair fund totals Â£16,600 this year, and she has been told her total contribution could run as high as Â£50,000 without funding. Ruth Wainwright is living off her pension and savings since her husband John's death in 2020 She said: ""There is a sense of panic about what's going to happen, and just worrying about things, constantly thinking about it."" ""It is just constantly worrying about where it's all going to end. ""The Welsh government don't seem to be listening to us, the developers don't want to know. I feel very let down by the Welsh government, I really don't feel they've done anything."" Celestia developer Redrow said it had provided ""significant financial support"" and will also be providing funding through the Residential Property Developers Tax. One managing agent of a development in Cardiff said waiting for the Welsh government to release funding was ""awful."" Mary-Anne Bowring from Ringley, which runs 980-flat Prospect Place, said the fire service had put in place an ""enforcement notice"" calling for the work to be done by December. ""Limbo is the worst thing in any crisis,"" she said. Will flat owners be refunded for cladding costs? Dozens of blocks still have Grenfell-type cladding ""If you don't comply with an enforcement notice one of the next steps the fire service could take is to force people not to be able to enter their homes and deem them unsafe. ""It's a perfect storm, where the client is doing the right thing in the fastest available time only held up by the Welsh government, with the fire service acting completely at tangent asking things that are impossible under the current regime."" The Welsh government said: ""We strongly believe that people living in affected buildings should not be left to pay to put right safety standards or breaches of building regulations. ""We will continue to engage with developers and press them to take responsibility and action and commend developers that have already set aside funds for remediation in Wales - they have set an example for others to follow.""

"The last remaining Covid restriction in England could be gone in weeks, after the prime minister announcedthe legal requirement to isolate after a positive test may be scrapped early. The plan had been to end it on 24 March - but if the trends remained positive, Boris Johnson said, it could go a month early. The move has taken many experts by surprise, with one describing it as either brave or stupid. When will the self-isolation rules be scrapped? What Covid rules remain across the UK? As often with Covid, the evidence is unclear. Certainly questions are being asked about the politics of the move, with the prime minister under continuing pressure. But there is plenty of positive news in the latest data - as the prime minister suggested. Hospital cases are falling and, despite the large wave of Omicron infections, overall deaths have not risen above what would normally be seen in winter. With new treatments and a huge amount of immunity in the population, from both vaccination and infection, the risk from the virus is lessening all the time. Other nations are also relaxing rules around self-isolation. Denmark, for example, now requires people to stay at home only if they have symptoms. Nonetheless, there are also grounds for caution. Infection levels remain high. And the Office for National Statistics (ONS) monitoring programme suggests they may even be rising again, with about one out of every 19 people in England positive last week. Coupled with this is the rise of a sub-variant of Omicron, BA.2, thought to be even more transmissible than the version, first identified in South Africa, that caused the Christmas surge. BA.2 now accounts for an estimated one out of every six infections - a proportion that is growing every week. This is one of the reasons Prof Paul Hunter, an expert in infectious disease, at the University of East Anglia, was surprised by the announcement on self-isolation. ""At some point, it is going to be the case that all remaining restrictions are dropped, including the need to self-isolate, though I certainly didn't expect that to happen this month,"" he says. Prof Hunter would have preferred to wait a little bit longer to see what happens with infections and the sub-variant. Dr Simon Clarke, from the University of Reading, who says that the move is either ""brave or stupid"", explains that the problem is nobody knows for sure what the impact will be. Some believe people could now feel pressurised into returning to work before they are physically ready or no longer infectious. It is worth bearing in mind, though, not every infected person was isolating anyway. This winter, the testing system has been picking up only half of all infections - so at the peak, an estimated 200,000 people a day in England who should have been were not being formally asked to isolate. Furthermore, about one in five of those who test positive does not fully adhere to the isolation requirements, according to the ONS. It is easy to overestimate the impact of government rules and the significance of removing them. After all, at Christmas there were no limits on mixing in England - but contact levels were still at incredibly low rates, similar to those seen in the first lockdown. Just because the public is no longer under a legal requirement to isolate, it does not mean they will suddenly stop staying home when ill. After all, when the rules do end, there will be guidance about the importance of staying at home if you are ill. Those willing and able to follow the rules - some say there has been insufficient financial support to help people on low incomes isolate when they risk losing earnings - may largely continue with their current behaviours, University College London epidemiologist Prof Tim Colbourn says. ""Ending legal isolation requirements doesn't meant everyone will freely spread Covid everywhere,"" he says. ""People still care about family, friends and colleagues. ""Given the availability of rapid tests and current isolation law being largely unenforceable, it might not actually make much difference."" Follow Nickon Twitter,external. Read morefrom Nick.

"The UK must do more to insulate the country's draughty homes, warns Britain's climate change chief. Chris Stark, head of the UK's Climate Change Committee, told the BBC he rates government policy on insulation as ""very poor"". Insulation, together with renewable power, is the way out of the current energy crisis, he says. Two-thirds of homes, or 19 million, need better insulation, according to government data. That raises an obvious question: if it is such a good idea, why aren't we all doing it? The key issue is the cost. Britain is frequently described as having some of the oldest and least energy efficient housing in Europe. Retrofitting - adding insulation to existing homes - can be very expensive and Mr Stark says the government isn't doing enough to help fund this costly work. The government needs to provide ""a sharper incentive for most people to make these investments in improving the energy efficiency of the home that they live in,"" he told BBC News. Rob Jones' four-bed Edwardian family home in Rusholme, Manchester illustrates the challenges. When he moved, it had an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) rating of ""E"", putting it amongst the least energy efficient homes nationwide. Rob raised the energy efficiency rating of his home by paying for insulation The government estimates that 19 million of the UK's 29 million homes are on the bottom rungs of the Energy Performance rankings with a rating of ""D"" or below. How better insulation can reduce energy bills Fix insulation to tackle cost of heating, PM told Lifting Rob's home into the ""B"" category meant improving the lagging in the roof, installing more double glazing, insulating the floors as well as putting insulated cladding on some inside and outside walls. The makeover cost Â£36,000. Rob says they now use 40% less gas for heating, which is good news as energy prices soar. But, at current energy prices, it'll take at least 20 years to cover the cost. Retrofitting homes is an even greater challenge for the providers of social housing. I visited Jean Davidson in her one-bed council flat in Blackpool. The council has spent Â£2.5m making the 75 flats on her estate more energy-efficient - Â£33,000 a piece. They insulated the entire block, took out her little porch and put in triple glazed windows. Her front door was changed to block draughts and some of the exterior walls of the blocks and the entrance area were insulated. Jean's home is certainly very cosy now - ""perfect"", as she describes it. But the council estimates it would cost Â£125m to bring its 5,000 homes up to this standard. Cost is not the only factor in insulation. Actually finding an installer in an industry literally decimated by government grant cuts is difficult. Then, will you trust the installer in your home? Then there are choices - insulating the outside of your walls is dearer than insulating the inside. But insulating the inside shrinks your room size by a few inches. Then comes what for many people is the biggest issue - the hassle. In one experiment, a local council offered households a grant to insulate their homes. Many people said, ""No - too much trouble."" So the council offered to pay the whole bill. ""No - too much trouble."" Then the council offered to clear out the attic and fit insulation as a bonus. ""Yes please"", came the response. So, myriad problems - but if the government can't solve this, ministers can kiss goodbye to carbon targets. ""It's just not financially viable,"" says John Donnellon, the CEO of Blackpool Coastal Housing, which manages the town's council homes. ""There needs to be grant aid to make it happen,"" he adds. Jean's council home is now insulated, saving her money on energy bills And remember, the benefits of lower energy bills go to tenants like Jean, not their landlords. The government acknowledged the importance of improving energy performance in buildings in its delayed Heat and Buildings Strategy published in October last year. It talked about the need for a ""fabric first"" approach - improving the efficiency of walls and lofts before replacing heating systems. But the report came seven months after the government cancelled its Â£1.5bn ""green homes grant"" scheme. That scheme -described as ""botched"" by MPsand closed after just six months - offered people up to Â£10,000 towards the cost of insulation.Just 47,500 homes were improved,externalunder the scheme, far fewer than the 600,000 that was promised at launch. Chris Stark, of the Climate Change Committee, believes the government will need a new scheme because most homeowners cannot afford to insulate their homes. As things stand, just a few tens of thousands of homes will install insulation this year, he says. ""We really need to scale that up to something more like half a million a year and to do that quickly over the next four or five years."" But with just Â£3.9bn earmarked by the government to supporting low-emissions homes, that may not happen as quickly as he hopes. The total is also well below the Â£9.2bn the Conservative Party said it would spend on energy efficiency by 2030 in its 2019 election manifesto. Investing in insulation is ""critical"" if Britain is to cut energy consumption and meet its climate goals, says Jan Rosenow of the Regulatory Assistance Project, a clean energy think tank. ""About 23% of our emissions are from keeping warm heating our buildings. We need to bring those down,"" he explains. For years, low energy prices have made it more cost effective to just turn up the boiler. That's why we've been caught out in the current energy crisis. ""Our homes, which we didn't insulate because there was no need for it, are now much more expensive to run,"" explains Mr Rosenow.

"This video can not be played Covid doctors: ""This wasn't what I signed up for"" A lack of beds in Welsh hospitals meant it was ""inevitable"" Covid patients would come into contact with others, a doctor has said. ""Seeing patients in bed at the time of admission is becoming a rarity,"" Dr Nicky Leopold said. Some patients, including those with Covid, have had to spend nights on chairs in A&E due to a lack of beds. The Welsh government said it aimed to deliver 12,000 more staff by 2024-25. Dr Leopold, a consultant geriatrician, who is a member of the BMA union in Wales, said there had been recent improvements since the number of NHS staff testing positive for Covid fell, but the flow of patients through hospital was still a problem. She said: ""So many patients are stranded in hospital and that's very difficult and frustrating. There just aren't the staff in the community to support the increased level of need."" Outpatient appointments had also been affected by shortages, she added. A lot of patients were in ""dire need"" and staff were ""desperately"" trying to keep clinics running. Patient spent four nights in A&E waiting for a bed The battle to get healthy patients home NHS waiting times in Wales hit record high again Dr Steve Kelly, a respiratory consultant, described ""really difficult working conditions"" with so many beds full of patients who had tested positive for Covid. He said fewer patients needed as much respiratory support as before but staff were ""just overwhelmed with patient numbers"". ""Lots of people are effectively trapped because we can't sort out care packages or help because they remain Covid-positive, so they need to stay with us until they're Covid-free,"" he said. ""It just slows down the process and makes our beds more full and makes the admissions more difficult and means people coming in spend longer in the emergency department than we would like."" Dr Kelly says many patients are effectively trapped Meanwhile, Dr Phil Banfield, the chairman of the BMA Cymru Wales consultants committee, said: ""The impact of the pandemic on the NHS is the tip of the iceberg. ""This predicament is one that was years in the making, the pandemic has just exacerbated the existing issues in the system. ""Health services will not be able to ensure patient safety or protect the fragile recovery of elective services without a well-supported, healthy and safe workforce. ""It is imperative the Welsh government and NHS employers take urgent action to expand the workforce and retain the staff we have."" Wales' health minister, Eluned Morgan, said a plan to tackle waiting lists would be published in April. A similar plan for England was published by the UK government this week. Ms Morgan told the Welsh government's health committee the plan could not be announced sooner as uncertainty remained about omicron's impact and how infection controls would continue to affect hospitals. Wales' health minister, Eluned Morgan, said a plan to tackle waiting lists would be published in April She said: ""Covid is still having an impact on staffing levels in the NHS... which has an impact on our capacity to increase surgical activity."" It's estimated about 1,000 patients in hospital beds are fit to go home but waiting for care to be arranged. Last month figures showed waiting lists for treatment in Wales had hit record levels for the 19th successive month. The latest waiting times statistics will be published next Thursday. Health boards are due to submit their proposals to increase planned activity to the Welsh government by the end of March. NHS Wales's chief executive, Judith Paget, said the plans would include ""specific ambitions and actions"" regarding patients who had been waiting longest. The Welsh government said: ""We are committed to increasing capacity through the recruitment of a range of professions including investing record amounts of more than Â£260m in training places to deliver an additional 12,000 clinical staff by 2024-25. ""We know how hard our health and social care staff have been working throughout the last couple of years and we want to thank them for everything they do.""

"There is concern that President Putin is trying hard to shift the balance of power in Europe They say there's safety in numbers. Europe, Nato and the US find themselves looking nervously over both shoulders these days. A) At China: the ever-present shadow over Shoulder Number One, with its economic might and expanding global influence. And increasingly: B) At Moscow, looming over Shoulder Number Two. Not ""only"" the threat to Ukraine's national sovereignty, but also concern about President Vladimir Putin trying hard to shift the balance of power in Europe. Geopolitics is very much on the mind of Western leaders. They fear the Kremlin is using tensions over Ukraine to divide and rule. It's a mark of just how seriously they view the situation, that oft-bickering allies are suddenly, and very publicly, in a determined ""we're all in this together, singing-from-the-same-hymn-sheet"" mode. The fortunes of prominent EU leaders are also being affected, in the frenzied shuttle diplomacy we're witnessing across Europe, to Moscow and Washington, as Western powers try to calm the situation and avoid a military invasion into Ukraine. I'll get to that in a moment. Firstly, there are plenty of well-known divisions between Western allies for President Putin to try to exploit, should he so wish. President Macron infamously dismissed Nato as ""brain dead"" not that long ago. He's been the loudest EU advocate of what he calls Europe's ""strategic autonomy"". Since President Donald Trump, EU-US relations have been tense over Nato defence funding and more. EU-UK relations have been strained since Brexit. And EU member states regularly quarrel amongst themselves over all sorts of things. Very much including foreign policy. But in recent off-the-record briefings I've had with high level EU diplomats - usually good for gleaning the real low-down - I've noticed a conscious change in tone. Co-operation with the US is ""better than it has been in decades"", I'm told. EU countries are working ""extremely well with the UK within Nato"" on how to deal with Moscow, and everyone is ""100% on board"" with a plan for tough economic sanctions on Moscow and Putin allies, should Russia take military action in Ukraine. There are plans for tough economic sanctions on Moscow should Russia take military action in Ukraine In fact, the European Commission is engaged in sustained internal diplomacy - as it was during the Brexit negotiations at the time - in an attempt to keep the 27 member states united over sanctions. It's whispered in EU corridors, that one of the reasons a precise, written ""menu"" of Russia sanctions for differing potential scenarios does not exist, is that Brussels hopes less detail means less fodder for member states to haggle over and complain about. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson commented in a UK newspaper article on Tuesday that, while the West was united in threatening sanctions, there were still ""shades of opinion"" between allies over what those penalties should be. ""We want our friends to have sanctions ready to go,"" writes the prime minister. ""We will continue to press for this."" The European Commission too has insisted that sanctions will only work if allies take a common position. Yet on Monday, that seemed a struggle for the German chancellor and US president at their joint press conference in Washington. Yes, there was lots of talk of unity. Both men publicly supported the idea of tough sanctions against Moscow if needed. But Olaf Scholz conspicuously declined to confirm a pledge heard from Joe Biden, that Germany's direct gas pipeline from Moscow would not go ahead should Russia invade Ukraine. EU countries are often divided over Russia. Poland and other former communist countries in Eastern and Central Europe tend to want to be tough on Moscow, which they constantly view as a potential security threat. They see the UK as being of the same mind, and openly still mourn the UK's departure from the EU because of this. Italy, France and Germany have often been accused by fellow EU members as being too ""soft"" in their dealings with Moscow; too keen on schmoozing President Putin, hungry for Russian business and - especially in the case of Germany, which has all but phased out nuclear power - Russian gas. Right now, the Kremlin insists it has no plans to invade Ukraine. But the build-up of its and Russian-allied troops on the Ukrainian border, is viewed as the biggest military build-up in Europe since World War Two. Germany raised irritated eyebrows in and outside the EU recently for refusing to send weapons to Ukraine. It was mocked by many for promising Kyiv helmets, a field hospital and 350 soldiers to be sent to Lithuania. And it's hardly helped Germany's reputation that former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, just became nominated as a board member of Gazprom, a majority Russian state-owned energy giant. But this week, even amongst the EU's biggest Russia-critics, I was hearing that while it would be ""helpful"" for Germany to have a stronger, clearer line on Russia, Berlin was ""doing its best"" . A publicly united front to present to President Putin is clearly uppermost in EU minds. We've only just started the week, and already we've seen a whirlwind of high-level bilaterals, planned trilaterals and quadrilaterals to discuss rising tensions with Moscow. On Monday alone, the French president was with Vladimir Putin in Moscow, the German chancellor met Joe Biden in Washington and the foreign ministers of Slovakia, Austria, Germany and the Czech Republic headed together to Kyiv. On Tuesday evening the so-called Weimar Triangle meets in Berlin. It's a loose grouping of France, Germany and Poland, designed to boost co-operation between the three countries in crisis zones. It was originally set up in 1991 to support Poland's emergence from communist rule. The three leaders meeting - Polish President Duda, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz - are clear examples of how international crises - in this case, Russia-Ukraine concerns - can affect the reputation of countries and prominent politicians. EU diplomats have been approving of Macron's attempts to try to de-escalate the crisis Emmanuel Macron is known (and disliked at times by some EU leaders) for seeming ever-keen to boost France's standing on the international diplomatic stage - even while he speaks of the importance of strengthening the EU's global presence. But, before heading to Moscow on Monday, Mr Macron made sure to speak to London, Washington and Brussels. EU diplomats I chatted to were approving of his attempts to try to de-escalate the situation. France currently holds the rotating presidency of the European Union and President Macron will have been well-aware that a ""successful"" trip to Moscow would hardly harm his bid for re-election as France's president in April. Although he has yet to officially announce his candidacy. After their meeting, President Putin said the talks had been useful and substantive and that some of Mr Macron's ideas were ""realistic"" and could form the basis of further joint steps. Germany's Olaf Scholz is faring rather less well in the court of (inter)national opinion. German media headlines scream that the honeymoon period of this still relatively new chancellor is now over, because of the way he's handled the Ukraine crisis so far. Mr Scholz faces a domestic conundrum: German business and energy links with Russia are huge, and his Social Democrat Party is famously split over relations with Moscow. Mr Scholz is also in a weak position in the German parliament. He only just squeezed into the Chancellery by the slimmest of margins. And while he and his closest adviser are known to be passionate Europhiles and transatlanticists, the German chancellor clearly felt he needed to tread carefully. While his predecessor Angela Merkel was respected on the world stage in crisis situations, Olaf Scholz has made, at best, a hesitant impression. At worst, Germany has been depicted by some, as an unreliable ally during the crisis over Ukraine. The EU's richest and most powerful nation now defensively boasts that it is the largest single donor to help stabilise Ukraine, to the tune of approximately $2bn, since the Crimea crisis in 2014. But, in the current standoff with Russia, Chancellor Scholz heads to Moscow and Kyiv in person only next week. And what about President Duda? Poland currently holds the rotating chair of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the OSCE. Back in December, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, a keen Nato member and transatlanticist, told me his country could guide and advise the West over Russia and its geopolitical intentions, as it was a country Warsaw knew very well indeed. Andrzej Duda has been president of Poland since 2015 Poland borders Russia's exclave of Kaliningrad to the northeast, Germany to the west and fellow EU countries Slovakia and the Czech Republic to the south. It sees itself as straddling and understanding two very different worlds: east and west. The role Poland is seen to play in the Russia-Ukraine crisis probably comes as a relief to Warsaw. It had been garnering a reputation, in quarters in and outside the EU, as a backsliding democracy, with allegations of press manipulation, not respecting the rights of minorities, or of women or guaranteeing an independent judiciary. Poland denies the accusations. For a long time now, it's been locked in a bitter battle with Brussels over what the EU calls ""the Rule of Law"" it demands all EU member states respect. That is an intra-EU tussle that will almost certainly continue, whatever transpires with Russia-Ukraine. EU-US tensions too will still simmer away over Big Tech and Nato funding, and the EU and post-Brexit UK remain pretty far from solving their differences over Northern Ireland. Despite shared concerns about the Kremlin, the longevity of the current show of unity between Western allies isn't guaranteed. Ukraine conflict: Where are Russia's troops?

"Unilever, the firm behind brands such as Marmite and Dove Soap, has said it will put up its prices again this year as its overheads continue to rise. The consumer goods giant, which already raised prices in 2021, said the cost of some its goods would climb but it would vary from country to country. Many firms are struggling with rising raw material, wage and energy costs. Unilever said: ""We don't want to put prices up but we're seeing the highest inflation we've seen in a decade. ""There will be price increases on some products and in some markets but it will not be uniform across the world."" Unilever, which also makes Ben & Jerry's ice cream and Hellmann's mayonnaise, said it was facing â¬3.5bn (Â£2.95bn) of extra costs in 2022 alone. It said it expected strong growth in sales this year as it raises prices, but also forecast a sharp decline in its profit margins. Other big firms have already revealed price rises to offset increased costs, including High Street giant Next, which said its prices would jump by up to 6% this year. Greggs, Britain's biggest bakery chain, said it had boosted prices between 5p and 10p on items across its range of sausage rolls and cakes, while Pret a Manger is upping the price of its coffee subscription service to Â£25 a month from Â£20. Next and Greggs raise prices as costs spiral Shoppers hit with sharpest price rises in a decade Don't ask for a big pay rise, warns Bank boss Food prices are also set to rise further, with the boss of Tesco warning supermarket prices could increase by as much as 5% by the spring. It comes as pay rises are failing to keep up with the rise in the cost of living, recent official figures show, putting the biggest squeeze on household finances in decades. However, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) also warned of a ""cost-of-doing-business crisis"" and called on the chancellor to help companies. Hannah Essex, the co-executive director of the BCC, told the BBC's Today programme: ""These price pressures have been building over the course of the last year, and it has now reached the point where businesses are passing that cost onto other businesses and to consumers."" It was partly due to global issues, she said, but added that there are ""levers that the government can pull to make things better"". Ms Essex called for an energy cap for smaller businesses and for the National Insurance increase set for April to be postponed for at least a year, adding that businesses could no longer absorb costs. ""It has reached the point where [firms] simply don't have a choice [but to put up prices],"" she said. She gave examples of a laundrette in Kent that has had a 250% increase in energy costs and companies seeing a 70% increase in the cost of raw materials. According to a BCC survey of 1,000 of its members, three in four businesses are putting up their prices to cover higher costs. The most commonly reported cost pressure was wages: 63% of firms overall - and 70% of manufacturers - reported rising wage demands causing pressure. This was closely followed by energy costs. The survey found 62% of companies said soaring energy bills were creating pressure, while 90% of manufacturing firms said higher raw material costs were an issue. In response to these pressures, 73% of firms said they were raising prices, while one in 20 respondents to the poll said they were considering ceasing trade completely. Consumer price inflation is on course to rise above 7% this year, a threat that recently prompted the boss of the Bank of England to urge workers to not ask forbig pay rises, to try to stop prices rising out of control. However, a new report by recruiters said starting salaries for permanent and temporary staff were being driven up due to a scarcity of candidates. ""With competition for staff still hot, companies are having to raise pay rates for new starters to attract the best people, and the cost of living crisis means there is also more pressure from jobseekers who want a pay rise,"" said Neil Carberry, chief executive of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC), which worked on the report with KPMG. The Treasury said it was aware of the strains caused by higher energy bills and was in ""regular contact"" with business groups and energy suppliers to ""see how they can best be supported"". A spokesman said the government had backed businesses through the pandemic with ""unprecedented"" support and would ""continue to stand firmly behind them"".

"This video can not be played Covid doctors: ""This wasn't what I signed up for"" A lack of beds in Welsh hospitals meant it was ""inevitable"" Covid patients would come into contact with others, a doctor has said. ""Seeing patients in bed at the time of admission is becoming a rarity,"" Dr Nicky Leopold said. Some patients, including those with Covid, have had to spend nights on chairs in A&E due to a lack of beds. The Welsh government said it aimed to deliver 12,000 more staff by 2024-25. Dr Leopold, a consultant geriatrician, who is a member of the BMA union in Wales, said there had been recent improvements since the number of NHS staff testing positive for Covid fell, but the flow of patients through hospital was still a problem. She said: ""So many patients are stranded in hospital and that's very difficult and frustrating. There just aren't the staff in the community to support the increased level of need."" Outpatient appointments had also been affected by shortages, she added. A lot of patients were in ""dire need"" and staff were ""desperately"" trying to keep clinics running. Patient spent four nights in A&E waiting for a bed The battle to get healthy patients home NHS waiting times in Wales hit record high again Dr Steve Kelly, a respiratory consultant, described ""really difficult working conditions"" with so many beds full of patients who had tested positive for Covid. He said fewer patients needed as much respiratory support as before but staff were ""just overwhelmed with patient numbers"". ""Lots of people are effectively trapped because we can't sort out care packages or help because they remain Covid-positive, so they need to stay with us until they're Covid-free,"" he said. ""It just slows down the process and makes our beds more full and makes the admissions more difficult and means people coming in spend longer in the emergency department than we would like."" Dr Kelly says many patients are effectively trapped Meanwhile, Dr Phil Banfield, the chairman of the BMA Cymru Wales consultants committee, said: ""The impact of the pandemic on the NHS is the tip of the iceberg. ""This predicament is one that was years in the making, the pandemic has just exacerbated the existing issues in the system. ""Health services will not be able to ensure patient safety or protect the fragile recovery of elective services without a well-supported, healthy and safe workforce. ""It is imperative the Welsh government and NHS employers take urgent action to expand the workforce and retain the staff we have."" Wales' health minister, Eluned Morgan, said a plan to tackle waiting lists would be published in April. A similar plan for England was published by the UK government this week. Ms Morgan told the Welsh government's health committee the plan could not be announced sooner as uncertainty remained about omicron's impact and how infection controls would continue to affect hospitals. Wales' health minister, Eluned Morgan, said a plan to tackle waiting lists would be published in April She said: ""Covid is still having an impact on staffing levels in the NHS... which has an impact on our capacity to increase surgical activity."" It's estimated about 1,000 patients in hospital beds are fit to go home but waiting for care to be arranged. Last month figures showed waiting lists for treatment in Wales had hit record levels for the 19th successive month. The latest waiting times statistics will be published next Thursday. Health boards are due to submit their proposals to increase planned activity to the Welsh government by the end of March. NHS Wales's chief executive, Judith Paget, said the plans would include ""specific ambitions and actions"" regarding patients who had been waiting longest. The Welsh government said: ""We are committed to increasing capacity through the recruitment of a range of professions including investing record amounts of more than Â£260m in training places to deliver an additional 12,000 clinical staff by 2024-25. ""We know how hard our health and social care staff have been working throughout the last couple of years and we want to thank them for everything they do.""

"The last remaining Covid restriction in England could be gone in weeks, after the prime minister announcedthe legal requirement to isolate after a positive test may be scrapped early. The plan had been to end it on 24 March - but if the trends remained positive, Boris Johnson said, it could go a month early. The move has taken many experts by surprise, with one describing it as either brave or stupid. When will the self-isolation rules be scrapped? What Covid rules remain across the UK? As often with Covid, the evidence is unclear. Certainly questions are being asked about the politics of the move, with the prime minister under continuing pressure. But there is plenty of positive news in the latest data - as the prime minister suggested. Hospital cases are falling and, despite the large wave of Omicron infections, overall deaths have not risen above what would normally be seen in winter. With new treatments and a huge amount of immunity in the population, from both vaccination and infection, the risk from the virus is lessening all the time. Other nations are also relaxing rules around self-isolation. Denmark, for example, now requires people to stay at home only if they have symptoms. Nonetheless, there are also grounds for caution. Infection levels remain high. And the Office for National Statistics (ONS) monitoring programme suggests they may even be rising again, with about one out of every 19 people in England positive last week. Coupled with this is the rise of a sub-variant of Omicron, BA.2, thought to be even more transmissible than the version, first identified in South Africa, that caused the Christmas surge. BA.2 now accounts for an estimated one out of every six infections - a proportion that is growing every week. This is one of the reasons Prof Paul Hunter, an expert in infectious disease, at the University of East Anglia, was surprised by the announcement on self-isolation. ""At some point, it is going to be the case that all remaining restrictions are dropped, including the need to self-isolate, though I certainly didn't expect that to happen this month,"" he says. Prof Hunter would have preferred to wait a little bit longer to see what happens with infections and the sub-variant. Dr Simon Clarke, from the University of Reading, who says that the move is either ""brave or stupid"", explains that the problem is nobody knows for sure what the impact will be. Some believe people could now feel pressurised into returning to work before they are physically ready or no longer infectious. It is worth bearing in mind, though, not every infected person was isolating anyway. This winter, the testing system has been picking up only half of all infections - so at the peak, an estimated 200,000 people a day in England who should have been were not being formally asked to isolate. Furthermore, about one in five of those who test positive does not fully adhere to the isolation requirements, according to the ONS. It is easy to overestimate the impact of government rules and the significance of removing them. After all, at Christmas there were no limits on mixing in England - but contact levels were still at incredibly low rates, similar to those seen in the first lockdown. Just because the public is no longer under a legal requirement to isolate, it does not mean they will suddenly stop staying home when ill. After all, when the rules do end, there will be guidance about the importance of staying at home if you are ill. Those willing and able to follow the rules - some say there has been insufficient financial support to help people on low incomes isolate when they risk losing earnings - may largely continue with their current behaviours, University College London epidemiologist Prof Tim Colbourn says. ""Ending legal isolation requirements doesn't meant everyone will freely spread Covid everywhere,"" he says. ""People still care about family, friends and colleagues. ""Given the availability of rapid tests and current isolation law being largely unenforceable, it might not actually make much difference."" Follow Nickon Twitter,external. Read morefrom Nick.
