"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""In order to have a irreversible road map you got to be cautious"" Boris Johnson has said the government must ""be cautious"" as it decides whether to end all Covid restrictions in England on 21 June. Cases are rising as the Delta variant spreads, with details of the next step on the ""roadmap"" due on Monday. The prime minister told the BBC it was important any easing of restrictions was ""irreversible"" and warned that hospital admissions were increasing. The BBC has been told adelay of up to four weeksis being considered. Senior medical advisers have urged a brake to the final easing of lockdown restrictions, which, if it went ahead in full, would mean removing limits on social contact and the number of people allowed into homes. Pubs, clubs, theatres and cinemas would also be allowed to operate without capacity limits, with sports events taking place in full stadiums, nightclubs reopening and limits of the number of wedding guests going. Lockdown lifting - the four key numbers Unvaccinated most at risk from Delta variant What do under 30s need to know about the vaccine? Vaccine passports considered for use at big events Asked by BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg whether all restrictions would now be lifted, Mr Johnson said people would have to wait until Monday to find out. ""What I can certainly say is we are looking at the data, continuing to do that, but what you can certainly take isâ¦ the roadmap was always cautious but irreversible, and in order to have an irreversible roadmap, we've got to be cautious."" A further 7,738 lab-confirmed cases of the virus were reported in the UK on Saturday, and a further 12 people recorded to have died within 28 days of a positive test. Infections continue to rise, with 50% more cases reported in the past seven days than the previous seven. For weeks we've practised modern day kremlinogy - getting our hopes up for an end of restrictions in England at the summer solstice whenever the PM sounds upbeat, then feeling more downhearted when government minister after minister uses the C word: caution. We will get a decision on Monday but it seems clear from Boris Johnson's use of the words ""caution"" and ""irreversible"" in his BBC interview that a delay is inevitable. In order to make his roadmap irreversible, the PM is likely to heed scientific advisers' advice to give himself some more breathing space while the vaccination programme rolls out further. Mr Johnson's mantra has been ""data not dates"" but in truth there may just not be enough data on the extent to which vaccinations are breaking the link between infection and hospitalisation for him to sweep away all remaining restrictions. But sources say the government is looking at a range of options for 21 June. So it's possible that - for example - a four week delay is reviewed after a fortnight when more data is available. Or that some restrictions are eased while most social distancing measures stay in place. The anxious wait for a decision is almost over but it could be that what some describe as 'Freedom Day' - like the horizon - moves further away the closer we appear to get. Answering questions at the G7 summit in Cornwall earlier, chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance would not be drawn on the decision about 21 June, but said the ""Delta variant [is] increasing in the UK"". He said there were lessons from the pandemic that could continue to apply in everyday life - such as self-isolating after symptoms of any infectious disease, the importance of ventilation, and hand hygiene. The Delta variant, first identified in India, now accounts for nine in 10 UK coronavirus cases. It is roughly 60% more transmissible than the Alpha - or Kent - variant, Public Health England data suggests. The government put India on the ""red list"" of places to which travel is banned on 23 April, two weeks later than Pakistan and Bangladesh, which had fewer cases per million at the time. Why was India not on the red list sooner? The prime minister defending the timing of the decision, saying: ""Pakistan had about 13 times as many variants of concern or variants of interest as as India at that stage."" ""Yet we put India on the red list on 23 April, which was days before it was even identified as a variant under investigation."" Mr Johnson, who is currently hosting the G7 summit in Carbis Bay, Cornwall, said the government had made ""a massive progress with the vaccination programme"". ""It's done a huge amount of good - but you have got to be cautious to be irreversible,"" he added. ""Again you have hospitalisations up, you've got cases up. There are grounds for caution."" On Friday, the British Medical Associationjoined public health officialsin calling for a delay to ending restrictions. The government said in February that England's restrictions would only be lifted if: the vaccine rollout continues successfully evidence shows vaccines effectively reduce hospitalisations and deaths in those vaccinated infection rates do not risk a surge in hospitalisations which would put unsustainable pressure on the NHS its assessment of the risks is not fundamentally changed by new variants of concern More than 29 million people in the UK have had both doses of a vaccine - 55.9% of the adult population. The R number in England is estimated to have risen to between 1.2 and 1.4, meaning that, on average, every 10 people with Covid will infect between 12 and 14 others. The easing of restrictions is happening at different speeds across the other nations of the UK with 21 June being given asan ""indicative date"" for a number of changes,externalin Northern Ireland, including 10 people from two households being allowed to meet in private homes, up to 15 people being able to meet outdoors in a garden and theatres and concerts able to restart. Lockdown measures in Wales,externalwill be reviewed on 21 June, while the whole of Scotland is due tomove to level zeroon 28 June - but the prevalence of the Delta variant may delay that.

"This video can not be played ""Prime duty of the government to uphold the territorial integrity of the UK"" - Johnson on NI Protocol Boris Johnson says he will do ""whatever it takes"" to protect the territorial integrity of the UK, after talks with EU leaders over Northern Ireland. The prime minister said there had been ""misunderstanding"" on the EU side but said he thought ""pragmatic solutions"" would be found to border issues. Meetings between the two sides took place at the G7 summit in Cornwall. French President Emmanuel Macron said he was willing to ""reset"" UK relations if it honoured the Brexit deal. The disagreement between the UK and the EU is over the implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol, a measure in the Brexit deal which prevents checks on trade across the Irish border. Some checks are taking place on British goods entering Northern Ireland, causing disruption to food supplies. Mr Johnson has held meetings with European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, European Council head Charles Michel, Mr Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel in the margins of the gathering at the Cornish resort Carbis Bay. Gulf remains between UK and EU over Brexit protocol Ahead of the G7, the EU had saidits patience with the UK was ""wearing thin"", after the UK said it was prepared to ignore rules to prevent disruption to trade in Northern Ireland following Brexit. Mr Johnson told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg: ""I think that to be fair there is quite a lot of misunderstanding around the EU about the situation in Northern Ireland, the balance of the Good Friday Agreement, the peace process. ""I was just in a gentle way getting across what that means and I think that we will have some pragmatic solutions.""He added he thought the EU leaders understood ""that it is the prime duty of the UK government to uphold the territorial integrity of the United Kingdom"" and said the government would do ""whatever it takes to ensure that"". In a word: sausages. EU food safety rules don't allow chilled meat products to enter its market from non-members, such as the UK. This has led to the prospect of British sausages - and other meat products - being banned from Northern Ireland. A six-month grace period has been in place since January where the rules don't apply - but that runs out at the end of the month. Talks on what happens next were held between the UK and EU earlier this week, but they broke up without agreement. Find out more about the Northern Ireland Protocol In an interview with Sky News, Mr Johnson said that unless there was a solution he would invoke Article 16 - a measure in the Northern Ireland Protocol which allows either side to take unilateral action. He said: ""I think if the protocol continues to be applied in this way, then we will obviously not hesitate to invoke Article 16, as I have said before."" Downing Street said it was Mr Johnson's desire was to ""work within the existing protocol to find radical and pragmatic solutions"" to Northern Ireland's border issues. By Vicki Young, BBC deputy political editor This deadlock won't get solved during the G7 summit, but it has dominated meetings between the UK and EU in Cornwall. The UK's decision to unilaterally extend the grace period where checks would be waived has already inflamed tensions - with the EU launching legal action against the UK earlier this year. Under the current agreement, Northern Ireland is still bound by a lot of EU rules: so the question is, what will the PM do next? Is he now suggesting that the UK would be willing to suspend the whole thing - and not go along with what was signed before? President Macron has talked about resetting the relationship between the French and the UK - but has stressed it depends on the UK keeping its word over Brexit. So how do leaders find a way through this? Both parties talk about pragmatic solutions to all of this - the trouble is, they don't agree on what they are. Following a trilateral meeting between Mr Johnson, Mrs von der Leyen and Mr Michel in Cornwall, an EU official said that the presidents had said that the rhetoric needed to be toned down and called on the joint committee - made up of negotiators from both sides - to actively look for solutions which are in the protocol. During meetings with the EU leaders, which Brexit minister Lord Frost also attended, the prime minister had ""made clear his desire for pragmatism and compromise on all sides"" but had also underlined that protecting the Good Friday Agreement was paramount, Downing Street said. The spokesman added the protocol as it was currently being implemented was ""having a damaging impact on the people of Northern Ireland"" and said the UK government would ""keep all options on the table"". Previously Downing Street had indicated the UK would be prepared to unilaterally delay the full implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol to prevent a ban on chilled meats crossing the Irish Sea from Great Britain - with restrictions due to come into force at the end of the month. Boris Johnson will also meet European Council head Charles Michel and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen Delaying the checks without agreement from Brussels would risk triggering a trade dispute with the EU. The UK prime minister has previously suggested the EU is taking an ""excessively burdensome"" approach to post-Brexit trading arrangements. Ahead of the G7 summit, Mrs von der Leyen insisted the protocol is the ""only solution"" to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic and must be implemented in full. French President Emmanuel Macron will have talks with UK PM Boris Johnson on Saturday but has said ""nothing is renegotiable"" At a press conference Mr Macron said ""nothing is renegotiable"" and said it was not ""serious to want to review in July what we finalised after years of debate and work in December"". Before US President Joe Biden travelled to Cornwall for the summit his national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the president had ""deep"" concerns that the trade rowcould endanger peace in Northern Ireland. Unionists are strongly opposed to checks in the Irish Sea because they do not want Northern Ireland to be treated differently to the rest of the UK. Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP, and Alliance have said there are problems with the protocol but have argued that the UK and EU must ensure its ""rigorous implementation"". The main agenda of the G7 summit, held in Cornwall, will see leaders of the UK, US, Canada, Japan, France, Germany and Italycommit to a plan to prevent a repeat of the coronavirus pandemic.

"The core stage and twin booster rockets stand taller than the Statue of Liberty (minus its pedestal) Nasa has assembled the first of its powerful Space Launch System (SLS) rockets, which will carry humans to the Moon this decade. On Friday, engineers at Florida's Kennedy Space Center finished lowering the 65m (212ft) -tall core stage in-between two smaller booster rockets. It's the first time all three key elements of the rocket have been together in their launch configuration. Nasa plans to launch the SLS on its maiden flight later this year. During this mission, known as Artemis-1, the SLS will carry Orion - America's next-generation crew vehicle - towards the Moon. However, no astronauts will be aboard; engineers want to put both the rocket and the spaceship through their paces before humans are allowed on in 2023. Test success for world's most powerful rocket Nasa's giant SLS rocket: a guide Artemis: To the Moon and Beyond Nasa chooses SpaceX to build Moon lander Core stage being lifted up from its position in the transfer aisle at the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) The SLS consists of the giant core stage, which houses propellant tanks and four powerful engines, flanked by two 54m (177ft) -long solid rocket boosters (SRBs). They provide most of the thrust-force that propels the SLS off the ground in the first two minutes of flight. Both the core stage and the SRBs are taller than the Statue of Liberty, minus its pedestal. Over Friday and Saturday, teams at Kennedy Space Center used a heavy-lift crane to first hoist the core stage, transfer it from a horizontal to a vertical position, and then lower it into place between the SRBs on a structure called the mobile launcher. This structure currently resides inside the huge, cuboid Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB). After being lifted, the core stage was rotated into the vertical position The mobile launcher allows access to the SLS for testing, checkout and servicing. It will also transfer the giant rocket to the launch pad. Engineers began stacking the SRBs on the mobile launcher in November last year. While this was going on, the core stage was attached to a test stand in Mississippi, undergoing a comprehensive programme of evaluation known as the Green Run. Artwork: Nasa wants to return to the Moon, but this time it wants to stay In March, thecore stage engines were fired successfully for around eight minutes- the time taken for the SLS to get from the ground to space - in the Green Run's final and most important test. After refurbishment, the core was taken by barge to Kennedy Space Center. Artemis-3, which will be the first mission to land humans on the Moon since Apollo 17 in 1972, should launch in the next few years. Nasa recently awarded the contract tobuild the next-generation Moon landerto SpaceX, which is adapting its Starship design for the purpose.

"This video can not be played Crannog roundhouse blaze: 'It was gone in six minutes' A recreated Iron Age house on the shores of Loch Tay has been gutted by fire. The Scottish Crannog Centre, which is also a museum of life in ancient Scotland, was hit by a devastating blaze on Friday evening. The Iron Age roundhouse stood on stilts on the loch shore at Kenmore in Perthshire. Video and pictures posted online by people nearby showed the Iron Age house engulfed in flames. Mike Benson, the director of the Crannog Centre, said CCTV footage showed the fire took hold and destroyed the house in minutes. He told BBC Scotland: ""It's just a devastating blow. ""It's such a much loved icon, you can't think of Loch Tay without thinking of the Crannog Centre. It's been here for 25 years and has been so incredibly loved. ""The main thing is nobody has been hurt, the crannog has gone but it is not the end of the story."" Mr  Benson said he had been ""inundated with support"" since the incident and said he was grateful the museum collection is intact. The reconstructed 2,500-year-old crannog sat on Loch Tay near Kenmore Phone footage shows how the house has been completely destroyed by the fire John Ward, who witnessed the blaze, told the PA news agency it was ""devastating to watch it burn"". He said: ""I saw it from the road end and my boat is at the marina. So lucky the wind was a westerly or it would have done a lot more damage."" A spokesman for the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said it was called to the scene at 23:12 where there was a ""well developed"" fire. The fire was extinguished less than an hour later and there were no reports of any casualties. A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: ""Enquiries will be carried out to establish the full circumstances, though there is nothing at present to suggest the fire is suspicious."" Pete Wishart, MP for Perth and North Perthshire, tweeted: ""Simply awful. The internationally renowned Crannog Centre is a huge part of the whole community of Kenmore/Loch Tay. ""So sorry for all involved with the centre who will be really upset this morning. We must rebuild it.""

"Sheffield's NHS Clinical Commissioning Group said the response had been ""amazing"", adding the clinic was now operating at capacity A pop-up Covid vaccine clinic in Sheffield reached capacity shortly after opening - prompting officials to ask people not to attend. Over-18s were invited to attend no-appointment drop-in sessions at the Crucible Theatre on Saturday. An online post advertising the clinic, open between 09:00 and 14:00 BST, was shared thousands of times. The clinic initially had 500 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine available, and managed to secure a further 200. But all were allocated shortly after the venue opened its doors, with late joiners being offered alternative venues, officials said. Dr Tom O'Brien said the response showed how keen people were to get a jab Dr Tom O'Brien, who was involved in the initiative, said he was delighted with the response, but was a little bit surprised by how many people turned up. It showed ""how keen"" people were to get a jab, he added. Max Wedekind and Charlie Hancock said they turned up early to ensure they had a place in the queue Some, including Charlie Hancock and Max Wedekind, both aged 20, turned up early to try and secure a place. Mr Hancock said they were there at 04:30, and initially thought they had got the wrong place. But after returning from getting breakfast, Mr Hancock said the queue was already getting quite long. He said he wanted to get the jab after waiting ""so long"" and was ""buzzing with excitement"". ""It's an honour how far we have come with the vaccines,"" he added. Some queued for several hours to get the jab Another person in the queue said he wanted the jab in order to protect his family. Others said it would make them feel safer going out. Health chiefs said more pop-up clinics were planned over the next few weeks, with churches providing space for sessions and trained volunteers administering the jabs. A new walk-in vaccination service will also be available from Monday at the Octagon building near Weston Park, officials said. The venue - which recently hosted the World Snooker Championship as part of a government pilot event - opened up as a pop-up clinic on Saturday to encourage over-18s to get jabbed Mass vaccination centre Sheffield Arena and GP surgeries are still taking vaccine appointments for people in the 25-29 cohortafter they were invited by the government this week. Dr Terry Hudson, from Sheffield's NHS Clinical Commissioning Group, said: ""There will be plenty of opportunity. Don't hesitate, get that jab in your arm."" Allow Twitter content?

"G7 leaders seeking to rival China have adopted a plan to support lower- and middle-income countries in building better infrastructure. President Joe Biden said he wanted the US-backed Build Back Better World (B3W) plan to be a higher-quality alternative to a similar Chinese programme. China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has helped finance trains, roads, and ports in many countries. But it has been criticised for saddling some with debt. In a statement at their summit in the English county of Cornwall, the G7 leaders said they would offer a ""values-driven, high-standard and transparent"" partnership. However, details of how the G7 plan will be financed remain unclear. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the group was not yet at a stage to release financing for its initiative. The US has been particularly critical of China's so-called ""debt diplomacy"". The G7, the world's seven wealthiest democracies, have alsocommitted to a new plan to stop future pandemics. The measures include cutting the time needed to develop and license vaccines and treatments for Covid-19 to under 100 days. The plan will be officially unveiled on Sunday, alongside the final summit communique. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is hosting the three-day gathering at the seaside resort of Carbis Bay. How many vaccines are rich countries sharing? In Pictures: G7 leaders meet at the seaside Firepits, scallops and spouses: Carrie Johnson's G7 party The Americans see Saturday's session at the G7 as being about challenging the rise of Chinese influence around the world. Beijing's Belt-and-Road initiative, which has seen billions of dollars poured into developing countries, must be countered by the Western democracies. Senior administration officials want to prove that Western values can prevail. They argue that Chinese investment has come with too high a price tag; that the forced labour of the Uyghur minority in Xinjiang is morally egregious, and economically unacceptable as it prevents fair competition. Global supply chains, Joe Biden will insist, must be free of this kind of labour. US officials say this is not just about confronting China, but about presenting a positive alternative for the world. But the Biden administration has been vague about how much the West would contribute to this global infrastructure plan and over what timescale. What is clear is a renewed determination among Western powers that they need to act now to counter a resurgent and increasingly powerful China. This video can not be played What China's One Belt, One Road really means Earlier this year, the US, the European Union, the UK and Canada introducedco-ordinated sanctions on China. The sanctions, including travel bans and asset freezes, targeted senior officials in Xinjiang who have been accused of serious human rights violations against  Uyghur Muslims. More than a million Uyghurs and other minorities are estimated to have been detained in camps in the north-western province. The Chinese government has been accused of carrying out forced sterilisations on  Uyghur women and separating children from their families. China has created a sprawling network of detention camps for minorities in the Xinjiang region A BBC investigation published in February containedfirst-hand testimony of systematic rape, sexual abuse and torture of detainees. China responded with its own sanctions on European officials. The leaders will issue the Carbis Bay Declaration on Saturday. Its aim is to prevent any repeat of the human and economic devastation wreaked by Covid-19. Globally, more than 175 million people have had the infection since the outbreak began, with over 3.7 million Covid-related deaths, according to America's Johns Hopkins university. The G7 declaration will spell out a series of steps, including: Slashing the time taken to develop and licence vaccines, treatments and diagnostics for any future disease to under 100 days Reinforcing global surveillance networks and genomic sequencing capacity Support for reforming and strengthening the World Health Organization (WHO) The declaration is expected to incorporate recommendations from a report by a group of international experts drawn from across industry, government and scientific institutions. UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres and WHO director Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus will also take part in Saturday's session. Dr Tedros stressed that ""the world needs a stronger global surveillance system to detect new epidemic and pandemic risks"".

"Five people who work for or with the Welsh NHS have told the BBC of a ""culture"" of bullying There is a ""culture"" of bullying in the Welsh NHS which leaves people scared to raise issues, several staff have said. NHS workers said they had witnessed or experienced institutionalised racism and sexism and also faced obstacles when reporting incidences of bullying. It is claimed that raising concerns has led to bullying, and numerical targets were often put before staff well-being. The Welsh NHS Confederation said it was ""saddened"" by the allegations and the NHS took bullying reports seriously. The 2020 NHS Wales staff survey found 16% of workers had experienced bullying, harassment or abuse by another colleague, while 10% said they had experienced the same from a manager. Meanwhile, 14% said their health board did not take effective action if staff were bullied or harassed by other members of staff or the public. Doctors 'bullied for raising Covid safety fears' BAME NHS anti-bullying rules 'not fit for purpose' Five whistleblowers who work for or closely with the Welsh NHS have told BBC Wales of their experiences of bullying and harassment within the organisation. Each of them have had their names changed. Oliver, who has worked as a consultant in several different departments, said the culture of bullying was ""recognised"" throughout all health boards in Wales. ""There's a culture of bullying and harassment which is widespread in most NHS organisations,"" he claimed. ""There are pockets of bad cultures and out of those bad cultures you get bullying, harassment and racism - which can be generally unconscious bias - and misogyny. ""The sexism which I've seen with some of my colleagues... it's upsetting to see."" Oliver said things are made difficult for people who choose to speak out about bullying Oliver said the current system for raising concerns could lead to further issues for those who complain, as the person who conducts the investigation within the department is ""generally involved"" in the cause of the complaint. ""This can then make things difficult for those who do speak out,"" Oliver said. ""It's a culture which then doesn't allow people the safety to speak up and say when some things are wrong around patient safety. ""There are certain departments where there are people who are either accidental bullies or determined bullies and will make life difficult for these doctors or nurses who have made these complaints. ""Staff are then worried and scared of raising issues because they think it will affect their career and make their working life harder. ""It's not the same in every organisation, but the staff feel like there are going to be repercussions on their career if they report bullying and harassment."" Record applications for nursing and medicine NHS staff 'pressured' to go back to work Oliver alleges this, in turn, can lead to people prioritising their careers over speaking up about issues, while meeting numerical targets are often prioritised over patient safety. ""Everyone's strapped for resources in the NHS and there's usually bullying around the resources that get utilised,"" he added. He added bullying has caused extra stress for some staff, additional to the fatigue suffered during the coronavirus pandemic. Louise, a nurse, said she recently decided to leave the NHS after several years in her job due to the culture of bullying in her department. She said: ""I've witnessed bullying, very subtle bullying, making your life difficult. ""They don't allow you time off for appointments, to use your annual leave as you wish... just your general treatment in the way they speak to you, it's almost as if 'I'm the manager I'll speak to you how I want'. ""There has been subtle bullying but also quite obvious bullying to the point where everyone sees what's going on, but people are too afraid to speak up. ""When I did speak up my life was made very difficult. I was made to feel quite excluded and it made me feel quite anxious to go into work. That's unusual because I love my job and I love the NHS."" Louise left her job in NHS Wales due to bullying in the department where she worked Louise said meeting targets is often more important to managers than staff well-being. ""Coming from the top down, things are so target orientated now that people will do anything to meet their targets, even if that comes with the consequence of your staff being unhappy,"" she claimed. ""There's no compassion, there's no empathy."" Louise said she felt ""lucky"" she had been able to leave her job and take up a part-time position outside the NHS, but that option was not available to everyone. ""There are many people who are in that job because they have to be in that job, and they've no other choice but to live with this every day, especially those who are not being treated very nicely. ""It's sad, its very sad."" Another consultant, Lloyd, said there needed to be a change in the way complaints were handled, particularly aswaiting lists of more than 500,000 people are tackled. ""It always comes back to bite the person who tries to hurt the system,"" he said. ""Not everyone is brave enough to go and fight the system, so we need people to be able to go to someone in the knowledge it's addressed. ""Things haven't changed. So the background microaggressions, bullying... have not been addressed. ""They will remain, so when the pressure and systems get worse on waiting times and clinics, it will inevitably lead to more microaggressions more pressures on people who've always been under pressure."" Lloyd was told to remove his face mask by a senior manager early in the pandemic Lloyd said there was an example of such behaviour from a senior manager early in the pandemic, when he was told to remove his mask in an office in order to avoid worrying people about the threat of coronavirus. He said: ""I was quite taken aback, I was asking for some help. No-one knew how it was going to be transmitted. We were all trying to take precautions. ""Every day on the Covid ward I thought 'I'm infected'. ""In the midst of that, that behaviour was uncalled for from a senior manager. I was quite upset about it."" Lloyd said this behaviour, in spring 2020, came at a time when he was regularly the only consultant on shift on his Covid ward, while he also showered three or four times each day and slept in a separate room in his house in order to avoid passing the infection on to his family. Amy, an allied health professional, said there was a culture of ""manipulation and intimidation"" at the hospital where she works. ""It seems to be a culture that comes from the top and trickles down and it becomes an acceptable way of treating people,"" she said. Amy added the ""number one thing"" management did was use patients as ""political pawns"" by giving staff little option but to work overtime or in unfavourable conditions in order to ensure patients do not go without care. ""You can't voice your concerns about patient safety, you're always overruled,"" she claimed. ""I have never worked somewhere where staff feel so demoralised. You have got people who worked there for years and years, because they haven't got the confidence to leave because they feel so belittled and downtrodden. ""I feel like a lot of people haveStockholm syndromeand want to leave, but don't feel like they can."" She said staff are asked for feedback, which is often ignored or dismissed, including on one occasion when a staff member was shouted at in front of 50 colleagues in a meeting. Amy said staff were ""downtrodden and demoralised"" at her hospital Amy added: ""The [feedback] forms are never asking about the root cause of the problem, as they'll ask you what your line manager's like or the work environment is like, but that's not the problem. ""When they come back they'll say 'staff are really happy', because they're not addressing the issues, deliberately, I would imagine. ""There have been plenty of instances of one off massively unacceptable behaviour for line managers to staff. ""It's sort of coercion and manipulation and if you don't agree with managers your life is made very difficult. These senior people then employ people who are like-minded."" Mary was diagnosed with a long-term illness more than 10 years ago and relies on the NHS for regular treatment. During this time, she has been asked to give feedback on NHS Wales services, and said she was ""shocked"" by the bullying she has witnessed and experienced. ""What they want for the patient is a rubber stamp,"" she said. ""They want to be seen consulting patients. They don't like answering the hard questions."" Mary said she had been ""ganged up on"" while giving feedback to NHS services She added: ""If the lines are not toed, there's bullying. That applies to all levels and also to patients. ""I can think of two particular occasions where they ganged up on me. That was quite distressing."" Mary said she had also witnessed an incident where a doctor was ""squashed"" by colleagues during a discussion over a treatment plan for a patient. She said: ""That person backed off and said 'I can't go through this, I can't put my family though this'. ""There's no way that person is going to stand up for the patient next time, it's too hard and there's a personal cost."" Due to these instances of bullying, the British Medical Association (BMA) has asked the Welsh government and NHS providers to invest in and establish Freedom to Speak up Guardians in Wales. Specially appointed to report concerns, guardians are already in place in England and Scotland, offering staff the opportunity to speak in confidence. The Welsh NHS Confederation, the body that represents the health service in Wales, said that the allegations were ""very serious and must be addressed"". ""We're unable to comment on individual cases,"" said director Darren Hughes. ""The NHS takes reports of bullying and harassment seriously and we're saddened to hear of the experiences of these individuals. ""We want all staff who work in the Welsh NHS to feel valued, listened to, recognised and supported so that we can all work together to deliver the best possible care to the people of Wales."" Mr Hughes added a number of programmes were in place, developed with trade unions and the Welsh government, while more were being developed as existing procedures were under review. Russell George, who speaks on health for the Welsh Conservatives, said: ""These whistleblower accounts are truly shocking. ""The Welsh government should now invest in and establish Freedom to Speak up Guardians that are already in place in Scotland and England, so Welsh NHS staff have the opportunity to raise concerns in confidence."" The Welsh government previously said it was considering introducing Freedom to Speak Up Guardians. A statement added: ""Any form of discrimination, bullying and harassment within the NHS is entirely unacceptable and we take these matters very seriously.""

"This video can not be played Crannog roundhouse blaze: 'It was gone in six minutes' A recreated Iron Age house on the shores of Loch Tay has been gutted by fire. The Scottish Crannog Centre, which is also a museum of life in ancient Scotland, was hit by a devastating blaze on Friday evening. The Iron Age roundhouse stood on stilts on the loch shore at Kenmore in Perthshire. Video and pictures posted online by people nearby showed the Iron Age house engulfed in flames. Mike Benson, the director of the Crannog Centre, said CCTV footage showed the fire took hold and destroyed the house in minutes. He told BBC Scotland: ""It's just a devastating blow. ""It's such a much loved icon, you can't think of Loch Tay without thinking of the Crannog Centre. It's been here for 25 years and has been so incredibly loved. ""The main thing is nobody has been hurt, the crannog has gone but it is not the end of the story."" Mr  Benson said he had been ""inundated with support"" since the incident and said he was grateful the museum collection is intact. The reconstructed 2,500-year-old crannog sat on Loch Tay near Kenmore Phone footage shows how the house has been completely destroyed by the fire John Ward, who witnessed the blaze, told the PA news agency it was ""devastating to watch it burn"". He said: ""I saw it from the road end and my boat is at the marina. So lucky the wind was a westerly or it would have done a lot more damage."" A spokesman for the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said it was called to the scene at 23:12 where there was a ""well developed"" fire. The fire was extinguished less than an hour later and there were no reports of any casualties. A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: ""Enquiries will be carried out to establish the full circumstances, though there is nothing at present to suggest the fire is suspicious."" Pete Wishart, MP for Perth and North Perthshire, tweeted: ""Simply awful. The internationally renowned Crannog Centre is a huge part of the whole community of Kenmore/Loch Tay. ""So sorry for all involved with the centre who will be really upset this morning. We must rebuild it."" Last year the Scottish Crannog Centre was one of a number of community projects which shared almost Â£200,000 in funding as part of Scotland's Year of Coast and Waters.

"It was the second day of talks at the G7 summit in the resort of Carbis Bay in Cornwall, south-west of England UK PM Boris Johnson tells the BBC his prime duty is to uphold the territorial integrity of the UK, amid a row with the EU over Northern Ireland The UK and EU are in dispute about post-Brexit checks on goods moving from Britain to Northern Ireland The G7 leaders relaxed with a barbecue on the beach during the evening They were entertained by a group singing sea shanties and a flypast from the Red Arrows The UK PM has told EU leaders he wants ""pragmatism and compromise on all sides"", according to Downing Street The leaders have agreed a spending plan for infrastructure investment in developing countries to counter China's growing global influence Kelly-Leigh Cooper and James Clarke We're
ending our live coverage for today, so thanks for joining us. Weâll be back tomorrow
with more news from Cornwall. Todayâs
updates were brought to you by Hugo Bachega, Victoria Lindrea, Dulcie Lee, Jack Hunter and Francesca Gillet. The page was edited by James Clarke and Kelly-Leigh Cooper. G7 leaders discussed theories about the origins of Covid-19 earlier today, according to the head of the World Health Organization (WHO). In recent weeks theclaim that the pandemic may have leaked from a laboratory in Wuhan has gained fresh attention. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus says the leaders ""raised"" the lab-leak hypothesis and agreed to press China for more clarity on the issue. A WHO investigation into the origin of the pandemic has not ruled out any theory behind the outbreak so far. ""We believe that all hypotheses should be open, and we need to proceed to the second phase to really know the origins,"" Dr Tedros said. He said the origins of Covid-19 should be fully investigated out of ""respect"" for the victims of the pandemic. There's nothing like a hard day of diplomatic haggling to work up an appetite. After about six hours of talks today, the G7 leaders and their guests have made their way down to the beach at Carbis Bay for a barbecue. Smoke from the grills is obscuring a clear view of who opted for what - but a number of local delicacies are said to be on the menu. The atmosphere may be relaxed but security is not Family members, including of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, could be seen at the informal event People gathered to watch as the Royal Air Force perform over St Ives This evening the G7 leaders were treated to a display by the RAF's Red Arrows aerobatic team. The jets set off at just after 20:00 BST and looped into an arc shape several times before splitting off. As well as the G7 leaders, members of the public in St Ives looked up to the skies to watch the colourful display, cheering with delight when the jets moved into formation. It's been a busy day for the Red Arrows, whohad already performed a flypast at the Queen's official birthday celebrations earlier today. The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale said that from a diplomatic point of view, events like the Red Arrows help provide a structure around which you can base all the serious politics. ""These leaders are going to summits all the time,"" he said. ""Most of them aren't as much fun as this. They get to bring their partners, there's a bit of a sense of occasion about this."" South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa is among the guests It's not just leaders of the G7 - the group of seven of the world's richest countries - that are at the summit in Cornwall this weekend. The UK invited four other countries as guests - Australia, South Korea, South Africa and India to attend in order to ""deepen the expertise and experience around the table"". Because of the coronavirus crisis, India's prime minister is joining via video conference call. But the other leaders arrived at the summit in person earlier today, along with UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Nomia IqbalBBC News The G7 leaders are enjoying a barbecue beach party and nearby,
so are Ruthie and Tony Goff. The couple live on a clifftop in Carbis Bay which has a
perfect view of the beach where world leaders are tucking into canapÃ©s, scallops and Cornish potatoes. Ruthie and Tony have burgers and sausages on their menu - with lots of wine on hand for their friends. Ruthie says âhaving a barbecue with amazing sunny weather
like this, is the norm for us.... it just happens to be that these world leaders hundreds
of yards away from us are doing the same thing.â Some locals have criticised the summit due to
the heavy security which has hugely restricted movements. But the Goffs are among residents embracing all the attention, with Ruthie describing it as ""amazing"" for the local area. The G7 leaders are gathering on the beach for their ""family photo"" and a beach barbecue. It seems the Red Arrows flypast has also been delayed. We're expecting a flypast over the summit by the RAF Red Arrows in the next few minutes. They will take off from RNAS Culdrose in Helston in Cornwall before flying over the coast east of Penzance and performing stunts over the Carbis Bay beach. But locals in the area are being encouraged not to gather to watch the flyover because of coronavirus restrictions. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

If you're just joining us, Saturday has been another packed day at the G7 summit in Cornwall. World vaccine distribution, the Northern Ireland Protocol and an ambitious infrastructure spending plan have all been among the day's main talking points so far. We're expecting the latest group session to end soon before this evening's events begin, with a beach barbecue and a Red Arrows flypast on the agenda. Demonstrators held Tigray flags at Gyllyngvase beach in Falmouth on Saturday The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, tweeted to say that Tigray was top of the agenda at the G7 summit today. The region of Ethiopia has been devastated by fighting between government forces and rebels, with 1.7 million people displaced since the conflict began in November 2020. Earlier this week Unicef warned thatabout 33,000 children there are now severely malnourished and at high risk of death with many more living in ""severe crisis"". Allow Twitter content?

More now on the spending plan adopted by G7 leaders to rival China - a key issue dominating the agenda this weekend. It's a plan designed to rival China's multi-trillion dollar Belt and Roads initiative, which funds infrastructure in many countries around the world. The G7's Build Back Better World (B3W) plan would offer a ""values-driven, high-standard and transparent"" alternative, the leaders say. But details of how the G7 plan will be funded are not yet clear. Germany's Angela Merkel says the group was not yet ready to release financing for the initiative. The summit this weekend is for the leaders of countries in the G7 - that's the group of seven of the world's richest countries. But some other countries' leaders have also been invited to attend as guests - and Boris and Carrie Johnson have been greeting them today. India's Narendra Modi was also invited but plans to take part via video link due to the coronavirus crisis. South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa laughs as he is greeted at Carbis Bay on Saturday afternoon Under the glorious sunshine, the couple welcomed South Korea""s President Moon Jae-in and first lady Kim Jung-sook Australia's PM Scott Morrison also flew in for the weekend's meeting Andrew SegalBBC South West, at Porthcurno The hush-hush visit of theG7 leadersâ partners to Porthcurnoin Cornwall meant many people who were visiting the village - and there were many, as it is a popular tourist spot - were not aware of what was happening up the hill at the Minack Theatre, a mere quarter of a mile away. Police from a few English forces were around the area, including officers from Bedford, Cambridgeshire and the City of London; and were relaxed while talking to visitors and me about how this was quite different from their usual duties. One officer (not pictured) said he was glad to be out, particularly in Saturdayâs very sunny weather, as heâd spent three days of his G7 deployment âsitting in a car parkâ. Excitement built up as a motorcade returned to the theatre and collected its passengers before they left the village through its narrow roads, with one security official confirming to me (when it was safe to do so) âIt was Dr Biden.â People who found out who it was were left with an interesting story about who passed them while they were in queues for pasties and ice cream. The G7 group of the world's richest nations is set to agreed a plan to stop the world's largest companies avoiding tax by moving their operations between countries. At the moment, a company can choose to put their headquarters in a country with a lower tax rate and take their profits there. For example in 2018, Facebook, which has its international HQ in Dublin, paid Â£28.5m in tax to the UK,although its revenue was Â£1.65bn. Under the G7 deal, companies could be taxed in any country where they make more than 10% profit on sales. Above that point, the company would have to pay 20% tax. Another part of the deal is a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%. This is to stop nations undercutting each other's tax rate to attract multinational companies. Ireland has operated a policy ofattracting US technology companies to set up their headquarters there,chiefly through the offer of a low corporation tax rate of 12.5% (the UK's is 19% and set to rise to 25% by 2023). Along with Facebook, Google has its international headquarters in Dublin's Grand Canal Quay, with TripAdvisor and AirBnB nearby. If the G7 deal goes ahead, the tax advantages which have attracted these companies would cease to exist. In a meeting with UN chief Antonio Guterres at the summit, Boris Johnson has discussed the need for ""joined-up global action"" on climate change and pandemic preparedness, a Downing Street spokesperson says. ""They agreed on the need for countries to step up and make ambitious commitments to cut carbon emissions and phase out the use of coal,"" the spokesperson adds. ""They discussed a number of international issues including the situations in Yemen, Syria and Libya, the Cyprus peace process, the need for a return to democracy in Myanmar and Afghanistan."" US First Lady Jill Biden has joined Carrie Johnson and other partners of G7 summit leaders on a visit to a Cornish clifftop theatre. Their motorcade wound down narrow lanes to reach the Minack Theatre, which overlooks picturesque Porthcurno beach on Cornwall's south coast. The route is notorious for traffic jams as tourists flock to the area in the summer. But with blue lights flashing and a posse of security guards on hand they managed to avoid the heavy traffic faced by holidaymakers. They were there for a special performance by Cornish children about plastic pollution. The local children werenât told about the VIP audience until minutes before the guests arrived. Apparently the players were anxious about misty Cornish weather but they needn't have worried, as there were clear blue skies over the stunning spot. Susie Kersley, who lives locally, says: ""It's amazing, a little bit of excitement and puts Porthcurno on the map."" Friend Miranda Penhaligon adds: ""It was mad, flashing blue lights, loads of cars. ""We are very isolated here and to see all these cars is just ridiculously amazing. ""We are just so excited, it's like a party."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"It was the second day of talks at the G7 summit in the resort of Carbis Bay in Cornwall, south-west of England UK PM Boris Johnson tells the BBC his prime duty is to uphold the territorial integrity of the UK, amid a row with the EU over Northern Ireland The UK and EU are in dispute about post-Brexit checks on goods moving from Britain to Northern Ireland The G7 leaders relaxed with a barbecue on the beach during the evening They were entertained by a group singing sea shanties and a flypast from the Red Arrows The UK PM has told EU leaders he wants ""pragmatism and compromise on all sides"", according to Downing Street The leaders have agreed a spending plan for infrastructure investment in developing countries to counter China's growing global influence Kelly-Leigh Cooper and James Clarke We're
ending our live coverage for today, so thanks for joining us. Weâll be back tomorrow
with more news from Cornwall. Todayâs
updates were brought to you by Hugo Bachega, Victoria Lindrea, Dulcie Lee, Jack Hunter and Francesca Gillet. The page was edited by James Clarke and Kelly-Leigh Cooper. G7 leaders discussed theories about the origins of Covid-19 earlier today, according to the head of the World Health Organization (WHO). In recent weeks theclaim that the pandemic may have leaked from a laboratory in Wuhan has gained fresh attention. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus says the leaders ""raised"" the lab-leak hypothesis and agreed to press China for more clarity on the issue. A WHO investigation into the origin of the pandemic has not ruled out any theory behind the outbreak so far. ""We believe that all hypotheses should be open, and we need to proceed to the second phase to really know the origins,"" Dr Tedros said. He said the origins of Covid-19 should be fully investigated out of ""respect"" for the victims of the pandemic. There's nothing like a hard day of diplomatic haggling to work up an appetite. After about six hours of talks today, the G7 leaders and their guests have made their way down to the beach at Carbis Bay for a barbecue. Smoke from the grills is obscuring a clear view of who opted for what - but a number of local delicacies are said to be on the menu. The atmosphere may be relaxed but security is not Family members, including of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, could be seen at the informal event People gathered to watch as the Royal Air Force perform over St Ives This evening the G7 leaders were treated to a display by the RAF's Red Arrows aerobatic team. The jets set off at just after 20:00 BST and looped into an arc shape several times before splitting off. As well as the G7 leaders, members of the public in St Ives looked up to the skies to watch the colourful display, cheering with delight when the jets moved into formation. It's been a busy day for the Red Arrows, whohad already performed a flypast at the Queen's official birthday celebrations earlier today. The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale said that from a diplomatic point of view, events like the Red Arrows help provide a structure around which you can base all the serious politics. ""These leaders are going to summits all the time,"" he said. ""Most of them aren't as much fun as this. They get to bring their partners, there's a bit of a sense of occasion about this."" South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa is among the guests It's not just leaders of the G7 - the group of seven of the world's richest countries - that are at the summit in Cornwall this weekend. The UK invited four other countries as guests - Australia, South Korea, South Africa and India to attend in order to ""deepen the expertise and experience around the table"". Because of the coronavirus crisis, India's prime minister is joining via video conference call. But the other leaders arrived at the summit in person earlier today, along with UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Nomia IqbalBBC News The G7 leaders are enjoying a barbecue beach party and nearby,
so are Ruthie and Tony Goff. The couple live on a clifftop in Carbis Bay which has a
perfect view of the beach where world leaders are tucking into canapÃ©s, scallops and Cornish potatoes. Ruthie and Tony have burgers and sausages on their menu - with lots of wine on hand for their friends. Ruthie says âhaving a barbecue with amazing sunny weather
like this, is the norm for us.... it just happens to be that these world leaders hundreds
of yards away from us are doing the same thing.â Some locals have criticised the summit due to
the heavy security which has hugely restricted movements. But the Goffs are among residents embracing all the attention, with Ruthie describing it as ""amazing"" for the local area. The G7 leaders are gathering on the beach for their ""family photo"" and a beach barbecue. It seems the Red Arrows flypast has also been delayed. We're expecting a flypast over the summit by the RAF Red Arrows in the next few minutes. They will take off from RNAS Culdrose in Helston in Cornwall before flying over the coast east of Penzance and performing stunts over the Carbis Bay beach. But locals in the area are being encouraged not to gather to watch the flyover because of coronavirus restrictions. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played ""Prime duty of the government to uphold the territorial integrity of the UK"" - Johnson on NI Protocol Boris Johnson says he will do ""whatever it takes"" to protect the territorial integrity of the UK, after talks with EU leaders over Northern Ireland. The prime minister said there had been ""misunderstanding"" on the EU side but said he thought ""pragmatic solutions"" would be found to border issues. Meetings between the two sides took place at the G7 summit in Cornwall. French President Emmanuel Macron said he was willing to ""reset"" UK relations if it honoured the Brexit deal. The disagreement between the UK and the EU is over the implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol, a measure in the Brexit deal which prevents checks on trade across the Irish border. Some checks are taking place on British goods entering Northern Ireland, causing disruption to food supplies. Mr Johnson has held meetings with European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, European Council head Charles Michel, Mr Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel in the margins of the gathering at the Cornish resort Carbis Bay. Gulf remains between UK and EU over Brexit protocol Ahead of the G7, the EU had saidits patience with the UK was ""wearing thin"", after the UK said it was prepared to ignore rules to prevent disruption to trade in Northern Ireland following Brexit. Mr Johnson told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg: ""I think that to be fair there is quite a lot of misunderstanding around the EU about the situation in Northern Ireland, the balance of the Good Friday Agreement, the peace process. ""I was just in a gentle way getting across what that means and I think that we will have some pragmatic solutions.""He added he thought the EU leaders understood ""that it is the prime duty of the UK government to uphold the territorial integrity of the United Kingdom"" and said the government would do ""whatever it takes to ensure that"". In a word: sausages. EU food safety rules don't allow chilled meat products to enter its market from non-members, such as the UK. This has led to the prospect of British sausages - and other meat products - being banned from Northern Ireland. A six-month grace period has been in place since January where the rules don't apply - but that runs out at the end of the month. Talks on what happens next were held between the UK and EU earlier this week, but they broke up without agreement. Find out more about the Northern Ireland Protocol In an interview with Sky News, Mr Johnson said that unless there was a solution he would invoke Article 16 - a measure in the Northern Ireland Protocol which allows either side to take unilateral action. He said: ""I think if the protocol continues to be applied in this way, then we will obviously not hesitate to invoke Article 16, as I have said before."" Downing Street said it was Mr Johnson's desire was to ""work within the existing protocol to find radical and pragmatic solutions"" to Northern Ireland's border issues. By Vicki Young, BBC deputy political editor This deadlock won't get solved during the G7 summit, but it has dominated meetings between the UK and EU in Cornwall. The UK's decision to unilaterally extend the grace period where checks would be waived has already inflamed tensions - with the EU launching legal action against the UK earlier this year. Under the current agreement, Northern Ireland is still bound by a lot of EU rules: so the question is, what will the PM do next? Is he now suggesting that the UK would be willing to suspend the whole thing - and not go along with what was signed before? President Macron has talked about resetting the relationship between the French and the UK - but has stressed it depends on the UK keeping its word over Brexit. So how do leaders find a way through this? Both parties talk about pragmatic solutions to all of this - the trouble is, they don't agree on what they are. Following a trilateral meeting between Mr Johnson, Mrs von der Leyen and Mr Michel in Cornwall, an EU official said that the presidents had said that the rhetoric needed to be toned down and called on the joint committee - made up of negotiators from both sides - to actively look for solutions which are in the protocol. During meetings with the EU leaders, which Brexit minister Lord Frost also attended, the prime minister had ""made clear his desire for pragmatism and compromise on all sides"" but had also underlined that protecting the Good Friday Agreement was paramount, Downing Street said. The spokesman added the protocol as it was currently being implemented was ""having a damaging impact on the people of Northern Ireland"" and said the UK government would ""keep all options on the table"". Previously Downing Street had indicated the UK would be prepared to unilaterally delay the full implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol to prevent a ban on chilled meats crossing the Irish Sea from Great Britain - with restrictions due to come into force at the end of the month. Boris Johnson will also meet European Council head Charles Michel and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen Delaying the checks without agreement from Brussels would risk triggering a trade dispute with the EU. The UK prime minister has previously suggested the EU is taking an ""excessively burdensome"" approach to post-Brexit trading arrangements. Ahead of the G7 summit, Mrs von der Leyen insisted the protocol is the ""only solution"" to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic and must be implemented in full. French President Emmanuel Macron will have talks with UK PM Boris Johnson on Saturday but has said ""nothing is renegotiable"" At a press conference Mr Macron said ""nothing is renegotiable"" and said it was not ""serious to want to review in July what we finalised after years of debate and work in December"". Before US President Joe Biden travelled to Cornwall for the summit his national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the president had ""deep"" concerns that the trade rowcould endanger peace in Northern Ireland. Unionists are strongly opposed to checks in the Irish Sea because they do not want Northern Ireland to be treated differently to the rest of the UK. Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP, and Alliance have said there are problems with the protocol but have argued that the UK and EU must ensure its ""rigorous implementation"". The main agenda of the G7 summit, held in Cornwall, will see leaders of the UK, US, Canada, Japan, France, Germany and Italycommit to a plan to prevent a repeat of the coronavirus pandemic.

"The core stage and twin booster rockets stand taller than the Statue of Liberty (minus its pedestal) Nasa has assembled the first of its powerful Space Launch System (SLS) rockets, which will carry humans to the Moon this decade. On Friday, engineers at Florida's Kennedy Space Center finished lowering the 65m (212ft) -tall core stage in-between two smaller booster rockets. It's the first time all three key elements of the rocket have been together in their launch configuration. Nasa plans to launch the SLS on its maiden flight later this year. During this mission, known as Artemis-1, the SLS will carry Orion - America's next-generation crew vehicle - towards the Moon. However, no astronauts will be aboard; engineers want to put both the rocket and the spaceship through their paces before humans are allowed on in 2023. Test success for world's most powerful rocket Nasa's giant SLS rocket: a guide Artemis: To the Moon and Beyond Nasa chooses SpaceX to build Moon lander Core stage being lifted up from its position in the transfer aisle at the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) The SLS consists of the giant core stage, which houses propellant tanks and four powerful engines, flanked by two 54m (177ft) -long solid rocket boosters (SRBs). They provide most of the thrust-force that propels the SLS off the ground in the first two minutes of flight. Both the core stage and the SRBs are taller than the Statue of Liberty, minus its pedestal. Over Friday and Saturday, teams at Kennedy Space Center used a heavy-lift crane to first hoist the core stage, transfer it from a horizontal to a vertical position, and then lower it into place between the SRBs on a structure called the mobile launcher. This structure currently resides inside the huge, cuboid Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB). After being lifted, the core stage was rotated into the vertical position The mobile launcher allows access to the SLS for testing, checkout and servicing. It will also transfer the giant rocket to the launch pad. Engineers began stacking the SRBs on the mobile launcher in November last year. While this was going on, the core stage was attached to a test stand in Mississippi, undergoing a comprehensive programme of evaluation known as the Green Run. Artwork: Nasa wants to return to the Moon, but this time it wants to stay In March, thecore stage engines were fired successfully for around eight minutes- the time taken for the SLS to get from the ground to space - in the Green Run's final and most important test. After refurbishment, the core was taken by barge to Kennedy Space Center. Artemis-3, which will be the first mission to land humans on the Moon since Apollo 17 in 1972, should launch in the next few years. Nasa recently awarded the contract tobuild the next-generation Moon landerto SpaceX, which is adapting its Starship design for the purpose.

"The core stage and twin booster rockets stand taller than the Statue of Liberty (minus its pedestal) Nasa has assembled the first of its powerful Space Launch System (SLS) rockets, which will carry humans to the Moon this decade. On Friday, engineers at Florida's Kennedy Space Center finished lowering the 65m (212ft) -tall core stage in-between two smaller booster rockets. It's the first time all three key elements of the rocket have been together in their launch configuration. Nasa plans to launch the SLS on its maiden flight later this year. During this mission, known as Artemis-1, the SLS will carry Orion - America's next-generation crew vehicle - towards the Moon. However, no astronauts will be aboard; engineers want to put both the rocket and the spaceship through their paces before humans are allowed on in 2023. Test success for world's most powerful rocket Nasa's giant SLS rocket: a guide Artemis: To the Moon and Beyond Nasa chooses SpaceX to build Moon lander Core stage being lifted up from its position in the transfer aisle at the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) The SLS consists of the giant core stage, which houses propellant tanks and four powerful engines, flanked by two 54m (177ft) -long solid rocket boosters (SRBs). They provide most of the thrust-force that propels the SLS off the ground in the first two minutes of flight. Both the core stage and the SRBs are taller than the Statue of Liberty, minus its pedestal. Over Friday and Saturday, teams at Kennedy Space Center used a heavy-lift crane to first hoist the core stage, transfer it from a horizontal to a vertical position, and then lower it into place between the SRBs on a structure called the mobile launcher. This structure currently resides inside the huge, cuboid Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB). After being lifted, the core stage was rotated into the vertical position The mobile launcher allows access to the SLS for testing, checkout and servicing. It will also transfer the giant rocket to the launch pad. Engineers began stacking the SRBs on the mobile launcher in November last year. While this was going on, the core stage was attached to a test stand in Mississippi, undergoing a comprehensive programme of evaluation known as the Green Run. Artwork: Nasa wants to return to the Moon, but this time it wants to stay In March, thecore stage engines were fired successfully for around eight minutes- the time taken for the SLS to get from the ground to space - in the Green Run's final and most important test. After refurbishment, the core was taken by barge to Kennedy Space Center. Artemis-3, which will be the first mission to land humans on the Moon since Apollo 17 in 1972, should launch in the next few years. Nasa recently awarded the contract tobuild the next-generation Moon landerto SpaceX, which is adapting its Starship design for the purpose.

"This video can not be played Crannog roundhouse blaze: 'It was gone in six minutes' A recreated Iron Age house on the shores of Loch Tay has been gutted by fire. The Scottish Crannog Centre, which is also a museum of life in ancient Scotland, was hit by a devastating blaze on Friday evening. The Iron Age roundhouse stood on stilts on the loch shore at Kenmore in Perthshire. Video and pictures posted online by people nearby showed the Iron Age house engulfed in flames. Mike Benson, the director of the Crannog Centre, said CCTV footage showed the fire took hold and destroyed the house in minutes. He told BBC Scotland: ""It's just a devastating blow. ""It's such a much loved icon, you can't think of Loch Tay without thinking of the Crannog Centre. It's been here for 25 years and has been so incredibly loved. ""The main thing is nobody has been hurt, the crannog has gone but it is not the end of the story."" Mr  Benson said he had been ""inundated with support"" since the incident and said he was grateful the museum collection is intact. The reconstructed 2,500-year-old crannog sat on Loch Tay near Kenmore Phone footage shows how the house has been completely destroyed by the fire John Ward, who witnessed the blaze, told the PA news agency it was ""devastating to watch it burn"". He said: ""I saw it from the road end and my boat is at the marina. So lucky the wind was a westerly or it would have done a lot more damage."" A spokesman for the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said it was called to the scene at 23:12 where there was a ""well developed"" fire. The fire was extinguished less than an hour later and there were no reports of any casualties. A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: ""Enquiries will be carried out to establish the full circumstances, though there is nothing at present to suggest the fire is suspicious."" Pete Wishart, MP for Perth and North Perthshire, tweeted: ""Simply awful. The internationally renowned Crannog Centre is a huge part of the whole community of Kenmore/Loch Tay. ""So sorry for all involved with the centre who will be really upset this morning. We must rebuild it."" Last year the Scottish Crannog Centre was one of a number of community projects which shared almost Â£200,000 in funding as part of Scotland's Year of Coast and Waters.

"Talks have been taking place on the NI Protocol which created a trade border in the Irish Sea As his press conference wore on,Maros Sefcovic sounded increasingly frustrated. The European Commission vice president had spent Wednesday morning in a meeting with Lord Frost, the UK's Brexit Minister. The meeting to discuss the implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol has been described by some sources as ""brutal"" or ""a car crash"". Mr Sefcovic said it had been a very difficult discussion. He told the media that earlier in the process the EU had suggested things the UK could do to simplify export certification for some products going from GB to Northern Ireland. ""Do you think at least one of these things was done?,"" he asked. ""None. Nothing has materialised."" This is typical of how the EU sees the UK's willingness to implement the protocol; moving too slowly and so needlessly exacerbating problems. The UK bristles at this. Writing for the Financial Times this week, Lord Frost said: ""We enforce EU law in Northern Ireland as required. We take no lectures on whether we are implementing the protocol; we are."" But aside from disagreement about operational detail, it is clear there is now a gulf between the two sides on how the protocol should be interpreted. Lord Frost (L) has been discussing border issues with his EU counterpart Maros Sefcovic in central London The protocol was agreed by the UK and EU in October 2019 and was subjected to further negotiation and agreement last year. Its fundamental aim is to prevent a hardening of the land border between the two parts of island. It does that by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods, meaning products arriving from GB need paperwork and some, particularly food, are subject to checks. Government 'knew NI Protocol was bad deal' Can sea border âteething problemsâ be solved? It was well understood in the UK Civil Service, if not among all MPs, that this was going to mean a substantial trade border which would increase cost and complexity for internal UK trade. The text of the protocol contains 40 pages of EU directives and regulations which continue to apply in Northern Ireland. That is the letter of the agreement. But UK ministers are increasingly focused on what they see as the spirit of the agreement. For them, that spirit can be found in the preamble to the protocol where one section reads: ""The application of this protocol should impact as little as possible on the every day life of communities in both Ireland and Northern Ireland."" On that basis, the current range of checks and controls does not come up to the mark and the operational impact of the protocol should be radically changed. Lord Frost put it like this in the Financial Times: ""In 2019 we agreed, as a huge compromise and for the greater good, to control certain goods' movements within our own country and customs territory. ""If that situation is not to be totally unsustainable we need to be able to do so in ways which do not disrupt every day life and which respect everyone's identity and interests."" The EU sees this approach as infuriatingly reductive and an attempt to walk back the whole premise of the agreement. French President Emmanuel Macron robustly articulated that view ahead of the G7 summit. ""We have a protocol,"" he said. ""If, after six months, you say we cannot respect what was negotiated, then that says nothing can be respected. ""I believe in the weight of a treaty, I believe in taking a serious approach. Nothing is negotiable. Everything is applicable."" Despite those tough words, technical talks between EU and UK officials will continue and progress is being made on easing some parts of the protocol. Outside those talks, other well-informed observers continue to offer ideas. Anton Spisak, a former UK Brexit official,has suggested a risk-based scheme which could offer a way to sharply reduce,externalthe need to check goods going from GB-NI. But any scheme of that sort involves the EU investing a large amount of trust in the UK and for now trust is in short supply.

"Five people who work for or with the Welsh NHS have told the BBC of a ""culture"" of bullying There is a ""culture"" of bullying in the Welsh NHS which leaves people scared to raise issues, several staff have said. NHS workers said they had witnessed or experienced institutionalised racism and sexism and also faced obstacles when reporting incidences of bullying. It is claimed that raising concerns has led to bullying, and numerical targets were often put before staff well-being. The Welsh NHS Confederation said it was ""saddened"" by the allegations and the NHS took bullying reports seriously. The 2020 NHS Wales staff survey found 16% of workers had experienced bullying, harassment or abuse by another colleague, while 10% said they had experienced the same from a manager. Meanwhile, 14% said their health board did not take effective action if staff were bullied or harassed by other members of staff or the public. Doctors 'bullied for raising Covid safety fears' BAME NHS anti-bullying rules 'not fit for purpose' Five whistleblowers who work for or closely with the Welsh NHS have told BBC Wales of their experiences of bullying and harassment within the organisation. Each of them have had their names changed. Oliver, who has worked as a consultant in several different departments, said the culture of bullying was ""recognised"" throughout all health boards in Wales. ""There's a culture of bullying and harassment which is widespread in most NHS organisations,"" he claimed. ""There are pockets of bad cultures and out of those bad cultures you get bullying, harassment and racism - which can be generally unconscious bias - and misogyny. ""The sexism which I've seen with some of my colleagues... it's upsetting to see."" Oliver said things are made difficult for people who choose to speak out about bullying Oliver said the current system for raising concerns could lead to further issues for those who complain, as the person who conducts the investigation within the department is ""generally involved"" in the cause of the complaint. ""This can then make things difficult for those who do speak out,"" Oliver said. ""It's a culture which then doesn't allow people the safety to speak up and say when some things are wrong around patient safety. ""There are certain departments where there are people who are either accidental bullies or determined bullies and will make life difficult for these doctors or nurses who have made these complaints. ""Staff are then worried and scared of raising issues because they think it will affect their career and make their working life harder. ""It's not the same in every organisation, but the staff feel like there are going to be repercussions on their career if they report bullying and harassment."" Record applications for nursing and medicine NHS staff 'pressured' to go back to work Oliver alleges this, in turn, can lead to people prioritising their careers over speaking up about issues, while meeting numerical targets are often prioritised over patient safety. ""Everyone's strapped for resources in the NHS and there's usually bullying around the resources that get utilised,"" he added. He added bullying has caused extra stress for some staff, additional to the fatigue suffered during the coronavirus pandemic. Louise, a nurse, said she recently decided to leave the NHS after several years in her job due to the culture of bullying in her department. She said: ""I've witnessed bullying, very subtle bullying, making your life difficult. ""They don't allow you time off for appointments, to use your annual leave as you wish... just your general treatment in the way they speak to you, it's almost as if 'I'm the manager I'll speak to you how I want'. ""There has been subtle bullying but also quite obvious bullying to the point where everyone sees what's going on, but people are too afraid to speak up. ""When I did speak up my life was made very difficult. I was made to feel quite excluded and it made me feel quite anxious to go into work. That's unusual because I love my job and I love the NHS."" Louise left her job in NHS Wales due to bullying in the department where she worked Louise said meeting targets is often more important to managers than staff well-being. ""Coming from the top down, things are so target orientated now that people will do anything to meet their targets, even if that comes with the consequence of your staff being unhappy,"" she claimed. ""There's no compassion, there's no empathy."" Louise said she felt ""lucky"" she had been able to leave her job and take up a part-time position outside the NHS, but that option was not available to everyone. ""There are many people who are in that job because they have to be in that job, and they've no other choice but to live with this every day, especially those who are not being treated very nicely. ""It's sad, its very sad."" Another consultant, Lloyd, said there needed to be a change in the way complaints were handled, particularly aswaiting lists of more than 500,000 people are tackled. ""It always comes back to bite the person who tries to hurt the system,"" he said. ""Not everyone is brave enough to go and fight the system, so we need people to be able to go to someone in the knowledge it's addressed. ""Things haven't changed. So the background microaggressions, bullying... have not been addressed. ""They will remain, so when the pressure and systems get worse on waiting times and clinics, it will inevitably lead to more microaggressions more pressures on people who've always been under pressure."" Lloyd was told to remove his face mask by a senior manager early in the pandemic Lloyd said there was an example of such behaviour from a senior manager early in the pandemic, when he was told to remove his mask in an office in order to avoid worrying people about the threat of coronavirus. He said: ""I was quite taken aback, I was asking for some help. No-one knew how it was going to be transmitted. We were all trying to take precautions. ""Every day on the Covid ward I thought 'I'm infected'. ""In the midst of that, that behaviour was uncalled for from a senior manager. I was quite upset about it."" Lloyd said this behaviour, in spring 2020, came at a time when he was regularly the only consultant on shift on his Covid ward, while he also showered three or four times each day and slept in a separate room in his house in order to avoid passing the infection on to his family. Amy, an allied health professional, said there was a culture of ""manipulation and intimidation"" at the hospital where she works. ""It seems to be a culture that comes from the top and trickles down and it becomes an acceptable way of treating people,"" she said. Amy added the ""number one thing"" management did was use patients as ""political pawns"" by giving staff little option but to work overtime or in unfavourable conditions in order to ensure patients do not go without care. ""You can't voice your concerns about patient safety, you're always overruled,"" she claimed. ""I have never worked somewhere where staff feel so demoralised. You have got people who worked there for years and years, because they haven't got the confidence to leave because they feel so belittled and downtrodden. ""I feel like a lot of people haveStockholm syndromeand want to leave, but don't feel like they can."" She said staff are asked for feedback, which is often ignored or dismissed, including on one occasion when a staff member was shouted at in front of 50 colleagues in a meeting. Amy said staff were ""downtrodden and demoralised"" at her hospital Amy added: ""The [feedback] forms are never asking about the root cause of the problem, as they'll ask you what your line manager's like or the work environment is like, but that's not the problem. ""When they come back they'll say 'staff are really happy', because they're not addressing the issues, deliberately, I would imagine. ""There have been plenty of instances of one off massively unacceptable behaviour for line managers to staff. ""It's sort of coercion and manipulation and if you don't agree with managers your life is made very difficult. These senior people then employ people who are like-minded."" Mary was diagnosed with a long-term illness more than 10 years ago and relies on the NHS for regular treatment. During this time, she has been asked to give feedback on NHS Wales services, and said she was ""shocked"" by the bullying she has witnessed and experienced. ""What they want for the patient is a rubber stamp,"" she said. ""They want to be seen consulting patients. They don't like answering the hard questions."" Mary said she had been ""ganged up on"" while giving feedback to NHS services She added: ""If the lines are not toed, there's bullying. That applies to all levels and also to patients. ""I can think of two particular occasions where they ganged up on me. That was quite distressing."" Mary said she had also witnessed an incident where a doctor was ""squashed"" by colleagues during a discussion over a treatment plan for a patient. She said: ""That person backed off and said 'I can't go through this, I can't put my family though this'. ""There's no way that person is going to stand up for the patient next time, it's too hard and there's a personal cost."" Due to these instances of bullying, the British Medical Association (BMA) has asked the Welsh government and NHS providers to invest in and establish Freedom to Speak up Guardians in Wales. Specially appointed to report concerns, guardians are already in place in England and Scotland, offering staff the opportunity to speak in confidence. The Welsh NHS Confederation, the body that represents the health service in Wales, said that the allegations were ""very serious and must be addressed"". ""We're unable to comment on individual cases,"" said director Darren Hughes. ""The NHS takes reports of bullying and harassment seriously and we're saddened to hear of the experiences of these individuals. ""We want all staff who work in the Welsh NHS to feel valued, listened to, recognised and supported so that we can all work together to deliver the best possible care to the people of Wales."" Mr Hughes added a number of programmes were in place, developed with trade unions and the Welsh government, while more were being developed as existing procedures were under review. Russell George, who speaks on health for the Welsh Conservatives, said: ""These whistleblower accounts are truly shocking. ""The Welsh government should now invest in and establish Freedom to Speak up Guardians that are already in place in Scotland and England, so Welsh NHS staff have the opportunity to raise concerns in confidence."" The Welsh government previously said it was considering introducing Freedom to Speak Up Guardians. A statement added: ""Any form of discrimination, bullying and harassment within the NHS is entirely unacceptable and we take these matters very seriously.""

"This video can not be played The Queen tapped her foot as her birthday parade took place in the grounds of Windsor Castle The Queen's official birthday has been marked with a scaled back celebration for a second year due to Covid. This year's Trooping the Colour saw a reduced parade in the grounds of Windsor Castle, rather than in central London, led by the Scots Guards. In 2020 the event was cancelled due to the pandemic witha ceremonial tributeperformed at Windsor by Welsh Guardsman and a band of the Household Division. It comes ahead of the Queen hosting US President Joe Biden on Sunday. The monarch's actual birthday is on 21 April but her official birthday is marked on the second Saturday of June each year. It is traditionally celebrated with a military parade near Buckingham Palace in which the Household Division marches carrying a regimental flag, known as a colour. The Red Arrows also performed a fly past to end the celebrations The event at Windsor Castle replaces the ceremony normally staged in central London The Guardsmen showed their precision marching skills while maintaining a social distance of just over two metres The Duke of Kent - the Queen's cousin - was also present for the ceremony, which saw the F Company Scots Guards troop the colour of the 2nd Battalion Scots Guards through the ranks of guardsmen on parade. The celebration was smaller than normal and has been dubbed a ""mini"" Trooping the Colour. But the military officer in charge of planning the parade said his aim was to create a ""memorable and uplifting day"" for the monarch, who has been based at Windsor during the pandemic. The birthday parade is a gift from the Household Division - the Army's most prestigious regiments Members of the public gathered in Windsor and saw the Red Arrows flypast overhead Crowds lined the Long Walk to watch the Household Cavalry leave Lt Col Guy Stone said: ""Last year we had 85 on parade, this year we've got 274, plus 70 horses, so we're really excited about the event having grown and getting us back to normal for next year we hope. ""It's been very challenging, but we like a challenge. Covid has got a lot to answer for in so many ways, it's made this difficult but what we want to do more than anything is give the Queen a memorable and uplifting day."" Foot tapping along to the music, the Queen took a break from meeting presidents and prime ministers during the G7 summit to attend her birthday parade. It was a scaled down Trooping the Colour - in the grounds of Windsor Castle rather than in central London. The soldiers once again had to carry out their manoeuvres in a socially distanced way but, unlike last year, the mounted regiments were there and gun salutes were fired. Any public hoping to catch a glimpse had been asked to stay away from Windsor town centre - but some of the weekend shoppers, cyclists and tourists did stop outside the castle walls. They were treated to a perfect view of the Red Arrows flying overhead as the parade came to an end. It has been a difficult few months for the Queen. A number of those taking part in Trooping the Colour were also involved in the funeral of the Duke of Edinburgh held here in April. On Monday, the Queen will be joined by US President Biden and the first lady for tea. At 95-years-old, the Queen appears to be enjoying a particularly busy weekend. Lt Col Stone, who serves with the Welsh Guards, is Brigade Major Household Division and was also in overall charge of the military arrangements for the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral. It was the Queen's first official birthday without her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, whodied at the age of 99 in April. The event ended with a 41 gun salute and a flypast by the Red Arrows.

Official celebrations of a sovereign's birthday have often been held on a day other than their actual birth date, particularly when the actual birthday has not been in the summer, so that there is better weather for a parade. Meanwhile, heroes of the pandemic have been among those to be recognised inthe Queen's Birthday Honours, with vaccine developer Prof Sarah Gilbert and former chair of the vaccine taskforce Kate Bingham among those to be recognised. On Friday the Queen and other members of the Royal Family were in Cornwall as part of the G7 summit of world leaders. The monarch joined the politicians for a dinner at the Eden Project.

"This video can not be played ""Prime duty of the government to uphold the territorial integrity of the UK"" - Johnson on NI Protocol Boris Johnson says he will do ""whatever it takes"" to protect the territorial integrity of the UK, after talks with EU leaders over Northern Ireland. The prime minister said there had been ""misunderstanding"" on the EU side but said he thought ""pragmatic solutions"" would be found to border issues. Meetings between the two sides took place at the G7 summit in Cornwall. French President Emmanuel Macron said he was willing to ""reset"" UK relations if it honoured the Brexit deal. The disagreement between the UK and the EU is over the implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol, a measure in the Brexit deal which prevents checks on trade across the Irish border. Some checks are taking place on British goods entering Northern Ireland, causing disruption to food supplies. Mr Johnson has held meetings with European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, European Council head Charles Michel, Mr Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel in the margins of the gathering at the Cornish resort Carbis Bay. Gulf remains between UK and EU over Brexit protocol Ahead of the G7, the EU had saidits patience with the UK was ""wearing thin"", after the UK said it was prepared to ignore rules to prevent disruption to trade in Northern Ireland following Brexit. Mr Johnson told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg: ""I think that to be fair there is quite a lot of misunderstanding around the EU about the situation in Northern Ireland, the balance of the Good Friday Agreement, the peace process. ""I was just in a gentle way getting across what that means and I think that we will have some pragmatic solutions.""He added he thought the EU leaders understood ""that it is the prime duty of the UK government to uphold the territorial integrity of the United Kingdom"" and said the government would do ""whatever it takes to ensure that"". In a word: sausages. EU food safety rules don't allow chilled meat products to enter its market from non-members, such as the UK. This has led to the prospect of British sausages - and other meat products - being banned from Northern Ireland. A six-month grace period has been in place since January where the rules don't apply - but that runs out at the end of the month. Talks on what happens next were held between the UK and EU earlier this week, but they broke up without agreement. Find out more about the Northern Ireland Protocol In an interview with Sky News, Mr Johnson said that unless there was a solution he would invoke Article 16 - a measure in the Northern Ireland Protocol which allows either side to take unilateral action. He said: ""I think if the protocol continues to be applied in this way, then we will obviously not hesitate to invoke Article 16, as I have said before."" Downing Street said it was Mr Johnson's desire was to ""work within the existing protocol to find radical and pragmatic solutions"" to Northern Ireland's border issues. By Vicki Young, BBC deputy political editor This deadlock won't get solved during the G7 summit, but it has dominated meetings between the UK and EU in Cornwall. The UK's decision to unilaterally extend the grace period where checks would be waived has already inflamed tensions - with the EU launching legal action against the UK earlier this year. Under the current agreement, Northern Ireland is still bound by a lot of EU rules: so the question is, what will the PM do next? Is he now suggesting that the UK would be willing to suspend the whole thing - and not go along with what was signed before? President Macron has talked about resetting the relationship between the French and the UK - but has stressed it depends on the UK keeping its word over Brexit. So how do leaders find a way through this? Both parties talk about pragmatic solutions to all of this - the trouble is, they don't agree on what they are. Following a trilateral meeting between Mr Johnson, Mrs von der Leyen and Mr Michel in Cornwall, an EU official said that the presidents had said that the rhetoric needed to be toned down and called on the joint committee - made up of negotiators from both sides - to actively look for solutions which are in the protocol. During meetings with the EU leaders, which Brexit minister Lord Frost also attended, the prime minister had ""made clear his desire for pragmatism and compromise on all sides"" but had also underlined that protecting the Good Friday Agreement was paramount, Downing Street said. The spokesman added the protocol as it was currently being implemented was ""having a damaging impact on the people of Northern Ireland"" and said the UK government would ""keep all options on the table"". Previously Downing Street had indicated the UK would be prepared to unilaterally delay the full implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol to prevent a ban on chilled meats crossing the Irish Sea from Great Britain - with restrictions due to come into force at the end of the month. Boris Johnson will also meet European Council head Charles Michel and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen Delaying the checks without agreement from Brussels would risk triggering a trade dispute with the EU. The UK prime minister has previously suggested the EU is taking an ""excessively burdensome"" approach to post-Brexit trading arrangements. Ahead of the G7 summit, Mrs von der Leyen insisted the protocol is the ""only solution"" to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic and must be implemented in full. French President Emmanuel Macron will have talks with UK PM Boris Johnson on Saturday but has said ""nothing is renegotiable"" At a press conference Mr Macron said ""nothing is renegotiable"" and said it was not ""serious to want to review in July what we finalised after years of debate and work in December"". Before US President Joe Biden travelled to Cornwall for the summit his national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the president had ""deep"" concerns that the trade rowcould endanger peace in Northern Ireland. Unionists are strongly opposed to checks in the Irish Sea because they do not want Northern Ireland to be treated differently to the rest of the UK. Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP, and Alliance have said there are problems with the protocol but have argued that the UK and EU must ensure its ""rigorous implementation"". The main agenda of the G7 summit, held in Cornwall, will see leaders of the UK, US, Canada, Japan, France, Germany and Italycommit to a plan to prevent a repeat of the coronavirus pandemic.

"The UK government faces a difficult choice in the next few days. Many people are desperate to see the return to normality promised by the final stage of the roadmap to lifting lockdown. But ministers always said 21 June was not set in stone - and could be affected by changes in the pandemic, including the emergence of new variants. What will they be weighing up as they make their final decision? Here are four key numbers to watch out for in the coming days. There are just under 1,000 people with coronavirus in hospitals in the UK, up about 5% from a low point a week ago. That's far below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January. And NHS Providers say the people who are going in aren't as seriously ill as they were in early waves. They are younger, or don't require intensive care as much - and they're coming out sooner. That means this wave is different, and better, than previous ones but eventually rising admissions will mount up. In the two parts of the UK that are furthest into this ""third wave"", the North West of England and Scotland, the number of people in hospital with coronavirus is rising faster than the rest of the UK. How far and how fast this trend develops depends on how fast infections are rising and how likely you are to get seriously sick with the new variant. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told Parliament on Tuesday that the main type of coronavirus in the UK - the Delta variant first identified in India - is ""at least 40%"" more transmissible than the version that sparked the winter wave - the Alpha variant first seen in Kent. And as Delta takes over, infections are on the rise again. Last week, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggested thatUK infections had risen by 60% in a single week. If that growth rate remains steady or picks up, it suggests that cases will rise pretty quickly if and when society reopens further. We'll learn more on Friday. But rising infections on their own aren't a reason to extend lockdown. The government'skey test,externalis whether rising infections ""risk a surge in hospitalisations which would put unsustainable pressure on the NHS"". And that also depends on your chances of getting seriously ill if you catch coronavirus. When could social distancing end? That is much harder to predict now than it was in the first or second waves, when scientists could predict what proportion of cases would need treatment. That's because vaccines do reduce your chance of getting really sick if you do get infected with any variant. Already we can see thatwhile people who have been double jabbed make up more than 40% of the population, they make up fewer than 5% of people who have been admitted to hospitalwith the Delta variant. But it does look like it takes two doses before someone gets high levels of protection from that variant. So there's a race on: double-jab as many people as possible, before the virus spreads enough to find the vulnerable or to put pressure on the NHS. More than 50% of adults have been given the best protection possible - two doses of the vaccine. That's still a way off herd immunity, even if you add in people who have some immunity from having had coronavirus in the past. Say each infected person would, on average, pass the virus on to six other people in a fully open society that hadn't seen the virus before. Then five out of six people, not just five out of six adults, would need to be able to fight off the virus - that would be the ""herd immunity threshold"". We're not there yet, and it's possible that the threshold is higher as Delta could be more infectious than imagined in this example. But every person vaccinated helps to slow the spread. How many people have been vaccinated so far? To predict what rising infections will mean for the NHS, you need to know how fast cases will rise and how many cases will get really sick. We don't know either figure precisely, and probably won't by 14 June. And a rough estimate doesn't help. The last time UK government modellers made their forecasts, the difference between ""40% more transmissible"" (the orange line below) and ""50% more transmissible"" (the blue line below) made a huge difference to the predicted severity of a third wave. And then, to know what to do about rising cases, you need to predict what effect any change to the rules might have on spread. It's uncertainty piled on uncertainty. To know the cost of that action, you need to know what effect another few weeks of being shut, or trading at a loss, would do to the businesses that are desperate to open up. It's a mammoth task and one that will require some old-fashioned political judgement as well as hi-tech epidemiological models. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

"Aer Lingus is stopping flights from Belfast City Airport to several UK destinations but is offering some passengers a replacement flight. It comes after Stobart Air, which operates Aer Lingus' regional services, including those from Belfast, failed to find a buyer and is being liquidated. Flights to Leeds Bradford, Edinburgh, Exeter, Manchester, East Midlands and Birmingham have been cancelled. Flights from Belfast City Airport to London Heathrow will not be affected. But a planned route between the airport and Newquay - due to start in late June - will be affected. Belfast City Airport said it would work with Aer Lingus to find a way to offer flights on the affected routes Aer Lingus said that all of its customers affected by the cancellations were being offered details of an alternative flight ""where feasible"" and also have the option of a full refund. The company said that of the 12 routes affected by the decision Aer Lingus will operate five routes and for at least the next week and BA City Flyer would operate two. Alternative services for the outstanding routes are still being determined, it said. ""Teams across Aer Lingus have been working through the night progressing alternative flying operations from tomorrow to provide a service for Aer Lingus Regional customers,"" said the airline. The final Aer Lingus regional flight operated by Stobart Air landed at Belfast City Airport on Friday evening Stobart Air also operated a number of routes within the Republic of Ireland for Aer Lingus and flights on those routes have all been cancelled. Aer Lingus was due to replace Stobart Air with a new regional operator next year but it is not clear how quickly it could now start to operate the services. Emerald Airlines was being lined up to take over the contract. Before Aer Lingus announced the replacement schedule, BBC News NI spoke to some of those affected. John Bird, from Newcastle, County Down, was in England to attend a family funeral and was due to return to Northern Ireland from Birmingham on Saturday afternoon. John Bird was in England for a family funeral He said he received a text from Aer Lingus at 08:45 BST, saying the flight was cancelled. ""We have now had to book new flights tomorrow from Manchester at an extra cost of Â£225 plus my son now needs to drive two hours to get us to Manchester,"" he said. ""I then need to get a taxi from Belfast International Airport to Belfast City Airport at a cost of Â£40 to collect my car on the long-term car park. ""I find this situation disgraceful with no help from either airline."" Mr Bird said he could not get through to the airline and added that it was ""shameful"" how passengers had been treated. Ollie Richards does not know if he will be able to bring his daughter to meet her family in NI Ollie Richards is due to fly from Exeter to Belfast on Wednesday, with his wife Janice, who is from Newtownards, County Down, and their five-month-old baby. It is supposed to be the first time their daughter will meet her family in Northern Ireland. He said he found out about the flight cancellations through the media. ""One word: gutted, really, as I'm sure her family will be in Newtownards who we were going to see to show off our little one, who is five months and hasn't been over there yet,"" he told BBC News NI. ""Family members haven't seen her yet - there will be absolute despair, especially among the grandparents who aren't able to get over to us [in Devon]. ""I'm sure they'll be distraught."" Tiffany Logue and Emmet McCracken took a train from Exeter to London from where they will fly to Belfast on Sunday Emmet McCracken and Tiffany Logue were due to travel from Exeter to Belfast City Airport but were sent a text on Saturday morning to say the flight had been cancelled. ""We had to leave our hire car back to Exeter Airport and then get a bus to the train station and now get a train to London to get a flight from London to Belfast tomorrow, back to the City Airport because our car's there,"" Ms Logue said. Mr McCracken added: ""I think we've spent about Â£400 already at this point just on flight changes and train and all sorts of things, a bit of running about and obviously a bit of a stressful morning. ""I actually have a training session tomorrow for part of the Irish MMA squad I'll have to miss, so it's been a real inconvenience."" Another passenger, Christopher from England, who has been in Northern Ireland for a week, arrived at Belfast City Airport on Saturday to be told Stobart Air was no longer flying. Christopher said he was relying on people sending him money to get back home from Belfast ""I have to book another flight back to England but I have to fly to London which is 100 miles away from my home, so it's a big inconvenience,"" he said. ""I'm distressed really, because I've turned up here, I've got no financial means of staying here or getting back to England, so I'm having to rely on people to send money through to me to get home."" In a statement, Aer Lingus said it was informed of the decision late on Friday evening. The airline apologised to its customers ""for the inconvenience caused by the cancellation at such short notice"". ""Aer Lingus is now communicating to customers to advise them of their options for refund or re-booking,"" said the statement. Belfast City Airport said it was informed by Aer Lingus that the operator had ceased operations on Saturday morning. Its chief executive Brian Ambrose said the airport's ""first priority"" was to work with Aer Lingus to ""find a solution and get planes back in the air to serve these popular destinations"". Belfast City Airport urged passengers booked on to the cancelled flights not to travel to the airport and instead to contact Aer Lingus. Aer Lingus to cut up to 500 jobs due to pandemic Ryanair and Aer Lingus cut Belfast flights Aer Lingus review after packed flight complaint Stobart Air staff received an email from the company's managing director on Friday night informing them of the situation. It outlined that Ettyl Limited, a company based in the Isle of Man, had agreed terms with Esken, the owners of Stobart Air, to buy the company. Customers have been urged to contact Aer Lingus However, according to the email, Esken discovered on Thursday evening Ettyl Limited was unable to acquire the company ""on the original terms"" or ""obtain an alternative funding package within the required timescale"". The email stated that Stobart Air was now in the process of appointing a liquidator. Esken is to retain ownership of Carlisle Lake District Airport, which it also owns, but has said it will ""actively explore strategic options for the use of this asset"".

"This video can not be played The Queen tapped her foot as her birthday parade took place in the grounds of Windsor Castle The Queen's official birthday has been marked with a scaled back celebration for a second year due to Covid. This year's Trooping the Colour saw a reduced parade in the grounds of Windsor Castle, rather than in central London, led by the Scots Guards. In 2020 the event was cancelled due to the pandemic witha ceremonial tributeperformed at Windsor by Welsh Guardsman and a band of the Household Division. It comes ahead of the Queen hosting US President Joe Biden on Sunday. The monarch's actual birthday is on 21 April but her official birthday is marked on the second Saturday of June each year. It is traditionally celebrated with a military parade near Buckingham Palace in which the Household Division marches carrying a regimental flag, known as a colour. The Red Arrows also performed a fly past to end the celebrations The event at Windsor Castle replaces the ceremony normally staged in central London The Guardsmen showed their precision marching skills while maintaining a social distance of just over two metres The Duke of Kent - the Queen's cousin - was also present for the ceremony, which saw the F Company Scots Guards troop the colour of the 2nd Battalion Scots Guards through the ranks of guardsmen on parade. The celebration was smaller than normal and has been dubbed a ""mini"" Trooping the Colour. But the military officer in charge of planning the parade said his aim was to create a ""memorable and uplifting day"" for the monarch, who has been based at Windsor during the pandemic. The birthday parade is a gift from the Household Division - the Army's most prestigious regiments Members of the public gathered in Windsor and saw the Red Arrows flypast overhead Crowds lined the Long Walk to watch the Household Cavalry leave Lt Col Guy Stone said: ""Last year we had 85 on parade, this year we've got 274, plus 70 horses, so we're really excited about the event having grown and getting us back to normal for next year we hope. ""It's been very challenging, but we like a challenge. Covid has got a lot to answer for in so many ways, it's made this difficult but what we want to do more than anything is give the Queen a memorable and uplifting day."" Foot tapping along to the music, the Queen took a break from meeting presidents and prime ministers during the G7 summit to attend her birthday parade. It was a scaled down Trooping the Colour - in the grounds of Windsor Castle rather than in central London. The soldiers once again had to carry out their manoeuvres in a socially distanced way but, unlike last year, the mounted regiments were there and gun salutes were fired. Any public hoping to catch a glimpse had been asked to stay away from Windsor town centre - but some of the weekend shoppers, cyclists and tourists did stop outside the castle walls. They were treated to a perfect view of the Red Arrows flying overhead as the parade came to an end. It has been a difficult few months for the Queen. A number of those taking part in Trooping the Colour were also involved in the funeral of the Duke of Edinburgh held here in April. On Monday, the Queen will be joined by US President Biden and the first lady for tea. At 95-years-old, the Queen appears to be enjoying a particularly busy weekend. Lt Col Stone, who serves with the Welsh Guards, is Brigade Major Household Division and was also in overall charge of the military arrangements for the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral. It was the Queen's first official birthday without her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, whodied at the age of 99 in April. The event ended with a 41 gun salute and a flypast by the Red Arrows. This year's Trooping the Colour was on a smaller scale than normal, as shown in 2019's parade This video can not be played What is Trooping the Colour? Official celebrations of a sovereign's birthday have often been held on a day other than their actual birth date, particularly when the actual birthday has not been in the summer, so that there is better weather for a parade. Meanwhile, heroes of the pandemic have been among those to be recognised inthe Queen's Birthday Honours, with vaccine developer Prof Sarah Gilbert and former chair of the vaccine taskforce Kate Bingham among those to be recognised. On Friday the Queen and other members of the Royal Family were in Cornwall as part of the G7 summit of world leaders. The monarch joined the politicians for a dinner at the Eden Project.

"The government is considering whether vaccine passports could be used at big events in future, the BBC understands. A review of the use of the certificates in England is expected to confirm on Monday they will not be compulsory. No formal decision has yet been made but a Whitehall source said they could have a role to play at large events, such as sports matches and concerts. It is thought they could also help to prevent business closures if there was a wave of the pandemic this winter. A committee of MPs has warned ministers against introducing the certificates, saying they would be unjustified and discriminatory. How can I use the NHS app for foreign travel? 'Two-tier society' warning over Covid passports Nightlife venues air concerns over Covid passports People travelling abroad can show they have been vaccinated using the NHS app in England or, in Scotland and Wales, a certificate. There have been suggestions that a similar system showing proof of vaccination or a negative Covid test could be set up domestically to enable parts of the economy to reopen more fully. But the idea has been controversial, with the UK's equality watchdog warning thatit could create a ""two-tier society"". The UK government has been conducting a review for England which is due to report back ahead of Monday's announcement on the roadmap out of restrictions. Immunisation record cards like this could be supplemented with certificates acting as passports to certain events However, the Commons Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee called for the certification to be scrapped, saying it should not be a part of the planned rolling back of restrictions on 21 June. The implementation would ""by its very nature be discriminatory"", MPs said, and there was no justification for their use ""sufficient to counter what is likely to be a significant infringement of individual rights"". The report also said ""conflicting and sometimes contradictory statements"" by ministers on the possibility of introducing certificates ""risked damaging trust in government and in the measures put in place to tackle the pandemic"". Committee chairman William Wragg said: ""We recognise the need to formulate an effective lockdown exit, but Covid passports are not the answer. ""We are entirely unconvinced by the case for their introduction. ""Although it is a tool that is being sold as and built with the intention of being for the universal good, it has the potential to cause great damage socially and economically. ""As vaccine uptake statistics indicate, any Covid certification system will be a discriminator along the lines of race, religion and age."" Cabinet office minister Michael Gove, who is leading the review, previously said the benefits of a vaccine passports scheme were ""finely balanced"". He has visited Israel as part of the process to assess the effectiveness of a similar ""green pass"" scheme deployed in the Middle East country. But he said that if such a scheme proved too costly or too much ""hassle"" for the hospitality industry, then the UK government would not pursue it. The NHS app has already been altered to allow users to prove their vaccine status and Mr Gove said further changes were in the pipeline so test results could be declared as well. WHY DO YOU NEVER SEE A TANNED VAMPIRE?:Scarlett and Scott discuss the undead ""THEY WERE THE ORIGINAL STOCK"":The woman who took on the big companies with links to slavery It comes as the government considersdelaying the lifting of England's remaining Covid restrictions by up to four weeks. There is growing concern over rapidly increasing cases and the higher transmissibility of the Delta variant. On Friday, another 8,125 virus cases were recorded in the UK, according toofficial figures,external, and another 17 people died within 28 days of a positive test.

"Five people who work for or with the Welsh NHS have told the BBC of a ""culture"" of bullying There is a ""culture"" of bullying in the Welsh NHS which leaves people scared to raise issues, several staff have said. NHS workers said they had witnessed or experienced institutionalised racism and sexism and also faced obstacles when reporting incidences of bullying. It is claimed that raising concerns has led to bullying, and numerical targets were often put before staff well-being. The Welsh NHS Confederation said it was ""saddened"" by the allegations and the NHS took bullying reports seriously. The 2020 NHS Wales staff survey found 16% of workers had experienced bullying, harassment or abuse by another colleague, while 10% said they had experienced the same from a manager. Meanwhile, 14% said their health board did not take effective action if staff were bullied or harassed by other members of staff or the public. Doctors 'bullied for raising Covid safety fears' BAME NHS anti-bullying rules 'not fit for purpose' Five whistleblowers who work for or closely with the Welsh NHS have told BBC Wales of their experiences of bullying and harassment within the organisation. Each of them have had their names changed. Oliver, who has worked as a consultant in several different departments, said the culture of bullying was ""recognised"" throughout all health boards in Wales. ""There's a culture of bullying and harassment which is widespread in most NHS organisations,"" he claimed. ""There are pockets of bad cultures and out of those bad cultures you get bullying, harassment and racism - which can be generally unconscious bias - and misogyny. ""The sexism which I've seen with some of my colleagues... it's upsetting to see."" Oliver said things are made difficult for people who choose to speak out about bullying Oliver said the current system for raising concerns could lead to further issues for those who complain, as the person who conducts the investigation within the department is ""generally involved"" in the cause of the complaint. ""This can then make things difficult for those who do speak out,"" Oliver said. ""It's a culture which then doesn't allow people the safety to speak up and say when some things are wrong around patient safety. ""There are certain departments where there are people who are either accidental bullies or determined bullies and will make life difficult for these doctors or nurses who have made these complaints. ""Staff are then worried and scared of raising issues because they think it will affect their career and make their working life harder. ""It's not the same in every organisation, but the staff feel like there are going to be repercussions on their career if they report bullying and harassment."" Record applications for nursing and medicine NHS staff 'pressured' to go back to work Oliver alleges this, in turn, can lead to people prioritising their careers over speaking up about issues, while meeting numerical targets are often prioritised over patient safety. ""Everyone's strapped for resources in the NHS and there's usually bullying around the resources that get utilised,"" he added. He added bullying has caused extra stress for some staff, additional to the fatigue suffered during the coronavirus pandemic. Louise, a nurse, said she recently decided to leave the NHS after several years in her job due to the culture of bullying in her department. She said: ""I've witnessed bullying, very subtle bullying, making your life difficult. ""They don't allow you time off for appointments, to use your annual leave as you wish... just your general treatment in the way they speak to you, it's almost as if 'I'm the manager I'll speak to you how I want'. ""There has been subtle bullying but also quite obvious bullying to the point where everyone sees what's going on, but people are too afraid to speak up. ""When I did speak up my life was made very difficult. I was made to feel quite excluded and it made me feel quite anxious to go into work. That's unusual because I love my job and I love the NHS."" Louise left her job in NHS Wales due to bullying in the department where she worked Louise said meeting targets is often more important to managers than staff well-being. ""Coming from the top down, things are so target orientated now that people will do anything to meet their targets, even if that comes with the consequence of your staff being unhappy,"" she claimed. ""There's no compassion, there's no empathy."" Louise said she felt ""lucky"" she had been able to leave her job and take up a part-time position outside the NHS, but that option was not available to everyone. ""There are many people who are in that job because they have to be in that job, and they've no other choice but to live with this every day, especially those who are not being treated very nicely. ""It's sad, its very sad."" Another consultant, Lloyd, said there needed to be a change in the way complaints were handled, particularly aswaiting lists of more than 500,000 people are tackled. ""It always comes back to bite the person who tries to hurt the system,"" he said. ""Not everyone is brave enough to go and fight the system, so we need people to be able to go to someone in the knowledge it's addressed. ""Things haven't changed. So the background microaggressions, bullying... have not been addressed. ""They will remain, so when the pressure and systems get worse on waiting times and clinics, it will inevitably lead to more microaggressions more pressures on people who've always been under pressure."" Lloyd was told to remove his face mask by a senior manager early in the pandemic Lloyd said there was an example of such behaviour from a senior manager early in the pandemic, when he was told to remove his mask in an office in order to avoid worrying people about the threat of coronavirus. He said: ""I was quite taken aback, I was asking for some help. No-one knew how it was going to be transmitted. We were all trying to take precautions. ""Every day on the Covid ward I thought 'I'm infected'. ""In the midst of that, that behaviour was uncalled for from a senior manager. I was quite upset about it."" Lloyd said this behaviour, in spring 2020, came at a time when he was regularly the only consultant on shift on his Covid ward, while he also showered three or four times each day and slept in a separate room in his house in order to avoid passing the infection on to his family. Amy, an allied health professional, said there was a culture of ""manipulation and intimidation"" at the hospital where she works. ""It seems to be a culture that comes from the top and trickles down and it becomes an acceptable way of treating people,"" she said. Amy added the ""number one thing"" management did was use patients as ""political pawns"" by giving staff little option but to work overtime or in unfavourable conditions in order to ensure patients do not go without care. ""You can't voice your concerns about patient safety, you're always overruled,"" she claimed. ""I have never worked somewhere where staff feel so demoralised. You have got people who worked there for years and years, because they haven't got the confidence to leave because they feel so belittled and downtrodden. ""I feel like a lot of people haveStockholm syndromeand want to leave, but don't feel like they can."" She said staff are asked for feedback, which is often ignored or dismissed, including on one occasion when a staff member was shouted at in front of 50 colleagues in a meeting. Amy said staff were ""downtrodden and demoralised"" at her hospital Amy added: ""The [feedback] forms are never asking about the root cause of the problem, as they'll ask you what your line manager's like or the work environment is like, but that's not the problem. ""When they come back they'll say 'staff are really happy', because they're not addressing the issues, deliberately, I would imagine. ""There have been plenty of instances of one off massively unacceptable behaviour for line managers to staff. ""It's sort of coercion and manipulation and if you don't agree with managers your life is made very difficult. These senior people then employ people who are like-minded."" Mary was diagnosed with a long-term illness more than 10 years ago and relies on the NHS for regular treatment. During this time, she has been asked to give feedback on NHS Wales services, and said she was ""shocked"" by the bullying she has witnessed and experienced. ""What they want for the patient is a rubber stamp,"" she said. ""They want to be seen consulting patients. They don't like answering the hard questions."" Mary said she had been ""ganged up on"" while giving feedback to NHS services She added: ""If the lines are not toed, there's bullying. That applies to all levels and also to patients. ""I can think of two particular occasions where they ganged up on me. That was quite distressing."" Mary said she had also witnessed an incident where a doctor was ""squashed"" by colleagues during a discussion over a treatment plan for a patient. She said: ""That person backed off and said 'I can't go through this, I can't put my family though this'. ""There's no way that person is going to stand up for the patient next time, it's too hard and there's a personal cost."" Due to these instances of bullying, the British Medical Association (BMA) has asked the Welsh government and NHS providers to invest in and establish Freedom to Speak up Guardians in Wales. Specially appointed to report concerns, guardians are already in place in England and Scotland, offering staff the opportunity to speak in confidence. The Welsh NHS Confederation, the body that represents the health service in Wales, said that the allegations were ""very serious and must be addressed"". ""We're unable to comment on individual cases,"" said director Darren Hughes. ""The NHS takes reports of bullying and harassment seriously and we're saddened to hear of the experiences of these individuals. ""We want all staff who work in the Welsh NHS to feel valued, listened to, recognised and supported so that we can all work together to deliver the best possible care to the people of Wales."" Mr Hughes added a number of programmes were in place, developed with trade unions and the Welsh government, while more were being developed as existing procedures were under review. Russell George, who speaks on health for the Welsh Conservatives, said: ""These whistleblower accounts are truly shocking. ""The Welsh government should now invest in and establish Freedom to Speak up Guardians that are already in place in Scotland and England, so Welsh NHS staff have the opportunity to raise concerns in confidence."" The Welsh government previously said it was considering introducing Freedom to Speak Up Guardians. A statement added: ""Any form of discrimination, bullying and harassment within the NHS is entirely unacceptable and we take these matters very seriously.""

"Baku will host Wales' Euro 2020 opener on Saturday Bordeaux and Baku - both cities will forever be associated with the golden age of Welsh football. After this weekend both will have played host to Wales' opening matches in the  European Championships. Wales' journey to the Euro 2016 semi final began in the Bordeaux, France. On Saturday, the Olympic Stadium in Azerbaijan's capital will host Wales' Euro 2020 opener against Switzerland. But the cities aren't just linked by Welsh football. Both signed a twinning agreement over 40 years ago, making them sister cities. On Saturday Baku's Olympic Stadium will host Wales' Euro 2020 opener against Switzerland They also share history as port cities, as centres of culture and a winemaking tradition. Bordeaux has a mythical status among Wales fans who watched their team beat Slovakia 2-1 at Euro 2016. Tens of thousands made the trip and made the city a Welsh enclave for a week in June 2016. You've got to look harder in Baku to find Wales fans ahead of the Euro 2020 opener against Switzerland - but as kick-off approaches several bricks of the 'Red Wall' are assembling in the Azeri capital. National team shirts have been hung in Azerbaijan's capital Both the Football Association of Wales and Welsh Government advised against travel to Baku - Azerbaijan is on the UK Government's Amber travel list. Buthundreds of fans have made the journeyregardless. On Friday afternoon a surge of red flowed through Baku's impressive Heydar Aliyev International Airport as Wales fans decked out in national team colours made their way to Arrivals. Imran Rassid says he is excited to be in Baku Imran Rassid from Bethesda in Gwynedd arrived on Friday afternoon after leaving home on Thursday night.

Freya Powell is relieved to be in Baku Freya Powell was on the same flight: ""It's a massive relief, I committed [to the trip] prior to Covid, everything was booked and ready to go.

"This video can not be played ""Prime duty of the government to uphold the territorial integrity of the UK"" - Johnson on NI Protocol Boris Johnson says he will do ""whatever it takes"" to protect the territorial integrity of the UK, after talks with EU leaders over Northern Ireland. The prime minister said there had been ""misunderstanding"" on the EU side but said he thought ""pragmatic solutions"" would be found to border issues. Meetings between the two sides took place at the G7 summit in Cornwall. French President Emmanuel Macron said he was willing to ""reset"" UK relations if it honoured the Brexit deal. The disagreement between the UK and the EU is over the implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol, a measure in the Brexit deal which prevents checks on trade across the Irish border. Some checks are taking place on British goods entering Northern Ireland, causing disruption to food supplies. Mr Johnson has held meetings with European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, European Council head Charles Michel, Mr Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel in the margins of the gathering at the Cornish resort Carbis Bay. Gulf remains between UK and EU over Brexit protocol Ahead of the G7, the EU had saidits patience with the UK was ""wearing thin"", after the UK said it was prepared to ignore rules to prevent disruption to trade in Northern Ireland following Brexit. Mr Johnson told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg: ""I think that to be fair there is quite a lot of misunderstanding around the EU about the situation in Northern Ireland, the balance of the Good Friday Agreement, the peace process. ""I was just in a gentle way getting across what that means and I think that we will have some pragmatic solutions.""He added he thought the EU leaders understood ""that it is the prime duty of the UK government to uphold the territorial integrity of the United Kingdom"" and said the government would do ""whatever it takes to ensure that"". In a word: sausages. EU food safety rules don't allow chilled meat products to enter its market from non-members, such as the UK. This has led to the prospect of British sausages - and other meat products - being banned from Northern Ireland. A six-month grace period has been in place since January where the rules don't apply - but that runs out at the end of the month. Talks on what happens next were held between the UK and EU earlier this week, but they broke up without agreement. Find out more about the Northern Ireland Protocol In an interview with Sky News, Mr Johnson said that unless there was a solution he would invoke Article 16 - a measure in the Northern Ireland Protocol which allows either side to take unilateral action. He said: ""I think if the protocol continues to be applied in this way, then we will obviously not hesitate to invoke Article 16, as I have said before."" Downing Street said it was Mr Johnson's desire was to ""work within the existing protocol to find radical and pragmatic solutions"" to Northern Ireland's border issues. By Vicki Young, BBC deputy political editor This deadlock won't get solved during the G7 summit, but it has dominated meetings between the UK and EU in Cornwall. The UK's decision to unilaterally extend the grace period where checks would be waived has already inflamed tensions - with the EU launching legal action against the UK earlier this year. Under the current agreement, Northern Ireland is still bound by a lot of EU rules: so the question is, what will the PM do next? Is he now suggesting that the UK would be willing to suspend the whole thing - and not go along with what was signed before? President Macron has talked about resetting the relationship between the French and the UK - but has stressed it depends on the UK keeping its word over Brexit. So how do leaders find a way through this? Both parties talk about pragmatic solutions to all of this - the trouble is, they don't agree on what they are. Following a trilateral meeting between Mr Johnson, Mrs von der Leyen and Mr Michel in Cornwall, an EU official said that the presidents had said that the rhetoric needed to be toned down and called on the joint committee - made up of negotiators from both sides - to actively look for solutions which are in the protocol. During meetings with the EU leaders, which Brexit minister Lord Frost also attended, the prime minister had ""made clear his desire for pragmatism and compromise on all sides"" but had also underlined that protecting the Good Friday Agreement was paramount, Downing Street said. The spokesman added the protocol as it was currently being implemented was ""having a damaging impact on the people of Northern Ireland"" and said the UK government would ""keep all options on the table"". Previously Downing Street had indicated the UK would be prepared to unilaterally delay the full implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol to prevent a ban on chilled meats crossing the Irish Sea from Great Britain - with restrictions due to come into force at the end of the month. Boris Johnson will also meet European Council head Charles Michel and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen Delaying the checks without agreement from Brussels would risk triggering a trade dispute with the EU. The UK prime minister has previously suggested the EU is taking an ""excessively burdensome"" approach to post-Brexit trading arrangements. Ahead of the G7 summit, Mrs von der Leyen insisted the protocol is the ""only solution"" to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic and must be implemented in full. French President Emmanuel Macron will have talks with UK PM Boris Johnson on Saturday but has said ""nothing is renegotiable"" At a press conference Mr Macron said ""nothing is renegotiable"" and said it was not ""serious to want to review in July what we finalised after years of debate and work in December"". Before US President Joe Biden travelled to Cornwall for the summit his national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the president had ""deep"" concerns that the trade rowcould endanger peace in Northern Ireland. Unionists are strongly opposed to checks in the Irish Sea because they do not want Northern Ireland to be treated differently to the rest of the UK. Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP, and Alliance have said there are problems with the protocol but have argued that the UK and EU must ensure its ""rigorous implementation"". The main agenda of the G7 summit, held in Cornwall, will see leaders of the UK, US, Canada, Japan, France, Germany and Italycommit to a plan to prevent a repeat of the coronavirus pandemic.

"Talks have been taking place on the NI Protocol which created a trade border in the Irish Sea As his press conference wore on,Maros Sefcovic sounded increasingly frustrated. The European Commission vice president had spent Wednesday morning in a meeting with Lord Frost, the UK's Brexit Minister. The meeting to discuss the implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol has been described by some sources as ""brutal"" or ""a car crash"". Mr Sefcovic said it had been a very difficult discussion. He told the media that earlier in the process the EU had suggested things the UK could do to simplify export certification for some products going from GB to Northern Ireland. ""Do you think at least one of these things was done?,"" he asked. ""None. Nothing has materialised."" This is typical of how the EU sees the UK's willingness to implement the protocol; moving too slowly and so needlessly exacerbating problems. The UK bristles at this. Writing for the Financial Times this week, Lord Frost said: ""We enforce EU law in Northern Ireland as required. We take no lectures on whether we are implementing the protocol; we are."" But aside from disagreement about operational detail, it is clear there is now a gulf between the two sides on how the protocol should be interpreted. Lord Frost (L) has been discussing border issues with his EU counterpart Maros Sefcovic in central London The protocol was agreed by the UK and EU in October 2019 and was subjected to further negotiation and agreement last year. Its fundamental aim is to prevent a hardening of the land border between the two parts of island. It does that by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods, meaning products arriving from GB need paperwork and some, particularly food, are subject to checks. Government 'knew NI Protocol was bad deal' Can sea border âteething problemsâ be solved? It was well understood in the UK Civil Service, if not among all MPs, that this was going to mean a substantial trade border which would increase cost and complexity for internal UK trade. The text of the protocol contains 40 pages of EU directives and regulations which continue to apply in Northern Ireland. That is the letter of the agreement. But UK ministers are increasingly focused on what they see as the spirit of the agreement. For them, that spirit can be found in the preamble to the protocol where one section reads: ""The application of this protocol should impact as little as possible on the every day life of communities in both Ireland and Northern Ireland."" On that basis, the current range of checks and controls does not come up to the mark and the operational impact of the protocol should be radically changed. Lord Frost put it like this in the Financial Times: ""In 2019 we agreed, as a huge compromise and for the greater good, to control certain goods' movements within our own country and customs territory. ""If that situation is not to be totally unsustainable we need to be able to do so in ways which do not disrupt every day life and which respect everyone's identity and interests."" The EU sees this approach as infuriatingly reductive and an attempt to walk back the whole premise of the agreement. French President Emmanuel Macron robustly articulated that view ahead of the G7 summit. ""We have a protocol,"" he said. ""If, after six months, you say we cannot respect what was negotiated, then that says nothing can be respected. ""I believe in the weight of a treaty, I believe in taking a serious approach. Nothing is negotiable. Everything is applicable."" Despite those tough words, technical talks between EU and UK officials will continue and progress is being made on easing some parts of the protocol. Outside those talks, other well-informed observers continue to offer ideas. Anton Spisak, a former UK Brexit official,has suggested a risk-based scheme which could offer a way to sharply reduce,externalthe need to check goods going from GB-NI. But any scheme of that sort involves the EU investing a large amount of trust in the UK and for now trust is in short supply.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""In order to have a irreversible road map you got to be cautious"" Boris Johnson has said the government must ""be cautious"" as it decides whether to end all Covid restrictions in England on 21 June. Cases are rising as the Delta variant spreads, with details of the next step on the ""roadmap"" due on Monday. The prime minister told the BBC it was important any easing of restrictions was ""irreversible"" and warned that hospital admissions were increasing. The BBC has been told adelay of up to four weeksis being considered. Senior medical advisers have urged a brake to the final easing of lockdown restrictions, which, if it went ahead in full, would mean removing limits on social contact and the number of people allowed into homes. Pubs, clubs, theatres and cinemas would also be allowed to operate without capacity limits, with sports events taking place in full stadiums, nightclubs reopening and limits of the number of wedding guests going. Lockdown lifting - the four key numbers Unvaccinated most at risk from Delta variant What do under 30s need to know about the vaccine? Vaccine passports considered for use at big events Asked by BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg whether all restrictions would now be lifted, Mr Johnson said people would have to wait until Monday to find out. ""What I can certainly say is we are looking at the data, continuing to do that, but what you can certainly take isâ¦ the roadmap was always cautious but irreversible, and in order to have an irreversible roadmap, we've got to be cautious."" A further 7,738 lab-confirmed cases of the virus were reported in the UK on Saturday, and a further 12 people recorded to have died within 28 days of a positive test. Infections continue to rise, with 50% more cases reported in the past seven days than the previous seven. For weeks we've practised modern day kremlinogy - getting our hopes up for an end of restrictions in England at the summer solstice whenever the PM sounds upbeat, then feeling more downhearted when government minister after minister uses the C word: caution. We will get a decision on Monday but it seems clear from Boris Johnson's use of the words ""caution"" and ""irreversible"" in his BBC interview that a delay is inevitable. In order to make his roadmap irreversible, the PM is likely to heed scientific advisers' advice to give himself some more breathing space while the vaccination programme rolls out further. Mr Johnson's mantra has been ""data not dates"" but in truth there may just not be enough data on the extent to which vaccinations are breaking the link between infection and hospitalisation for him to sweep away all remaining restrictions. But sources say the government is looking at a range of options for 21 June. So it's possible that - for example - a four week delay is reviewed after a fortnight when more data is available. Or that some restrictions are eased while most social distancing measures stay in place. The anxious wait for a decision is almost over but it could be that what some describe as 'Freedom Day' - like the horizon - moves further away the closer we appear to get. Answering questions at the G7 summit in Cornwall earlier, chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance would not be drawn on the decision about 21 June, but said the ""Delta variant [is] increasing in the UK"". He said there were lessons from the pandemic that could continue to apply in everyday life - such as self-isolating after symptoms of any infectious disease, the importance of ventilation, and hand hygiene. The Delta variant, first identified in India, now accounts for nine in 10 UK coronavirus cases. It is roughly 60% more transmissible than the Alpha - or Kent - variant, Public Health England data suggests. The government put India on the ""red list"" of places to which travel is banned on 23 April, two weeks later than Pakistan and Bangladesh, which had fewer cases per million at the time. Why was India not on the red list sooner? The prime minister defending the timing of the decision, saying: ""Pakistan had about 13 times as many variants of concern or variants of interest as as India at that stage."" ""Yet we put India on the red list on 23 April, which was days before it was even identified as a variant under investigation."" Mr Johnson, who is currently hosting the G7 summit in Carbis Bay, Cornwall, said the government had made ""a massive progress with the vaccination programme"". ""It's done a huge amount of good - but you have got to be cautious to be irreversible,"" he added. ""Again you have hospitalisations up, you've got cases up. There are grounds for caution."" On Friday, the British Medical Associationjoined public health officialsin calling for a delay to ending restrictions. The government said in February that England's restrictions would only be lifted if: the vaccine rollout continues successfully evidence shows vaccines effectively reduce hospitalisations and deaths in those vaccinated infection rates do not risk a surge in hospitalisations which would put unsustainable pressure on the NHS its assessment of the risks is not fundamentally changed by new variants of concern More than 29 million people in the UK have had both doses of a vaccine - 55.9% of the adult population. The R number in England is estimated to have risen to between 1.2 and 1.4, meaning that, on average, every 10 people with Covid will infect between 12 and 14 others. The easing of restrictions is happening at different speeds across the other nations of the UK with 21 June being given asan ""indicative date"" for a number of changes,externalin Northern Ireland, including 10 people from two households being allowed to meet in private homes, up to 15 people being able to meet outdoors in a garden and theatres and concerts able to restart. Lockdown measures in Wales,externalwill be reviewed on 21 June, while the whole of Scotland is due tomove to level zeroon 28 June - but the prevalence of the Delta variant may delay that.

"G7 leaders seeking to rival China have adopted a plan to support lower- and middle-income countries in building better infrastructure. President Joe Biden said he wanted the US-backed Build Back Better World (B3W) plan to be a higher-quality alternative to a similar Chinese programme. China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has helped finance trains, roads, and ports in many countries. But it has been criticised for saddling some with debt. In a statement at their summit in the English county of Cornwall, the G7 leaders said they would offer a ""values-driven, high-standard and transparent"" partnership. However, details of how the G7 plan will be financed remain unclear. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the group was not yet at a stage to release financing for its initiative. The US has been particularly critical of China's so-called ""debt diplomacy"". The G7, the world's seven wealthiest democracies, have alsocommitted to a new plan to stop future pandemics. The measures include cutting the time needed to develop and license vaccines and treatments for Covid-19 to under 100 days. The plan will be officially unveiled on Sunday, alongside the final summit communique. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is hosting the three-day gathering at the seaside resort of Carbis Bay. How many vaccines are rich countries sharing? In Pictures: G7 leaders meet at the seaside Firepits, scallops and spouses: Carrie Johnson's G7 party The Americans see Saturday's session at the G7 as being about challenging the rise of Chinese influence around the world. Beijing's Belt-and-Road initiative, which has seen billions of dollars poured into developing countries, must be countered by the Western democracies. Senior administration officials want to prove that Western values can prevail. They argue that Chinese investment has come with too high a price tag; that the forced labour of the Uyghur minority in Xinjiang is morally egregious, and economically unacceptable as it prevents fair competition. Global supply chains, Joe Biden will insist, must be free of this kind of labour. US officials say this is not just about confronting China, but about presenting a positive alternative for the world. But the Biden administration has been vague about how much the West would contribute to this global infrastructure plan and over what timescale. What is clear is a renewed determination among Western powers that they need to act now to counter a resurgent and increasingly powerful China. This video can not be played What China's One Belt, One Road really means Earlier this year, the US, the European Union, the UK and Canada introducedco-ordinated sanctions on China. The sanctions, including travel bans and asset freezes, targeted senior officials in Xinjiang who have been accused of serious human rights violations against  Uyghur Muslims. More than a million Uyghurs and other minorities are estimated to have been detained in camps in the north-western province. The Chinese government has been accused of carrying out forced sterilisations on  Uyghur women and separating children from their families. China has created a sprawling network of detention camps for minorities in the Xinjiang region A BBC investigation published in February containedfirst-hand testimony of systematic rape, sexual abuse and torture of detainees. China responded with its own sanctions on European officials. The leaders will issue the Carbis Bay Declaration on Saturday. Its aim is to prevent any repeat of the human and economic devastation wreaked by Covid-19. Globally, more than 175 million people have had the infection since the outbreak began, with over 3.7 million Covid-related deaths, according to America's Johns Hopkins university. The G7 declaration will spell out a series of steps, including: Slashing the time taken to develop and licence vaccines, treatments and diagnostics for any future disease to under 100 days Reinforcing global surveillance networks and genomic sequencing capacity Support for reforming and strengthening the World Health Organization (WHO) The declaration is expected to incorporate recommendations from a report by a group of international experts drawn from across industry, government and scientific institutions. UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres and WHO director Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus will also take part in Saturday's session. Dr Tedros stressed that ""the world needs a stronger global surveillance system to detect new epidemic and pandemic risks"".

"G7 leaders seeking to rival China have adopted a plan to support lower- and middle-income countries in building better infrastructure. President Joe Biden said he wanted the US-backed Build Back Better World (B3W) plan to be a higher-quality alternative to a similar Chinese programme. China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has helped finance trains, roads, and ports in many countries. But it has been criticised for saddling some with debt. In a statement at their summit in the English county of Cornwall, the G7 leaders said they would offer a ""values-driven, high-standard and transparent"" partnership. However, details of how the G7 plan will be financed remain unclear. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the group was not yet at a stage to release financing for its initiative. The US has been particularly critical of China's so-called ""debt diplomacy"". The G7, the world's seven wealthiest democracies, have alsocommitted to a new plan to stop future pandemics. The measures include cutting the time needed to develop and license vaccines and treatments for Covid-19 to under 100 days. The plan will be officially unveiled on Sunday, alongside the final summit communique. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is hosting the three-day gathering at the seaside resort of Carbis Bay. How many vaccines are rich countries sharing? In Pictures: G7 leaders meet at the seaside Firepits, scallops and spouses: Carrie Johnson's G7 party The Americans see Saturday's session at the G7 as being about challenging the rise of Chinese influence around the world. Beijing's Belt-and-Road initiative, which has seen billions of dollars poured into developing countries, must be countered by the Western democracies. Senior administration officials want to prove that Western values can prevail. They argue that Chinese investment has come with too high a price tag; that the forced labour of the Uyghur minority in Xinjiang is morally egregious, and economically unacceptable as it prevents fair competition. Global supply chains, Joe Biden will insist, must be free of this kind of labour. US officials say this is not just about confronting China, but about presenting a positive alternative for the world. But the Biden administration has been vague about how much the West would contribute to this global infrastructure plan and over what timescale. What is clear is a renewed determination among Western powers that they need to act now to counter a resurgent and increasingly powerful China. This video can not be played What China's One Belt, One Road really means Earlier this year, the US, the European Union, the UK and Canada introducedco-ordinated sanctions on China. The sanctions, including travel bans and asset freezes, targeted senior officials in Xinjiang who have been accused of serious human rights violations against  Uyghur Muslims. More than a million Uyghurs and other minorities are estimated to have been detained in camps in the north-western province. The Chinese government has been accused of carrying out forced sterilisations on  Uyghur women and separating children from their families. China has created a sprawling network of detention camps for minorities in the Xinjiang region A BBC investigation published in February containedfirst-hand testimony of systematic rape, sexual abuse and torture of detainees. China responded with its own sanctions on European officials. The leaders will issue the Carbis Bay Declaration on Saturday. Its aim is to prevent any repeat of the human and economic devastation wreaked by Covid-19. Globally, more than 175 million people have had the infection since the outbreak began, with over 3.7 million Covid-related deaths, according to America's Johns Hopkins university. The G7 declaration will spell out a series of steps, including: Slashing the time taken to develop and licence vaccines, treatments and diagnostics for any future disease to under 100 days Reinforcing global surveillance networks and genomic sequencing capacity Support for reforming and strengthening the World Health Organization (WHO) The declaration is expected to incorporate recommendations from a report by a group of international experts drawn from across industry, government and scientific institutions. UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres and WHO director Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus will also take part in Saturday's session. Dr Tedros stressed that ""the world needs a stronger global surveillance system to detect new epidemic and pandemic risks"".

"The action plan will aim to slash the time needed to develop vaccines to under 100 days G7 leaders are to commit to using all their resources in an effort to ensure the devastation caused by a pandemic like Covid-19 is never repeated. On the second day of their summit in Cornwall, they will issue a declaration that sets out a series of measures intended to achieve this. The aim is to slash the time needed to develop vaccines to under 100 days. On Friday,UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson opened the summit with a plea to tackle global inequality. Mr Johnson, who is hosting the three-day gathering at the Cornish seaside resort of Carbis Bay, said it was vital to learn from the ""mistakes"" of the 2008 financial crisis and tackle the ""scar"" of inequality. After Friday's talks, the leaders were joined by the Queen for a dinner at the nearby Eden Project. As they posed for a group photo, the monarch was heard to joke: ""Are you supposed to be looking as if you're enjoying yourself?"" This video can not be played The Queen isn't afraid to lighten the mood at the G7 ""family photo"" The leaders around the Queen laughed, and Mr Johnson replied emphatically: ""Yes."" The prime minister added: ""We have been enjoying ourselves - in spite of appearances."" The G7 (Group of Seven) is an organisation made up of the world's seven largest so-called advanced economies: Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, the UK and the US. Two top EU politicians are also attending the summit. How many vaccines are rich countries sharing? In Pictures: G7 leaders meet at the seaside Firepits, scallops and spouses: Carrie Johnson's G7 party The G7 leaders will issue the Carbis Bay Declaration after a special session on Saturday, which will set out a plan to try to prevent any repeat of the human and economic devastation wreaked by Covid-19. Globally, more than 175 million people have had the infection since the outbreak began, with over 3.7 million Covid-related deaths, according to America's Johns Hopkins university. The G7 declaration will spell out a series of concrete steps, including: Slashing the time taken to develop and licence vaccines, treatments and diagnostics for any future disease to under 100 days Reinforcing global surveillance networks and genomic sequencing capacity Support for reforming and strengthening the World Health Organization (WHO) Before the talks, Mr Johnson said: ""In the last year the world has developed several effective coronavirus vaccines, licensed and manufactured them at pace and is now getting them into the arms of the people who need them. ""But to truly defeat coronavirus and recover we need to prevent a pandemic like this from ever happening again. That means learning lessons from the last 18 months and doing it differently next time around."" The G7 leaders attended a reception at the Eden Project on Friday evening The declaration is expected to incorporate recommendations from a report by a group of international experts drawn from across industry, government and scientific institutions. UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres and WHO director Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus will also take part in Saturday's session. Dr Tedros stressed that ""the world needs a stronger global surveillance system to detect new epidemic and pandemic risks"". Mr Johnson has pledged the UK will donate more than 100 million Covid vaccines to poorer countries within the next year, while Mr Biden promised 500 million doses of Pfizer vaccines to 92 low and middle-income countries and the African Union. But some charities and campaigners have criticised the scale of the UK's plan, under which 5 million doses will be given out by the end of September, with 25 million by the end of 2021 and the rest provided during 2022. Lis Wallace, head of UK advocacy at anti-poverty campaigners One, said it was ""not happening anywhere near fast enough"", and called on Mr Johnson to start sharing doses straight away. And US pop star Selena Gomez told her nearly 65 million Twitter followers that the promise to deliver five million vaccines by the end of September was ""too little too late"". Ms Gomez was among anumber of celebritieswho took part in a concert aimed at increasing access to Covid vaccines in April. Mr Biden also appeared at the event, as did Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. The G7 nations are expected to collectively agree to provide a billion doses of Covid-19 vaccine in an effort to end the pandemic in 2022. The World Health Organization estimates 11 billion doses will be needed to vaccinate the whole world to a level of 70%, the point at which transmission of the virus could be significantly affected.

"This video can not be played The Queen tapped her foot as her birthday parade took place in the grounds of Windsor Castle The Queen's official birthday has been marked with a scaled back celebration for a second year due to Covid. This year's Trooping the Colour saw a reduced parade in the grounds of Windsor Castle, rather than in central London, led by the Scots Guards. In 2020 the event was cancelled due to the pandemic witha ceremonial tributeperformed at Windsor by Welsh Guardsman and a band of the Household Division. It comes ahead of the Queen hosting US President Joe Biden on Sunday. The monarch's actual birthday is on 21 April but her official birthday is marked on the second Saturday of June each year. It is traditionally celebrated with a military parade near Buckingham Palace in which the Household Division marches carrying a regimental flag, known as a colour. The Red Arrows also performed a fly past to end the celebrations The event at Windsor Castle replaces the ceremony normally staged in central London The Guardsmen showed their precision marching skills while maintaining a social distance of just over two metres The Duke of Kent - the Queen's cousin - was also present for the ceremony, which saw the F Company Scots Guards troop the colour of the 2nd Battalion Scots Guards through the ranks of guardsmen on parade. The celebration was smaller than normal and has been dubbed a ""mini"" Trooping the Colour. But the military officer in charge of planning the parade said his aim was to create a ""memorable and uplifting day"" for the monarch, who has been based at Windsor during the pandemic. The birthday parade is a gift from the Household Division - the Army's most prestigious regiments Members of the public gathered in Windsor and saw the Red Arrows flypast overhead Crowds lined the Long Walk to watch the Household Cavalry leave Lt Col Guy Stone said: ""Last year we had 85 on parade, this year we've got 274, plus 70 horses, so we're really excited about the event having grown and getting us back to normal for next year we hope. ""It's been very challenging, but we like a challenge. Covid has got a lot to answer for in so many ways, it's made this difficult but what we want to do more than anything is give the Queen a memorable and uplifting day."" Foot tapping along to the music, the Queen took a break from meeting presidents and prime ministers during the G7 summit to attend her birthday parade. It was a scaled down Trooping the Colour - in the grounds of Windsor Castle rather than in central London. The soldiers once again had to carry out their manoeuvres in a socially distanced way but, unlike last year, the mounted regiments were there and gun salutes were fired. Any public hoping to catch a glimpse had been asked to stay away from Windsor town centre - but some of the weekend shoppers, cyclists and tourists did stop outside the castle walls. They were treated to a perfect view of the Red Arrows flying overhead as the parade came to an end. It has been a difficult few months for the Queen. A number of those taking part in Trooping the Colour were also involved in the funeral of the Duke of Edinburgh held here in April. On Monday, the Queen will be joined by US President Biden and the first lady for tea. At 95-years-old, the Queen appears to be enjoying a particularly busy weekend. Lt Col Stone, who serves with the Welsh Guards, is Brigade Major Household Division and was also in overall charge of the military arrangements for the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral. It was the Queen's first official birthday without her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, whodied at the age of 99 in April. The event ended with a 41 gun salute and a flypast by the Red Arrows. This year's Trooping the Colour was on a smaller scale than normal, as shown in 2019's parade This video can not be played What is Trooping the Colour? Official celebrations of a sovereign's birthday have often been held on a day other than their actual birth date, particularly when the actual birthday has not been in the summer, so that there is better weather for a parade. Meanwhile, heroes of the pandemic have been among those to be recognised inthe Queen's Birthday Honours, with vaccine developer Prof Sarah Gilbert and former chair of the vaccine taskforce Kate Bingham among those to be recognised. On Friday the Queen and other members of the Royal Family were in Cornwall as part of the G7 summit of world leaders. The monarch joined the politicians for a dinner at the Eden Project.

"G7 leaders seeking to rival China have adopted a plan to support lower- and middle-income countries in building better infrastructure. President Joe Biden said he wanted the US-backed Build Back Better World (B3W) plan to be a higher-quality alternative to a similar Chinese programme. China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has helped finance trains, roads, and ports in many countries. But it has been criticised for saddling some with debt. In a statement at their summit in the English county of Cornwall, the G7 leaders said they would offer a ""values-driven, high-standard and transparent"" partnership. However, details of how the G7 plan will be financed remain unclear. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the group was not yet at a stage to release financing for its initiative. The US has been particularly critical of China's so-called ""debt diplomacy"". The G7, the world's seven wealthiest democracies, have alsocommitted to a new plan to stop future pandemics. The measures include cutting the time needed to develop and license vaccines and treatments for Covid-19 to under 100 days. The plan will be officially unveiled on Sunday, alongside the final summit communique. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is hosting the three-day gathering at the seaside resort of Carbis Bay. How many vaccines are rich countries sharing? In Pictures: G7 leaders meet at the seaside Firepits, scallops and spouses: Carrie Johnson's G7 party The Americans see Saturday's session at the G7 as being about challenging the rise of Chinese influence around the world. Beijing's Belt-and-Road initiative, which has seen billions of dollars poured into developing countries, must be countered by the Western democracies. Senior administration officials want to prove that Western values can prevail. They argue that Chinese investment has come with too high a price tag; that the forced labour of the Uyghur minority in Xinjiang is morally egregious, and economically unacceptable as it prevents fair competition. Global supply chains, Joe Biden will insist, must be free of this kind of labour. US officials say this is not just about confronting China, but about presenting a positive alternative for the world. But the Biden administration has been vague about how much the West would contribute to this global infrastructure plan and over what timescale. What is clear is a renewed determination among Western powers that they need to act now to counter a resurgent and increasingly powerful China. This video can not be played What China's One Belt, One Road really means Earlier this year, the US, the European Union, the UK and Canada introducedco-ordinated sanctions on China. The sanctions, including travel bans and asset freezes, targeted senior officials in Xinjiang who have been accused of serious human rights violations against  Uyghur Muslims. More than a million Uyghurs and other minorities are estimated to have been detained in camps in the north-western province. The Chinese government has been accused of carrying out forced sterilisations on  Uyghur women and separating children from their families. China has created a sprawling network of detention camps for minorities in the Xinjiang region A BBC investigation published in February containedfirst-hand testimony of systematic rape, sexual abuse and torture of detainees. China responded with its own sanctions on European officials. The leaders will issue the Carbis Bay Declaration on Saturday. Its aim is to prevent any repeat of the human and economic devastation wreaked by Covid-19. Globally, more than 175 million people have had the infection since the outbreak began, with over 3.7 million Covid-related deaths, according to America's Johns Hopkins university.

"Oxygen cylinders in India, where the more transmissible Delta variant was first seen It is clear we are now dealing with a virus that spreads far more easily - probably more than twice as easily - as the version that emerged in Wuhan at the end of 2019. The Alpha variant, first identified in Kent, UK, performed a large jump in its ability to transmit. Now Delta, seen first in India, leapt further still. This is evolution in action. So are we doomed to a never-ending parade of new and improved variants that get harder and harder to contain? Or is there a limit to how much worse coronavirus can become? It's worth remembering the journey this virus is on. It has made the jump from infecting a completely different species - itsclosest relatives are in bats,external- to us. It's like you, starting a new job: you're competent, but not the finished article. The first variant was good enough to start a devastating pandemic, but now it's learning on the job. When viruses jump to humans it would be ""very rare for them to be perfect,"" said Prof Wendy Barclay, a virologist from Imperial College London. ""They settle in and then they have a great time."" There are examples of viruses, she said, from flu pandemics to Ebola outbreaks, making the jump and then accelerating. So how far could it go? The cleanest way of comparing the pure biological spreading power of viruses is to look at their R0 (pronounced R-naught). It's the average number of people each infected person passes a virus on to if nobody were immune and nobody took extra precautions to avoid getting infected. That number was around 2.5 when the pandemic started in Wuhan and could be as high as 8.0 for the Delta variant, according to disease modellers at Imperial. ""This virus has surprised us a lot. It is beyond anything we feared,"" said Dr Aris Katzourakis, who studies viral evolution at the University of Oxford. ""The fact it has happened twice in 18 months, two lineages (Alpha and then Delta) each 50% more transmissible is a phenomenal amount of change."" It's ""foolish"", he thinks, to attempt to put a number on how high it could go, but he can easily see further jumps in transmission over the next couple of years. Other viruses have far higher R0s and the record holder, measles, can cause explosive outbreaks. ""There is still space for it to move higher,"" said Prof Barclay. ""Measles is between 14 and 30 depending on who you ask, I don't know how it's going to play out."" So, how are the variants doing it? There are many tricks the virus could employ to get better at spreading, such as: improving how it opens the doorway to our body's cells surviving longer in the air increasing the viral load so patients breathe or cough out more viruses changing when in the course of an infection it spreads to another person One way the Alpha variantbecame more transmissible,externalwas by getting better at sneaking past the intruder alarm - called the interferon response - inside our body's cells. But this does not mean that by the time we work through the Greek alphabet of variants and reach Omega that we'll end up with an unstoppable beast. ""Ultimately there are limits and there isn't a super-ultimate virus that has every bad combination of mutations,"" said Dr Katzourakis. There is also the concept of evolutionary trade-offs - in order to become better at one thing you often get worse at something else. The fastest vaccination programme in history will give the virus a different hurdle to overcome and squeeze it in another evolutionary direction. ""It is quite possible that changes in the virus that make it better at avoiding vaccines could end up compromising its ability to transmit in an absolute sense,"" said Dr Katzourakis. He thinks the Beta variant - which has a mutation called E484K that helps evade the immune system but hasn't managed to take off - is an example of this. However, the Delta does have mutations that both help it spread and partially dodge immunity. What will turn out to be the optimal strategy for coronavirus is still hard to predict. Different viruses use different techniques to keep on infecting. Measles is explosive, but leaves behind lifelong immunity so it always has to find someone new. Influenza has a much lower R0, barely above 1, but constantly mutates to side-step immunity. ""We're in a really interesting, intermediate and somewhat unpredictable phase, it is difficult to predict how that's going to play out a year from now,"" said Prof Barclay. One thing that is often claimed, but attracts scientific scorn, is that the virus must get milder in order to spread more easily. There is very little evolutionary pressure on the virus for that to happen. The virus is already off into the next person long before it kills the person it infected. And the people who do the most spreading (younger people) are those who don't get very ill. In rich countries with good vaccination campaigns it is hoped the next variants won't be able to pose a major problem due to widespread immunity. But these progressively more transmissible variants are a nightmare for the rest of the world where they are making it harder and harder to stay on top of Covid.

"The UK government faces a difficult choice in the next few days. Many people are desperate to see the return to normality promised by the final stage of the roadmap to lifting lockdown. But ministers always said 21 June was not set in stone - and could be affected by changes in the pandemic, including the emergence of new variants. What will they be weighing up as they make their final decision? Here are four key numbers to watch out for in the coming days. There are just under 1,000 people with coronavirus in hospitals in the UK, up about 5% from a low point a week ago. That's far below the peak of nearly 40,000 people in January. And NHS Providers say the people who are going in aren't as seriously ill as they were in early waves. They are younger, or don't require intensive care as much - and they're coming out sooner. That means this wave is different, and better, than previous ones but eventually rising admissions will mount up. In the two parts of the UK that are furthest into this ""third wave"", the North West of England and Scotland, the number of people in hospital with coronavirus is rising faster than the rest of the UK. How far and how fast this trend develops depends on how fast infections are rising and how likely you are to get seriously sick with the new variant. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told Parliament on Tuesday that the main type of coronavirus in the UK - the Delta variant first identified in India - is ""at least 40%"" more transmissible than the version that sparked the winter wave - the Alpha variant first seen in Kent. And as Delta takes over, infections are on the rise again. Last week, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggested thatUK infections had risen by 60% in a single week. If that growth rate remains steady or picks up, it suggests that cases will rise pretty quickly if and when society reopens further. We'll learn more on Friday. But rising infections on their own aren't a reason to extend lockdown. The government'skey test,externalis whether rising infections ""risk a surge in hospitalisations which would put unsustainable pressure on the NHS"". And that also depends on your chances of getting seriously ill if you catch coronavirus. When could social distancing end? That is much harder to predict now than it was in the first or second waves, when scientists could predict what proportion of cases would need treatment. That's because vaccines do reduce your chance of getting really sick if you do get infected with any variant. Already we can see thatwhile people who have been double jabbed make up more than 40% of the population, they make up fewer than 5% of people who have been admitted to hospitalwith the Delta variant. But it does look like it takes two doses before someone gets high levels of protection from that variant. So there's a race on: double-jab as many people as possible, before the virus spreads enough to find the vulnerable or to put pressure on the NHS. More than 50% of adults have been given the best protection possible - two doses of the vaccine. That's still a way off herd immunity, even if you add in people who have some immunity from having had coronavirus in the past. Say each infected person would, on average, pass the virus on to six other people in a fully open society that hadn't seen the virus before. Then five out of six people, not just five out of six adults, would need to be able to fight off the virus - that would be the ""herd immunity threshold"". We're not there yet, and it's possible that the threshold is higher as Delta could be more infectious than imagined in this example. But every person vaccinated helps to slow the spread. How many people have been vaccinated so far? To predict what rising infections will mean for the NHS, you need to know how fast cases will rise and how many cases will get really sick. We don't know either figure precisely, and probably won't by 14 June. And a rough estimate doesn't help. The last time UK government modellers made their forecasts, the difference between ""40% more transmissible"" (the orange line below) and ""50% more transmissible"" (the blue line below) made a huge difference to the predicted severity of a third wave. And then, to know what to do about rising cases, you need to predict what effect any change to the rules might have on spread. It's uncertainty piled on uncertainty. To know the cost of that action, you need to know what effect another few weeks of being shut, or trading at a loss, would do to the businesses that are desperate to open up. It's a mammoth task and one that will require some old-fashioned political judgement as well as hi-tech epidemiological models. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

"The government is considering whether vaccine passports could be used at big events in future, the BBC understands. A review of the use of the certificates in England is expected to confirm on Monday they will not be compulsory. No formal decision has yet been made but a Whitehall source said they could have a role to play at large events, such as sports matches and concerts. It is thought they could also help to prevent business closures if there was a wave of the pandemic this winter. A committee of MPs has warned ministers against introducing the certificates, saying they would be unjustified and discriminatory. How can I use the NHS app for foreign travel? 'Two-tier society' warning over Covid passports Nightlife venues air concerns over Covid passports People travelling abroad can show they have been vaccinated using the NHS app in England or, in Scotland and Wales, a certificate. There have been suggestions that a similar system showing proof of vaccination or a negative Covid test could be set up domestically to enable parts of the economy to reopen more fully. But the idea has been controversial, with the UK's equality watchdog warning thatit could create a ""two-tier society"". The UK government has been conducting a review for England which is due to report back ahead of Monday's announcement on the roadmap out of restrictions. Immunisation record cards like this could be supplemented with certificates acting as passports to certain events However, the Commons Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee called for the certification to be scrapped, saying it should not be a part of the planned rolling back of restrictions on 21 June. The implementation would ""by its very nature be discriminatory"", MPs said, and there was no justification for their use ""sufficient to counter what is likely to be a significant infringement of individual rights"". The report also said ""conflicting and sometimes contradictory statements"" by ministers on the possibility of introducing certificates ""risked damaging trust in government and in the measures put in place to tackle the pandemic"". Committee chairman William Wragg said: ""We recognise the need to formulate an effective lockdown exit, but Covid passports are not the answer. ""We are entirely unconvinced by the case for their introduction. ""Although it is a tool that is being sold as and built with the intention of being for the universal good, it has the potential to cause great damage socially and economically. ""As vaccine uptake statistics indicate, any Covid certification system will be a discriminator along the lines of race, religion and age."" Cabinet office minister Michael Gove, who is leading the review, previously said the benefits of a vaccine passports scheme were ""finely balanced"". He has visited Israel as part of the process to assess the effectiveness of a similar ""green pass"" scheme deployed in the Middle East country. But he said that if such a scheme proved too costly or too much ""hassle"" for the hospitality industry, then the UK government would not pursue it. The NHS app has already been altered to allow users to prove their vaccine status and Mr Gove said further changes were in the pipeline so test results could be declared as well.

There is growing concern over rapidly increasing cases and the higher transmissibility of the Delta variant.

"This video can not be played The Queen tapped her foot as her birthday parade took place in the grounds of Windsor Castle The Queen's official birthday has been marked with a scaled back celebration for a second year due to Covid. This year's Trooping the Colour saw a reduced parade in the grounds of Windsor Castle, rather than in central London, led by the Scots Guards. In 2020 the event was cancelled due to the pandemic witha ceremonial tributeperformed at Windsor by Welsh Guardsman and a band of the Household Division. It comes ahead of the Queen hosting US President Joe Biden on Sunday. The monarch's actual birthday is on 21 April but her official birthday is marked on the second Saturday of June each year. It is traditionally celebrated with a military parade near Buckingham Palace in which the Household Division marches carrying a regimental flag, known as a colour. The Red Arrows also performed a fly past to end the celebrations The event at Windsor Castle replaces the ceremony normally staged in central London The Guardsmen showed their precision marching skills while maintaining a social distance of just over two metres The Duke of Kent - the Queen's cousin - was also present for the ceremony, which saw the F Company Scots Guards troop the colour of the 2nd Battalion Scots Guards through the ranks of guardsmen on parade. The celebration was smaller than normal and has been dubbed a ""mini"" Trooping the Colour. But the military officer in charge of planning the parade said his aim was to create a ""memorable and uplifting day"" for the monarch, who has been based at Windsor during the pandemic. The birthday parade is a gift from the Household Division - the Army's most prestigious regiments Members of the public gathered in Windsor and saw the Red Arrows flypast overhead Crowds lined the Long Walk to watch the Household Cavalry leave Lt Col Guy Stone said: ""Last year we had 85 on parade, this year we've got 274, plus 70 horses, so we're really excited about the event having grown and getting us back to normal for next year we hope. ""It's been very challenging, but we like a challenge. Covid has got a lot to answer for in so many ways, it's made this difficult but what we want to do more than anything is give the Queen a memorable and uplifting day."" Foot tapping along to the music, the Queen took a break from meeting presidents and prime ministers during the G7 summit to attend her birthday parade. It was a scaled down Trooping the Colour - in the grounds of Windsor Castle rather than in central London. The soldiers once again had to carry out their manoeuvres in a socially distanced way but, unlike last year, the mounted regiments were there and gun salutes were fired. Any public hoping to catch a glimpse had been asked to stay away from Windsor town centre - but some of the weekend shoppers, cyclists and tourists did stop outside the castle walls. They were treated to a perfect view of the Red Arrows flying overhead as the parade came to an end. It has been a difficult few months for the Queen. A number of those taking part in Trooping the Colour were also involved in the funeral of the Duke of Edinburgh held here in April. On Monday, the Queen will be joined by US President Biden and the first lady for tea. At 95-years-old, the Queen appears to be enjoying a particularly busy weekend. Lt Col Stone, who serves with the Welsh Guards, is Brigade Major Household Division and was also in overall charge of the military arrangements for the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral. It was the Queen's first official birthday without her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, whodied at the age of 99 in April. The event ended with a 41 gun salute and a flypast by the Red Arrows. This year's Trooping the Colour was on a smaller scale than normal, as shown in 2019's parade This video can not be played What is Trooping the Colour? Official celebrations of a sovereign's birthday have often been held on a day other than their actual birth date, particularly when the actual birthday has not been in the summer, so that there is better weather for a parade. Meanwhile, heroes of the pandemic have been among those to be recognised inthe Queen's Birthday Honours, with vaccine developer Prof Sarah Gilbert and former chair of the vaccine taskforce Kate Bingham among those to be recognised. On Friday the Queen and other members of the Royal Family were in Cornwall as part of the G7 summit of world leaders. The monarch joined the politicians for a dinner at the Eden Project.

"Five people who work for or with the Welsh NHS have told the BBC of a ""culture"" of bullying There is a ""culture"" of bullying in the Welsh NHS which leaves people scared to raise issues, several staff have said. NHS workers said they had witnessed or experienced institutionalised racism and sexism and also faced obstacles when reporting incidences of bullying. It is claimed that raising concerns has led to bullying, and numerical targets were often put before staff well-being. The Welsh NHS Confederation said it was ""saddened"" by the allegations and the NHS took bullying reports seriously. The 2020 NHS Wales staff survey found 16% of workers had experienced bullying, harassment or abuse by another colleague, while 10% said they had experienced the same from a manager. Meanwhile, 14% said their health board did not take effective action if staff were bullied or harassed by other members of staff or the public. Doctors 'bullied for raising Covid safety fears' BAME NHS anti-bullying rules 'not fit for purpose' Five whistleblowers who work for or closely with the Welsh NHS have told BBC Wales of their experiences of bullying and harassment within the organisation. Each of them have had their names changed. Oliver, who has worked as a consultant in several different departments, said the culture of bullying was ""recognised"" throughout all health boards in Wales. ""There's a culture of bullying and harassment which is widespread in most NHS organisations,"" he claimed. ""There are pockets of bad cultures and out of those bad cultures you get bullying, harassment and racism - which can be generally unconscious bias - and misogyny. ""The sexism which I've seen with some of my colleagues... it's upsetting to see."" Oliver said things are made difficult for people who choose to speak out about bullying Oliver said the current system for raising concerns could lead to further issues for those who complain, as the person who conducts the investigation within the department is ""generally involved"" in the cause of the complaint. ""This can then make things difficult for those who do speak out,"" Oliver said. ""It's a culture which then doesn't allow people the safety to speak up and say when some things are wrong around patient safety. ""There are certain departments where there are people who are either accidental bullies or determined bullies and will make life difficult for these doctors or nurses who have made these complaints. ""Staff are then worried and scared of raising issues because they think it will affect their career and make their working life harder. ""It's not the same in every organisation, but the staff feel like there are going to be repercussions on their career if they report bullying and harassment."" Record applications for nursing and medicine NHS staff 'pressured' to go back to work Oliver alleges this, in turn, can lead to people prioritising their careers over speaking up about issues, while meeting numerical targets are often prioritised over patient safety. ""Everyone's strapped for resources in the NHS and there's usually bullying around the resources that get utilised,"" he added. He added bullying has caused extra stress for some staff, additional to the fatigue suffered during the coronavirus pandemic. Louise, a nurse, said she recently decided to leave the NHS after several years in her job due to the culture of bullying in her department. She said: ""I've witnessed bullying, very subtle bullying, making your life difficult. ""They don't allow you time off for appointments, to use your annual leave as you wish... just your general treatment in the way they speak to you, it's almost as if 'I'm the manager I'll speak to you how I want'. ""There has been subtle bullying but also quite obvious bullying to the point where everyone sees what's going on, but people are too afraid to speak up. ""When I did speak up my life was made very difficult. I was made to feel quite excluded and it made me feel quite anxious to go into work. That's unusual because I love my job and I love the NHS."" Louise left her job in NHS Wales due to bullying in the department where she worked Louise said meeting targets is often more important to managers than staff well-being. ""Coming from the top down, things are so target orientated now that people will do anything to meet their targets, even if that comes with the consequence of your staff being unhappy,"" she claimed. ""There's no compassion, there's no empathy."" Louise said she felt ""lucky"" she had been able to leave her job and take up a part-time position outside the NHS, but that option was not available to everyone. ""There are many people who are in that job because they have to be in that job, and they've no other choice but to live with this every day, especially those who are not being treated very nicely. ""It's sad, its very sad."" Another consultant, Lloyd, said there needed to be a change in the way complaints were handled, particularly aswaiting lists of more than 500,000 people are tackled. ""It always comes back to bite the person who tries to hurt the system,"" he said. ""Not everyone is brave enough to go and fight the system, so we need people to be able to go to someone in the knowledge it's addressed. ""Things haven't changed. So the background microaggressions, bullying... have not been addressed. ""They will remain, so when the pressure and systems get worse on waiting times and clinics, it will inevitably lead to more microaggressions more pressures on people who've always been under pressure."" Lloyd was told to remove his face mask by a senior manager early in the pandemic Lloyd said there was an example of such behaviour from a senior manager early in the pandemic, when he was told to remove his mask in an office in order to avoid worrying people about the threat of coronavirus. He said: ""I was quite taken aback, I was asking for some help. No-one knew how it was going to be transmitted. We were all trying to take precautions. ""Every day on the Covid ward I thought 'I'm infected'. ""In the midst of that, that behaviour was uncalled for from a senior manager. I was quite upset about it."" Lloyd said this behaviour, in spring 2020, came at a time when he was regularly the only consultant on shift on his Covid ward, while he also showered three or four times each day and slept in a separate room in his house in order to avoid passing the infection on to his family. Amy, an allied health professional, said there was a culture of ""manipulation and intimidation"" at the hospital where she works. ""It seems to be a culture that comes from the top and trickles down and it becomes an acceptable way of treating people,"" she said. Amy added the ""number one thing"" management did was use patients as ""political pawns"" by giving staff little option but to work overtime or in unfavourable conditions in order to ensure patients do not go without care. ""You can't voice your concerns about patient safety, you're always overruled,"" she claimed. ""I have never worked somewhere where staff feel so demoralised. You have got people who worked there for years and years, because they haven't got the confidence to leave because they feel so belittled and downtrodden. ""I feel like a lot of people haveStockholm syndromeand want to leave, but don't feel like they can."" She said staff are asked for feedback, which is often ignored or dismissed, including on one occasion when a staff member was shouted at in front of 50 colleagues in a meeting. Amy said staff were ""downtrodden and demoralised"" at her hospital Amy added: ""The [feedback] forms are never asking about the root cause of the problem, as they'll ask you what your line manager's like or the work environment is like, but that's not the problem. ""When they come back they'll say 'staff are really happy', because they're not addressing the issues, deliberately, I would imagine. ""There have been plenty of instances of one off massively unacceptable behaviour for line managers to staff. ""It's sort of coercion and manipulation and if you don't agree with managers your life is made very difficult. These senior people then employ people who are like-minded."" Mary was diagnosed with a long-term illness more than 10 years ago and relies on the NHS for regular treatment. During this time, she has been asked to give feedback on NHS Wales services, and said she was ""shocked"" by the bullying she has witnessed and experienced. ""What they want for the patient is a rubber stamp,"" she said. ""They want to be seen consulting patients. They don't like answering the hard questions."" Mary said she had been ""ganged up on"" while giving feedback to NHS services She added: ""If the lines are not toed, there's bullying. That applies to all levels and also to patients. ""I can think of two particular occasions where they ganged up on me. That was quite distressing."" Mary said she had also witnessed an incident where a doctor was ""squashed"" by colleagues during a discussion over a treatment plan for a patient. She said: ""That person backed off and said 'I can't go through this, I can't put my family though this'. ""There's no way that person is going to stand up for the patient next time, it's too hard and there's a personal cost."" Due to these instances of bullying, the British Medical Association (BMA) has asked the Welsh government and NHS providers to invest in and establish Freedom to Speak up Guardians in Wales. Specially appointed to report concerns, guardians are already in place in England and Scotland, offering staff the opportunity to speak in confidence. The Welsh NHS Confederation, the body that represents the health service in Wales, said that the allegations were ""very serious and must be addressed"". ""We're unable to comment on individual cases,"" said director Darren Hughes. ""The NHS takes reports of bullying and harassment seriously and we're saddened to hear of the experiences of these individuals. ""We want all staff who work in the Welsh NHS to feel valued, listened to, recognised and supported so that we can all work together to deliver the best possible care to the people of Wales."" Mr Hughes added a number of programmes were in place, developed with trade unions and the Welsh government, while more were being developed as existing procedures were under review. Russell George, who speaks on health for the Welsh Conservatives, said: ""These whistleblower accounts are truly shocking. ""The Welsh government should now invest in and establish Freedom to Speak up Guardians that are already in place in Scotland and England, so Welsh NHS staff have the opportunity to raise concerns in confidence."" The Welsh government previously said it was considering introducing Freedom to Speak Up Guardians. A statement added: ""Any form of discrimination, bullying and harassment within the NHS is entirely unacceptable and we take these matters very seriously.""

"It was the second day of talks at the G7 summit in the resort of Carbis Bay in Cornwall, south-west of England UK PM Boris Johnson tells the BBC his prime duty is to uphold the territorial integrity of the UK, amid a row with the EU over Northern Ireland The UK and EU are in dispute about post-Brexit checks on goods moving from Britain to Northern Ireland The G7 leaders relaxed with a barbecue on the beach during the evening They were entertained by a group singing sea shanties and a flypast from the Red Arrows The UK PM has told EU leaders he wants ""pragmatism and compromise on all sides"", according to Downing Street The leaders have agreed a spending plan for infrastructure investment in developing countries to counter China's growing global influence Kelly-Leigh Cooper and James Clarke We're
ending our live coverage for today, so thanks for joining us. Weâll be back tomorrow
with more news from Cornwall. Todayâs
updates were brought to you by Hugo Bachega, Victoria Lindrea, Dulcie Lee, Jack Hunter and Francesca Gillet. The page was edited by James Clarke and Kelly-Leigh Cooper. G7 leaders discussed theories about the origins of Covid-19 earlier today, according to the head of the World Health Organization (WHO). In recent weeks theclaim that the pandemic may have leaked from a laboratory in Wuhan has gained fresh attention. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus says the leaders ""raised"" the lab-leak hypothesis and agreed to press China for more clarity on the issue. A WHO investigation into the origin of the pandemic has not ruled out any theory behind the outbreak so far. ""We believe that all hypotheses should be open, and we need to proceed to the second phase to really know the origins,"" Dr Tedros said. He said the origins of Covid-19 should be fully investigated out of ""respect"" for the victims of the pandemic. There's nothing like a hard day of diplomatic haggling to work up an appetite. After about six hours of talks today, the G7 leaders and their guests have made their way down to the beach at Carbis Bay for a barbecue. Smoke from the grills is obscuring a clear view of who opted for what - but a number of local delicacies are said to be on the menu. The atmosphere may be relaxed but security is not Family members, including of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, could be seen at the informal event People gathered to watch as the Royal Air Force perform over St Ives This evening the G7 leaders were treated to a display by the RAF's Red Arrows aerobatic team. The jets set off at just after 20:00 BST and looped into an arc shape several times before splitting off. As well as the G7 leaders, members of the public in St Ives looked up to the skies to watch the colourful display, cheering with delight when the jets moved into formation. It's been a busy day for the Red Arrows, whohad already performed a flypast at the Queen's official birthday celebrations earlier today. The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale said that from a diplomatic point of view, events like the Red Arrows help provide a structure around which you can base all the serious politics. ""These leaders are going to summits all the time,"" he said. ""Most of them aren't as much fun as this. They get to bring their partners, there's a bit of a sense of occasion about this."" South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa is among the guests It's not just leaders of the G7 - the group of seven of the world's richest countries - that are at the summit in Cornwall this weekend. The UK invited four other countries as guests - Australia, South Korea, South Africa and India to attend in order to ""deepen the expertise and experience around the table"". Because of the coronavirus crisis, India's prime minister is joining via video conference call. But the other leaders arrived at the summit in person earlier today, along with UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Nomia IqbalBBC News The G7 leaders are enjoying a barbecue beach party and nearby,
so are Ruthie and Tony Goff. The couple live on a clifftop in Carbis Bay which has a
perfect view of the beach where world leaders are tucking into canapÃ©s, scallops and Cornish potatoes. Ruthie and Tony have burgers and sausages on their menu - with lots of wine on hand for their friends. Ruthie says âhaving a barbecue with amazing sunny weather
like this, is the norm for us.... it just happens to be that these world leaders hundreds
of yards away from us are doing the same thing.â Some locals have criticised the summit due to
the heavy security which has hugely restricted movements. But the Goffs are among residents embracing all the attention, with Ruthie describing it as ""amazing"" for the local area. The G7 leaders are gathering on the beach for their ""family photo"" and a beach barbecue. It seems the Red Arrows flypast has also been delayed. We're expecting a flypast over the summit by the RAF Red Arrows in the next few minutes. They will take off from RNAS Culdrose in Helston in Cornwall before flying over the coast east of Penzance and performing stunts over the Carbis Bay beach. But locals in the area are being encouraged not to gather to watch the flyover because of coronavirus restrictions. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

If you're just joining us, Saturday has been another packed day at the G7 summit in Cornwall. World vaccine distribution, the Northern Ireland Protocol and an ambitious infrastructure spending plan have all been among the day's main talking points so far. We're expecting the latest group session to end soon before this evening's events begin, with a beach barbecue and a Red Arrows flypast on the agenda. Demonstrators held Tigray flags at Gyllyngvase beach in Falmouth on Saturday The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, tweeted to say that Tigray was top of the agenda at the G7 summit today. The region of Ethiopia has been devastated by fighting between government forces and rebels, with 1.7 million people displaced since the conflict began in November 2020. Earlier this week Unicef warned thatabout 33,000 children there are now severely malnourished and at high risk of death with many more living in ""severe crisis"". Allow Twitter content?

More now on the spending plan adopted by G7 leaders to rival China - a key issue dominating the agenda this weekend. It's a plan designed to rival China's multi-trillion dollar Belt and Roads initiative, which funds infrastructure in many countries around the world. The G7's Build Back Better World (B3W) plan would offer a ""values-driven, high-standard and transparent"" alternative, the leaders say. But details of how the G7 plan will be funded are not yet clear. Germany's Angela Merkel says the group was not yet ready to release financing for the initiative. The summit this weekend is for the leaders of countries in the G7 - that's the group of seven of the world's richest countries. But some other countries' leaders have also been invited to attend as guests - and Boris and Carrie Johnson have been greeting them today. India's Narendra Modi was also invited but plans to take part via video link due to the coronavirus crisis. South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa laughs as he is greeted at Carbis Bay on Saturday afternoon Under the glorious sunshine, the couple welcomed South Korea""s President Moon Jae-in and first lady Kim Jung-sook Australia's PM Scott Morrison also flew in for the weekend's meeting Andrew SegalBBC South West, at Porthcurno The hush-hush visit of theG7 leadersâ partners to Porthcurnoin Cornwall meant many people who were visiting the village - and there were many, as it is a popular tourist spot - were not aware of what was happening up the hill at the Minack Theatre, a mere quarter of a mile away. Police from a few English forces were around the area, including officers from Bedford, Cambridgeshire and the City of London; and were relaxed while talking to visitors and me about how this was quite different from their usual duties. One officer (not pictured) said he was glad to be out, particularly in Saturdayâs very sunny weather, as heâd spent three days of his G7 deployment âsitting in a car parkâ. Excitement built up as a motorcade returned to the theatre and collected its passengers before they left the village through its narrow roads, with one security official confirming to me (when it was safe to do so) âIt was Dr Biden.â People who found out who it was were left with an interesting story about who passed them while they were in queues for pasties and ice cream. The G7 group of the world's richest nations is set to agreed a plan to stop the world's largest companies avoiding tax by moving their operations between countries. At the moment, a company can choose to put their headquarters in a country with a lower tax rate and take their profits there. For example in 2018, Facebook, which has its international HQ in Dublin, paid Â£28.5m in tax to the UK,although its revenue was Â£1.65bn. Under the G7 deal, companies could be taxed in any country where they make more than 10% profit on sales. Above that point, the company would have to pay 20% tax. Another part of the deal is a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%. This is to stop nations undercutting each other's tax rate to attract multinational companies. Ireland has operated a policy ofattracting US technology companies to set up their headquarters there,chiefly through the offer of a low corporation tax rate of 12.5% (the UK's is 19% and set to rise to 25% by 2023). Along with Facebook, Google has its international headquarters in Dublin's Grand Canal Quay, with TripAdvisor and AirBnB nearby. If the G7 deal goes ahead, the tax advantages which have attracted these companies would cease to exist. In a meeting with UN chief Antonio Guterres at the summit, Boris Johnson has discussed the need for ""joined-up global action"" on climate change and pandemic preparedness, a Downing Street spokesperson says. ""They agreed on the need for countries to step up and make ambitious commitments to cut carbon emissions and phase out the use of coal,"" the spokesperson adds. ""They discussed a number of international issues including the situations in Yemen, Syria and Libya, the Cyprus peace process, the need for a return to democracy in Myanmar and Afghanistan."" US First Lady Jill Biden has joined Carrie Johnson and other partners of G7 summit leaders on a visit to a Cornish clifftop theatre. Their motorcade wound down narrow lanes to reach the Minack Theatre, which overlooks picturesque Porthcurno beach on Cornwall's south coast. The route is notorious for traffic jams as tourists flock to the area in the summer. But with blue lights flashing and a posse of security guards on hand they managed to avoid the heavy traffic faced by holidaymakers. They were there for a special performance by Cornish children about plastic pollution. The local children werenât told about the VIP audience until minutes before the guests arrived. Apparently the players were anxious about misty Cornish weather but they needn't have worried, as there were clear blue skies over the stunning spot. Susie Kersley, who lives locally, says: ""It's amazing, a little bit of excitement and puts Porthcurno on the map."" Friend Miranda Penhaligon adds: ""It was mad, flashing blue lights, loads of cars. ""We are very isolated here and to see all these cars is just ridiculously amazing. ""We are just so excited, it's like a party."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"It was the second day of talks at the G7 summit in the resort of Carbis Bay in Cornwall, south-west of England UK PM Boris Johnson tells the BBC his prime duty is to uphold the territorial integrity of the UK, amid a row with the EU over Northern Ireland The UK and EU are in dispute about post-Brexit checks on goods moving from Britain to Northern Ireland The G7 leaders relaxed with a barbecue on the beach during the evening They were entertained by a group singing sea shanties and a flypast from the Red Arrows The UK PM has told EU leaders he wants ""pragmatism and compromise on all sides"", according to Downing Street The leaders have agreed a spending plan for infrastructure investment in developing countries to counter China's growing global influence Kelly-Leigh Cooper and James Clarke We're
ending our live coverage for today, so thanks for joining us. Weâll be back tomorrow
with more news from Cornwall. Todayâs
updates were brought to you by Hugo Bachega, Victoria Lindrea, Dulcie Lee, Jack Hunter and Francesca Gillet. The page was edited by James Clarke and Kelly-Leigh Cooper. G7 leaders discussed theories about the origins of Covid-19 earlier today, according to the head of the World Health Organization (WHO). In recent weeks theclaim that the pandemic may have leaked from a laboratory in Wuhan has gained fresh attention. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus says the leaders ""raised"" the lab-leak hypothesis and agreed to press China for more clarity on the issue. A WHO investigation into the origin of the pandemic has not ruled out any theory behind the outbreak so far. ""We believe that all hypotheses should be open, and we need to proceed to the second phase to really know the origins,"" Dr Tedros said. He said the origins of Covid-19 should be fully investigated out of ""respect"" for the victims of the pandemic. There's nothing like a hard day of diplomatic haggling to work up an appetite. After about six hours of talks today, the G7 leaders and their guests have made their way down to the beach at Carbis Bay for a barbecue. Smoke from the grills is obscuring a clear view of who opted for what - but a number of local delicacies are said to be on the menu. The atmosphere may be relaxed but security is not Family members, including of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, could be seen at the informal event People gathered to watch as the Royal Air Force perform over St Ives This evening the G7 leaders were treated to a display by the RAF's Red Arrows aerobatic team. The jets set off at just after 20:00 BST and looped into an arc shape several times before splitting off. As well as the G7 leaders, members of the public in St Ives looked up to the skies to watch the colourful display, cheering with delight when the jets moved into formation. It's been a busy day for the Red Arrows, whohad already performed a flypast at the Queen's official birthday celebrations earlier today. The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale said that from a diplomatic point of view, events like the Red Arrows help provide a structure around which you can base all the serious politics. ""These leaders are going to summits all the time,"" he said. ""Most of them aren't as much fun as this. They get to bring their partners, there's a bit of a sense of occasion about this."" South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa is among the guests It's not just leaders of the G7 - the group of seven of the world's richest countries - that are at the summit in Cornwall this weekend. The UK invited four other countries as guests - Australia, South Korea, South Africa and India to attend in order to ""deepen the expertise and experience around the table"". Because of the coronavirus crisis, India's prime minister is joining via video conference call. But the other leaders arrived at the summit in person earlier today, along with UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Nomia IqbalBBC News The G7 leaders are enjoying a barbecue beach party and nearby,
so are Ruthie and Tony Goff. The couple live on a clifftop in Carbis Bay which has a
perfect view of the beach where world leaders are tucking into canapÃ©s, scallops and Cornish potatoes. Ruthie and Tony have burgers and sausages on their menu - with lots of wine on hand for their friends. Ruthie says âhaving a barbecue with amazing sunny weather
like this, is the norm for us.... it just happens to be that these world leaders hundreds
of yards away from us are doing the same thing.â Some locals have criticised the summit due to
the heavy security which has hugely restricted movements. But the Goffs are among residents embracing all the attention, with Ruthie describing it as ""amazing"" for the local area. The G7 leaders are gathering on the beach for their ""family photo"" and a beach barbecue. It seems the Red Arrows flypast has also been delayed. We're expecting a flypast over the summit by the RAF Red Arrows in the next few minutes. They will take off from RNAS Culdrose in Helston in Cornwall before flying over the coast east of Penzance and performing stunts over the Carbis Bay beach. But locals in the area are being encouraged not to gather to watch the flyover because of coronavirus restrictions. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

If you're just joining us, Saturday has been another packed day at the G7 summit in Cornwall. World vaccine distribution, the Northern Ireland Protocol and an ambitious infrastructure spending plan have all been among the day's main talking points so far. We're expecting the latest group session to end soon before this evening's events begin, with a beach barbecue and a Red Arrows flypast on the agenda. Demonstrators held Tigray flags at Gyllyngvase beach in Falmouth on Saturday The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, tweeted to say that Tigray was top of the agenda at the G7 summit today. The region of Ethiopia has been devastated by fighting between government forces and rebels, with 1.7 million people displaced since the conflict began in November 2020. Earlier this week Unicef warned thatabout 33,000 children there are now severely malnourished and at high risk of death with many more living in ""severe crisis"". Allow Twitter content?

"The action plan will aim to slash the time needed to develop vaccines to under 100 days G7 leaders are to commit to using all their resources in an effort to ensure the devastation caused by a pandemic like Covid-19 is never repeated. On the second day of their summit in Cornwall, they will issue a declaration that sets out a series of measures intended to achieve this. The aim is to slash the time needed to develop vaccines to under 100 days. On Friday,UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson opened the summit with a plea to tackle global inequality. Mr Johnson, who is hosting the three-day gathering at the Cornish seaside resort of Carbis Bay, said it was vital to learn from the ""mistakes"" of the 2008 financial crisis and tackle the ""scar"" of inequality. After Friday's talks, the leaders were joined by the Queen for a dinner at the nearby Eden Project. As they posed for a group photo, the monarch was heard to joke: ""Are you supposed to be looking as if you're enjoying yourself?"" This video can not be played The Queen isn't afraid to lighten the mood at the G7 ""family photo"" The leaders around the Queen laughed, and Mr Johnson replied emphatically: ""Yes."" The prime minister added: ""We have been enjoying ourselves - in spite of appearances."" The G7 (Group of Seven) is an organisation made up of the world's seven largest so-called advanced economies: Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, the UK and the US. Two top EU politicians are also attending the summit. How many vaccines are rich countries sharing? In Pictures: G7 leaders meet at the seaside Firepits, scallops and spouses: Carrie Johnson's G7 party The G7 leaders will issue the Carbis Bay Declaration after a special session on Saturday, which will set out a plan to try to prevent any repeat of the human and economic devastation wreaked by Covid-19. Globally, more than 175 million people have had the infection since the outbreak began, with over 3.7 million Covid-related deaths, according to America's Johns Hopkins university. The G7 declaration will spell out a series of concrete steps, including: Slashing the time taken to develop and licence vaccines, treatments and diagnostics for any future disease to under 100 days Reinforcing global surveillance networks and genomic sequencing capacity Support for reforming and strengthening the World Health Organization (WHO) Before the talks, Mr Johnson said: ""In the last year the world has developed several effective coronavirus vaccines, licensed and manufactured them at pace and is now getting them into the arms of the people who need them. ""But to truly defeat coronavirus and recover we need to prevent a pandemic like this from ever happening again. That means learning lessons from the last 18 months and doing it differently next time around."" The G7 leaders attended a reception at the Eden Project on Friday evening The declaration is expected to incorporate recommendations from a report by a group of international experts drawn from across industry, government and scientific institutions. UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres and WHO director Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus will also take part in Saturday's session. Dr Tedros stressed that ""the world needs a stronger global surveillance system to detect new epidemic and pandemic risks"". Mr Johnson has pledged the UK will donate more than 100 million Covid vaccines to poorer countries within the next year, while Mr Biden promised 500 million doses of Pfizer vaccines to 92 low and middle-income countries and the African Union. But some charities and campaigners have criticised the scale of the UK's plan, under which 5 million doses will be given out by the end of September, with 25 million by the end of 2021 and the rest provided during 2022. Lis Wallace, head of UK advocacy at anti-poverty campaigners One, said it was ""not happening anywhere near fast enough"", and called on Mr Johnson to start sharing doses straight away. And US pop star Selena Gomez told her nearly 65 million Twitter followers that the promise to deliver five million vaccines by the end of September was ""too little too late"". Ms Gomez was among anumber of celebritieswho took part in a concert aimed at increasing access to Covid vaccines in April. Mr Biden also appeared at the event, as did Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. The G7 nations are expected to collectively agree to provide a billion doses of Covid-19 vaccine in an effort to end the pandemic in 2022. The World Health Organization estimates 11 billion doses will be needed to vaccinate the whole world to a level of 70%, the point at which transmission of the virus could be significantly affected.

"US lawmakers have introduced five bills aimed at limiting the power held by Big Tech companies. The bills were drafted after a 16-month investigation into the powers of  Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook. They address topics including data, mergers, and the competitive behaviour of these companies - which could ultimately lead to them being forced to sell some assets. But there is not unanimous support for the bills targeting Big Tech. ""Bills that target specific companies, instead of focusing on business practices, are simply bad policy... and could be ruled unconstitutional,"" Neil Bradley from the US Chamber of Commerce said in a statement. The bills will be referred to the House Judiciary Committee before being sent to the House floor. To become law, they must pass through the House of Representatives, the Senate and, finally, be signed by President Joe Biden. David Cicilline, the co-sponsor of the bills and Democratic chair of the Antitrust panel, tweeted a breakdown of the bills which, he says, will, ""strengthen our laws to hold tech monopolies accountable, and build #AStrongerOnlineEconomy"".
