"The 2.2 million people who have been self-isolating in England during the pandemic will no longer need to shield from 1 August. From 6 July, they will be able to meet up outdoors, in a group, with up to five others and form 'support bubbles' with other households. The measures can be eased because infection rates are falling, the government says. Support packages will remain until the end of July to help people transition. Those who are shielding and live alone in England - including single parents who are shielding - will be able to create a support bubble with one other household of any size. This follows the'social bubble' ruleswhich were introduced earlier this month for anyone living alone and single-parent households. People shielding will also be able to meet in groups of up to six outdoors while maintaining social distancing rules. Still shielding: 'The novelty has certainly worn off' Extremely vulnerable people who are most at risk from becoming ill from coronavirus will no longer need to shield in England. That means they can return to work, if they can't work from home, as long as theirworkplace is COVID secure,external. However, they should still follow social distancing guidelines when outside their homes and wash their hands regularly to reduce the risk of being infected. The changes mean those shielding will no longer be eligible for statutory sick pay - unless they develop coronavirus symptoms, or someone they know develops symptoms, and they are told to self-isolate and cannot work from home. Free essential food boxes will stop being delivered, but support from NHS volunteers and local councils is still possible. They will still qualify for priority slots for online shopping and will be offered help with medicine deliveries and getting to medical appointments. The UK government says the advice can be relaxed because the chances of encountering the virus in the community continue to fall - one in 1,700 people are estimated to have the virus now, down from 1 in 500 four weeks ago. The government says it has worked with clinicians, GPs, charities, the voluntary sector and patient groups on the changes. But some charities are criticising the relaxing of the advice, saying many of the people they support do not feel it is safe to stop shielding. Coronavirus: Who should be shielding? ""We know how difficult this period has been and the impact shielding has had on many people's mental health,"" says Dr Jenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer. ""We believe it is the right time to relax some of the advice so people can start to regain a degree of normality once more in their daily lives."" But she added the advice on shielding could change again ""if there are any changes in the rates of infection that could impact on this group"". As the country went into lockdown, around two million peoplewere sent letters by their GPstelling them not to leave home and to avoid contact with others. This was to protect them from the virus because they were considered to be most at risk from Covid-19. Among thelist of people who should be shielding,externalare solid organ transplant recipients, cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, pregnant women with heart disease and people with severe respiratory conditions such as cystic fibrosis and severe asthma. Over half of those shielding are under the age of 70; more than 90,000 are children. Since the start of June, people shielding in England were told they could go out once a day - to meet one person from another household while adhering to social distancing. From the beginning of August, that shielding advice is to be completely relaxed. The NHS will keep the shielded list, in case more advice needs to given to this group in future. This video can not be played Natasha Howard has been campaigning for a ""shielding hour"" Northern Ireland has already said people will no longer need to shield from 31 July. But officials say this pausing of the advice will only happen if the rate of community transmission remains low. People who are shielding and living alone in Northern Ireland willalso be able to form a support bubble from 6 Julywith one other household. Until then, people shielding across the UK are advised to stay at home as much as possible and to practise social distancing when they go outside. In Scotland, the advice applies to around 180,000 people and is in place until at least 31 July. Meanwhile in Wales, almost 130,000 people are shielding and the Chief Medical Officer for Wales saysthe current guidance runs until at least 16 August.,external Have you been shielding?

"Bio-logging devices are trackers fitted to animals, like this Alpine ibex, that record their movements Researchers have launched an initiative to track wildlife before, during and after the coronavirus lockdown. The UK-led team's aim is to study what they have called the ""anthropause"" - the global-scale, temporary slowdown in human activity, which is likely to have a profound impact on other species. Measuring that impact, they say, will reveal ways in which we can ""share our increasingly crowded planet"". They outline the missionin the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution,external. All over the world, some animals have been tracked throughout lockdown They outline ""urgent steps"" to allow scientists to learn as much as possible from the sudden absence of humans in many landscapes - including ensuring that researchers have access and permission to carry out their work, and can gain access to information about human movement, as well as animal-tracking data. Coronavirus: This is not the last pandemic Covid recovery could 'tip the balance' for nature Coronavirus: A hunt for the 'missing link' species Prof Christian Rutz from the University of St Andrews is president of the International Bio-logging Society. He pointed out that bio-loggers - small tracking devices fitted to animals in order to record their movements and other behaviour - have been collecting information in habitats all over the world throughout the pandemic. Tracking whales could also reveal the impact that the ""anthropause"" has had on ocean wildlife ""There is a really valuable research opportunity here, one that's been brought about by the most tragic circumstances, but it's one we think we can't afford to miss,"" he told BBC News. Usually, studies which try to examine the impact of human presence and activity on wild animals are limited to comparing protected habitats to unprotected areas, or studying landscapes in the wake of a natural disaster. Disasters like the one in Chernobyl can become tragic ""natural experiments"" ""But during lockdown we have this replicated around the globe -  in different localities and for habitats where some species have been fitted with tracking devices the whole time,"" said Prof Rutz. There have been many accounts on social media of wildlife apparently making the most of our absence  - moving freely through surprisingly urban settings. In some places though, the lack of human activity appears to have been detrimental -increases in poaching driven by poverty, and the absence of ecotourism. This video can not be played Chernobyl's post-human landscape ""No one's saying that humans should stay in lockdown permanently,"" added Prof Rutz. ""But what if we see major impacts of our changes in road use, for example? We could use that to make small changes to our transport network that could have major benefits."" Prof Jim Smith from the University of Portsmouth has been part of what might be considered the first anthropause study - a long-term investigation into the changes in the abandoned landscape around the damaged Chernobyl nuclear power plant. Chernobyl's wolves returned in the wake of the abandonment of the Exclusion Zone ""Just a few years after the evacuation of the Exclusion Zone, Belarussian and Ukrainian researchers found species associated with humans - like pigeons and rats - were disappearing, but wild animals - wild boar, deer and wolf - were multiplying,"" he said. ""Still abandoned more than 30 years later, the zone has become an iconic example of accidental rewilding."" ""At great economic and human cost, Covid and Chernobyl forcedÂ us to push the pause button on our environmental damage,"" Prof Smith continued. ""Stopping some of those impacts altogether will be hard, but will be helpedÂ by what we can learn from these extreme events."" Prof Rutz and his team pointed out in their paper: ""Scientific knowledge gained during this devastating crisis will allow us to develop innovative strategies for sharing space on this increasingly crowded planet, with benefits for both wildlife and humans.""

"Former chancellor Sajid Javid has warned against a return to austerity as the UK economy struggles with the effects of the coronavirus crisis. In a report by the Centre for Policy Studies, he also called for low taxes on business to aid the UK's recovery. The conservative think tank, which was co-founded by Margaret Thatcher, said this should be based on ""a dynamic private sector and low taxes"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said there will be no return to ""austerity"". However, Labour has said the government should have offered more generous support during the crisis. The report by the Centre for Policy Studies said that a quick economic bounce back from the coronavirus crisis is is unlikely. But it said coronavirus emergency spending measures should be stopped, if possible, by April 2021. It said that polls suggest the UK is ""not ready"" to return to austerity measures introduced by former chancellor George Osborne, ""necessary though they were"". How much will coronavirus cost the UK? Where do governments borrow money? Dozens of people 'chasing every job' in poor areas Instead, the report calls for tax to shift away from profits and incomes and towards reformed property tax and tightening tax reliefs ""which unduly favour the wealthy"". National insurance should be given a ""significant temporary"" reduction to make it cheaper for employers to take on staff. Mr Javid, who resigned from the Treasury in February, said ""early hopes of a V-shaped recovery"" had ""proved optimistic"". He predicted that ""some long-term damage to the economy"" had become ""unavoidable"", with as many as 2.5 million people out of work due to the Covid-19 lockdown. But to speed up the rate of people re-entering employment, Mr Javid argued in the After The Virus report, published on Tuesday, that ministers must make it easier for businesses to hire workers. ""If we want to support and stimulate employment, then axiomatically the best option is to cut the payroll tax - employer's National Insurance,"" Mr Javid said. ""Tax employment less, and all other things being equal you will end up with more of it."" Other recommendations made in the report include temporarily cutting VAT and bringing forward ""shovel ready"" infrastructure projects, with Mr Javid arguing that the ""only way out of this crisis is growth"". He joins fellow former chancellor Alistair Darling in calling for an emergency VAT cut to boost consumer spending, a move undertaken by the Labour peer after the 2008 financial crisis. Mr Javid said: ""If we want to secure the strongest possible recovery, it's essential that no stone is left unturned."" The Labour Party, in areport in March,externalon the economic effects of coronavirus, criticised the government for acting too slowly and said it should underwrite a bigger proportion of wages for those who lose their jobs. 40,000 DEATHS:Could they have been prevented?

"Boris Johnson will announce his plans in Parliament on Tuesday Boris Johnson is expected to announce on Tuesday if the hospitality sector can reopen on 4 July, and that the 2m distancing rule in England will be relaxed, with some conditions. Non-essential shops have reopened in England already, withretail resuming in Walesfrom today. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said England is ""clearly on track"" to further ease lockdown restrictions. But No 10 warned the moves would be reversed if they led to a virus surge. The PM discussed England's approach to the changes with the Covid-19 Strategy Committee on Monday, ahead of an announcement in Parliament on Tuesday. Kuenssberg: Next stage brings new challenges Government to 'bring forward proposals' on 2m rule Tory MPs urge change in 2m social distancing rule Is it safe to relax the 2m rule? Mr Johnson is also expected to announce a reduction in the 2m social distancing rule to 1m, with some mitigating measures. The change to the rule, which follows agovernment review, is expected to come into effect on 4 July. Ministers are also expected to bring forward legislation this week aiming to help businesses cope with social distancing requirements. The PM's spokesman said the Business and Planning Bill would help firms ""adjust to new ways of working, and help them capitalise on the summer months"". Labour MPs have called for ministers to be transparent on the findings of the 2m rule review. Shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth has said the party's support would depend on mitigations being introduced on face-shielding, and testing and tracing. Earlier Security Minister James Brokenshire said the 2m rule review would be informed by scientific evidence but also ""experience around the world as well"". He told BBC Breakfast it was also important to recognise the importance of other factors on safety, such as whether people are indoors or outside, or whether they are wearing face coverings. He added that the review would also take into account the latest understanding of how the virus is transmitted, which ""has evolved over the last number of weeks"". A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? IMPACT:What the virus does to the body RECOVERY:How long does it take? LOCKDOWN:How can we lift restrictions? ENDGAME:How do we get out of this mess? Mr Hancock has suggested that customers may have to register when entering pubs and bars so they can easily be traced if they come into contact with a coronavirus case. Asked on Sunday about plans for registration and ordering drinks through smartphone apps, he said: ""I wouldn't rule it out. It isn't a decision we've taken yet, but there are other countries in the world that take that approach."" He added that he ""very much hoped"" the 2m rule can be lowered, with ""mitigations"" to cut the risk of transmission. The government has come under pressure from the hospitality sector to lower the rule, with many saying it would be impossible to trade under the current restrictions. This video can not be played One and two metre social distancing - what does it look like? Some Tory MPs and members of the hospitality sector have been appealing to the government to lower the 2m rule to 1m, as many venues say they would be unable to open otherwise. The World Health Organization recommends a distance of at least 1m (just over 3ft), but the UK government's scientific advisers say that distance carries up to 10 times the risk of being 2m apart. The other nations of the UK are yet to announce any plans to change the 2m distance rule. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has asked scientific advisors toreview the circumstancesin which it might be reduced alongside ""additional mitigations"". In Northern Ireland, where hotels, bars, restaurants and cafes are set to reopen from 3 July, Economy Minister Diane Dodds has said she isopen to changing it. A change has alsonot been ruled outin Wales - where First Minister Mark Drakeford said he would support a reduction if Welsh advisers said it was safe. This video can not be played Boris Johnson said the government was ""sticking like glue"" to its roadmap In his speech on Tuesday, the PM is expected to warn the public they must continue to follow social distancing guidelines to ""keep the coronavirus under control"". He will also reiterate pledges to use the NHS Test and Trace system to detect and control local outbreaks through ""targeted lockdowns"". A No 10 spokesman said: ""The reason we are able to move forward this week is because the vast majority of people have taken steps to contain the virus. ""The more we open up, the more important it is that everyone follows the social distancing rules. ""We will not hesitate to put the handbrake on to stop the virus running out of control.""

"Dillibe Onyeama was the first black person to complete his studies at Eton The headmaster of Eton College has told the BBC he is ""appalled"" by the racism experienced by the first black person to complete his studies at the prestigious British public school. Nigerian writer Dillibe Onyeama obtained his school-leaving certificate from Eton in 1969. He wrote a book about the racism he experienced at the school and was subsequently banned from visiting. Head Master Simon Henderson said ""we have made significant strides since"". But he acknowledged that there was ""more to do"".

"Tim Cook said it was a ""historic day for the Mac"" Apple has confirmed it will transition its Mac laptop and desktop computers to its own ARM-based processors. The move means that Macs will run on the same type of chips as the firm's iPhones and iPads, rather than Intel's. Intel had faced problems manufacturing its own designs,leading it to issue a public apology to computer-makers,external. Apple's challenge will be to carry off the transition smoothly and convince third-party developers to update their apps accordingly. ""We expect to ship our first Mac with Apple silicon by the end of the year,"" said chief executive Tim Cook, adding that it would likely be two years before its full product line had made the jump. The firm said the move would allow it to offer new features and improved performance as well as making it easier for developers to ""write and optimise software for the entire Apple ecosystem"". The announcement was made at Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). ""Apple's motivations for doing this include reducing its dependence on Intel, maximizing its silicon investment, boosting performance and giving itself more flexibility and agility when it comes to future products,"" commented Geoff Blaber from the consultancy CCS Insight. ""Embracing ARM and making its hardware more consistent across the iPhone, iPad and Mac ranges is a strategic necessity, but there will be inevitable bumps along the road."" MacOS was shown running on the current iPad Pro chip, but the new computers will have processors of their own Apple said it had already developed native versions of several of its own apps, including Final Cut Pro X and Logic Pro.  iPhone and iPad apps will also be able to be run on the computers. Apple said that Microsoft was working on an optimised version of Office, and Adobe was developing a version of Photoshop. Other developers should be able to recompile their apps to get a version running ""in just a matter of days,"" said the company's software chief Craig Federighi. He added that old apps would automatically be translated at point of installation to run, although they would not work as well. To mark the significance of the move, MacOS will move to version 11. Since 2001, it had only moved from 10.0 to 10.15. Apple successfully made the switch from IBM-Motorola's PowerPC processors to Intel's x86 family in 2006. However, some software was never updated and cannot easily be run on today's Mac computers. Apple dropped support for running older software under emulation in the 2011 release of its Mac operating system. Microsoft already allows Windows 10 to be run on both Intel and ARM-based processors and looks set to continue supporting both chip architectures. Apple has not stated how long it will do the same.

As a result, some people considering buying one of its laptop or desktop computers may decide to postpone a purchase until its first ARM-based computers go on sale. This could hit sales both at Apple and the development studios that make software for the platform. ARM-based chips are based on the designs of the UK-based company, which is headquartered in Cambridge. Other companies then adapt these to add capabilities of their own. Samsung, Qualcomm and Huawei are among the many other companies to do so. Apple is the fourth-largest PC vendor, according to market research firm Gartner, coming behind Lenovo, HP, and Dell. The company has said that it has more than 100 million active Mac users. Back in June 2005, when it first announced the move to Intel chips, the figure was about 12.5 million. ""Apple is approximately 4.5% of the laptop market and 2.6% of the desktop market, so the financial impact to Intel will not be significant,"" commented Gartner's Jon Erensen. ""However, this transition... could give momentum to Microsoft's current efforts to run Windows on Qualcomm's Snapdragon processors."" The new version of MacOS, ""Big Sur"", was shown off with design tweaks Existing Mac owners will see changes to the next MacOS operating system - called Big Sur - which Apple said marked its biggest redesign to date. Analysis by James Clayton, North America technology reporter The best way to describe a processor is the brain of the computer. Hardly surprising then that the processor in your computer is kind of important. Changing it is no small thing - and Apple hasn't decided this lightly. The big question though - and the one that if you're reading this you're probably more interested in - is what will this do for Macs in general? The prevailing view in Silicon Valley is moving to Apple silicon will make for more powerful Macs. Bringing it in-house could create cheaper processors - so in theory you could have cheaper Macs (that's if Apple wanted to pass on savings to the consumer). But there are risks too. The first is that Apple still has Intel-based Macs yet to come out. Will people simply wait for Apple's new processor to go live before choosing to buy a new computer? And - considering how well Mac products sell there will be a nervousness about changing a formula that has worked very well for Apple for the last 15 years. Other announcements at WWDC included the ability to use an iPhone as a substitute for a car key by transmitting an NFC (near-field communication) signal to unlock doors and start the engine. This will initially be limited to some new BMWs, but the firm said it intended to expand to other models in time. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

One of the biggest changes to the iPhone's iOS14 operating system will be a shake-up of the home screen. Apps can now be automatically organised into folders containing: suggested apps, which are based on past habits recently downloaded items themed downloads, for example games In addition, the firm is updating its ""widgets"" - blocks that display a stripped-down, small app window - so that they can be placed among the icons for other programs. Examples included weather forecasts, news briefings, and calendar meetings. Android already has something similar. Another Android-like new feature is the introduction of App Clips, which allow part of a program to be downloaded quickly. These must be less than 10 megabytes in size and will be able to be triggered via an NFC-transmission or by scanning a QR code. Suggested uses included the ability to order a drink in a cafe or to pay for a car-parking space. ""App Clips"" are lightweight apps that can be launched easily, without installing, for immediate functionality Apple is also releasing a new app called Translate that carries out language translations offline, offering an alternative to Google Translate. It will support 11 languages to begin with including English, Mandarin, French, German, and Arabic. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Kettering Hospital is investigating whether patients with coronavirus were sent to Cheaney Court Thirty-six people have tested positive for coronavirus at a care home which admitted three patients who later turned out to be infected. Two Kettering General Hospital patients and one from a hospice were described as Covid-negative when admitted to Cheaney House in Desborough, Northamptonshire. However, theylater tested positive for the virus. A spokesperson for the home said all virus ""look likely"" to recover. Of the 36 new cases, 23 are among residents with 13 staff also testing positive. Live updates: Coronavirus and other stories from across the east of England ""We require written confirmation of a negative Covid-19 test before any resident is admitted."" the home said. ""Our policy also ensures that all incoming residents are placed in isolation and are tested again by us. As a result of these precautions we were able to identify three people admitted from NHS facilities in the past month who tested positive. Last week, theLocal Democracy Reporting Servicereported the care home saw paperwork when the patients were admitted between 25 May and 4 June. ""Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, a number of other residents and staff have subsequently tested positive for Covid-19. The majority are now reaching the end of the cycle and medical advice, happily, indicates that everyone looks likely to recover. ""The home is coping extremely well under the circumstances and morale amongst staff and residents alike is very good."" Kettering General Hospital's medical director Andrew Chilton said the hospital worked to guidelines approved by the county's health and social care system and adhered to national guidelines.

"Shoppers have been making the most of the high street in Cardiff, as non-essential shops reopen After months of being closed many shops are opening for the first time and welcoming customers back. From Monday, non-essential stores are able to openfor the first time since coronavirus restrictions were brought in. But with strict social-distancing and hygiene measures in place, shopping will look very different compared to before coronavirus hit. The Welsh Retail Consortium said many shops were ""in a fight for survival"". Sara Jones, of the WRC, said lockdown had cost non-food stores Â£1.7bn a week during April and May, and with sales ""expected to remain weak"", many would not reopen their doors. She told BBC Radio Wales safety was ""the priority"" and that businesses had been working hard to achieve this. ""We just implore that people are considerate to fellow shoppers and people working in store. This video can not be played After months closed many shops are reopening ""Its going to be quite a mixed picture but the most important thing for us is that we have the opportunity to open now. Non-essential shops had been under ""a huge amount of pressure"" and their survival was on ""a wafer thin-edge"", she said. ""And we'll be doing all we can to encourage consumers back into shops safely and hope that confidence can grow in consumers to come back into store."" An initial surge of shoppers would be no guarantee they would stay, Ms Jones said. In some European nations business was brisk initially before dropping back. ""I would expect that to happen for some time here until consumer confidence returns back to almost normal levels,"" she said. Large queues where seen inparts of England after non-essential stores, including clothing shops like Primark, opened on 15 June. Health Minister Vaughan Gething has said he does not want to see a repeat of ""crowds bunched together outside"" when shops reopen in Wales. What do the latest lockdown rules mean? How our towns can meet social distancing rules Quiz: Do you really know Britain's lockdown rules? In Wales, people will only be able to visit non-essential stores if they are near their home -within five miles as a general rule- due to coronavirus regulations. Some retail giants and smaller shops have already confirmed they will not open branches despite being given the green light by the Welsh Government. People joined long queues to get into Ikea in the capital Primark, which does not sell online, has started trading again in England and Northern Ireland, but stores in Scotland and Wales will remain shut for now. The company, which has stores in Cardiff, Newport, Cwmbran, Llanelli, Swansea, Llandudno, Wrexham, said it was still working through plans for reopening and it would only open when it was ""convinced that it is safe and right to do so"". Debenhams has already said its Merthyr Tydfil branch will not reopen as measures are eased, but itsSwansea and Newport stores willafter the councils allowed the chain to defer paying business rates. Staff at some stores have been issued with visors in a bid to keep Covid-19 at bay If you go to your favourite shop from Monday, do not expect business as usual. The WRC said retailers had ""invested significantly in social distancing measures"", in an attempt to make it safe for customers and staff to shop. And with some councils, including Cardiff, alreadyracing to redesign busy high streets, to provide more space for shoppers and outdoor areas, our high streets may never look the same again. Friends snapped selfies of themselves in their masks Measures you could see from Monday include: Screens at pay points and floor markings to show social distancing Extra staff or security on doors to check the number of shoppers going in Socially distanced queuing to get into the store and to pay Staff wearing masks and extra cleaning being carried out Hand sanitiser at entrances and cleaning for baskets and trolleys Some changing rooms closed, while public toilets remain shut Allison Jenkins, from Marks & Spencer, said people will see very different clothing and home departments At Marks and Spencer staff have been working to get stores ready for reopening. While food halls have been open, with social distancing measures in place, clothing and home stores will reopen from Monday. Allison Jenkins, head of Wales and west region for Marks & Spencer, said this had helped them to prepare for reopening the rest of their business. When customers enter stores on Monday they will be given a brief description of where things are, and asked to respect the two metre rule by looking at floor markings. ""Customers will see very different clothing and home departments. There will be a lot less equipment on the shop floor to create an air of confidence,"" she said. ""We can't tell customers not to touch anything but we do ask them to minimise that as much as possible."" Ginevra Croft is getting ready to reopen - with a helping hand from her daughter Ginevra Croft runs a wool shop in Abergavenny, Monmouthshire and is ready to ""crack on with how it's going to be next"". But with shoppers still being told to stay local for another two weeks, she has concerns about how many customers will really come through her doors. ""What's that going to really do to our passing trade?"" she said. ""How busy are we we going to be when we open? How are we going to make it worthwhile for the business to be here with open doors?"" she said. A trip to your favourite shop may look very different to how you remember it In his shop, Richard Barber is preparing for the reopening, measuring out two metre floor markings. But Mr Barber, who runs Nicholls clothing and gifts shop in Abergavenny, said he knew it would be ""hard in the coming months"". ""We are retailers and this is what we do. We've got a really good team behind us,"" he said. ""We're hopeful, but I suppose at the end of the day, realistically, it is going to be tough in the coming months."" This video can not be played Cardiff's arcades are introducing social distancing Non-essential shops have been closed to the public in Wales since lockdown began in late March. Ms Jones, from the WRC, said with fewer customers able to enter stores and fewer expected to head to the high streets due to travel restrictions and safety concerns, many retailers were facing a difficult future. ""Retailers rely on getting customers through their doors in order to pay rent and employees' wages,"" she said. ""With consumer demand expected to remain low for some time, it is vital that businesses of all sizes can access government support to enable them to make adaptions to their stores where necessary,"" she said. Coronavirus: What do the latest lockdown rules say? Lockdown review gives Wales tourism sector 'hope' How our towns can meet social distancing rules On Mondayother changes to lockdown also mean people will be able to travel further than the five-mile general rule,but only on compassionate grounds, to see those who they are worried about. Outdoor sports courts and tracks will open, but only for non-contact sports, people can go to places of workshop for private prayer and non-professional elite athletes can resume training. People will also be able to get married if they adhere to lockdown regulations, stay local and socially distance. Some 190,000 people are employed in retailing and wholesaling in Wales. While many have worked through the pandemic and the return of others will be staggered, it's clear a significant part of the Welsh economy is opening for business today. There was some unhappiness among retailers in Wales about the uncertainty of having no specific reopening date, which there had been in England. But non-essential retailers were given three weeks to prepare ahead of a decision by the Welsh Government and have been allowed to open days after the end of that period. That might give some confidence to other sectors like tourism which has now been given three weeks' notice to prepare for reopening if the right safety measures are in place. But different sectors don't operate in isolation. Shops in tourist areas may now open but they will be affected by the fact the tourism industry is still in lockdown and people are being encouraged not to drive more than five miles.

"Mixer signed exclusive deals with some popular streamers, including Ninja Microsoft has decided to close its Mixer livestreaming service and is partnering with Facebook Gaming instead. Mixer made headlines last year when it signed a reportedly multi-million dollar exclusivity deal with Ninja, a big star on rival platform Twitch. But despite the investment, Microsoft says the platform will close in one month's time. Ninja and other major gamers will no longer be tied to exclusivity deals. Ninja had been signed to Mixer for less than a year. From 22 July, Mixer's website and app will redirect users to Facebook Gaming. As part of the deal, Microsoft will work to bring its xCloud games-streaming service to Facebook. ""This seems quite ruthless, but Microsoft's strategy to reach more gamers is underpinned by its cloud business, not Mixer,"" said Piers Harding-Rolls from the consultancy Ampere Analysis. ""Clearly Facebook has significant reach globally, to expose users to xCloud."" All games-streamers in Mixer's partner programme will be granted partner status on Facebook Gaming if they wish to move to the platform. Facebook reveals Gaming app to rival Twitch YouTube signs three top gamers away from Twitch Streaming star Ninja moves to Microsoft's Mixer ""Ultimately, the success of partners and streamers on Mixer is dependent on our ability to scale the platform for them as quickly and broadly as possible,""Mixer said in a statement,external. ""It became clear that the time needed to grow our own livestreaming community to scale was out of measure with the vision and experiences that Microsoft and Xbox want to deliver for gamers now, so we've decided to close the operations side of Mixer and help the community transition to a new platform."" In a separate blog post,external, Xbox chief Phil Spencer said the transition deal was part of a wider agreement between Xbox and Facebook, with Xbox aiming to introduce gaming features that work on Facebook and Instagram in the future.

"Groups of up to six people in Northern Ireland can meet indoors from Tuesday, the executive has agreed. First Minister Arlene Foster said it would be a ""new milestone"" in NI's journey out of the Covid-19 lockdown. It means Northern Ireland will become the first part of the UK to permit limited indoor gatherings. People will still be required to maintain social distancing when meeting indoors with family and friends. The executive said people were ""strongly advised"" to wear face coverings during indoor gatherings, and the regulations did not extend to overnight visits. Until now, people in Northern Ireland have only been allowed to gather outside in groups of 10 or fewer. Visiting people indoors in their own homes has been limited to adults who live alone, who canform a ""support bubble"" with one other household. In the Republic of Ireland people are already permitted to meet indoors, in groups of up to six. Speaking at the executive's press conference, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the new easement came with ""very strong public health advice"". ""I know the natural human reaction will be to hug each other, but for now distance is still needed to keep people safe,"" she added. Mrs Foster acknowledged people in Northern Ireland had ""weathered a particularly vicious storm"". ""I know many of you have been desperate to visit family and friends in their homes,"" she added. ""As positive as this step is, we cannot stress enough that the battle against Covid-19 is very much still ongoing."" Both the first and deputy first ministers said they also hoped the move would allow ""informal childcare arrangements"" to begin for families again. Indoor visits will not apply to those vulnerable people in Northern Ireland who are shielding, Ms O'Neill said. However from 6 July, shielders can meet outside in groups of up to six, maintaining social distancing. Q&A: What has and has not changed in NI lockdown? Who are we allowed to meet up with? People who are shielding alone will be able to form a support bubble with one other household from 6 July. New letters will be issued to about 95,000 people who are shielding, ahead of a planned ""pause"" in the shielding period, which is due to start from 31 July. Professor Ian Young, chief scientific advisor to the Department of Health, said he was confident people would want to wear face coverings when they understood they would help to protect loved ones when they meet  indoors. He said there may be settings where face coverings will become mandatory in the future but that would be a matter of a policy decision. ""If everyone would do it on a voluntary basis hopefully that will not be necessary,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme. He added that he was not aware of plans to make face coverings mandatory on public transport, but said it was something that would be kept under review. In other developments: Belfast City Council has agreed to waive all fees for pavement cafe licences, with applications now open for cafes, bars and restaurants to use outdoor space for tables and chairs The NI Sports Forum has written to the first and deputy first ministers asking them to take ""urgent action"" to reopen NI's indoor sports facilities Cinema owners in NI are also calling for a reopening date, with multiplexes in the Republic of Ireland set to resume trading from 20 July There will be a phased return of MoT and driver testing services - from 20 July, MoT testing for priority vehicle groups, including taxis and buses due a first time test, and vehicles not previously registered in NI will begin The Republic of Ireland's health authority plans to press ahead withthe launch of a coronavirus contact-tracing app. Two further people with coronavirus have died in the Republic of Ireland, bringing the country's death toll to 1,717 On Monday, ministers also discussed the 2m (6ft) social distancing rule, funding for childcare and school dinners, as well as the use of face coverings. No decision has yet been taken by ministers on whether face coverings on public transport should become mandatory, but Ms O'Neill said the issue was ""under review"". ""The advice remains that we strongly recommend it,"" added the deputy first minister. Social distancing in England is expected to be reduced from 2m to 1m in England from Tuesday, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson due to make an announcement. Mrs Foster said the executive would engage with Westminster officials about the issue, but no agreement had been reached by Stormont ministers. Several of her DUP ministerial colleagues have urged the distance to be reduced, in order to make it more viable for some sectors of the economy to resume trading. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? IMPACT:What the virus does to the body RECOVERY:How long does it take? LOCKDOWN:How can we lift restrictions? ENDGAME:How do we get out of this mess? The executive's announcement on indoor gatherings came as no new coronavirus-related deaths have been reported in Northern Ireland in the past 24 hours. One new confirmed case of the virus has been recorded, taking that total to 4,871. Thetotal number of deaths recorded by the Department of Health,externalin NI remains at 545 - this figure is mostly comprised of hospital deaths and where patients tested positive for the virus. Stormont's statistics agency Nisra releases weekly figures showing fatalities in all settings and by 12 June, itrecorded more than 800 Covid-linked deaths. Meanwhile, with just a week to go before parking and bus lane fines are reintroduced, motorists who break the rules are being issued with ""warnings"" from Monday. On-street parking charges and bus lane enforcement were suspended on 24 March as part of the coronavirus lockdown. But enforcement teams are back on the streets from 22 June to prepare for the return of charges and fines on 29 June. Parking attendants are back on the streets for the first time since March Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said it was part of the economic recovery plan to support businesses. However she acknowledged the return of parking charges and bus lane fines ""may not be popular for some"" but added she had to consider the needs of all road users.

"Boris Johnson will announce his plans in Parliament on Tuesday Boris Johnson is expected to announce on Tuesday if the hospitality sector can reopen on 4 July, and that the 2m distancing rule in England will be relaxed, with some conditions. Non-essential shops have reopened in England already, withretail resuming in Walesfrom today. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said England is ""clearly on track"" to further ease lockdown restrictions. But No 10 warned the moves would be reversed if they led to a virus surge. The PM discussed England's approach to the changes with the Covid-19 Strategy Committee on Monday, ahead of an announcement in Parliament on Tuesday.

Mr Johnson is also expected to announce a reduction in the 2m social distancing rule to 1m, with some mitigating measures. The change to the rule, which follows agovernment review, is expected to come into effect on 4 July. Ministers are also expected to bring forward legislation this week aiming to help businesses cope with social distancing requirements. The PM's spokesman said the Business and Planning Bill would help firms ""adjust to new ways of working, and help them capitalise on the summer months"". Labour MPs have called for ministers to be transparent on the findings of the 2m rule review. Shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth has said the party's support would depend on mitigations being introduced on face-shielding, and testing and tracing. Earlier Security Minister James Brokenshire said the 2m rule review would be informed by scientific evidence but also ""experience around the world as well"". He told BBC Breakfast it was also important to recognise the importance of other factors on safety, such as whether people are indoors or outside, or whether they are wearing face coverings. He added that the review would also take into account the latest understanding of how the virus is transmitted, which ""has evolved over the last number of weeks"". A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? IMPACT:What the virus does to the body RECOVERY:How long does it take? LOCKDOWN:How can we lift restrictions? ENDGAME:How do we get out of this mess? Mr Hancock has suggested that customers may have to register when entering pubs and bars so they can easily be traced if they come into contact with a coronavirus case. Asked on Sunday about plans for registration and ordering drinks through smartphone apps, he said: ""I wouldn't rule it out. It isn't a decision we've taken yet, but there are other countries in the world that take that approach."" He added that he ""very much hoped"" the 2m rule can be lowered, with ""mitigations"" to cut the risk of transmission. The government has come under pressure from the hospitality sector to lower the rule, with many saying it would be impossible to trade under the current restrictions.

Some Tory MPs and members of the hospitality sector have been appealing to the government to lower the 2m rule to 1m, as many venues say they would be unable to open otherwise. The World Health Organization recommends a distance of at least 1m (just over 3ft), but the UK government's scientific advisers say that distance carries up to 10 times the risk of being 2m apart. The other nations of the UK are yet to announce any plans to change the 2m distance rule. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has asked scientific advisors toreview the circumstancesin which it might be reduced alongside ""additional mitigations"". In Northern Ireland, where hotels, bars, restaurants and cafes are set to reopen from 3 July, Economy Minister Diane Dodds has said she isopen to changing it.

"Mixer signed exclusive deals with some popular streamers, including Ninja Microsoft has decided to close its Mixer livestreaming service and is partnering with Facebook Gaming instead. Mixer made headlines last year when it signed a reportedly multi-million dollar exclusivity deal with Ninja, a big star on rival platform Twitch. But despite the investment, Microsoft says the platform will close in one month's time. Ninja and other major gamers will no longer be tied to exclusivity deals. Ninja had been signed to Mixer for less than a year. From 22 July, Mixer's website and app will redirect users to Facebook Gaming. As part of the deal, Microsoft will work to bring its xCloud games-streaming service to Facebook. ""This seems quite ruthless, but Microsoft's strategy to reach more gamers is underpinned by its cloud business, not Mixer,"" said Piers Harding-Rolls from the consultancy Ampere Analysis. ""Clearly Facebook has significant reach globally, to expose users to xCloud."" All games-streamers in Mixer's partner programme will be granted partner status on Facebook Gaming if they wish to move to the platform. Facebook reveals Gaming app to rival Twitch YouTube signs three top gamers away from Twitch Streaming star Ninja moves to Microsoft's Mixer ""Ultimately, the success of partners and streamers on Mixer is dependent on our ability to scale the platform for them as quickly and broadly as possible,""Mixer said in a statement,external. ""It became clear that the time needed to grow our own livestreaming community to scale was out of measure with the vision and experiences that Microsoft and Xbox want to deliver for gamers now, so we've decided to close the operations side of Mixer and help the community transition to a new platform."" In a separate blog post,external, Xbox chief Phil Spencer said the transition deal was part of a wider agreement between Xbox and Facebook, with Xbox aiming to introduce gaming features that work on Facebook and Instagram in the future.

"Foden gives Man City lead with fine strike Mahrez adds second with powerful low drive, third with penalty David Silva pokes in fourth after clever City move Foden gets his second with precise finish Phil Dawkes That is all from us for this evening. Another cracking night for City and another feather in the cap of Phil Foden. For Burnley it is the standard 5-0 loss at the Etihad. One to brush off and go again. What can't be brushed off, though, is what happened above the stadium early in the game. Positive steps have been made but we still have a long way to go. We'll be back tomorrow for Leicester v Brighton and Tottenham v West Ham. Man City 5-0 Burnley Burnley Burnely manager Sean Dyche has been speaking after the game. On the plane banner:""I didnât realise
what had gone on at the beginning. Heard noise. Unacceptable. We can only
apologise. ""I donât know what
the club can do to send a message out. The powers that be will look at the way we can
play our part."" On being without several players whose contracts are expiring:  ""We have everything
we have got. Ashley Barnes and Chris Wood are injured, plus there is Robbie Brady. Club decided to offer
contracts very late in the day. Choice is not to be involved. ""The balance to that is that decisions have to be made. I can only advise. The chairman made a different
decision. ""The players have
asked me a few questions about why certain things have not been done. No lack
of focus about the intention. Group as stretched as it has ever been. These
games do you good. They remind you how serious these teams are. ""I have been here
seven and a half years. Never been an easy ride with finance. It is not my
first rodeo. The club has a restricted and stringent look at finance. We have
had a healthy return but the chairman makes the decisions. I can only advise. ""Life at Burnley is
tough at times. We are in very good shape financially. The decisions have been late.
That has affected the situation."" Man City 5-0 Burnley Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola, speaking to Sky Sports:""We played really well. Solid performance especially in the beginning. We had to be patient and give permission to ourselves to go into positions to attack more comfortable and make the transitions. The first goal and second helped us a lot. We are so close close to playing in the Champions League next season. On Phil Foden:""I remember some games in the cup when he played similar. I am happy for him and he says what he feels. ""I said many times when he played he never played bad. He loves to play football. When he had day off he is with his friends with the ball. Every time he played with us he always played at a high level. But he is 20 years old and he needs to improve. He will be an important player for this club for the next decade. He deserves it. He is a joy to watch."" On a proper send-off for David Silva:""We are going to when it is possible to have people back to the Etihad to try and have not one empty seat for this incredible legend. With Joe Hart, Vincent Kompany, Yaya Toure, Pablo Zabaleta - these players bring these players to another level and they deserve real fireworks. David is unique in the small spaces. ""In this position, when David says it is his last year I spoke with the board that we have Phil (Foden) so we don't have to invest."" On Sergio Aguero's injury:""It doesn't look good. Something in the knee and we will see tomorrow. He felt something in his knee. He struggled in the last month with some pain in his knee."" As appalling as it is to see the banner flown over the Etihad tonight, the response from both Ben Mee and his club has been impressive. There was a time when players weren't as vocal on issues outside the game. But the unity and strong stance on this is very positive. Burnley defender Ben Mee, speaking to Sky Sports:""It was a tough night. We can talk about football but there is something  I would like to speak about first - the plane at the beginning of the game. I am ashamed and embarrassed that a small number of our fans have decided to fly that around the stadium. Completely misses the point. The group of lads in the changing room are embarrassed to see that. It is not what we are about. They have missed what we are trying to achieve. These people need to come into the 21st century and educate themselves. They don't represent what we are about, the club is about, the players are about and the majority of fans are about. ""AS we were coming out we heard some whispers that it was going to happen. The club tried to stop it. I've heard it is a small number that have arranged this and I hope it doesn't happen again. I don't want to associate it with my club. I don't want to see this in the game. ""It is not right. We totally condemn it. These people can learn and be taught what the Black Lives Matter movement is trying to achieve. ""The players have pulled together and this is what we want, what the majority of fans want - equality in society and in football, everything, be it race, religion, gender, LGBTQ community. ""The players have pulled together and we want to make a stand against this for all minorities."" Man City 5-0 Burnley Former Manchester City defender Micah Richards, speaking on
Sky Sports about a banner which flew over the stadium before kick-off with the words ""White Lives Matter - Burnley"":âItâs so disheartening. After how far weâve come in these last
couple of weeks it really does hurt me. ""I agree everyone should have free speech but when it looked like everything was
on the up thereâs a small fraction who want to ruin it. I donât want to make
a big thing of it and Iâd like to hope itâs a small percentage. ""Itâs so disheartening. After how far weâve come in these last
couple of weeks it really does hurt me."" Man City 5-0 Burnley Pat NevinFormer Chelsea and Scotland winger on BBC Radio 5 Live It was not in doubt after the second goal, it finished it and worryingly for Burnley Manchester City had more gears to move in to. We saw some fantastic play and the pick of the players? Phil Foden. He stood out as the best player on the pitch but he had everything about his game, good energy and runs with the ball but also the eye of a pass which all City players have. As an outsider, I would build my team around him, not just City but England too. If it was Spain, they would make him the core of the team early on. I watch Chelsea who have a lot of good young players, but Foden is extraordinary and has the vision that not others have. Man City 5-0 Burnley Man City midfielder Phil Foden, speaking to Sky Sports:""It is always good to play a part. I am enjoying my football. The main thing is getting the result and how the team are playing. We are sharp. ""It is down to the whole team wanting to work hard. No matter who the manager puts in they do a job."" On scoring from corners:""We have a set-piece coach and have been working hard on short corners and defending as well so it is good when it comes off."" On his pass for the David Silva goal:""We worked on the set-piece to draw players out as well so I already knew where to play the pass. I am just glad it came off. ""I'd like to think that was my best game in a City shirt. I am still learning every day but I am happy to put performances in like that."" On replacing David Silva:""How he plays today, he is unbelievable. I don't want to think about it. I am just enjoying playing with him. He is a legend of the game."" Man City 5-0 Burnley Simon StoneBBC Sport at the Etihad Stadium Manchester City midfielder Phil Foden was named man of the match after scoring twice. But he also left the pitch wearing a rather large ice pack on his left thigh. City play next at Chelsea on Thursday. Man City 5-0 Burnley John MurrayBBC Radio 5 Live commentator The last four results here for Burnley now read 4-1 3-0, 5-0, 5-0, 5-0. One way traffic. Man City 5-0 Burnley Brilliant City making it two wins out of two since the restart and three 5-0 victories on the bounce against Burnley. Mahrez got two but it was another man with a brace to his name - Phil Foden - who really starred tonight. He's staking his claim now. Poor Burnley barely got a kick. Man City 5-0 Burnley Pat NevinFormer Chelsea and Scotland winger on BBC Radio 5 Live It is painful to some degree. Burnley have not stopped trying but the game was over for a long time. James Tarkowski came to the side of the pitch for a word with manager Sean Dyche and they both started laughing, how often do you see that at 5-0 down? It is not that they don't care, they understand. Mn City 5-0 Burnley Joao Cancelo's low cross is gathered by Pope as we move into the first of two minutes of added time. Man City 5-0 Burnley Probably not the dream debut Max Thompson would have wished for. But it remains a significant moment for the young lad. He replaces Matej Vydra, shortly after Bernardo Silva sees a first-time shot in the box blocked before it can test Pope. Man City 5-0 Burnley No, it's not De Bruyne who hits it. He is in attendance but allows Sane to have a pop. The winger's effort goes straight into the wall, though. Man City 5-0 Burnley Ben Mee has had a rough night. He is done by Jesus on the edge of the box and has no choice but to stick a leg out and bring the forward down. De Bruyne free-kick incoming... Man City 5-0 Burnley Simon StoneBBC Sport at the Etihad Stadium Leroy Sane makes his first appearance since suffering a cruciate knee ligament injury during the Community Shield in August. On Friday, Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola said Sane had refused to sign a new contract and wants to join another club. Bayern Munich are thought to be Sane's preferred destination but he still has another year left on his contract, so there is no guarantee the Germany winger will get his wish this summer. Man City 5-0 Burnley You can only imagine the standing ovation Foden would have got from the Etihad had it been populated with fans tonight. His fine work is done, with Leroy Sane replacing him. Sane, as you'll probably know, has had an injury-plagued season, coupled with his contract situation rumbling away in the background. He has 10 minutes here to try and add something. Man City 5-0 Burnley De Bruyne looks for Jesus in the box with a low ball into the corridor of uncertainty, but it is just a fraction ahead of the striker. Soon after, Rodri fires an effort from range straight down Pope's throat. Man City 5-0 Burnley Pat NevinFormer Chelsea and Scotland winger on BBC Radio 5 Live I remember covering Manchester City at Watford and it was 6-0, it could have been 11-0 or 12-0 and I do not think Watford played badly. I just felt so sorry for them. I would not say Burnley have been a disgrace today, they have worked hard and could lose 7-0, but player for player they are so far behind. It is just about the quality. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.9999995
"From 6 July those in England most vulnerable to the virus will have more freedom to see other people UK government reviewing whether 2m rule on social distancing in England should be reduced to 1m Greatest threat is not the virus itself but lack of global solidarity and leadership - WHO World Health Organization records highest one-day increase in total cases, with 183,000 added in one day Most came from Brazil, followed by the US and India South Korea is going through a ""second wave"" of coronavirus, officials say, even though new infections are falling France is re-opening cinemas, swimming pools and holiday centres. All children up to 15 are back at school Globally, there have been almost 9m confirmed cases since the outbreak began, with 467,000 deaths Edited by Rob Corp We're bringing our rolling coverage of the pandemic to a close until tomorrow morning. Thank you for joining us. It's been a busy day. To recap, here are some of the top headlines. Today's live page reporters were: Vicky Baker, Henri Astier, Alexandra Fouche, Ashitha Nagesh, Hamish Mackay, Mary OâConnor, Max Matza, Emma Harrison and Gavin Stamp. The editors were Thomas Poole and Rob Corp. Before we sign off our live coverage for the day, here are the main UK headlines. The Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils, has called for a ""plan"" for vulnerable households affected by news of an end to shielding for people in England from 1 August. From 6 July, the 2.2 million people who have been self-isolating at home will be able to meet up outdoors, in a group, with up to five others and form ""support bubbles"" with other households. Cllr Ian Hudspeth, chairman of the LGA's community wellbeing board, said the UK government's announcement provided ""much-need clarity"" for those who've been shielding, adding that ""clear communication"" was ""vital"" for people to adjust to the changes and councils' ability to support them. But he said a ""plan is needed"" to help people who can't afford access to priority supermarket delivery slots when the provision of emergency food parcels finishes and to support those whose ""wellbeing has suffered as a result of prolonged isolation"". Mexico has announced a deal to resume sending temporary farm workers to Canada to help with summer planting and harvesting. Canada and Mexico ""reached an agreement to improve sanitary conditions of the nationals who work on farms"", the Mexican foreign ministry said. Canada relies on about 60,000 temporary migrant labourers - mostly from Latin America and the Caribbean - to help with chronic employment shortages in the agricultural industry. Last week, Mexico said it would hit the ""pause button"" on sending about 5,000 workers to Canada after at least two of its nationals died after contracting Covid-19 on farms. The Rath Yatra in Puri in 2017 - before social distancing India's Supreme Court will allow an annual Hindu festival to go ahead in the city of Puri, in Odisha state, on Tuesday - but in a ""restricted manner"". The Lord Jagannath Rath Yatra festival had previously been banned because of the coronavirus. But central and state governments argued that it should go ahead without public participation, saying it could be broadcast on TV instead. Since the Supreme Court's decision, officials in Puri shut the city down, imposing a curfew that will stay in place until Wednesday. This is so the festival can go ahead without the public taking part. The festival involves a procession with Hindu idols in large chariots. It usually attracts huge crowds. Grigor Dimitrov (centre) sat with Alexander Zverev and Novak Djokovic during the first Adria Tour event in Belgrade last week As professional tennis tours have been put on pause until at least August, a number of domestic and regional exhibition tournaments between players based in the same part of the world have sprung up. But the Balkans-based Adria Tour event set up by world number one Novak Djokovic has drawn criticismafter two players tested positive for Covid-19. The latest critic is British men's number one Dan Evans, who says Djokovic should ""feel some responsibility"" after players Grigor Dimitrov and Borna Coric tested positive for the virus. Dimitrov played Coric on Saturday in the second leg of the world number one's event in Zadar, Croatia - where players were not obliged to observe social distancing rules after a lockdown easing there. Evans, 30, thinks Djokovic - who is awaiting the results of his Covid test - has some questions to answer. ""Put it this way, I don't think you should be having a players' party and then dancing all over each other,"" Evans said. ""He should feel some responsibility in his event and how it's transpired."" The first leg of the tour in Serbia concluded with players dancing close together in a Belgrade nightclub. Meanwhile, Britain's Sir Andy Murray says it has been a ""lesson for us all"" to take the situation ""extremely seriously"". Organisers said Sunday's final in Zadar has been cancelled ""as a precaution"" and insisted epidemiological measures in each nation where matches were played were ""strictly followed"" at all times. Health officials in the Netherlands have announced there were no new coronavirus deaths in the last 24 hours - the first time the country's daily death toll has been zero since the beginning of March. There were, however, 69 new infections. The Netherlands started easing its lockdown on 13 May, and officials said it would continue to be eased in phases until 1 September. The country's total death toll is 6,090, and there have been 49,658 cases. White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany has denied that President Trump ordered a slowdown of virus testing. It comes after Trump commented during a rally in Oklahoma over the weekend that the ""bad part"" of testing is that ""you're going to find more cases"". ""So I said to my people, slow the testing down please."" But the White House on Monday denied that Trump's comments reflected an actual presidential order. âAny suggestion that testing has been curtailed is not rooted in fact,â McEnany said on Monday. âIt was a comment that he made in jest,â she added.

On a call to state governors on Monday, Vice-President Mike Pence defended Trump's remark as ""a passing observation"". But in an interview on Monday, Trump declined to say that he had not ordered testing to be slowed. ""If it did slow down - frankly, I think weâre way ahead of ourselves, if you want to know the truth,â he told Scripps television. âWeâve done too good of a job. The reason we have more cases is because we do more testing.â Banff National Park previously received around 4m visitors per year The Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Alberta, has fined six American nationals who were found sneaking into Banff National Park. Non-essential travel between the US and Canada is prohibited until 21 July, but some Americans have been allowed to cross the border as long as they are en route to the US state of Alaska, - a more than 1,000 mile (1,600km) drive from Canada's southern border. But to be allowed into Canada, Americans must promise to remain in their cars as much as possible, avoid hotels and shops and forgo any unnecessary stops. The C$1,200 fines ($880, Â£700) were issued near the Lake Louise area of the park to Americans who had stopped to hike. Ashitha NageshBBC News, London Children across the UK are developing mental health conditions, including post-traumatic stress, because of the pandemic, a charity has warned. As well as anxiety about their loved ones' health, many children are facing social isolation and hunger, the Childhood Trust says. Children in poverty who don't have the internet at home are effectively shut out of online lessons while schools are closed. Few are able to access therapy. Teachers warn this will lead to entrenched inequalities between them and classmates from more affluent families. Read the full story here. Another 23 deaths have been reported in the last 24 hours in France, bringing the country's total death toll up to 29,663. The French health ministry also says the number of people in hospital has gone down by 130, and is now 9,693. Schools in the country reopened today for pupils up to the age of 15. Earlier this month, President Emmanuel Macron declared France had won its ""first victory"" against the coronavirus, before announcing the greatest lifting of lockdown measures in the country so far. As we heard earlier, the 2.2 million clinically extremely vulnerable people in England who have been self-isolating at home from coronavirus for the past three months will no longer need to do this from 1 August. From 6 July, they will be able to meet up to six people outdoors and form ""support bubbles"" with other households. At the beginning of lockdown, the BBC's Joe Lee spoke to some of those shielding to see how they felt about avoiding all close contact for 12 weeks. He's now gone back to ask how they feel about the prospect of rejoining the wider world - with some varying responses. Michael Winehouse, a charity fundraiser who has cystic fibrosis, has been shielding at home with his wife and their four-year-old son. He said shielding had ""certainly worked"" for people with his condition, but now the ""novelty"" had worn off, he was looking forward to doing normal things like doing a shop or seeing family and friends. ""I can't live inside forever"", he says, ""I'm just going to have to risk assess every situation, avoid those places where bugs are likely to linger."" You can read Joe's full piece here. Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent Next year's A-levels and GCSEs in England could be pushed back later into the summer to allow more teaching time,says Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. This would allow schools to catch up some of the time lost since the lockdown. Mr Williamson told MPs he would be consulting the exam regulator Ofqual about extra time to deliver courses. It follows a similar proposal announced for exams in Scotland. England's education secretary, speaking in the House of Commons, said he wanted to find a way to ""add more teaching time"". The total number of cases worldwide has now exceeded nine million, according to the count kept by the US-based Johns Hopkins University. It says the exact number of global infections is 9,003,042. A total of 469,122 people have now died. Advice in Wales asking people vulnerable to coronavirus to self-isolate has not changed, the Welsh Government has said. It issued the statement afterUK ministers announced the tapering of the precautions in England, where people will no longer need to shield from 1 August. From 6 July, people in England will be able to meet up to six people outdoors and form 'support bubbles' with other households. But in Wales, shielding advice remains in place until 16 August. The advice includes people who have received organ transplants, those on immuno-suppressant drugs, and pregnant women. You can read more here. Reality Check The R number refers to the reproduction rate of the virus. If the R is below 1, the spread of infection is slowing but if itâs above 1 itâs speeding up. Across the UK, the R is between 0.7â0.9 and the number is falling day to day by between 2-4%, according to the latest government data. In Germany, where the lockdown was eased earlier than in the UK, the R number has jumped to 2.88 as of Sunday, according to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), the countryâs leading public health body. As recently as Friday, Germanyâs R number was estimated to be as low as 1.06, but it increased significantly after an outbreak at a meat processing plant in the north-west of the country led to more than 1,500 workers being infected with Covid-19. However, the RKI has cautioned that the jump in the R rate does not show an imminent threat of a second wave nationwide and is instead âmainly related to local outbreaksâ. âSince case numbers in Germany are generally low, these local outbreaks have a relatively strong influence on the value of the reproduction number,â the RKI said in a statement. Read more about how the R number is calculated here. Reality Check Health Secretary Matt Hancock was asked at today's Downing Street briefing about what employment protections would be in place for people shielding who might not be able to return to work. An estimated 627,000 âclinical extremely vulnerableâ people normally work, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Almost 40% of these individuals are working from home and another 40% are furloughed or receiving self-employment support. Most of the people furloughed say they would not be able to work from home. However, 17% of those people who normally work have said they have stopped working and not receiving support from job retention schemes. A small amount of people - 5% - said they were currently working outside of the home. It does not tell us what financial support those not receiving job retention payments are getting. The estimates are based on surveys conducted between 28 May and 3 June. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent The pausing of shielding in England from 1 August will affect more than two million people. And it was interesting that, if shielding needs to be
resumed, Dr Jenny Harries felt it was likely to be imposed in a more targeted
form â with very few children asked to shield in future. ""Only"" 36 children had been admitted to an intensive care
unit with Covid-19. But while the topic of todayâs press conference was
health-related, this was also about the economy and getting people back in to employment. From 1 August those who are shielding and
canât work from home will be able to return to work if their business is ""covid
secure"". Good news for many. But for those who are anxious about returning, then itâs
likely they will no longer be eligible for the statutory sick pay they have
been given since April. Giving people the confidence to return to work is still a
challenge for the government. As
     is getting parents to send children back to school. The health secretary also underlined that to get the economy
moving, infrastructure projects will be ""accelerated"". And at this time of year, minds turn to holidays and not
just work. So Matt Hancock sought to reassure us that the government
was ""working very intensively"" on ""travel corridors"" - though the quarantine policy as a whole was unlikely to be
withdrawn. In case you missed today's government coronavirus briefing, here is a quick round-up of the key points: The last question is about the risk of infection hotspots in the north-east of England and whether economic deprivation or care home policies in the region have contributed to the large number of cases in places such as Bishop Auckland, Blythe Valley and North West Durham. In response, Hancock says those living in the region have made ""enormous sacrifices"" in recent months and the result is that the R number is under one there and cases are falling. He says the government will look into regional anomalies and stresses that the levelling-up agenda that the Conservatives emphasised at the last election is even more important going forward, with what he describes as the ""more even distribution of opportunity of wealth and health"". Harries says people in the North East should be ""careful and cautious"" as they go forward, but not anxious.  Â© 2025 BBC.

"Kettering Hospital is investigating whether patients with coronavirus were sent to Cheaney Court Thirty-six people have tested positive for coronavirus at a care home which admitted three patients who later turned out to be infected. Two Kettering General Hospital patients and one from a hospice were described as Covid-negative when admitted to Cheaney House in Desborough, Northamptonshire. However, theylater tested positive for the virus. A spokesperson for the home said all virus ""look likely"" to recover. Of the 36 new cases, 23 are among residents with 13 staff also testing positive. Live updates: Coronavirus and other stories from across the east of England ""We require written confirmation of a negative Covid-19 test before any resident is admitted."" the home said. ""Our policy also ensures that all incoming residents are placed in isolation and are tested again by us. As a result of these precautions we were able to identify three people admitted from NHS facilities in the past month who tested positive. Last week, theLocal Democracy Reporting Servicereported the care home saw paperwork when the patients were admitted between 25 May and 4 June. ""Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, a number of other residents and staff have subsequently tested positive for Covid-19. The majority are now reaching the end of the cycle and medical advice, happily, indicates that everyone looks likely to recover. ""The home is coping extremely well under the circumstances and morale amongst staff and residents alike is very good."" Kettering General Hospital's medical director Andrew Chilton said the hospital worked to guidelines approved by the county's health and social care system and adhered to national guidelines.

"The 2.2 million people who have been self-isolating in England during the pandemic will no longer need to shield from 1 August. From 6 July, they will be able to meet up outdoors, in a group, with up to five others and form 'support bubbles' with other households. The measures can be eased because infection rates are falling, the government says. Support packages will remain until the end of July to help people transition. Those who are shielding and live alone in England - including single parents who are shielding - will be able to create a support bubble with one other household of any size. This follows the'social bubble' ruleswhich were introduced earlier this month for anyone living alone and single-parent households. People shielding will also be able to meet in groups of up to six outdoors while maintaining social distancing rules. Still shielding: 'The novelty has certainly worn off' Extremely vulnerable people who are most at risk from becoming ill from coronavirus will no longer need to shield in England. That means they can return to work, if they can't work from home, as long as theirworkplace is COVID secure,external. However, they should still follow social distancing guidelines when outside their homes and wash their hands regularly to reduce the risk of being infected. The changes mean those shielding will no longer be eligible for statutory sick pay - unless they develop coronavirus symptoms, or someone they know develops symptoms, and they are told to self-isolate and cannot work from home. Free essential food boxes will stop being delivered, but support from NHS volunteers and local councils is still possible. They will still qualify for priority slots for online shopping and will be offered help with medicine deliveries and getting to medical appointments. The UK government says the advice can be relaxed because the chances of encountering the virus in the community continue to fall - one in 1,700 people are estimated to have the virus now, down from 1 in 500 four weeks ago. The government says it has worked with clinicians, GPs, charities, the voluntary sector and patient groups on the changes. But some charities are criticising the relaxing of the advice, saying many of the people they support do not feel it is safe to stop shielding. Coronavirus: Who should be shielding? ""We know how difficult this period has been and the impact shielding has had on many people's mental health,"" says Dr Jenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer. ""We believe it is the right time to relax some of the advice so people can start to regain a degree of normality once more in their daily lives."" But she added the advice on shielding could change again ""if there are any changes in the rates of infection that could impact on this group"". As the country went into lockdown, around two million peoplewere sent letters by their GPstelling them not to leave home and to avoid contact with others. This was to protect them from the virus because they were considered to be most at risk from Covid-19. Among thelist of people who should be shielding,externalare solid organ transplant recipients, cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, pregnant women with heart disease and people with severe respiratory conditions such as cystic fibrosis and severe asthma. Over half of those shielding are under the age of 70; more than 90,000 are children. Since the start of June, people shielding in England were told they could go out once a day - to meet one person from another household while adhering to social distancing. From the beginning of August, that shielding advice is to be completely relaxed. The NHS will keep the shielded list, in case more advice needs to given to this group in future. This video can not be played Natasha Howard has been campaigning for a ""shielding hour"" Northern Ireland has already said people will no longer need to shield from 31 July. But officials say this pausing of the advice will only happen if the rate of community transmission remains low. People who are shielding and living alone in Northern Ireland willalso be able to form a support bubble from 6 Julywith one other household. Until then, people shielding across the UK are advised to stay at home as much as possible and to practise social distancing when they go outside. In Scotland, the advice applies to around 180,000 people and is in place until at least 31 July. Meanwhile in Wales, almost 130,000 people are shielding and the Chief Medical Officer for Wales saysthe current guidance runs until at least 16 August.,external Have you been shielding?

"A leaked video revealing how sales have plunged at Pret a Manger during the coronavirus crisis has raised fears about job cuts at the sandwich chain. Boss Pano Christou told staff in a recent online meeting that an announcement about the ""job situation"" would be made on 8 July. He said Pret's global weekly takings had fallen to Â£3m, just 15% of what they would normally be. A Pret spokeswoman said staff would be the ""first to hear about any changes"". Pret stores in the UK, the US and France have been hit hard by lockdowns as office workers stayed in their homes. In May, Pret called in consultants to help renegotiate its rents as it attempted to avoid store closures, and said it was putting a ""clear plan"" in place to deal with reduced footfall. That plan could involve job cuts. In a recent video call to staff, which was leaked and shared on Twitter, Mr Christou discussed the ""job situation"": ""What will be the case is, on 8 July, we'll be doing a broader communication to the teams, just talking through the initial work that's been done on this, so things will start to become clearer from 8 July,"" he said. Restaurant bosses in plea to PM over job cut fears Pret A Manger plans rent talks to save stores Thousands of UK jobs go in sweeping retail closures A Pret spokeswoman said: ""As we have already confirmed, at the end of May we appointed advisers to help Pret develop a comprehensive transformation plan to adapt to the new retail environment."" ""Transparency is very important in our business and we will make sure that Pret's team members are the first to hear about any changes. We will update our team members in early July once the plan has been finalised."" Restaurants and food chains have been hit hard by coronavirus lockdown measures. Last week bosses at restaurant and food chains including Wagamama and Pizza Hutwarned Prime Minister Boris Johnsonthat the sector faces mass job cuts without more help. Although Pret has re-opened more than 300 stores in the UK, they are only offering takeaway or delivery services. The firm is trialling a click-and-collect service so customers can avoid queuing when demand returns. The video call indicated that sales were substantially down compared with normal figures, although improving as lockdown restrictions lift. When asked what sales Pret needed to make for the company to stop losing money, he said: ""I think globally we'll need our sales to get to about 60% [of pre-crisis levels] to break even."" ""We're trying to aim to the month of September to get to that 60% but clearly there is a lot of work going into that from the team, but at the same time we're so dependent on footfall coming back into the cities to drive our sales up."" Mr Christou said the chain's US stores took close to $100,000 in sales in one week recently, a 98% drop from pre-crisis levels. In the same video, Pret's UK managing director, Clare Clough, said UK sales were down almost 90%. ""We're creeping up point by point, but we're still sitting around -86% in the UK,"" she said. In the meeting, Ms Clough said the company is engaging in ""quite intense negotiations"" with more than 300 individual landlords to deal with property costs. She encouraged staff to drive up sales, saying: ""We want to make sure that we are the winners as people come back onto the High Street.""

"Tim Cook said it was a ""historic day for the Mac"" Apple has confirmed it will transition its Mac laptop and desktop computers to its own ARM-based processors. The move means that Macs will run on the same type of chips as the firm's iPhones and iPads, rather than Intel's. Intel had faced problems manufacturing its own designs,leading it to issue a public apology to computer-makers,external. Apple's challenge will be to carry off the transition smoothly and convince third-party developers to update their apps accordingly. ""We expect to ship our first Mac with Apple silicon by the end of the year,"" said chief executive Tim Cook, adding that it would likely be two years before its full product line had made the jump. The firm said the move would allow it to offer new features and improved performance as well as making it easier for developers to ""write and optimise software for the entire Apple ecosystem"". The announcement was made at Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). ""Apple's motivations for doing this include reducing its dependence on Intel, maximizing its silicon investment, boosting performance and giving itself more flexibility and agility when it comes to future products,"" commented Geoff Blaber from the consultancy CCS Insight. ""Embracing ARM and making its hardware more consistent across the iPhone, iPad and Mac ranges is a strategic necessity, but there will be inevitable bumps along the road."" MacOS was shown running on the current iPad Pro chip, but the new computers will have processors of their own Apple said it had already developed native versions of several of its own apps, including Final Cut Pro X and Logic Pro.  iPhone and iPad apps will also be able to be run on the computers. Apple said that Microsoft was working on an optimised version of Office, and Adobe was developing a version of Photoshop. Other developers should be able to recompile their apps to get a version running ""in just a matter of days,"" said the company's software chief Craig Federighi. He added that old apps would automatically be translated at point of installation to run, although they would not work as well. To mark the significance of the move, MacOS will move to version 11. Since 2001, it had only moved from 10.0 to 10.15. Apple successfully made the switch from IBM-Motorola's PowerPC processors to Intel's x86 family in 2006. However, some software was never updated and cannot easily be run on today's Mac computers. Apple dropped support for running older software under emulation in the 2011 release of its Mac operating system. Microsoft already allows Windows 10 to be run on both Intel and ARM-based processors and looks set to continue supporting both chip architectures. Apple has not stated how long it will do the same.

As a result, some people considering buying one of its laptop or desktop computers may decide to postpone a purchase until its first ARM-based computers go on sale. This could hit sales both at Apple and the development studios that make software for the platform. ARM-based chips are based on the designs of the UK-based company, which is headquartered in Cambridge. Other companies then adapt these to add capabilities of their own. Samsung, Qualcomm and Huawei are among the many other companies to do so. Apple is the fourth-largest PC vendor, according to market research firm Gartner, coming behind Lenovo, HP, and Dell. The company has said that it has more than 100 million active Mac users. Back in June 2005, when it first announced the move to Intel chips, the figure was about 12.5 million. ""Apple is approximately 4.5% of the laptop market and 2.6% of the desktop market, so the financial impact to Intel will not be significant,"" commented Gartner's Jon Erensen. ""However, this transition... could give momentum to Microsoft's current efforts to run Windows on Qualcomm's Snapdragon processors."" The new version of MacOS, ""Big Sur"", was shown off with design tweaks Existing Mac owners will see changes to the next MacOS operating system - called Big Sur - which Apple said marked its biggest redesign to date. Analysis by James Clayton, North America technology reporter The best way to describe a processor is the brain of the computer. Hardly surprising then that the processor in your computer is kind of important. Changing it is no small thing - and Apple hasn't decided this lightly. The big question though - and the one that if you're reading this you're probably more interested in - is what will this do for Macs in general? The prevailing view in Silicon Valley is moving to Apple silicon will make for more powerful Macs. Bringing it in-house could create cheaper processors - so in theory you could have cheaper Macs (that's if Apple wanted to pass on savings to the consumer). But there are risks too. The first is that Apple still has Intel-based Macs yet to come out. Will people simply wait for Apple's new processor to go live before choosing to buy a new computer? And - considering how well Mac products sell there will be a nervousness about changing a formula that has worked very well for Apple for the last 15 years. Other announcements at WWDC included the ability to use an iPhone as a substitute for a car key by transmitting an NFC (near-field communication) signal to unlock doors and start the engine. This will initially be limited to some new BMWs, but the firm said it intended to expand to other models in time. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Examples included weather forecasts, news briefings, and calendar meetings. Android already has something similar. Another Android-like new feature is the introduction of App Clips, which allow part of a program to be downloaded quickly. These must be less than 10 megabytes in size and will be able to be triggered via an NFC-transmission or by scanning a QR code. Suggested uses included the ability to order a drink in a cafe or to pay for a car-parking space.

"A leaked video revealing how sales have plunged at Pret a Manger during the coronavirus crisis has raised fears about job cuts at the sandwich chain. Boss Pano Christou told staff in a recent online meeting that an announcement about the ""job situation"" would be made on 8 July. He said Pret's global weekly takings had fallen to Â£3m, just 15% of what they would normally be. A Pret spokeswoman said staff would be the ""first to hear about any changes"". Pret stores in the UK, the US and France have been hit hard by lockdowns as office workers stayed in their homes. In May, Pret called in consultants to help renegotiate its rents as it attempted to avoid store closures, and said it was putting a ""clear plan"" in place to deal with reduced footfall. That plan could involve job cuts. In a recent video call to staff, which was leaked and shared on Twitter, Mr Christou discussed the ""job situation"": ""What will be the case is, on 8 July, we'll be doing a broader communication to the teams, just talking through the initial work that's been done on this, so things will start to become clearer from 8 July,"" he said. Restaurant bosses in plea to PM over job cut fears Pret A Manger plans rent talks to save stores Thousands of UK jobs go in sweeping retail closures A Pret spokeswoman said: ""As we have already confirmed, at the end of May we appointed advisers to help Pret develop a comprehensive transformation plan to adapt to the new retail environment."" ""Transparency is very important in our business and we will make sure that Pret's team members are the first to hear about any changes. We will update our team members in early July once the plan has been finalised."" Restaurants and food chains have been hit hard by coronavirus lockdown measures. Last week bosses at restaurant and food chains including Wagamama and Pizza Hutwarned Prime Minister Boris Johnsonthat the sector faces mass job cuts without more help. Although Pret has re-opened more than 300 stores in the UK, they are only offering takeaway or delivery services. The firm is trialling a click-and-collect service so customers can avoid queuing when demand returns. The video call indicated that sales were substantially down compared with normal figures, although improving as lockdown restrictions lift. When asked what sales Pret needed to make for the company to stop losing money, he said: ""I think globally we'll need our sales to get to about 60% [of pre-crisis levels] to break even."" ""We're trying to aim to the month of September to get to that 60% but clearly there is a lot of work going into that from the team, but at the same time we're so dependent on footfall coming back into the cities to drive our sales up."" Mr Christou said the chain's US stores took close to $100,000 in sales in one week recently, a 98% drop from pre-crisis levels. In the same video, Pret's UK managing director, Clare Clough, said UK sales were down almost 90%. ""We're creeping up point by point, but we're still sitting around -86% in the UK,"" she said. In the meeting, Ms Clough said the company is engaging in ""quite intense negotiations"" with more than 300 individual landlords to deal with property costs. She encouraged staff to drive up sales, saying: ""We want to make sure that we are the winners as people come back onto the High Street.""

"James Furlong, a teacher, is the first victim identified Second victim named by family in US as Joe Ritchie-Bennett The third person killed has been named as David Wails A minute's silence was held in the town at 10:00 BST Khairi Saadallah, a 25-year-old Libyan national, is in custody It is believed to be an isolated incident and police are not looking for anyone else The attacks happened in Forbury Gardens in the town centre Three people died following the attack and three more were treated for injuries Police urge people not to share footage of the attack on social media Dan Kerins, Nathan Briant and Andre Rhoden-Paul Tributes have been paid to the three people killed in a park on Saturday. Reading East MP Matt Rodda said he was proud of the way people in Reading are supporting each other through this ""difficult time"". He added: ""Reading is a friendly and peaceful town with a diverse and tolerant community and this whole incident is completely unknown to us, it is something which has never occurred before in our community and as such is deeply upsetting."" Earlier today the MP laid flowers with community and faith leaders at the scene of the attack. A minute's silence was held outside the Blagrave Arms pub for the victims of the Reading terror attack. Ahead of the pause, Jamie Wake, a friend of the three men who were stabbed, told reporters: ""I wish I could stand here and say that I can make sense of the senseless. Sadly today, like many others, I can't. ""We become so used to seeing incidents like this on the television. This time, we cannot change the channel. This time, it's on our doorstep. And this time, it's happened to people we know."" Mr Wake said the Blagrave was a place the LGBT community in Reading called home and was a ""safe space for so many members of our community"". ""A place that today we have all been drawn to as we unite together, to mourn as one,"" he added. Reading East MP Matt Rodda has paid tribute in the Commons to the victims of Forbury Gardens. Mr Rodda told MPs: ""Like many other local people I was shocked and deeply upset by the dreadful attack in Forbury Gardens.

Friends pay tribute to the three people who died after a stabbing attack in Reading on Saturday. Detectives have been granted more time to
question a man suspected of killing three people in Reading. Counter terrorism police are now able to
hold Khairi Saadallah until 27
June, after he was arrested on Saturday following an attack in Forbury Gardens. David Wails was earlier named
as the third victim of the attack.Joe Ritchie-Bennett and his friend James Furlong also died. Det Ch Supt Kath
Barnes said officers were ""working to establish exactly what happened in
the lead up to, during and after this incident"". A statement said
her team are ""particularly interested"" in hearing from anyone who
might have been driving in the area before or at the time of the incident, and
who may have dash-cam footage. Staff at a Reading pub have said they are ""devastated"" by the death of three ""friends"" in the Forbury Gardens attack. The Blagrave Arms said the victims, David Wails, James Furlong and Joe Ritchie-Bennett, were regular customers and described them as the ""kindest, most genuine, and most loveliest people in our community"". The town centre pub is a popular venue with Reading's LGBT community. In a statement The Blagrave Arms said:  ""The Blagrave Arms management and staff are devestated that the three people who died, in the Forbury Gardens attack on Saturday, were regular customers and very dear friends of ours. ""Our hearts are broken and our thoughts go out to their families and friends; also to the other victims of this disgusting vicious attack."" They added: ""They'll be forever in our thoughts."" West Dorset MP Chris Loder has told MPs how one of his parliamentary assistants carried out CPR on a victim of the Forbury Gardens attack. He told the commons:""In the same way that (Tobias Ellwood) did so in March 2017, another member of our parliamentary family who, by chance was at Forbury Gardens on Saturday, ran courageously towards danger, his only focus to help the injured."" Mr Loder said his staff member James Antell ""not only used his own shirt to stem the bleeding of one victim, but continued resuscitation on a second victim until the paramedics arrived"". He added he was ""extremely proud"" of his assistant's ""remarkable and extraordinary effort"". In response Home Secretary Priti Patel said: ""Responding, Home Secretary Priti Patel said: ""Can I join with (Mr Loder) a tribute to his assistant and to all other first responders who showed great humility but also that sense of duty in coming together on Saturday in Forbury Gardens to respond and prevent the further loss of life."" A friend of the three victims has paid tribute to the trio and the shock of their deaths. It comes asthe third person killed in Forbury Gardens has been named as David Wails. Michael Main, said: ""You wouldn't think it would be any time soon but when it happens, that's what hits me the hardest."" Mr Main said: ""[Mr Wails] was always happy. Everyone has their problems but he left them at the door. He always made people smile. ""I always loved how Joe [Ritchie-Bennett] would say anything. He didnât have much of a filter, which was the best thing. He always said what he wanted â and it was never anything bad, he always had something good to say. ""James [Furlong], I used to love his argumentative conversations. Not in a bad way, just discussions and heâd always beat me in the arguments. I am going to miss that. Itâs not going to be the same for me."" David Wails has been named as the third victim of the Forbury Gardens attack. A friend of Mr Wails, and the other two victims Joe Ritchie-Bennett and James Furlong said they were ""always happy"" and would be remembered fondly. Michael Main, who knew them from drinking at the Blagrave Arms in Reading, said the attacks had affected the town significantly. He told the BBC: ""I drank with David probably every day. Every time I was in there, he was in there. We'd have a lot of banter. He was a banter person. He's the one that hits me the most because I know him more and it's just sad to know he's gone so early."" The Home Secretary Priti Patel has sent her ""heartfelt condolences"" to those involved in the Forbury Gardens attack. Ms Patel told MPs in the Commons: ""Police have confirmed that the threat is contained but that sadly three innocent members of the public were killed, murdered by a sudden and savage knife attacker as they enjoyed a summer evening with friends. ""Another three victims were injured and received hospital treatment. ""My thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of everyone who was hurt or killed as a result of this sickening attack."" Ms Patel visited Forbury Gardens earlier this morning. Among dozens of floral tributes outside of The Holt School in Wokingham - in memory of teacher James Furlong - one sign attached to the gates said: ""And remember, be safe, be careful and don't do anything I wouldn't do."" One student, who preferred not to be named, said that Mr Furlong used to repeat the motto to pupils at the end of every lesson. The sign also said ""our hero"" and ""fly high"" alongside pictures of the history teacher, while a red and white Liverpool Football Club scarf had been draped over the gates. The Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has paid tribute to victim James Furlong who was a teacher. Mr Furlong was head of history, government and politics at The Holt School in Wokingham. Mr Williamson told MPs: ""Before I begin, may I take the opportunity to share my deepest condolences with the family of James Furlong and the other victims of the terrorist attack in Reading. ""We've heard so many young people talk about the amazing impact James had on their lives and the real appreciation they felt and the loss that they now feel. ""Our hearts go out to all of those who have been affected by this most terrible of tragedies. ""It was an appalling attack and the Home Secretary will update the House later today."" More flowers are being left in Reading town centre in tribute to the three victims of Saturday's attack. One bouquet left behind showed the mood around Reading: one of mourning but also defiance. Several community leaders, including Reading's MPs and the Bishop of Reading, laid flowers at a vigil earlier. The prime minister has promised that the government ""will not hesitate"" to act if there are changes that could be made to legislation in the wake of Saturday's events. Boris Johnson's official spokesman said the PM took part in the minute's silence for the victims at 10am and continues to receive ""regular updates from security officials"". The Number 10 spokesman added: ""The prime minister has said that if there are any lessons to be learned or any changes to be made to stop such events from happening again, we will not hesitate to take that action, as we have before."" Marianna SpringDisinformation and social media reporter Old photos, misleading claims and
conspiracies relating to the Reading attack have been shared across social
media. Some posts show old images of
convicted terrorists claiming they were behind the attack, while others made
false claims about a left-wing commentator. Some erroneously tried to link the
incident to an earlier Black Lives Matter protest. There was also a disturbing,
albeit genuine, video of the aftermath of the incident. Police encouraged
people not to share it, out of respect to the victims. Breaking news can be fertile

increased police presence will be seen across Reading over the next few days,
the townâs local policing area commander has said. Supt
Nicholas John said residents should not be alarmed if cordons remain in place, though many have already come down. He said
the townâs response and community spirit had been âvery movingâ since the attack. Supt
John said: âIt is now more important than ever that everyone plays their part
in tackling terrorism. âCommunities
defeat terrorism. In times of adversity we must come together as one community
as the co-operation between each other is our most powerful defence. âI
am proud to be part of the diverse Reading community and we will together stand
up against those who aim to divide us.â Cordons remain
in place near Forbury Gardens, including Town Hall Square, Blagrave Street, Forbury Road and The Forbury. A cordon outside Reading Town Hall on Monday afternoon More pupils at The Holt School in Wokingham paid tribute to James Furlong, who was its head of history, government and politics. Ella Banbury, 17, said: ""He was just a really kind teacher. You would always see him smile - there wouldn't be a time where you wouldn't see him smiling. ""He wasn't just there to teach the subject, he wanted to make sure everyone is OK."" Kate La Cumbra, 17, said: ""I didn't have any subjects with him but even if you didn't know him, around school he would always be happy to help you,"" Another student, Poppy Hind, 17, added: ""His smile was the main thing. He would walk around school with a massive smile on his face every single day."" Pupils lit candles at the nearby St Paul's Parish Church. AndrÃ© Rhoden-PaulBBC South At police cordons near
Forbury Gardens, a steady stream of people continue to bring floral tributes in
memory of the three people who lost their lives. Reading local Magda Koc said she was in ""disbelief"" about what
happened and was moved enough to lay flowers at the scene. ""I'm just waiting to hear who it is that died, so I can think
about them,"" she said. At 10:00 BST all across the town people stopped in their tracks and
bowed their heads to mark the minute's silence in memory of those
affected. Later, politicians and
community and faith leaders gathered in huge numbers to lay flowers and say a
prayer at the gates of the park - a sombre display of collective of
grieving. Reading is in
mourning. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.90008616
"Foden gives Man City lead with fine strike Mahrez adds second with powerful low drive, third with penalty David Silva pokes in fourth after clever City move Foden gets his second with precise finish Phil Dawkes That is all from us for this evening. Another cracking night for City and another feather in the cap of Phil Foden. For Burnley it is the standard 5-0 loss at the Etihad. One to brush off and go again. What can't be brushed off, though, is what happened above the stadium early in the game. Positive steps have been made but we still have a long way to go. We'll be back tomorrow for Leicester v Brighton and Tottenham v West Ham. Man City 5-0 Burnley Burnley Burnely manager Sean Dyche has been speaking after the game. On the plane banner:""I didnât realise
what had gone on at the beginning. Heard noise. Unacceptable. We can only
apologise. ""I donât know what
the club can do to send a message out. The powers that be will look at the way we can
play our part."" On being without several players whose contracts are expiring:  ""We have everything
we have got. Ashley Barnes and Chris Wood are injured, plus there is Robbie Brady. Club decided to offer
contracts very late in the day. Choice is not to be involved. ""The balance to that is that decisions have to be made. I can only advise. The chairman made a different
decision. ""The players have
asked me a few questions about why certain things have not been done. No lack
of focus about the intention. Group as stretched as it has ever been. These
games do you good. They remind you how serious these teams are. ""I have been here
seven and a half years. Never been an easy ride with finance. It is not my
first rodeo. The club has a restricted and stringent look at finance. We have
had a healthy return but the chairman makes the decisions. I can only advise. ""Life at Burnley is
tough at times. We are in very good shape financially. The decisions have been late.
That has affected the situation."" Man City 5-0 Burnley Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola, speaking to Sky Sports:""We played really well. Solid performance especially in the beginning. We had to be patient and give permission to ourselves to go into positions to attack more comfortable and make the transitions. The first goal and second helped us a lot. We are so close close to playing in the Champions League next season. On Phil Foden:""I remember some games in the cup when he played similar. I am happy for him and he says what he feels. ""I said many times when he played he never played bad. He loves to play football. When he had day off he is with his friends with the ball. Every time he played with us he always played at a high level. But he is 20 years old and he needs to improve. He will be an important player for this club for the next decade. He deserves it. He is a joy to watch."" On a proper send-off for David Silva:""We are going to when it is possible to have people back to the Etihad to try and have not one empty seat for this incredible legend. With Joe Hart, Vincent Kompany, Yaya Toure, Pablo Zabaleta - these players bring these players to another level and they deserve real fireworks. David is unique in the small spaces. ""In this position, when David says it is his last year I spoke with the board that we have Phil (Foden) so we don't have to invest."" On Sergio Aguero's injury:""It doesn't look good. Something in the knee and we will see tomorrow. He felt something in his knee. He struggled in the last month with some pain in his knee."" As appalling as it is to see the banner flown over the Etihad tonight, the response from both Ben Mee and his club has been impressive. There was a time when players weren't as vocal on issues outside the game. But the unity and strong stance on this is very positive. Burnley defender Ben Mee, speaking to Sky Sports:""It was a tough night. We can talk about football but there is something  I would like to speak about first - the plane at the beginning of the game. I am ashamed and embarrassed that a small number of our fans have decided to fly that around the stadium. Completely misses the point. The group of lads in the changing room are embarrassed to see that. It is not what we are about. They have missed what we are trying to achieve. These people need to come into the 21st century and educate themselves. They don't represent what we are about, the club is about, the players are about and the majority of fans are about. ""AS we were coming out we heard some whispers that it was going to happen. The club tried to stop it. I've heard it is a small number that have arranged this and I hope it doesn't happen again. I don't want to associate it with my club. I don't want to see this in the game. ""It is not right. We totally condemn it. These people can learn and be taught what the Black Lives Matter movement is trying to achieve. ""The players have pulled together and this is what we want, what the majority of fans want - equality in society and in football, everything, be it race, religion, gender, LGBTQ community. ""The players have pulled together and we want to make a stand against this for all minorities."" Man City 5-0 Burnley Former Manchester City defender Micah Richards, speaking on
Sky Sports about a banner which flew over the stadium before kick-off with the words ""White Lives Matter - Burnley"":âItâs so disheartening. After how far weâve come in these last
couple of weeks it really does hurt me. ""I agree everyone should have free speech but when it looked like everything was
on the up thereâs a small fraction who want to ruin it. I donât want to make
a big thing of it and Iâd like to hope itâs a small percentage. ""Itâs so disheartening. After how far weâve come in these last
couple of weeks it really does hurt me."" Man City 5-0 Burnley Pat NevinFormer Chelsea and Scotland winger on BBC Radio 5 Live It was not in doubt after the second goal, it finished it and worryingly for Burnley Manchester City had more gears to move in to. We saw some fantastic play and the pick of the players? Phil Foden. He stood out as the best player on the pitch but he had everything about his game, good energy and runs with the ball but also the eye of a pass which all City players have. As an outsider, I would build my team around him, not just City but England too. If it was Spain, they would make him the core of the team early on. I watch Chelsea who have a lot of good young players, but Foden is extraordinary and has the vision that not others have. Man City 5-0 Burnley Man City midfielder Phil Foden, speaking to Sky Sports:""It is always good to play a part. I am enjoying my football. The main thing is getting the result and how the team are playing. We are sharp. ""It is down to the whole team wanting to work hard. No matter who the manager puts in they do a job."" On scoring from corners:""We have a set-piece coach and have been working hard on short corners and defending as well so it is good when it comes off."" On his pass for the David Silva goal:""We worked on the set-piece to draw players out as well so I already knew where to play the pass. I am just glad it came off. ""I'd like to think that was my best game in a City shirt. I am still learning every day but I am happy to put performances in like that."" On replacing David Silva:""How he plays today, he is unbelievable. I don't want to think about it. I am just enjoying playing with him. He is a legend of the game."" Man City 5-0 Burnley Simon StoneBBC Sport at the Etihad Stadium Manchester City midfielder Phil Foden was named man of the match after scoring twice. But he also left the pitch wearing a rather large ice pack on his left thigh. City play next at Chelsea on Thursday. Man City 5-0 Burnley John MurrayBBC Radio 5 Live commentator The last four results here for Burnley now read 4-1 3-0, 5-0, 5-0, 5-0. One way traffic. Man City 5-0 Burnley Brilliant City making it two wins out of two since the restart and three 5-0 victories on the bounce against Burnley. Mahrez got two but it was another man with a brace to his name - Phil Foden - who really starred tonight. He's staking his claim now. Poor Burnley barely got a kick. Man City 5-0 Burnley Pat NevinFormer Chelsea and Scotland winger on BBC Radio 5 Live It is painful to some degree. Burnley have not stopped trying but the game was over for a long time. James Tarkowski came to the side of the pitch for a word with manager Sean Dyche and they both started laughing, how often do you see that at 5-0 down? It is not that they don't care, they understand. Mn City 5-0 Burnley Joao Cancelo's low cross is gathered by Pope as we move into the first of two minutes of added time. Man City 5-0 Burnley Probably not the dream debut Max Thompson would have wished for. But it remains a significant moment for the young lad. He replaces Matej Vydra, shortly after Bernardo Silva sees a first-time shot in the box blocked before it can test Pope. Man City 5-0 Burnley No, it's not De Bruyne who hits it. He is in attendance but allows Sane to have a pop. The winger's effort goes straight into the wall, though. Man City 5-0 Burnley Ben Mee has had a rough night. He is done by Jesus on the edge of the box and has no choice but to stick a leg out and bring the forward down. De Bruyne free-kick incoming... Man City 5-0 Burnley Simon StoneBBC Sport at the Etihad Stadium Leroy Sane makes his first appearance since suffering a cruciate knee ligament injury during the Community Shield in August. On Friday, Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola said Sane had refused to sign a new contract and wants to join another club. Bayern Munich are thought to be Sane's preferred destination but he still has another year left on his contract, so there is no guarantee the Germany winger will get his wish this summer. Man City 5-0 Burnley You can only imagine the standing ovation Foden would have got from the Etihad had it been populated with fans tonight. His fine work is done, with Leroy Sane replacing him. Sane, as you'll probably know, has had an injury-plagued season, coupled with his contract situation rumbling away in the background. He has 10 minutes here to try and add something. Man City 5-0 Burnley De Bruyne looks for Jesus in the box with a low ball into the corridor of uncertainty, but it is just a fraction ahead of the striker. Soon after, Rodri fires an effort from range straight down Pope's throat. Man City 5-0 Burnley Pat NevinFormer Chelsea and Scotland winger on BBC Radio 5 Live I remember covering Manchester City at Watford and it was 6-0, it could have been 11-0 or 12-0 and I do not think Watford played badly. I just felt so sorry for them. I would not say Burnley have been a disgrace today, they have worked hard and could lose 7-0, but player for player they are so far behind. It is just about the quality. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,4.518157e-08
"Police officers in Ireland trialled the app ahead of its planned national rollout Ireland's health authority plans to press ahead with the launch of a coronavirus contact-tracing app based on Apple and Google's technology. The Health Service Executive told the BBC that it would submit a memo to government this week, and ""subject to approval"" would launch its Covid Tracker app shortly after. The move comes despite concerns raised about the tech's accuracy in its current state. The UK is worried about false alerts. And researchers advising the Irish effort have also questioned whether the software should be rolled out in its current state. Ireland would follow Germany in deploying such an app nationwide. Two tests were carried out in Ireland ahead of the launch of its app. Members of the An Garda Siochana police force volunteered to take part in field trials at the start of the month to see how it would perform in everyday situations. ""The Gardai are one of the few groups of people that are moving around and interacting with each other as they carry out their duties,"" explained a spokeswoman for the country's government. The results have given health chiefs confidence to roll it out to the public. And they note that because it has been designed to support UK mobile numbers, visitors crossing the border from Northern Ireland or travelling across from Great Britain can also make use if it. The second experimentinvolved a team at Trinity College, Dublin testing an app based on the Google-Apple API,external[application programming interface] on a commuter bus. It found that metal in the vehicle's structure and fittings caused problems. The Google-API allows the threshold for what triggers a contact match to be adjusted based on the strength of the Bluetooth signal and duration of the exposure. When using the settings already in use by Switzerland's contact-tracing app, the researchers found that no contact logs were logged despite 60 pairs of handsets being placed within 2m of each other. And they only managed to raise this to an 8% detection rate when they shortened the exposure time and adjusted the Bluetooth strength to a level that they said would be likely to cause false alerts in other environments. This video can not be played WATCH: What is contact tracing and how does it work? In addition, the researchers said signal strength was sometimes higher for phones that were far apart than those close together, which they said made reliable proximity-detection ""hard or perhaps even impossible"" to achieve. ""As to whether it is sensible to deploy these apps, I'd say the jury is still out on that,"" Prof Doug Leith told the BBC. ""But the likely effectiveness of apps based on the Apple-Google API in real-world situations  -ie outside the lab - is certainly far from clear."" Last week, the UK ditched its own contact-tracing technology to switch to the Apple-Google model. But while the government now intends to launch a Covid-19 app of some sort in England by the Autumn, it has said it may still not include contact-tracing functionality. ""I was only prepared to recommend to people that they download an app when I'm really confident in it,"" Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the Andrew Marr Show on Sunday. What went wrong with the UK's contact tracing app? UK virus-tracing app switches to Apple-Google model In-built Covid-19 tracing tool 'is not an app' Apple and Google are under pressure to become less restrictive about the data they share to let apps become more accurate. ""The API does not expose Bluetooth received signal strength (RSS) measurements directly, rather it abstracts this,"" explained Dr Brendan Jennings, who is also involved in developing Ireland's app. ""There certainly are some changes in the API that we believe would be helpful - and we do believe that Google/Apple will be willing to take on board suggested changes in future revisions."" But in the meantime, others have already decided to launch apps based on the two US tech firms' software tool, including: Denmark Germany Gibraltar Italy Japan Latvia Poland Saudi Arabia Switzerland Uruguay One of the developers of Germany's app said it was currently 80% accurate at logging matches across a range of scenarios, and it had been felt that this was good enough to go with. Bayern Munich football players promoted the German app during a Bundesliga match at the weekend ""There can be false alerts,"" added SAP's Thomas Leonhardi. ""But that can also happen via manual contact tracing. It's the best we have and of course we're still working on it."" The Robert Koch Institute, which published the Corona-Warn App on behalf of the German government, said on Friday morning that ithad already been downloaded 9.6 million times,external. The country's population is about 83 million. Once Ireland has got an app based on the Apple/Google toolkit up and running then Northern Ireland and indeed the rest of the UK should be able to use it - job done, right? Well, no, say insiders on the NHS team. First, an app is more than just the code - you would need to integrate it with the public health advice, the testing infrastructure and the manual contact-tracing systems for each of the four home nations. But the key issue is the question of whether the Apple/Google system is actually working well at measuring the distance between two phones using Bluetooth - last Thursday Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Test and Trace supremo Baroness Dido Harding made it clear they thought it wasn't. Incidentally, Baroness Harding may have overstated the failings of the centralised app in the Isle of Wight during Thursday's briefings when she said it could only detect 4% of iPhone contacts. Someone on the island who was briefed about what went wrong tells me that this disastrous 4% only referred to cases where the app was asleep in the background after a long period when two iPhones had not been in use for a while - which apparently accounts for just a small percentage of overall iPhone contacts. What's frustrated both the app team and Apple is that in the days before the U-turn, the two sides had apparently begun working closely on ways to make Bluetooth work better with the app in the background. Thursday's announcement came as a surprise to the developers and to the tech giant - which was then dismayed to hear Mr Hancock accusing it of a failure to co-operate.

"Groups of up to six people in Northern Ireland can meet indoors from Tuesday, the executive has agreed. First Minister Arlene Foster said it would be a ""new milestone"" in NI's journey out of the Covid-19 lockdown. It means Northern Ireland will become the first part of the UK to permit limited indoor gatherings. People will still be required to maintain social distancing when meeting indoors with family and friends. The executive said people were ""strongly advised"" to wear face coverings during indoor gatherings, and the regulations did not extend to overnight visits. Until now, people in Northern Ireland have only been allowed to gather outside in groups of 10 or fewer. Visiting people indoors in their own homes has been limited to adults who live alone, who canform a ""support bubble"" with one other household. In the Republic of Ireland people are already permitted to meet indoors, in groups of up to six. Speaking at the executive's press conference, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the new easement came with ""very strong public health advice"". ""I know the natural human reaction will be to hug each other, but for now distance is still needed to keep people safe,"" she added. Mrs Foster acknowledged people in Northern Ireland had ""weathered a particularly vicious storm"". ""I know many of you have been desperate to visit family and friends in their homes,"" she added. ""As positive as this step is, we cannot stress enough that the battle against Covid-19 is very much still ongoing."" Both the first and deputy first ministers said they also hoped the move would allow ""informal childcare arrangements"" to begin for families again. Indoor visits will not apply to those vulnerable people in Northern Ireland who are shielding, Ms O'Neill said. However from 6 July, shielders can meet outside in groups of up to six, maintaining social distancing. Q&A: What has and has not changed in NI lockdown? Who are we allowed to meet up with? People who are shielding alone will be able to form a support bubble with one other household from 6 July. New letters will be issued to about 95,000 people who are shielding, ahead of a planned ""pause"" in the shielding period, which is due to start from 31 July. Professor Ian Young, chief scientific advisor to the Department of Health, said he was confident people would want to wear face coverings when they understood they would help to protect loved ones when they meet  indoors. He said there may be settings where face coverings will become mandatory in the future but that would be a matter of a policy decision. ""If everyone would do it on a voluntary basis hopefully that will not be necessary,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme. He added that he was not aware of plans to make face coverings mandatory on public transport, but said it was something that would be kept under review. In other developments: Belfast City Council has agreed to waive all fees for pavement cafe licences, with applications now open for cafes, bars and restaurants to use outdoor space for tables and chairs The NI Sports Forum has written to the first and deputy first ministers asking them to take ""urgent action"" to reopen NI's indoor sports facilities Cinema owners in NI are also calling for a reopening date, with multiplexes in the Republic of Ireland set to resume trading from 20 July There will be a phased return of MoT and driver testing services - from 20 July, MoT testing for priority vehicle groups, including taxis and buses due a first time test, and vehicles not previously registered in NI will begin The Republic of Ireland's health authority plans to press ahead withthe launch of a coronavirus contact-tracing app. Two further people with coronavirus have died in the Republic of Ireland, bringing the country's death toll to 1,717 On Monday, ministers also discussed the 2m (6ft) social distancing rule, funding for childcare and school dinners, as well as the use of face coverings. No decision has yet been taken by ministers on whether face coverings on public transport should become mandatory, but Ms O'Neill said the issue was ""under review"". ""The advice remains that we strongly recommend it,"" added the deputy first minister. Social distancing in England is expected to be reduced from 2m to 1m in England from Tuesday, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson due to make an announcement. Mrs Foster said the executive would engage with Westminster officials about the issue, but no agreement had been reached by Stormont ministers. Several of her DUP ministerial colleagues have urged the distance to be reduced, in order to make it more viable for some sectors of the economy to resume trading. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? IMPACT:What the virus does to the body RECOVERY:How long does it take? LOCKDOWN:How can we lift restrictions? ENDGAME:How do we get out of this mess? The executive's announcement on indoor gatherings came as no new coronavirus-related deaths have been reported in Northern Ireland in the past 24 hours. One new confirmed case of the virus has been recorded, taking that total to 4,871. Thetotal number of deaths recorded by the Department of Health,externalin NI remains at 545 - this figure is mostly comprised of hospital deaths and where patients tested positive for the virus. Stormont's statistics agency Nisra releases weekly figures showing fatalities in all settings and by 12 June, itrecorded more than 800 Covid-linked deaths. Meanwhile, with just a week to go before parking and bus lane fines are reintroduced, motorists who break the rules are being issued with ""warnings"" from Monday. On-street parking charges and bus lane enforcement were suspended on 24 March as part of the coronavirus lockdown. But enforcement teams are back on the streets from 22 June to prepare for the return of charges and fines on 29 June. Parking attendants are back on the streets for the first time since March Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said it was part of the economic recovery plan to support businesses. However she acknowledged the return of parking charges and bus lane fines ""may not be popular for some"" but added she had to consider the needs of all road users.

"A leaked video revealing how sales have plunged at Pret a Manger during the coronavirus crisis has raised fears about job cuts at the sandwich chain. Boss Pano Christou told staff in a recent online meeting that an announcement about the ""job situation"" would be made on 8 July. He said Pret's global weekly takings had fallen to Â£3m, just 15% of what they would normally be. A Pret spokeswoman said staff would be the ""first to hear about any changes"". Pret stores in the UK, the US and France have been hit hard by lockdowns as office workers stayed in their homes. In May, Pret called in consultants to help renegotiate its rents as it attempted to avoid store closures, and said it was putting a ""clear plan"" in place to deal with reduced footfall. That plan could involve job cuts. In a recent video call to staff, which was leaked and shared on Twitter, Mr Christou discussed the ""job situation"": ""What will be the case is, on 8 July, we'll be doing a broader communication to the teams, just talking through the initial work that's been done on this, so things will start to become clearer from 8 July,"" he said. Restaurant bosses in plea to PM over job cut fears Pret A Manger plans rent talks to save stores Thousands of UK jobs go in sweeping retail closures A Pret spokeswoman said: ""As we have already confirmed, at the end of May we appointed advisers to help Pret develop a comprehensive transformation plan to adapt to the new retail environment."" ""Transparency is very important in our business and we will make sure that Pret's team members are the first to hear about any changes. We will update our team members in early July once the plan has been finalised."" Restaurants and food chains have been hit hard by coronavirus lockdown measures. Last week bosses at restaurant and food chains including Wagamama and Pizza Hutwarned Prime Minister Boris Johnsonthat the sector faces mass job cuts without more help. Although Pret has re-opened more than 300 stores in the UK, they are only offering takeaway or delivery services. The firm is trialling a click-and-collect service so customers can avoid queuing when demand returns. The video call indicated that sales were substantially down compared with normal figures, although improving as lockdown restrictions lift. When asked what sales Pret needed to make for the company to stop losing money, he said: ""I think globally we'll need our sales to get to about 60% [of pre-crisis levels] to break even."" ""We're trying to aim to the month of September to get to that 60% but clearly there is a lot of work going into that from the team, but at the same time we're so dependent on footfall coming back into the cities to drive our sales up."" Mr Christou said the chain's US stores took close to $100,000 in sales in one week recently, a 98% drop from pre-crisis levels. In the same video, Pret's UK managing director, Clare Clough, said UK sales were down almost 90%. ""We're creeping up point by point, but we're still sitting around -86% in the UK,"" she said. In the meeting, Ms Clough said the company is engaging in ""quite intense negotiations"" with more than 300 individual landlords to deal with property costs. She encouraged staff to drive up sales, saying: ""We want to make sure that we are the winners as people come back onto the High Street.""

"The 2.2 million people who have been self-isolating in England during the pandemic will no longer need to shield from 1 August. From 6 July, they will be able to meet up outdoors, in a group, with up to five others and form 'support bubbles' with other households. The measures can be eased because infection rates are falling, the government says. Support packages will remain until the end of July to help people transition. Those who are shielding and live alone in England - including single parents who are shielding - will be able to create a support bubble with one other household of any size. This follows the'social bubble' ruleswhich were introduced earlier this month for anyone living alone and single-parent households. People shielding will also be able to meet in groups of up to six outdoors while maintaining social distancing rules. Still shielding: 'The novelty has certainly worn off' Extremely vulnerable people who are most at risk from becoming ill from coronavirus will no longer need to shield in England. That means they can return to work, if they can't work from home, as long as theirworkplace is COVID secure,external. However, they should still follow social distancing guidelines when outside their homes and wash their hands regularly to reduce the risk of being infected. The changes mean those shielding will no longer be eligible for statutory sick pay - unless they develop coronavirus symptoms, or someone they know develops symptoms, and they are told to self-isolate and cannot work from home. Free essential food boxes will stop being delivered, but support from NHS volunteers and local councils is still possible. They will still qualify for priority slots for online shopping and will be offered help with medicine deliveries and getting to medical appointments. The UK government says the advice can be relaxed because the chances of encountering the virus in the community continue to fall - one in 1,700 people are estimated to have the virus now, down from 1 in 500 four weeks ago. The government says it has worked with clinicians, GPs, charities, the voluntary sector and patient groups on the changes. But some charities are criticising the relaxing of the advice, saying many of the people they support do not feel it is safe to stop shielding. Coronavirus: Who should be shielding? ""We know how difficult this period has been and the impact shielding has had on many people's mental health,"" says Dr Jenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer. ""We believe it is the right time to relax some of the advice so people can start to regain a degree of normality once more in their daily lives."" But she added the advice on shielding could change again ""if there are any changes in the rates of infection that could impact on this group"". As the country went into lockdown, around two million peoplewere sent letters by their GPstelling them not to leave home and to avoid contact with others. This was to protect them from the virus because they were considered to be most at risk from Covid-19. Among thelist of people who should be shielding,externalare solid organ transplant recipients, cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, pregnant women with heart disease and people with severe respiratory conditions such as cystic fibrosis and severe asthma. Over half of those shielding are under the age of 70; more than 90,000 are children. Since the start of June, people shielding in England were told they could go out once a day - to meet one person from another household while adhering to social distancing. From the beginning of August, that shielding advice is to be completely relaxed. The NHS will keep the shielded list, in case more advice needs to given to this group in future. This video can not be played Natasha Howard has been campaigning for a ""shielding hour"" Northern Ireland has already said people will no longer need to shield from 31 July. But officials say this pausing of the advice will only happen if the rate of community transmission remains low. People who are shielding and living alone in Northern Ireland willalso be able to form a support bubble from 6 Julywith one other household. Until then, people shielding across the UK are advised to stay at home as much as possible and to practise social distancing when they go outside. In Scotland, the advice applies to around 180,000 people and is in place until at least 31 July. Meanwhile in Wales, almost 130,000 people are shielding and the Chief Medical Officer for Wales saysthe current guidance runs until at least 16 August.,external Have you been shielding?

"Michaela Coel stars in, wrote and co-directed I May Destroy You The BBC is to increase diversity by investing Â£100m of its TV budget over a three year period to produce ""diverse and inclusive content"". Director general Tony Hall has described the move, which will apply from April 2021, as ""a big leap"". The BBC has set itself a mandatory target - 20% of off-screen talent must come from under-represented groups. That includes those with a disability or from a BAME or disadvantaged socio-economic background. There will also be three ""tests"" for diversity in the BBC's TV output, with programmes needing to meet two of them to qualify - diverse stories and portrayal on-screen, diverse production teams and talent and diverse-led production companies. The announcement follows widespread Black Lives Matter protests, after the death of George Floyd while in police custody in the US. June Sarpong was appointed the BBC's first director of creative diversity in October 2019 ""The senseless killing of George Floyd - and what it tells us about the stain of systemic racism - has had a profound impact on all of us,"" said Lord Hall. ""It's made us question ourselves about what more we can do to help tackle racism - and drive inclusion within our organisation and in society as a whole. ""This is our response - it's going to drive change in what we make and who makes it.  It's a big leap forward - and we'll have more to announce in the coming weeks.""

Off air, the BBC promised at the time to increase the proportion of leadership roles filled by women from 44% to 50% by next year, and raise the share of such senior roles held by BAME staff from 11.5% to 15%. Reacting to Monday's latest package, Sarpong said: ""I came to the BBC as an outsider. Before joining I had an idea of this being an organisation that did not want to change. What I found was something different: an organisation that had ambitious goals for diversity and inclusion but didn't know how to reach them."" She believes the commitment ""will help to drive real change that will be felt by all audiences"". ""I'm pleased that we're announcing this fund as the first of a series of bold steps that will help make the BBC an instrument of real change."" ""As a black woman,"" she added, ""I feel and share in the pain that so many are feeling worldwide. ""It makes it all the more important that we show up now not just with words but with meaningful action."" The cash injection will support diversity and inclusion across all genres of TV, including Children's, Education and Current Affairs. The BBC is calling it ""the biggest financial investment to on-air inclusion in the industry"", declaring that ""the media industry is not changing fast enough"". ""The measures announced today are designed to accelerate the pace of change in increasing diversity and inclusion both on and off air,"" the statement read.

""It's just not healthy,"" said Sir Steve. ""It's wrong. And yet, many people in the industry go along with it as if it is normal. It's not normal. It is anything but normal. It's blindingly, obviously wrong. It's blatant racism. Fact. I grew up with it."" The BBC's director of content, Charlotte Moore, said McQueen challenged her and the organisation to ""set meaningful targets and take proper action"" last year during the making of his upcoming anthology series, Small Axe.

"Harry Dunn, 19, died in hospital after his motorbike was in a crash near RAF Croughton Did Anne Sacoolas, the wife of a US intelligence officer in Britain, have diplomatic immunity when she allegedly killed Harry Dunn in a road accident in Northamptonshire last August? Harry's parents insist that she didn't, and that she can be tried for causing his death. The Foreign Office and the US embassy in London argue that she did. Now one of Britain's top experts on diplomacy has poured scorn on the British and American argument. The Dunns' lawyers, headed by Geoffrey Robertson QC, asked Sir Ivor Roberts, a former British ambassador in Serbia, Ireland and Italy, for his opinion. After retiring from the diplomatic service Sir Ivor was head of Trinity College, Oxford. His report on the arguments produced by the British and US governments, which I have read, is remarkably strongly worded. Anne Sacoolas, pictured on her wedding day in 2003, cited diplomatic immunity after the crash outside RAF Croughton Mrs Sacoolas's husband was an American intelligence officer based at RAF Croughton.  That gave him a certain level of diplomatic immunity.  The British and US governments maintain that this meant that, as his wife, Mrs Sacoolas had immunity too. Sir Ivor says this is ""a palpable absurdity"". Anne Sacoolas extradition refusal 'final' Suspect Anne Sacoolas 'wanted internationally' US officials decline meeting with Dunn family He quotes a letter of agreement between the Foreign Office and the US ambassador to Britain in August 1995 about the American personnel at RAF Croughton.  This says explicitly that diplomatic immunity for people like Mr Sacoolas would not apply for ""acts performed outside the course of their duties"". If Mr Sacoolas wasn't covered for acts outside his duties, Sir Ivor says, it would be absurd for Mrs Sacoolas, who had no official position, to be immune from prosecution when her husband wasn't. He doesn't mince his words. ""It was clearly not anticipated that this agreement might be dishonourably challenged by the US government through their embassy in London,"" he says. Tim Dunn and Charlotte Charles are going through ""torture"", says their son Niall In Sir Ivor's view both the British and US sides knew that back in 1995 they had agreed that ""both agents and their dependants"" were subject to British criminal law in their non-work activities at RAF Croughton. For the Americans to argue the opposite would, he said, be regarded by professional diplomats as a breach of good faith. Words and expressions like ""palpable absurdity"", ""dishonourably"" and ""breach of good faith"" are rare from a top expert on diplomacy. Although the judges at the High Court agreed that Sir Ivor was a leading figure in the study of diplomacy, they did not accept his report on the technical grounds that he was not a practising lawyer. They rejected an application by the Dunns to force the Foreign Office to disclose evidence relating to a ""secret agreement"" between the US and British governments.

"Shoppers have been making the most of the high street in Cardiff, as non-essential shops reopen After months of being closed many shops are opening for the first time and welcoming customers back. From Monday, non-essential stores are able to openfor the first time since coronavirus restrictions were brought in. But with strict social-distancing and hygiene measures in place, shopping will look very different compared to before coronavirus hit. The Welsh Retail Consortium said many shops were ""in a fight for survival"". Sara Jones, of the WRC, said lockdown had cost non-food stores Â£1.7bn a week during April and May, and with sales ""expected to remain weak"", many would not reopen their doors. She told BBC Radio Wales safety was ""the priority"" and that businesses had been working hard to achieve this. ""We just implore that people are considerate to fellow shoppers and people working in store. This video can not be played After months closed many shops are reopening ""Its going to be quite a mixed picture but the most important thing for us is that we have the opportunity to open now. Non-essential shops had been under ""a huge amount of pressure"" and their survival was on ""a wafer thin-edge"", she said. ""And we'll be doing all we can to encourage consumers back into shops safely and hope that confidence can grow in consumers to come back into store."" An initial surge of shoppers would be no guarantee they would stay, Ms Jones said. In some European nations business was brisk initially before dropping back. ""I would expect that to happen for some time here until consumer confidence returns back to almost normal levels,"" she said. Large queues where seen inparts of England after non-essential stores, including clothing shops like Primark, opened on 15 June. Health Minister Vaughan Gething has said he does not want to see a repeat of ""crowds bunched together outside"" when shops reopen in Wales. What do the latest lockdown rules mean? How our towns can meet social distancing rules Quiz: Do you really know Britain's lockdown rules? In Wales, people will only be able to visit non-essential stores if they are near their home -within five miles as a general rule- due to coronavirus regulations. Some retail giants and smaller shops have already confirmed they will not open branches despite being given the green light by the Welsh Government. People joined long queues to get into Ikea in the capital Primark, which does not sell online, has started trading again in England and Northern Ireland, but stores in Scotland and Wales will remain shut for now. The company, which has stores in Cardiff, Newport, Cwmbran, Llanelli, Swansea, Llandudno, Wrexham, said it was still working through plans for reopening and it would only open when it was ""convinced that it is safe and right to do so"". Debenhams has already said its Merthyr Tydfil branch will not reopen as measures are eased, but itsSwansea and Newport stores willafter the councils allowed the chain to defer paying business rates. Staff at some stores have been issued with visors in a bid to keep Covid-19 at bay If you go to your favourite shop from Monday, do not expect business as usual. The WRC said retailers had ""invested significantly in social distancing measures"", in an attempt to make it safe for customers and staff to shop. And with some councils, including Cardiff, alreadyracing to redesign busy high streets, to provide more space for shoppers and outdoor areas, our high streets may never look the same again. Friends snapped selfies of themselves in their masks Measures you could see from Monday include: Screens at pay points and floor markings to show social distancing Extra staff or security on doors to check the number of shoppers going in Socially distanced queuing to get into the store and to pay Staff wearing masks and extra cleaning being carried out Hand sanitiser at entrances and cleaning for baskets and trolleys Some changing rooms closed, while public toilets remain shut Allison Jenkins, from Marks & Spencer, said people will see very different clothing and home departments At Marks and Spencer staff have been working to get stores ready for reopening. While food halls have been open, with social distancing measures in place, clothing and home stores will reopen from Monday. Allison Jenkins, head of Wales and west region for Marks & Spencer, said this had helped them to prepare for reopening the rest of their business. When customers enter stores on Monday they will be given a brief description of where things are, and asked to respect the two metre rule by looking at floor markings. ""Customers will see very different clothing and home departments. There will be a lot less equipment on the shop floor to create an air of confidence,"" she said. ""We can't tell customers not to touch anything but we do ask them to minimise that as much as possible."" Ginevra Croft is getting ready to reopen - with a helping hand from her daughter Ginevra Croft runs a wool shop in Abergavenny, Monmouthshire and is ready to ""crack on with how it's going to be next"". But with shoppers still being told to stay local for another two weeks, she has concerns about how many customers will really come through her doors. ""What's that going to really do to our passing trade?"" she said. ""How busy are we we going to be when we open? How are we going to make it worthwhile for the business to be here with open doors?"" she said. A trip to your favourite shop may look very different to how you remember it In his shop, Richard Barber is preparing for the reopening, measuring out two metre floor markings. But Mr Barber, who runs Nicholls clothing and gifts shop in Abergavenny, said he knew it would be ""hard in the coming months"". ""We are retailers and this is what we do. We've got a really good team behind us,"" he said. ""We're hopeful, but I suppose at the end of the day, realistically, it is going to be tough in the coming months."" This video can not be played Cardiff's arcades are introducing social distancing Non-essential shops have been closed to the public in Wales since lockdown began in late March. Ms Jones, from the WRC, said with fewer customers able to enter stores and fewer expected to head to the high streets due to travel restrictions and safety concerns, many retailers were facing a difficult future. ""Retailers rely on getting customers through their doors in order to pay rent and employees' wages,"" she said. ""With consumer demand expected to remain low for some time, it is vital that businesses of all sizes can access government support to enable them to make adaptions to their stores where necessary,"" she said. Coronavirus: What do the latest lockdown rules say? Lockdown review gives Wales tourism sector 'hope' How our towns can meet social distancing rules On Mondayother changes to lockdown also mean people will be able to travel further than the five-mile general rule,but only on compassionate grounds, to see those who they are worried about. Outdoor sports courts and tracks will open, but only for non-contact sports, people can go to places of workshop for private prayer and non-professional elite athletes can resume training. People will also be able to get married if they adhere to lockdown regulations, stay local and socially distance. Some 190,000 people are employed in retailing and wholesaling in Wales. While many have worked through the pandemic and the return of others will be staggered, it's clear a significant part of the Welsh economy is opening for business today. There was some unhappiness among retailers in Wales about the uncertainty of having no specific reopening date, which there had been in England. But non-essential retailers were given three weeks to prepare ahead of a decision by the Welsh Government and have been allowed to open days after the end of that period. That might give some confidence to other sectors like tourism which has now been given three weeks' notice to prepare for reopening if the right safety measures are in place. But different sectors don't operate in isolation. Shops in tourist areas may now open but they will be affected by the fact the tourism industry is still in lockdown and people are being encouraged not to drive more than five miles.

"Michaela Coel stars in, wrote and co-directed I May Destroy You The BBC is to increase diversity by investing Â£100m of its TV budget over a three year period to produce ""diverse and inclusive content"". Director general Tony Hall has described the move, which will apply from April 2021, as ""a big leap"". The BBC has set itself a mandatory target - 20% of off-screen talent must come from under-represented groups. That includes those with a disability or from a BAME or disadvantaged socio-economic background. There will also be three ""tests"" for diversity in the BBC's TV output, with programmes needing to meet two of them to qualify - diverse stories and portrayal on-screen, diverse production teams and talent and diverse-led production companies. The announcement follows widespread Black Lives Matter protests, after the death of George Floyd while in police custody in the US. June Sarpong was appointed the BBC's first director of creative diversity in October 2019 ""The senseless killing of George Floyd - and what it tells us about the stain of systemic racism - has had a profound impact on all of us,"" said Lord Hall. ""It's made us question ourselves about what more we can do to help tackle racism - and drive inclusion within our organisation and in society as a whole. ""This is our response - it's going to drive change in what we make and who makes it.  It's a big leap forward - and we'll have more to announce in the coming weeks."" Recent BBC productions from ethnic minority creatives and featuring actors from BAME backgrounds include Michaela Coel's 12-part drama, I May Destroy You. Patrick Robinson plays Anthony Bryan in Sitting In Limbo It charts the fallout from a sexual assault andreceived rave reviews. Elsewhere, the story of Anthony Bryan and the Windrush scandal was brought to our screens in the feature-length drama, Sitting In Limbo. In fact, the diversity announcement arrives on the 72nd anniversary of the day the Empire Windrush arrived at the port of Tilbury symbolising the beginning of the migration of thousands of people from the Caribbean to the UK. This video can not be played BBC reporter Shamaan Freeman-Powell speaks to members of her family about the impact of moving to the UK Writing about my sexual assault was 'cathartic' 'Turning my brother's Windrush trauma into a TV drama' June Sarpong appointed BBC diversity director In October last year, TV presenter and campaigner June Sarpong was appointed as the BBC's director of creative diversity, as it pledged to ensure 50% of on-air roles will go to women by 2020, with targets of 15% for black, Asian and minority ethnic groups [BAME], 8% for disabled people and 8% for LGBT staff. Off air, the BBC promised at the time to increase the proportion of leadership roles filled by women from 44% to 50% by next year, and raise the share of such senior roles held by BAME staff from 11.5% to 15%. Reacting to Monday's latest package, Sarpong said: ""I came to the BBC as an outsider. Before joining I had an idea of this being an organisation that did not want to change. What I found was something different: an organisation that had ambitious goals for diversity and inclusion but didn't know how to reach them."" She believes the commitment ""will help to drive real change that will be felt by all audiences"". ""I'm pleased that we're announcing this fund as the first of a series of bold steps that will help make the BBC an instrument of real change."" ""As a black woman,"" she added, ""I feel and share in the pain that so many are feeling worldwide. ""It makes it all the more important that we show up now not just with words but with meaningful action."" The cash injection will support diversity and inclusion across all genres of TV, including Children's, Education and Current Affairs. The BBC is calling it ""the biggest financial investment to on-air inclusion in the industry"", declaring that ""the media industry is not changing fast enough"". ""The measures announced today are designed to accelerate the pace of change in increasing diversity and inclusion both on and off air,"" the statement read. Director Steve McQueen dedicated his two 2020 Cannes films, from his Small Axe series, to the late Mr Floyd McQueen dedicates Cannes films to George Floyd Speaking to The Observer,externalon Sunday, director Steve McQueen led the attack on racism in the British film and TV industry and the lack of diversity. ""It's just not healthy,"" said Sir Steve. ""It's wrong. And yet, many people in the industry go along with it as if it is normal. It's not normal. It is anything but normal. It's blindingly, obviously wrong. It's blatant racism. Fact. I grew up with it."" The BBC's director of content, Charlotte Moore, said McQueen challenged her and the organisation to ""set meaningful targets and take proper action"" last year during the making of his upcoming anthology series, Small Axe. ""He was right,"" said Moore. ""Today's announcement represents a truly transformational commitment to both on and off screen representation. ""Concrete, tangible action is the only way we can bring about real sustainable change."" Meanwhile, actors including Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michaela Coel and Noel Clarke, as well as David Oyelowo and Meera Syal, have signed an open letter demanding that the UK film and TV industry will now ""put its money and practices where its mouth is"". The document, revealed on Monday, has more than 4,000 signatures, including those of presenter Anita Rani and directors Asif Kapadia, Gurinder Chadha and Rapman.

"Harry Dunn, 19, died in hospital after his motorbike was in a crash near RAF Croughton Did Anne Sacoolas, the wife of a US intelligence officer in Britain, have diplomatic immunity when she allegedly killed Harry Dunn in a road accident in Northamptonshire last August? Harry's parents insist that she didn't, and that she can be tried for causing his death. The Foreign Office and the US embassy in London argue that she did. Now one of Britain's top experts on diplomacy has poured scorn on the British and American argument. The Dunns' lawyers, headed by Geoffrey Robertson QC, asked Sir Ivor Roberts, a former British ambassador in Serbia, Ireland and Italy, for his opinion. After retiring from the diplomatic service Sir Ivor was head of Trinity College, Oxford. His report on the arguments produced by the British and US governments, which I have read, is remarkably strongly worded. Anne Sacoolas, pictured on her wedding day in 2003, cited diplomatic immunity after the crash outside RAF Croughton Mrs Sacoolas's husband was an American intelligence officer based at RAF Croughton.  That gave him a certain level of diplomatic immunity.  The British and US governments maintain that this meant that, as his wife, Mrs Sacoolas had immunity too. Sir Ivor says this is ""a palpable absurdity"". Anne Sacoolas extradition refusal 'final' Suspect Anne Sacoolas 'wanted internationally' US officials decline meeting with Dunn family He quotes a letter of agreement between the Foreign Office and the US ambassador to Britain in August 1995 about the American personnel at RAF Croughton.  This says explicitly that diplomatic immunity for people like Mr Sacoolas would not apply for ""acts performed outside the course of their duties"". If Mr Sacoolas wasn't covered for acts outside his duties, Sir Ivor says, it would be absurd for Mrs Sacoolas, who had no official position, to be immune from prosecution when her husband wasn't. He doesn't mince his words. ""It was clearly not anticipated that this agreement might be dishonourably challenged by the US government through their embassy in London,"" he says. Tim Dunn and Charlotte Charles are going through ""torture"", says their son Niall In Sir Ivor's view both the British and US sides knew that back in 1995 they had agreed that ""both agents and their dependants"" were subject to British criminal law in their non-work activities at RAF Croughton. For the Americans to argue the opposite would, he said, be regarded by professional diplomats as a breach of good faith. Words and expressions like ""palpable absurdity"", ""dishonourably"" and ""breach of good faith"" are rare from a top expert on diplomacy. Although the judges at the High Court agreed that Sir Ivor was a leading figure in the study of diplomacy, they did not accept his report on the technical grounds that he was not a practising lawyer. They rejected an application by the Dunns to force the Foreign Office to disclose evidence relating to a ""secret agreement"" between the US and British governments.

"Groups of up to six people in Northern Ireland can meet indoors from Tuesday, the executive has agreed. First Minister Arlene Foster said it would be a ""new milestone"" in NI's journey out of the Covid-19 lockdown. It means Northern Ireland will become the first part of the UK to permit limited indoor gatherings. People will still be required to maintain social distancing when meeting indoors with family and friends. The executive said people were ""strongly advised"" to wear face coverings during indoor gatherings, and the regulations did not extend to overnight visits. Until now, people in Northern Ireland have only been allowed to gather outside in groups of 10 or fewer. Visiting people indoors in their own homes has been limited to adults who live alone, who canform a ""support bubble"" with one other household. In the Republic of Ireland people are already permitted to meet indoors, in groups of up to six. Speaking at the executive's press conference, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the new easement came with ""very strong public health advice"". ""I know the natural human reaction will be to hug each other, but for now distance is still needed to keep people safe,"" she added. Mrs Foster acknowledged people in Northern Ireland had ""weathered a particularly vicious storm"". ""I know many of you have been desperate to visit family and friends in their homes,"" she added. ""As positive as this step is, we cannot stress enough that the battle against Covid-19 is very much still ongoing."" Both the first and deputy first ministers said they also hoped the move would allow ""informal childcare arrangements"" to begin for families again. Indoor visits will not apply to those vulnerable people in Northern Ireland who are shielding, Ms O'Neill said. However from 6 July, shielders can meet outside in groups of up to six, maintaining social distancing. Q&A: What has and has not changed in NI lockdown? Who are we allowed to meet up with? People who are shielding alone will be able to form a support bubble with one other household from 6 July. New letters will be issued to about 95,000 people who are shielding, ahead of a planned ""pause"" in the shielding period, which is due to start from 31 July. Professor Ian Young, chief scientific advisor to the Department of Health, said he was confident people would want to wear face coverings when they understood they would help to protect loved ones when they meet  indoors. He said there may be settings where face coverings will become mandatory in the future but that would be a matter of a policy decision. ""If everyone would do it on a voluntary basis hopefully that will not be necessary,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme. He added that he was not aware of plans to make face coverings mandatory on public transport, but said it was something that would be kept under review. In other developments: Belfast City Council has agreed to waive all fees for pavement cafe licences, with applications now open for cafes, bars and restaurants to use outdoor space for tables and chairs The NI Sports Forum has written to the first and deputy first ministers asking them to take ""urgent action"" to reopen NI's indoor sports facilities Cinema owners in NI are also calling for a reopening date, with multiplexes in the Republic of Ireland set to resume trading from 20 July There will be a phased return of MoT and driver testing services - from 20 July, MoT testing for priority vehicle groups, including taxis and buses due a first time test, and vehicles not previously registered in NI will begin The Republic of Ireland's health authority plans to press ahead withthe launch of a coronavirus contact-tracing app. Two further people with coronavirus have died in the Republic of Ireland, bringing the country's death toll to 1,717 On Monday, ministers also discussed the 2m (6ft) social distancing rule, funding for childcare and school dinners, as well as the use of face coverings. No decision has yet been taken by ministers on whether face coverings on public transport should become mandatory, but Ms O'Neill said the issue was ""under review"". ""The advice remains that we strongly recommend it,"" added the deputy first minister. Social distancing in England is expected to be reduced from 2m to 1m in England from Tuesday, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson due to make an announcement. Mrs Foster said the executive would engage with Westminster officials about the issue, but no agreement had been reached by Stormont ministers. Several of her DUP ministerial colleagues have urged the distance to be reduced, in order to make it more viable for some sectors of the economy to resume trading. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? IMPACT:What the virus does to the body RECOVERY:How long does it take? LOCKDOWN:How can we lift restrictions? ENDGAME:How do we get out of this mess? The executive's announcement on indoor gatherings came as no new coronavirus-related deaths have been reported in Northern Ireland in the past 24 hours. One new confirmed case of the virus has been recorded, taking that total to 4,871. Thetotal number of deaths recorded by the Department of Health,externalin NI remains at 545 - this figure is mostly comprised of hospital deaths and where patients tested positive for the virus. Stormont's statistics agency Nisra releases weekly figures showing fatalities in all settings and by 12 June, itrecorded more than 800 Covid-linked deaths. Meanwhile, with just a week to go before parking and bus lane fines are reintroduced, motorists who break the rules are being issued with ""warnings"" from Monday. On-street parking charges and bus lane enforcement were suspended on 24 March as part of the coronavirus lockdown. But enforcement teams are back on the streets from 22 June to prepare for the return of charges and fines on 29 June. Parking attendants are back on the streets for the first time since March Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said it was part of the economic recovery plan to support businesses. However she acknowledged the return of parking charges and bus lane fines ""may not be popular for some"" but added she had to consider the needs of all road users.

"The 2.2 million people who have been self-isolating in England will no longer need to shield from 1 August. PM to announce on Tuesday if pubs can reopen Poorer households 'funding lockdown with debt' Children 'developing post-traumatic stress' from pandemic 'Do it at home' coronavirus saliva test trialled Updates on Monday 22 June Jennifer Meierhans, Kathryn Hamlett, Rob England and Jay Vydelingum Rob EnglandBBC News With news of big changes tothe coronavirus shielding programme in England, that's all from us today. We'll be back tomorrow morning at 07:30 BST with all your latest news and updates on the pandemic. Until then, stay safe. Following the announced changes to thecoronavirus shielding programme, a charity boss has called on the government to ensure people are not forced to choose between protecting their health and making ends meet. Lynda Thomas, Chief Executive at Macmillan Cancer Support said the easing was ""welcome news"" for some, but others may be left ""incredibly anxious about what's to come"". ""Itâs positive that the government have clarified how people can continue to access essential food, medicines, healthcare and financial support, however people need to be reassured that these systems will work,"" Ms Thomas said. She called on the government to make sure there were ""no gaps in the support available"" for the vulnerable group, and officials should also ensure employers ""met their legal obligations"" to support former shielding employees had a safe return to work. Ms Thomas continued: ""Those who are unable to work safely should be able to continue to access support from the Governmentâs Job Retention Scheme, whether they have been furloughed before or not."" Cumbria's director of public health, Colin Cox, says the rate of new coronavirus infections in the county each week is now between 25 and 50, ""much lower than than other parts of the North West"". Mr Cox was speaking as ministers prepared to relax the advice for people who have been ""shielding"", without contact outside their homes, since March, so they could spend more time outside and meeting people. He said he knew people who were extremely clinically vulnerable would not take decisions about going out and meeting people lightly, but the level of infections was ""relevant when people are trying to make informed decisions"". Some 2.2m can stop shielding from the start of August, but are they ready to rejoin the wider world? For the past three months about 2.2 million people in England with medical conditions that make them extremely vulnerable to coronavirus have been shielding. From next monththat comes to an end. At the beginning of lockdown, we spoke to some of the so-called shielded to see how they felt about avoiding all close contact for 12 weeks. Now, we've gone back to ask: how do you feel about the prospect of rejoining the wider world? Read more here. The UK has recorded its lowest number of daily confirmed coronavirus cases - 958 - since the lockdown began. The number of daily virus deaths also fell to 15, the lowest figure since 15 March, the day before the government began its daily televised briefings. However, the number of deaths are often lower on Mondays due to reporting lags over the weekend. Read more here. Health Secretary Matt Hancock says he will write to all those in the shielded groupto update them and online guidance will also be updated. He says that after months of relative isolation, he knows that it will take ""time to adjust"". He also says that seven supermarkets have agreed to give the shielded priority delivery slots while he urges employers to be sympathetic to their needs to help them return to work. The national shielded list will remain place, he adds, while the government stands ready to reintroduce restrictions if needed. After the government's announcement it will relax rules for the 2.2 million people who are shielding, there are calls from charities to do more to help those affected. Chris Askew, chief executive officer at Diabetes UK, said: ""The Government has again given little to no acknowledgement of the impact that these changes will have on thousands of people living with conditions such as diabetes, or detailed the support and protections they can expect. ""Thousands of people with diabetes are telling us that social distancing at work is not being made possible, and that employers' risk assessments are failing to protect them. ""The Government must do more, and take this opportunity to present clear and extensive guidance so that the people who it aims to protect have explicit and robust protections at work."" Shielding,the practice of taking extra steps to protect those considered ""high risk"" from coronavirus,external, is due to finish at the end of July in England. England's deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries said the extra steps had impact ""on many people's mental health"". ""The prevalence of the virus in the community is now lower and chances of getting infected are reduced, so we believe it is the right time to relax some of the advice so people can start to regain a degree of normality once more in their daily lives."" The government announced that from 6 July those shielding can meet in groups and form a social bubble with another household, although this is being kept under review. ""People should continue to follow social distancing guidance when outside their homes, as well as frequently washing their hands, to minimise the risk of becoming infected,"" Ms Harries added. People at risk of becoming severely ill if they get coronavirus should take extra precautions. Read more here. Those who've been confined to their home during the coronavirus pandemic, due to underlying health conditions, have been praised by the government as restrictions ease. New advice from 6 July allows those in England who are shielding to form a support bubble with another household, or meet in groups for up to six. Support packages will stop at the end of July, but people will retain their priority for supermarket delivery slots, and can still access help with shopping, medication, phone calls and transport to medical appointments, according to the Department for Health and Social Care. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""I know this has been incredibly tough. ""Shielding has involved not leaving your house for months, not seeing people you care about, not being able to wander to the park for some fresh air, or even pop to the shops for something you need. ""Now, with infection rates continuing to fall in our communities, our medical experts have advised that we can now ease some of these measures, while keeping people safe."" The 2.2 million people in England who are currently shielding can meet in groups from 6 July, the health secretary says - with shielding coming to a stop at the end of July. Matt Hancock says shielding has been ""incredibly tough"" as he set out how those who have been in the most vulnerable category will be able to meet in groups of up to six people outdoors, and some can form a ""support bubble"" with another household. Food and support packages for those who have been shielding will stop at the end of July. The new guidance says that from 6 July, those shielding from coronavirus can meet with people outside of their household outdoors in groups of six - as long as social distancing is maintained. People who are shielding and live alone, or are single parents with children, will also be able to create a ""support bubble"" with one other household of any size, in line with rules already in place for the wider population. With the prime minister expected to make an announcement tomorrow on whether pubs and restaurants can reopen on 4 July, it has led to questions about how the new rules would work. Last week the British Beer and Pub Association set out demandsin a letter,externalcalling for a definitive opening date from the government. Read more abouthow pub chains are preparing to reopen here. Martin Whitley, from Dartmoor Hawking, says his business has fallen through the net of support set up by the government. He says he may need to sell one or two of his ""most valuable"" birds if the business is going to survive. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"From 6 July those in England most vulnerable to the virus will have more freedom to see other people UK government reviewing whether 2m rule on social distancing in England should be reduced to 1m Greatest threat is not the virus itself but lack of global solidarity and leadership - WHO World Health Organization records highest one-day increase in total cases, with 183,000 added in one day Most came from Brazil, followed by the US and India South Korea is going through a ""second wave"" of coronavirus, officials say, even though new infections are falling France is re-opening cinemas, swimming pools and holiday centres. All children up to 15 are back at school Globally, there have been almost 9m confirmed cases since the outbreak began, with 467,000 deaths Edited by Rob Corp We're bringing our rolling coverage of the pandemic to a close until tomorrow morning. Thank you for joining us. It's been a busy day. To recap, here are some of the top headlines. Today's live page reporters were: Vicky Baker, Henri Astier, Alexandra Fouche, Ashitha Nagesh, Hamish Mackay, Mary OâConnor, Max Matza, Emma Harrison and Gavin Stamp. The editors were Thomas Poole and Rob Corp. Before we sign off our live coverage for the day, here are the main UK headlines. The Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils, has called for a ""plan"" for vulnerable households affected by news of an end to shielding for people in England from 1 August. From 6 July, the 2.2 million people who have been self-isolating at home will be able to meet up outdoors, in a group, with up to five others and form ""support bubbles"" with other households. Cllr Ian Hudspeth, chairman of the LGA's community wellbeing board, said the UK government's announcement provided ""much-need clarity"" for those who've been shielding, adding that ""clear communication"" was ""vital"" for people to adjust to the changes and councils' ability to support them. But he said a ""plan is needed"" to help people who can't afford access to priority supermarket delivery slots when the provision of emergency food parcels finishes and to support those whose ""wellbeing has suffered as a result of prolonged isolation"". Mexico has announced a deal to resume sending temporary farm workers to Canada to help with summer planting and harvesting. Canada and Mexico ""reached an agreement to improve sanitary conditions of the nationals who work on farms"", the Mexican foreign ministry said. Canada relies on about 60,000 temporary migrant labourers - mostly from Latin America and the Caribbean - to help with chronic employment shortages in the agricultural industry. Last week, Mexico said it would hit the ""pause button"" on sending about 5,000 workers to Canada after at least two of its nationals died after contracting Covid-19 on farms. The Rath Yatra in Puri in 2017 - before social distancing India's Supreme Court will allow an annual Hindu festival to go ahead in the city of Puri, in Odisha state, on Tuesday - but in a ""restricted manner"". The Lord Jagannath Rath Yatra festival had previously been banned because of the coronavirus. But central and state governments argued that it should go ahead without public participation, saying it could be broadcast on TV instead. Since the Supreme Court's decision, officials in Puri shut the city down, imposing a curfew that will stay in place until Wednesday. This is so the festival can go ahead without the public taking part. The festival involves a procession with Hindu idols in large chariots. It usually attracts huge crowds. Grigor Dimitrov (centre) sat with Alexander Zverev and Novak Djokovic during the first Adria Tour event in Belgrade last week As professional tennis tours have been put on pause until at least August, a number of domestic and regional exhibition tournaments between players based in the same part of the world have sprung up. But the Balkans-based Adria Tour event set up by world number one Novak Djokovic has drawn criticismafter two players tested positive for Covid-19. The latest critic is British men's number one Dan Evans, who says Djokovic should ""feel some responsibility"" after players Grigor Dimitrov and Borna Coric tested positive for the virus. Dimitrov played Coric on Saturday in the second leg of the world number one's event in Zadar, Croatia - where players were not obliged to observe social distancing rules after a lockdown easing there. Evans, 30, thinks Djokovic - who is awaiting the results of his Covid test - has some questions to answer. ""Put it this way, I don't think you should be having a players' party and then dancing all over each other,"" Evans said. ""He should feel some responsibility in his event and how it's transpired."" The first leg of the tour in Serbia concluded with players dancing close together in a Belgrade nightclub. Meanwhile, Britain's Sir Andy Murray says it has been a ""lesson for us all"" to take the situation ""extremely seriously"". Organisers said Sunday's final in Zadar has been cancelled ""as a precaution"" and insisted epidemiological measures in each nation where matches were played were ""strictly followed"" at all times. Health officials in the Netherlands have announced there were no new coronavirus deaths in the last 24 hours - the first time the country's daily death toll has been zero since the beginning of March. There were, however, 69 new infections. The Netherlands started easing its lockdown on 13 May, and officials said it would continue to be eased in phases until 1 September. The country's total death toll is 6,090, and there have been 49,658 cases. White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany has denied that President Trump ordered a slowdown of virus testing. It comes after Trump commented during a rally in Oklahoma over the weekend that the ""bad part"" of testing is that ""you're going to find more cases"". ""So I said to my people, slow the testing down please."" But the White House on Monday denied that Trump's comments reflected an actual presidential order. âAny suggestion that testing has been curtailed is not rooted in fact,â McEnany said on Monday. âIt was a comment that he made in jest,â she added.

On a call to state governors on Monday, Vice-President Mike Pence defended Trump's remark as ""a passing observation"". But in an interview on Monday, Trump declined to say that he had not ordered testing to be slowed. ""If it did slow down - frankly, I think weâre way ahead of ourselves, if you want to know the truth,â he told Scripps television. âWeâve done too good of a job. The reason we have more cases is because we do more testing.â Banff National Park previously received around 4m visitors per year The Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Alberta, has fined six American nationals who were found sneaking into Banff National Park. Non-essential travel between the US and Canada is prohibited until 21 July, but some Americans have been allowed to cross the border as long as they are en route to the US state of Alaska, - a more than 1,000 mile (1,600km) drive from Canada's southern border. But to be allowed into Canada, Americans must promise to remain in their cars as much as possible, avoid hotels and shops and forgo any unnecessary stops. The C$1,200 fines ($880, Â£700) were issued near the Lake Louise area of the park to Americans who had stopped to hike. Ashitha NageshBBC News, London Children across the UK are developing mental health conditions, including post-traumatic stress, because of the pandemic, a charity has warned. As well as anxiety about their loved ones' health, many children are facing social isolation and hunger, the Childhood Trust says. Children in poverty who don't have the internet at home are effectively shut out of online lessons while schools are closed. Few are able to access therapy. Teachers warn this will lead to entrenched inequalities between them and classmates from more affluent families. Read the full story here. Another 23 deaths have been reported in the last 24 hours in France, bringing the country's total death toll up to 29,663. The French health ministry also says the number of people in hospital has gone down by 130, and is now 9,693. Schools in the country reopened today for pupils up to the age of 15. Earlier this month, President Emmanuel Macron declared France had won its ""first victory"" against the coronavirus, before announcing the greatest lifting of lockdown measures in the country so far. As we heard earlier, the 2.2 million clinically extremely vulnerable people in England who have been self-isolating at home from coronavirus for the past three months will no longer need to do this from 1 August. From 6 July, they will be able to meet up to six people outdoors and form ""support bubbles"" with other households. At the beginning of lockdown, the BBC's Joe Lee spoke to some of those shielding to see how they felt about avoiding all close contact for 12 weeks. He's now gone back to ask how they feel about the prospect of rejoining the wider world - with some varying responses. Michael Winehouse, a charity fundraiser who has cystic fibrosis, has been shielding at home with his wife and their four-year-old son. He said shielding had ""certainly worked"" for people with his condition, but now the ""novelty"" had worn off, he was looking forward to doing normal things like doing a shop or seeing family and friends. ""I can't live inside forever"", he says, ""I'm just going to have to risk assess every situation, avoid those places where bugs are likely to linger."" You can read Joe's full piece here. Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent Next year's A-levels and GCSEs in England could be pushed back later into the summer to allow more teaching time,says Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. This would allow schools to catch up some of the time lost since the lockdown. Mr Williamson told MPs he would be consulting the exam regulator Ofqual about extra time to deliver courses. It follows a similar proposal announced for exams in Scotland. England's education secretary, speaking in the House of Commons, said he wanted to find a way to ""add more teaching time"". The total number of cases worldwide has now exceeded nine million, according to the count kept by the US-based Johns Hopkins University. It says the exact number of global infections is 9,003,042. A total of 469,122 people have now died. Advice in Wales asking people vulnerable to coronavirus to self-isolate has not changed, the Welsh Government has said. It issued the statement afterUK ministers announced the tapering of the precautions in England, where people will no longer need to shield from 1 August. From 6 July, people in England will be able to meet up to six people outdoors and form 'support bubbles' with other households. But in Wales, shielding advice remains in place until 16 August. The advice includes people who have received organ transplants, those on immuno-suppressant drugs, and pregnant women. You can read more here. Reality Check The R number refers to the reproduction rate of the virus. If the R is below 1, the spread of infection is slowing but if itâs above 1 itâs speeding up. Across the UK, the R is between 0.7â0.9 and the number is falling day to day by between 2-4%, according to the latest government data. In Germany, where the lockdown was eased earlier than in the UK, the R number has jumped to 2.88 as of Sunday, according to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), the countryâs leading public health body. As recently as Friday, Germanyâs R number was estimated to be as low as 1.06, but it increased significantly after an outbreak at a meat processing plant in the north-west of the country led to more than 1,500 workers being infected with Covid-19. However, the RKI has cautioned that the jump in the R rate does not show an imminent threat of a second wave nationwide and is instead âmainly related to local outbreaksâ. âSince case numbers in Germany are generally low, these local outbreaks have a relatively strong influence on the value of the reproduction number,â the RKI said in a statement. Read more about how the R number is calculated here. Reality Check Health Secretary Matt Hancock was asked at today's Downing Street briefing about what employment protections would be in place for people shielding who might not be able to return to work. An estimated 627,000 âclinical extremely vulnerableâ people normally work, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Almost 40% of these individuals are working from home and another 40% are furloughed or receiving self-employment support. Most of the people furloughed say they would not be able to work from home. However, 17% of those people who normally work have said they have stopped working and not receiving support from job retention schemes. A small amount of people - 5% - said they were currently working outside of the home. It does not tell us what financial support those not receiving job retention payments are getting. The estimates are based on surveys conducted between 28 May and 3 June. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent The pausing of shielding in England from 1 August will affect more than two million people. And it was interesting that, if shielding needs to be
resumed, Dr Jenny Harries felt it was likely to be imposed in a more targeted
form â with very few children asked to shield in future. ""Only"" 36 children had been admitted to an intensive care
unit with Covid-19. But while the topic of todayâs press conference was
health-related, this was also about the economy and getting people back in to employment. From 1 August those who are shielding and
canât work from home will be able to return to work if their business is ""covid
secure"". Good news for many. But for those who are anxious about returning, then itâs
likely they will no longer be eligible for the statutory sick pay they have
been given since April. Giving people the confidence to return to work is still a
challenge for the government. As
     is getting parents to send children back to school. The health secretary also underlined that to get the economy
moving, infrastructure projects will be ""accelerated"". And at this time of year, minds turn to holidays and not
just work. So Matt Hancock sought to reassure us that the government
was ""working very intensively"" on ""travel corridors"" - though the quarantine policy as a whole was unlikely to be
withdrawn. In case you missed today's government coronavirus briefing, here is a quick round-up of the key points: The last question is about the risk of infection hotspots in the north-east of England and whether economic deprivation or care home policies in the region have contributed to the large number of cases in places such as Bishop Auckland, Blythe Valley and North West Durham. In response, Hancock says those living in the region have made ""enormous sacrifices"" in recent months and the result is that the R number is under one there and cases are falling. He says the government will look into regional anomalies and stresses that the levelling-up agenda that the Conservatives emphasised at the last election is even more important going forward, with what he describes as the ""more even distribution of opportunity of wealth and health"". Harries says people in the North East should be ""careful and cautious"" as they go forward, but not anxious.  Â© 2025 BBC.

As non-essential shops in Wales reopen, Cardiff's Castle Street has closed to enable a covered, outdoor seating area to be built. Cardiff Council said it would be used by restaurants and cafes when they got the go-ahead to reopen. The authority said it would help them ""serve customers they would otherwise lose"" because of social distancing requirements on their premises. Allow Twitter content?

Union leaders have welcomed the move by the 2 Sisters Food Group to pay all 560 staff employed at a Llangefni chicken processing factory as they self-isolate. So far,158 workers there have tested positivefor coronavirus. All staff will be paid in full during a two-week self-isolation period, paid for out of a Â£1m hardship fund established by the company to support employees during the current crisis.

Bridgend council is the latest in Wales to say its schools will reopen for three weeks instead of four.

This graph shows the number of deaths of people with Covid-19 in Wales that have been confirmed by Public Health Wales. Today it announced a single additional death for the third day running, all in north Wales. The graph shows the number of deaths according to the day they occurred, rather than the day they were announced. Local Democracy Reporting Service A Covid-19 outbreak at an Anglesey chicken plant has had a âprofound effectâ and caused âgenuine fearâ, local councillors say. After 158 members of staff at the 2 Sisters poultry preparation factory in Llangefni tested positive for coronavirus, the Welsh Government has not ruled out maintaining stricter lockdown restrictions on Anglesey to try and further contain its spread. Councillor Nicola Roberts, who represents Canolbarth MÃ´n on Anglesey council, said she would not ârelishâ a local lockdown but would accept it if it was felt necessary. âMy main concern would be peopleâs mental health if they were under lockdown while the rest of the country is carrying on as it has, although if necessary then weâd have to abide with it,"" she said. Carwyn Jones, Anglesey councillor responsible for economic development, added they would have to think carefully about allowing tourism to resume on the island. ""Safeguarding and protecting the people of Anglesey is our key priority and all decisions going forward have to be made with safety first,â he said. Officials have not ruled out special measures to tackle a coronavirus outbreak at the 2 Sisters factory at Llangefni One further person with coronavirus has died in Wales, taking the total to 1,478. The death was declared by Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, which covers north Wales. This map shows the number of deaths announced to date by each health board. The first minister of Wales says he has not ruled outreducing the two-metre social distancing rule to one metre. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to relax the two-metre rule in England, with some conditions.

The pub industry has been calling for the rule to be eased, saying they would struggle otherwise. This video can not be played Coronavirus social distancing advice: What two metres looks like Another person has died with coronavirus in Wales, taking the total to 1,478. Public Health Wales (PHW) figures also show there were 71 new cases reported, meaning 15,197 people have tested positive for Covid-19. PHW publishes daily statistics of deaths, mostly occurring in hospitals, but only when the virus has been confirmed by laboratories. The figures for deaths are revised and numbers are added to the correct date retrospectively. Office for National Statistics figures are published weekly andinclude all registered deaths, including those in care homes and at home, where Covid-19 is suspected, as well as laboratory-confirmed cases. A total of 23 prisoners and nine jail staff in England and Wales have died after testing positive for Covid-19, the UK government has confirmed. One prisoner was at Berwyn jail in Wrexham and another at Usk, Monmouthshire. The figures, to 12 June, have been given in a written parliamentary answer to Liz Saville Roberts MP, the Plaid Cymru justice spokeswoman. Three of those who died were at HMP Littlehey, the Cambridgeshire jail for male sex offenders. There were two each at Altcourse, Liverpool, and Channings Wood, Devon.
Two staff members died from both Pentonville, London, and Wymott prisons, Lancashire. Justice Minister Lucy Frazer said: âThe government has put robust measures in place to protect staff and offenders from Covid-19 and introduce âcompartmentalisationâ to isolate those prisoners with symptoms, shield the vulnerable and quarantine new arrivals.â First Minister Mark Drakeford has said if there is a public need to impose a localised lockdown on Anglesey to stop the spread of Covid-19, he would introduce the measures - but his approach would be âproportionateâ and based on evidence. Mr Drakeford was responding to the outbreak at the 2 Sisters meat processing plant in Llangefni, where 158 workers tested positive for the virus. Speaking during the Welsh Governmentâs daily coronavirus briefing, the first minister said he was speaking to local health officials on the island this afternoon to review what was happening and to see whether further measures needed to be put in place. Mr Drakeford added that the outbreak had been in a closed setting and the success of the testing and tracing system meant the Welsh Government was able to keep on top of whether the virus had spread any further from the factory into the wider community. Commenting on whether there was a need for a localised lockdown, he said: âOur approach will be proportionate, it will draw on the evidence, it will draw on local intelligence and information and then we will take the action that is required in a way that responds directly to the outbreak, but doesn't do so in a way that unfairly places restrictions on people where there would be no public health advantage to doing so."" The first minister insisted the Welsh Government followed the advice they were given in discharging asymptomatic hospital patients back into care homes without testing them for Covid-19 in the early days of the pandemic. He was askedafter it emerged that 1,000 patients were dischargedwithout being tested, with Care Forum Wales saying this turned ""safe havens into coronavirus warzones"". Mark Drakeford said ministers did not have âthe virtue of hindsightâ when they had to make decisions to deal with the pandemic. âEarly on, the advice to was test symptomatic people, anybody who had symptoms were tested before they left hospital, and the advice early on was that the testing of people without symptoms would not have given useful outcomes,"" he said. âWhen the advice changed, we changed the practice. ""We changed practice probably three times during the coronavirus crisis in relation to care homes and whenever the advice changed, thatâs what the government did.â First Minister Mark Drakeford says there ""certainly is more to do"" in addressing tackling discrimination and disadvantage for black, Asian or minority ethnic (BAME) people in Wales. He pointed to the ""need for us to do more"" to ensure decision-makers in Wales ""reflect the society in which we live"". Mr Drakeford added that ""we have had a proud cross-party commitment in Wales throughout the devolution era"" to addressing discrimination people from different backgrounds face in Wales, but said ""there is more to do."" The first minister was responding to a question about the Welsh Government advisory group report into the impact of Covid-19 on Wales' BAME communities, which highlighted a ""lack of action on race equality"". Mr Drakeford added: ""Before the coronavirus crisis hit, we had commissioned and concluded a radical review of the way in which public appointments are made here in Wales. ""[The review is to] make sure the people who are appointed to those important positions reflect the diversity of Wales. ""We are going to implement that report and we're going to begin its implementation as soon as we are able to resume making public appointments in Wales."" First Minister Mark Drakeford says a report into the impact of Covid-19 on black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people ""touches on all aspects of life"". He said it highlighted issues ranging ""from housing conditions and higher levels of mental illness to the way we teach children in schools and collect data about ethnicity"". Mr Drakeford said the Welsh Government would work with the education watchdog Estyn to ensure a review of Welsh history teaching takes full account of ""Welsh, and wider BAME (black, Asian or ethnic minority) history, identity and culture"". The first minister said he would set up a working group to oversee the development of learning resources and identify gaps in current resources or training. He said a helpline was being set up to provide guidance and support for BAME communities in response to the pandemic. Mr Drakeford said the Welsh Government was already working with health and social care employers and trades unions on Covid risk assessments for BAME employees and he hoped to roll this out to other workplaces and sectors in Wales. These risk assessments should be seen as ""an investment in people and not a burden"", he said. First Minister Mark Drakeford saystoday's report looking at the underlying socio-economic and environmental issues impacting black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communitiesis            ""sobering and powerful"". Written by Prof Emmanuel Ogbonna, Mr Drakeford says the report ""speaks of peopleâs lived experienced of racism, a persisting culture of racial discrimination and structural inequalities in Wales"". The first minister said the report states that the coronavirus pandemic âhas further exposed existing racial inequalities in Walesâ. Mr Drakeford added: ""We know that coronavirus has targeted areas of inequality and deprivation in Wales â as Prof Ogbonna says, being black, Asian or from an ethnic minority pre-disposes people to the discrimination that makes it difficult for them to cope with the pandemic.""

"The 2.2 million people who have been self-isolating in England will no longer need to shield from 1 August. PM to announce on Tuesday if pubs can reopen Poorer households 'funding lockdown with debt' Children 'developing post-traumatic stress' from pandemic 'Do it at home' coronavirus saliva test trialled Updates on Monday 22 June Jennifer Meierhans, Kathryn Hamlett, Rob England and Jay Vydelingum Rob EnglandBBC News With news of big changes tothe coronavirus shielding programme in England, that's all from us today. We'll be back tomorrow morning at 07:30 BST with all your latest news and updates on the pandemic. Until then, stay safe. Following the announced changes to thecoronavirus shielding programme, a charity boss has called on the government to ensure people are not forced to choose between protecting their health and making ends meet. Lynda Thomas, Chief Executive at Macmillan Cancer Support said the easing was ""welcome news"" for some, but others may be left ""incredibly anxious about what's to come"". ""Itâs positive that the government have clarified how people can continue to access essential food, medicines, healthcare and financial support, however people need to be reassured that these systems will work,"" Ms Thomas said. She called on the government to make sure there were ""no gaps in the support available"" for the vulnerable group, and officials should also ensure employers ""met their legal obligations"" to support former shielding employees had a safe return to work. Ms Thomas continued: ""Those who are unable to work safely should be able to continue to access support from the Governmentâs Job Retention Scheme, whether they have been furloughed before or not."" Cumbria's director of public health, Colin Cox, says the rate of new coronavirus infections in the county each week is now between 25 and 50, ""much lower than than other parts of the North West"". Mr Cox was speaking as ministers prepared to relax the advice for people who have been ""shielding"", without contact outside their homes, since March, so they could spend more time outside and meeting people. He said he knew people who were extremely clinically vulnerable would not take decisions about going out and meeting people lightly, but the level of infections was ""relevant when people are trying to make informed decisions"". Some 2.2m can stop shielding from the start of August, but are they ready to rejoin the wider world? For the past three months about 2.2 million people in England with medical conditions that make them extremely vulnerable to coronavirus have been shielding. From next monththat comes to an end. At the beginning of lockdown, we spoke to some of the so-called shielded to see how they felt about avoiding all close contact for 12 weeks. Now, we've gone back to ask: how do you feel about the prospect of rejoining the wider world? Read more here. The UK has recorded its lowest number of daily confirmed coronavirus cases - 958 - since the lockdown began. The number of daily virus deaths also fell to 15, the lowest figure since 15 March, the day before the government began its daily televised briefings. However, the number of deaths are often lower on Mondays due to reporting lags over the weekend. Read more here. Health Secretary Matt Hancock says he will write to all those in the shielded groupto update them and online guidance will also be updated. He says that after months of relative isolation, he knows that it will take ""time to adjust"". He also says that seven supermarkets have agreed to give the shielded priority delivery slots while he urges employers to be sympathetic to their needs to help them return to work. The national shielded list will remain place, he adds, while the government stands ready to reintroduce restrictions if needed. After the government's announcement it will relax rules for the 2.2 million people who are shielding, there are calls from charities to do more to help those affected. Chris Askew, chief executive officer at Diabetes UK, said: ""The Government has again given little to no acknowledgement of the impact that these changes will have on thousands of people living with conditions such as diabetes, or detailed the support and protections they can expect. ""Thousands of people with diabetes are telling us that social distancing at work is not being made possible, and that employers' risk assessments are failing to protect them. ""The Government must do more, and take this opportunity to present clear and extensive guidance so that the people who it aims to protect have explicit and robust protections at work."" Shielding,the practice of taking extra steps to protect those considered ""high risk"" from coronavirus,external, is due to finish at the end of July in England. England's deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries said the extra steps had impact ""on many people's mental health"". ""The prevalence of the virus in the community is now lower and chances of getting infected are reduced, so we believe it is the right time to relax some of the advice so people can start to regain a degree of normality once more in their daily lives."" The government announced that from 6 July those shielding can meet in groups and form a social bubble with another household, although this is being kept under review. ""People should continue to follow social distancing guidance when outside their homes, as well as frequently washing their hands, to minimise the risk of becoming infected,"" Ms Harries added. People at risk of becoming severely ill if they get coronavirus should take extra precautions. Read more here. Those who've been confined to their home during the coronavirus pandemic, due to underlying health conditions, have been praised by the government as restrictions ease. New advice from 6 July allows those in England who are shielding to form a support bubble with another household, or meet in groups for up to six. Support packages will stop at the end of July, but people will retain their priority for supermarket delivery slots, and can still access help with shopping, medication, phone calls and transport to medical appointments, according to the Department for Health and Social Care. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""I know this has been incredibly tough. ""Shielding has involved not leaving your house for months, not seeing people you care about, not being able to wander to the park for some fresh air, or even pop to the shops for something you need. ""Now, with infection rates continuing to fall in our communities, our medical experts have advised that we can now ease some of these measures, while keeping people safe."" The 2.2 million people in England who are currently shielding can meet in groups from 6 July, the health secretary says - with shielding coming to a stop at the end of July. Matt Hancock says shielding has been ""incredibly tough"" as he set out how those who have been in the most vulnerable category will be able to meet in groups of up to six people outdoors, and some can form a ""support bubble"" with another household. Food and support packages for those who have been shielding will stop at the end of July. The new guidance says that from 6 July, those shielding from coronavirus can meet with people outside of their household outdoors in groups of six - as long as social distancing is maintained. People who are shielding and live alone, or are single parents with children, will also be able to create a ""support bubble"" with one other household of any size, in line with rules already in place for the wider population. With the prime minister expected to make an announcement tomorrow on whether pubs and restaurants can reopen on 4 July, it has led to questions about how the new rules would work. Last week the British Beer and Pub Association set out demandsin a letter,externalcalling for a definitive opening date from the government. Read more abouthow pub chains are preparing to reopen here. Martin Whitley, from Dartmoor Hawking, says his business has fallen through the net of support set up by the government. He says he may need to sell one or two of his ""most valuable"" birds if the business is going to survive. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

England's education secretary, speaking in the House of Commons, said he wanted to find a way to ""add more teaching time"". A man who was in a coma for two days due to coronavirus has been clapped out of hospital by staff members after his recovery. Mohammed Azeem, 35, was treated at Bradford Royal Infirmary and says he has nothing but praise for the health workers who cared for him.

"Efforts to increase the number of black managers at British companies have stalled, according to a business group. Just 1.5% of top bosses at UK companies are black. That compares to 3% of the population of England and Wales. While the ratio is an improvement on the 1.4% of 2014, there is much ground still to cover, said Sandra Kerr, race director at Business in the Community, which has campaigned for workplace racial equality for 25 years. ""It is clear that black people continue to be under-represented at a senior level,"" she said. ""Black livelihoods matter and employers need to take urgent action to ensure that their organisation is inclusive and a place where people of any ethnic background can thrive and succeed."" 'My African name stopped me getting job opportunities' The new figures coincide with the 72nd anniversary of the arrival of HMT Empire Windrush, which brought workers from the Caribbean to the UK. Employers should make their companies welcoming to black workers, said Sandra Kerr, race director at Business in the Community They also come amid global protests over racial inequality and as some older British companies come to terms with their historical links with the slave trade. Pub chain Greene King and insurance market Lloyd's of London apologised for those ties last week. One of Greene King's founders owned a number of plantations in the Caribbean. Meanwhile, maritime insurance - which was focused on Lloyd's - thrived on the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Lloyd's has said it will donate to charities representing black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) groups. Greene King said it would make a ""substantial investment to benefit the BAME community"". In March, a report from the Carnegie Trust, University College London's Centre for Longitudinal Studies and Operation Black Vote said young BAME members are 47% more likely to to be on a zero-hours contract. The researchers compared the experiences of 25-year-olds in England. They looked at people who are white, as well mixed-race, Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Black African and Caribbean, and other minority ethnicities, sometimes collectively known as BAME workers.

"Harry Dunn, 19, died in hospital after his motorbike was in a crash near RAF Croughton Did Anne Sacoolas, the wife of a US intelligence officer in Britain, have diplomatic immunity when she allegedly killed Harry Dunn in a road accident in Northamptonshire last August? Harry's parents insist that she didn't, and that she can be tried for causing his death. The Foreign Office and the US embassy in London argue that she did. Now one of Britain's top experts on diplomacy has poured scorn on the British and American argument. The Dunns' lawyers, headed by Geoffrey Robertson QC, asked Sir Ivor Roberts, a former British ambassador in Serbia, Ireland and Italy, for his opinion. After retiring from the diplomatic service Sir Ivor was head of Trinity College, Oxford. His report on the arguments produced by the British and US governments, which I have read, is remarkably strongly worded. Anne Sacoolas, pictured on her wedding day in 2003, cited diplomatic immunity after the crash outside RAF Croughton Mrs Sacoolas's husband was an American intelligence officer based at RAF Croughton.  That gave him a certain level of diplomatic immunity.  The British and US governments maintain that this meant that, as his wife, Mrs Sacoolas had immunity too. Sir Ivor says this is ""a palpable absurdity"". Anne Sacoolas extradition refusal 'final' Suspect Anne Sacoolas 'wanted internationally' US officials decline meeting with Dunn family He quotes a letter of agreement between the Foreign Office and the US ambassador to Britain in August 1995 about the American personnel at RAF Croughton.  This says explicitly that diplomatic immunity for people like Mr Sacoolas would not apply for ""acts performed outside the course of their duties"". If Mr Sacoolas wasn't covered for acts outside his duties, Sir Ivor says, it would be absurd for Mrs Sacoolas, who had no official position, to be immune from prosecution when her husband wasn't. He doesn't mince his words. ""It was clearly not anticipated that this agreement might be dishonourably challenged by the US government through their embassy in London,"" he says. Tim Dunn and Charlotte Charles are going through ""torture"", says their son Niall In Sir Ivor's view both the British and US sides knew that back in 1995 they had agreed that ""both agents and their dependants"" were subject to British criminal law in their non-work activities at RAF Croughton. For the Americans to argue the opposite would, he said, be regarded by professional diplomats as a breach of good faith. Words and expressions like ""palpable absurdity"", ""dishonourably"" and ""breach of good faith"" are rare from a top expert on diplomacy. Although the judges at the High Court agreed that Sir Ivor was a leading figure in the study of diplomacy, they did not accept his report on the technical grounds that he was not a practising lawyer. They rejected an application by the Dunns to force the Foreign Office to disclose evidence relating to a ""secret agreement"" between the US and British governments. But this was a preliminary hearing, and it seems reasonable to assume that Sir Ivor's scathing opinion of the case presented by the Foreign Office and the US embassy will have an influence on the case as it continues. In a statement, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: ""Anne Sacoolas held diplomatic immunity on arrival in the UK on 24 July until her departure from the UK. ""Under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, any waiver of immunity must be express. ""The historic arrangements covering Croughton contained no such waiver for family members. ""We are committed to revising this anomaly in the arrangements at Croughton so they cannot be used in this way again.""

"Avon and Somerset Police said it wanted the public to help identify several people Police have released images of people they want to speak to as part of an investigation into criminal damage to the Edward Colston statue in Bristol. The slave trader's effigy was torn down and thrown into the harbour during an anti-racism protest earlier this month. Avon and Somerset Police said it wanted the public to help identify 15 people. Det Supt Liz Hughes said ""in the eyes of the law"" a crime had been committed and the force was ""duty-bound to investigate without fear or favour"". She added the incident attracted worldwide attention and there was ""no denying it has polarised public opinion"". Police said a ""large amount"" of footage and photographs of the incident has been examined ""I'd like to reassure people we're carrying out a thorough, fair and proportionate investigation and have sought early investigative advice from the Crown Prosecution Service."" She added a ""large amount"" of footage and photographs of the incident, and CCTV footage from the area, had been examined, and 18 people had been isolated. ""We've carried out a number of enquiries to try and establish who these people are, in the hope we wouldn't need to release their images into the public domain and have managed to identify a small number who we're making arrangements with to get their account of events. ""However, despite every effort being made to identify the remaining people we'd like to talk to, we still don't know who they are which is why we're now releasing images of them in the hope the public can help."" Det Supt Liz Hughes said police were ""confident someone will know them and be able to provide us with their name"" She said some of the images were ""not as clear as we'd like"" and the fact some of the people were wearing masks further hindered their inquiry. ""But we're confident someone will know them and be able to provide us with their name."" The statue was pulled from its plinth in the city centre and rolled into the harbour at about 14:30 BST on 7 June during a Black Lives Matter demonstration.
