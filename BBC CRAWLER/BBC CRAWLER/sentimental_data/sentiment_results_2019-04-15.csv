"Watching the cathedral go up in flames is deeply upsetting for the locals No other site represents France quite like Notre-Dame. Its main rival as a national symbol, the Eiffel Tower, is little more than a century old. Notre-Dame has stood tall above Paris since the 1200s. It has given its name to one of the country's literary masterpieces. Victor Hugo's novel Hunchback of Notre-Dame is known to the French simply as Notre Dame de Paris. The last time the cathedral suffered major damage was during the French Revolution, when statues of saints were hacked by anti-clerical hotheads. The building survived the 1871 Commune uprising, as well as two world wars, largely unscathed. It is impossible to overstate how shocking it is to watch such an enduring embodiment of our country burn. Locals are not famous for their sunny disposition, but few can walk along the banks of the Seine in the central part of the capital without feeling their spirits rise at the majestic bulk of Notre-Dame. It is one of the few sights sure to make a Parisian feel good about living there. This video can not be played The major operation to try to save the building Like all cherished places everywhere, it is not one residents visit very often. In the three decades I spent in my native city, I can't have been inside Notre-Dame more than three or four times - and then only with foreign visitors. There are many of those. The cathedral is not just the most popular tourist site in Western Europe. Eight centuries after its completion, it is also still a place of worship - about 2,000 services are held there every year. But it is also much more than a religious site. President Emmanuel Macron has expressed the shock of a ""whole nation"" at the fire.  As Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said, Notre Dame is ""part of our common heritage"". Many of those looking on as flames engulf the building are in tears. Their dismay is shared by believers and non-believers alike in a nation where faith has long ceased to be a binding force. Massive fire ravages Notre-Dame cathedral Massive flames at Notre-Dame.

"A major fire has destroyed the roof of Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris, toppling its spire and leaving the remaining structure of the building in a weakened state. France's culture minister Franck Riester said the ""most precious treasures"" have been saved, including what is said to be the crown of thorns worn by Jesus and the tunic of Saint Louis. The emergency services worked late into Monday night to salvage the art and other priceless pieces stored in the cathedral. The wooden interior has been destroyed. But which other features in the 850-year-old Gothic structure make it stand out in a city of iconic buildings? The cathedral has three rose windows dating back to the 13th Century, which are among its most famous features. The first, and smallest, on the west facade, was finished in around 1225 and celebrated for the way the glass seemingly upheld the stonework around it. The south rose has a diameter of nearly 13m (43ft) and is made up of 84 panels. However, it no longer retains its original stained glass because it was damaged in previous fires. Images of the blaze at Notre-Dame What Notre-Dame means to the French AndrÃ© Finot, cathedral spokesman, told BFMTV that the rose windows appeared not to have been touched by the fire, although there were still fears for them because of the fragility of the building. And Alixe Bovey, a medieval art historian from the Courtauld Institute of Art in London, told BBC Radio Wales that ""much more of [the glass] has survived than looked even remotely possible in the first few hours of the fire"". She added that they ""look more than salvageable"" and ""in really remarkable condition considering what they've been exposed to"". This video can not be played Why Notre Dame is getting new bells The cathedral has 10 bells - the largest, known as Emmanuel, weighs more than 23 tonnes and was installed in the south tower in 1685. The cathedral celebrated its 850th anniversary in 2013 by recasting the smaller bells from the north tower. Each was blessed with the name of a saint to replicate the original bells that were melted for cannon balls during the French Revolution. Writer Victor Hugo used the cathedral as a setting for his 1831 work The Hunchback of Notre-Dame. His main character, Quasimodo, is feared by locals for the way he looks - but finds sanctuary in the cathedral and is employed as a bell-ringer. The Holy Crown of Thorns was rescued from the fire Notre-Dame is home to relics from the Passion of Christ, described as a piece of the cross, a nail and the Holy Crown of Thorns, said to have been worn by Jesus before the crucifixion. Anne Hidalgo, mayor of Paris, tweeted thatfirefighters, police and others formed a human chain,externalto rescue priceless artefacts, such as the crown and tunic said to have been worn by King Louis IX when he brought the crown of thorns to Paris. BBC Europe correspondent Kevin Connolly said firefighters reported that some of the large paintings inside the cathedral were too heavy to take down from the walls and save. Some of the art and artefacts were stored overnight in City Hall but they would be moved to the Louvre museum as soon as possible, said French culture minister Franck Riester. Major paintings in the cathedral would be moved to the museum on Friday, after they had been protected, conserved and restored, he said. Mr Riester said they were mostly undamaged but may have suffered some effects from the smoke. Many of the cathedral's important artefacts - including paintings, sculptures and textiles - were held in its many chapels around the nave. Artwork and relics saved from Notre Dame were temporarily stored in City Hall These being relatively safe, Ms Bovey told the BBC, is thanks to the cathedral's stone vaults being ""more or less sound"" after the blaze - something that didn't look likely when it first started. ""What can happen in fires like this is that they burn so hot that the stone vaults can fail, and then the fire can fall through into the body of the church and scorch the limestone,"" she said. But, she said, that doesn't appear to have happened. ""I feel pretty optimistic looking at the external fabric that [the artefacts are] more than salvageable"". The cathedral has three organs, including the 8,000-pipe Great Organ, first constructed in 1401 and rebuilt in the 18th and 19th Centuries. Despite many restorations and additions over the years, it still contains some pipes first installed in the medieval era. Deputy Mayor Emmanuel Gregoire told French news channel BFMTV that the organ remained intact. Organist Johann Vexo, who was playing a Mass when the fire alarm rang, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It's the most famous instrument in the world. It was absolutely stunning, gorgeous - we don't have any words to describe it, it was a wonderful experience every time. It was such a privilege to work and to play in this wonderful place."" Anyone feeling fit enough to climb the stairs and gain views across Paris has to pass another of the cathedral's best-known features - the gargoyles and grotesques. These are two types of stone sculptures, often featuring mythical creatures. Unlike grotesques, gargoyles have water spouts to carry rainwater off the building, although several have already been replaced by PVC pipes because Notre-Dame's stonework has corroded. The most famous sculpture - known as the Stryge - sits on top of the building, watching out over the city with its head in its hands. An image of the steeple taken last year, contrasted with Monday's blaze Notre-Dame's famous spire, which collapsed during Monday's fire, dates back to the 12th Century. It underwent several changes in the building's history - including being dismantled during the French Revolution, and later rebuilt in the 1860s. Reflecting on its collapse, the Royal Institute of British Architects said: ""The loss of the roof and spire of Notre-Dame, and possibly the stone vault too, is an irreplaceable blow to the heritage of French Gothic architecture. ""Our heart goes out to the people of France, and to lovers of our shared cultural heritage wherever they are."" Most visitors to Notre-Dame will spend some time standing before two Gothic towers which crown the western facade of the cathedral. Work on the western facade began in 1200, but the first tower - the north one - was not completed until 40 years later. Ten years after that, in 1250, the southern tower was completed. Both towers are 68m high, and climbing the 387 steps gives panoramic views of Paris. Officials said that both bell towers remain intact.

"The Department for Education says it is investing in teacher recruitment Where do you see yourself in five years' time? No longer working in education, 40% of UK teachers surveyed by a teachers' union replied. It may sound like a cliched interview question, but the National Education Union says that the answer is evidence of a ""culture of fear"" in schools. Its survey of 8,600 members found most of those leaving blamed ""huge workloads and excessive accountability"". Education Secretary Damian Hinds has promised to tackle the workload issue. One teacher, who responded to the union's State of Education survey published at its annual conference in Liverpool, said: ""Working 70 hours a week for many years has meant my health and family life have suffered. ""I am getting out before the job kills me."" Another unnamed respondent said: ""My job is no longer about children. It's about a 60-hour week with pressure to push children's data through."" More than half of respondents said their work-life balance had got worse in the past year, with one teacher saying: ""With a young family, and despite working part-time, I have come to realise that a job in education is not conducive to family life."" Abuse of teachers leading to 'millions' in compensation Teachers to be offered cash to stay in school Teachers tired of pointless emails Another said: ""My personal life doesn't exist any more."" And the outlook was negative for a substantial minority of new teachers, with some 26% of those who had been in the job between two and five years, saying that they plan to quit the classroom altogether in five years' time. NEU joint general secretary Kevin Courtney said: ""The government is doing a far better job of driving teachers out of the profession than they are solving the issue of excessive workload."" He said that the main problem was one of excessive accountability, adding: ""So long as the main drivers of a performance-based system are still in place, schools will continue to be in the grip of fear, over-regulation and a lack of trust."" Mr Hinds has acknowledged that long hours and red tape are among the ""biggest threats"" to recruiting and retaining staff. A spokesperson for the Department for Education said reducing teacher workload was a key part of its retention and recruitment strategy. ""We have worked with school leaders and teachers to create a workload reduction toolkit, which provides practical advice and resources that schools can use rather than creating new ones from scratch,"" he added. ""We are also tackling excessive data burdens in schools; simplifying the accountability system to target the associated burdens and working with Ofsted to ensure staff workload is considered as part of a school's inspection judgement."" Recruitment targets for teachers have been missed in England for five years in a row.

"The World Health Organization says the latest figures paint ""an alarming picture"" The number of measles cases reported worldwide in the first three months of 2019 has quadrupled compared with the same time last year, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The UN body said provisional data indicated a ""a clear trend"", with all regions of the world seeing outbreaks. Africa had witnessed the most dramatic rise - up 700%. The agency said actual numbers may be far greater, since only one in 10 cases globally are reported. Measles is a highly infectious viral illness that can sometimes lead to serious health complications, including infections of the lungs and brain. Ukraine, Madagascar and India have been worst affected by the disease, with tens of thousands of reported cases per million people. Since September, at least 800 people have died from measles in Madagascar alone. Outbreaks have also hit Brazil, Pakistan and Yemen, ""causing many deaths - mostly among young children"", while a spike in case numbers was reported for countries including the US and Thailand with high levels of vaccination coverage. How a preventable disease returned from the past Measles cases triple in Europe Vaccine deniers gaining ground - NHS boss YouTube takes ads off 'anti-vax' videos In total, some 170 countries reported 112,163 measles cases to WHO, in comparison to 28,124 cases across 163 countries during the same period in 2018. The UN says the disease is ""entirely preventable"" with the right vaccines, but global coverage of the first immunisation stage has ""stalled"" at 85%, ""still short of the 95% needed to prevent outbreaks"". In an opinion piece for CNN, WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and UNICEF head Henrietta Fore saidthe world was ""in the middle of a measles crisis"",externaland that ""the proliferation of confusing and contradictory information"" about vaccines was partly to blame. By James Gallagher, health and science correspondent, BBC News It is one of the most contagious viruses around. However, nothing about measles has changed. It has not mutated to become more infectious or more dangerous. Instead the answers are entirely human. There are two stories here - one of poverty and one of misinformation. In poorer countries fewer people are vaccinated and a larger portion of the population is left vulnerable to the virus. This creates the environment for a large outbreak to occur - such as those in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kyrgyzstan and Madagascar. But rich countries with seemingly high vaccination rates are seeing cases spike too. This is because clusters of people are choosing not to vaccinate their children due to the spread of untrue anti-vax messages on social media. It is worth noting these figures are provisional, the WHO says the true figures will be much higher. And that measles is far from harmless. It kills around 100,000 people, mostly children, every year. The pair wrote that it was ""understandable, in such a climate, how loving parents can feel lost"" but that ""ultimately, there is no 'debate' to be had about the profound benefits of vaccines"". They added: ""More than 20 million lives have been saved through measles vaccination since the year 2000 alone."" In response to recent measles outbreaks, calls have mounted in several countries to make immunisation mandatory. Last month,Italy banned children under six from attending schoolsunless they had received vaccines for chickenpox, measles and other illnesses. A public health emergency has also beendeclared in areas of New York, ordering all residents to be vaccinated or face a fine.

"Construction on Stonehenge probably began about 3,000BC The ancestors of the people who built Stonehenge travelled west across the Mediterranean before reaching Britain, a study has shown. Researchers compared DNA extracted from Neolithic human remains found across Britain with that of people alive at the same time in Europe. The Neolithic inhabitants were descended from populations originating in Anatolia (modern Turkey) that moved to Iberia before heading north. They reached Britain in about 4,000BC. Details have beenpublished in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution.,external The migration to Britain was just one part of a general, massive expansion of people out of Anatolia in 6,000BC that introduced farming to Europe. Before that, Europe was populated by small, travelling groups which hunted animals and gathered wild plants and shellfish. One group of early farmers followed the river Danube up into Central Europe, but another group travelled west across the Mediterranean. DNA reveals that Neolithic Britons were largely descended from groups who took the Mediterranean route, either hugging the coast or hopping from island-to-island on boats. Some British groups had a minor amount of ancestry from groups that followed the Danube route. A facial reconstruction of Whitehawk Woman, a 5,600-year-old Neolithic woman from Sussex. The reconstruction is on show at the Royal Pavilion & Museum in Brighton When the researchers analysed the DNA of early British farmers, they found they most closely resembled Neolithic people from Iberia (modern Spain and Portugal). These Iberian farmers were descended from people who had journeyed across the Mediterranean. From Iberia, or somewhere close, the Mediterranean farmers travelled north through France. They might have entered Britain from the west, through Wales or south-west England. Indeed, radiocarbon dates suggest that Neolithic people arrived marginally earlier in the west, but this remains a topic for future work. In addition to farming, the Neolithic migrants to Britain appear to have introduced the tradition of building monuments using large stones known as megaliths. Stonehenge in Wiltshire was part of this tradition. Although Britain was inhabited by groups of ""western hunter-gatherers"" when the farmers arrived in about 4,000BC, DNA shows that the two groups did not mix very much at all. The British hunter-gatherers were almost completely replaced by the Neolithic farmers, apart from one group in western Scotland, where the Neolithic inhabitants had elevated local ancestry. This could have come down to the farmer groups simply having greater numbers. ""We don't find any detectable evidence at all for the local British western hunter-gatherer ancestry in the Neolithic farmers after they arrive,"" said co-author Dr Tom Booth, a specialist in ancient DNA from the Natural History Museum in London. ""That doesn't mean they don't mix at all, it just means that maybe their population sizes were too small to have left any kind of genetic legacy."" Co-author Professor Mark Thomas, from UCL, said he also favoured ""a numbers game explanation"". A reconstruction of Cheddar Man. As with other Mesolithic hunter-gatherers, DNA results suggest he had dark skin and blue or green eyes Professor Thomas said the Neolithic farmers had probably had to adapt their practices to different climatic conditions as they moved across Europe. But by the time they reached Britain they were already ""tooled up"" and well-prepared for growing crops in a north-west European climate. The study also analysed DNA from these British hunter-gatherers. One of the skeletons analysed was that of Cheddar Man, whose skeletal remains have been dated to 7,100BC. He was the subject of a reconstruction unveiled at the Natural History Museum last year. DNA suggests that, like most other European hunter-gatherers of the time, he had dark skin combined with blue eyes. Genetic analysis shows that the Neolithic farmers, by contrast, were paler-skinned with brown eyes and black or dark-brown hair. Towards the end of the Neolithic, in about 2,450BC, the descendants of the first farmers were themselves almost entirely replaced when a new population - called the Bell Beaker people - migrated from mainland Europe. So Britain saw two extreme genetic shifts in the space of a few thousand years. Prof Thomas said that this later event happened after the Neolithic population had been in decline for some time, both in Britain and across Europe. He cautioned against simplistic explanations invoking conflict, and said the shifts ultimately came down to ""economic"" factors, about which lifestyles were best suited to exploit the landscape. Dr Booth explained: ""It's difficult to see whether the two [genetic shifts] could have anything in common - they're two very different kinds of change. There's speculation that they're to some extent population collapses. But the reasons suggested for those two collapses are different, so it could just be coincidence.""

"Daniel Hegarty, 15, was shot dead by a soldier during Operation Motorman in 1972 A former soldier is to be charged with murdering a teenager, who was shot twice in the head in Londonderry during the Northern Ireland Troubles. Fifteen-year-old Daniel Hegarty was killed in an Army operation near his home in the Creggan in July 1972. Last year, the High Court ruled a decision not to prosecute, taken in 2016, was based on ""flawed"" reasoning. The Army veteran, known as Soldier B, will also face a second charge of wounding the teenager's cousin. The move has been welcomed by the Hegarty family. The Director of Public Prosecutions, Stephen Herron, informed the Hegarty family of developments at a private meeting. Family fight 'no prosecution' ruling Family 'overwhelmed' by inquest findings He conducted a review of the case following the court ruling. Mr Herron said he believed the evidence ""is sufficient to provide a reasonable prospect of conviction"". Operation Motorman was then the largest British military operation since the Suez Crisis of 1956 In reaching the decision, he added that he had taken Soldier B's ill health into consideration. An inquest in 2011 found Daniel Hegarty posed no risk and was shot without warningas the Army moved in to clear ""no-go"" areas during Operation Motorman. His cousin, Christopher Hegarty, 17, was also shot in the head by the same soldier, but survived. In respect of the older youth, Soldier B will face a charge of wounding with intent. In a statement, the Hegarty family said: ""This has been a long journey. It has taken 47 years to finally get the state to do the right thing. ""We urge anyone fighting for justice never to give up. ""We wish Soldier B no ill-will. We just want the criminal trial process to begin."" A total of six former soldiers are now facing prosecution over Troubles-era killings. The cases relate to Daniel Hegarty; Bloody Sunday; John Pat Cunningham; Joe McCann (involving two ex-soldiers); and Aidan McAnespie. Not all the charges are murder. The Public Prosecution Service said that of 26 so-called legacy cases it has taken decisions on since 2011, 13 related to republicans, eight to loyalists, and five are connected to the Army.

"Cholesterol-lowering ""statin"" drugs taken by millions of Britons may not work well enough in about half of those prescribed them, research suggests. UK investigators looked at 165,000 patients on statins and found that for one in two, the drugs had too little effect on bad cholesterol - one of the big risk factors for heart disease. They are not sure why statins appear to help some more than others. Patients should not stop taking the drugs without seeing their doctor. One possible explanation is patients not taking their prescribed drugs or doctors giving them at too low doses, experts suggest. Cardiovascular disease kills about 150,000 people in the UK each year. ""Bad"" low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is a major contributor - it can lead to furring and blockage of blood vessels. Cutting down on saturated fat can help lower bad cholesterol, but some people will also need medication. Millions of people in the UK are given statins for this reason. But statins can cause side effects and there is a debate about how many patients should be prescribed them. Who should take statins? Are statins the best choice for me?,external Cholesterol-lowering pill new option for statin users The study, published in the journalHeart,external, included 165,411 patients who had been put on statins to cut their risk of developing heart disease by lowering their cholesterol to a healthy level. Half of the patients - 84,609 in total - did not see their cholesterol go down by enough - the required 40% or more reduction specified by guidelines - even after being on the daily treatment for two years. Experts say the study findings are somewhat limited because they cannot prove that patients who do not respond well to statins will necessarily fare worse as a consequence. Other factors - like smoking and obesity - also raise cardiovascular risk. But the work does provide ""real life"" data and experience to draw on. Researcher Dr Stephen Weng, from Nottingham University, said: ""Our research has shown that in almost half of patients prescribed statins, they are very effective and offer significant protection against cardiovascular disease. ""However, for the other half - whether it's due to your genetic make-up, having side effects, sticking to the treatment or other medications - we don't see that intended benefit."" In the study, a higher proportion of patients with a sub-optimal response to statins were prescribed lower potency doses, compared with those with an optimal response. He said: ""We have to develop better ways to understand differences between patients and how we can tailor more effective treatment for those millions of patients who are simply blanket-prescribed statins."" Prof Metin Avkiran, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, advised: ""Statins are an important and proven treatment for lowering cholesterol and reducing the risk of a potentially fatal heart attack or stroke. ""If you have been prescribed statins, you should continue to take them regularly, as prescribed. If you have any concerns you should discuss your medication with your GP. There are now other drugs available to help lower cholesterol levels, and it may be that another type of medication will be an effective addition or alternative for you."" Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, said: ""When we prescribe medication, we have to rely on patients to make sure that they take it, both at the recommended dose and for the duration of time that we think will benefit them most. ""There is a substantial body of research showing that statins are safe and effective drugs for most people, and can reduce the risk of heart attacks and stroke, when prescribed appropriately - but controversy remains around their widespread use and their potential side-effects. ""There are complex reasons why patients choose not to take their prescribed medication, and mixed messaging around statins could be one of these.""

"Daniel Hegarty, 15, was shot dead by a soldier during Operation Motorman in 1972 The High Court has quashed a decision not to prosecute the soldier who killed Londonderry teenager Daniel Hegarty, The 15-year-old was shot twice in the head by a soldier in Derry in 1972. On Wednesday, the High Court ruled a 2016 decision not to prosecute was based on ""irredeemably flawed"" reasoning. Judges said the evidential test imposed by then Public Prosecutions Service (PPS) Director Barra McGrory was too stringent. The judges also said the four-year delay in reaching the decision not to prosecute was ""manifestly excessive, inexplicable, unjustified and unlawful"". Hegarty family solicitor Des Doherty said that the case will now go back to the PPS and they do not expect prosecutors to appeal the latest ruling. ""The family are very pleased with the decision. It is a very important decision that should be read widely because it may have implications for quite a lot of other cases in controversial circumstances involving agents of the state."" A 2011 inquest found the boy posed no risk and was shot without warning. Operation Motorman was then the largest British military operation since the Suez Crisis of 1956 It also prompted the coroner to refer the case back to the PPS. Following the decision not to prosecute, Margaret Brady, Mr Hegarty's sister, issued judicial review proceedings. At the High Court, Lord Justice Treacy, sitting with Mr Justice Colton, pointed out that the PPS only needs to be satisfied there is credible evidence which could be proved - not that there will definitely be a conviction. Referring to expert conclusions provided in November 2012, he said: ""Had the decision been taken at that time it seems inevitable in light of the scientific evidence and the legal advice that the director must have concluded that the test for prosecution was then satisfied."" Ruling that the director imposed too stringent a test, the judge continued: ""We consider that the reasoning leading to the impugned decision not to prosecute is irredeemably flawed. ""In particular, the decision of the director is founded on an unreasonable and rationally unsustainable hypothesis which is inconsistent with the case made by the soldier."" Daniel, a labourer, was unarmed when he was shot close to his home in Creggan during Operation Motorman, an army-mounted attempt to re-take no-go areas of Derry. His cousin Christopher, 16, was also shot in the head by the same soldier, but survived.

"Ms Begum left Bethnal Green, east London, in 2015 to join the Islamic State group in Syria Shamima Begum - who joined the Islamic State group aged 15 - is set to be granted legal aid to fight the decision to revoke her UK citizenship. The 19-year-old, who left east London in 2015, was stripped of her citizenship in February, after she was found in a Syrian refugee camp. Her family has previously said it planned to challenge the decision. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the idea of the provision of legal aid to Ms Begum made him ""very uncomfortable"". Mr Hunt added, however, that the UK was ""a country that believes that people with limited means should have access to the resources of the state if they want to challenge the decisions the state has made about them"". Legal aid is financial assistance provided by the taxpayer to those unable to afford legal representation themselves, whether they are accused of a crime or a victim who seeks the help of a lawyer through the court process. It is means-tested and availability has been cut back significantly in recent years in England and Wales. Civil servants at the Legal Aid Agency, which is part of the Ministry of Justice, are responsible for making decisions about who receives legal aid. Earlier, the BBC reported Ms Begum's case had been approved - but sources now say it will be formally signed off in the coming days. What is Shamima Begum's legal status? Legal aid: Who is entitled to it? 'I didn't want to be IS poster girl' The women and children no-one wants The legal aid that is expected to be granted covers a case before the semi-secret Special Immigration Appeals Commission (Siac), which adjudicates on cases where the home secretary has stripped someone of their nationality on grounds of national security. Cases before Siac are among the most complicated legal challenges that the government can face. This is because they typically involve a complex combination of MI5 intelligence reports, which cannot be disclosed to the complainant, and long-standing law on achieving a fair hearing. It is not yet clear when the expected case will be heard but the Siac process can take years to complete - and granting of legal aid in these circumstances is not unusual. Over the last decade or so there have been many other people stripped of nationality on the basis they are linked to terrorism who have been legally-aided during the Siac process. Ms Begum left the UK in February 2015 alongside fellow Bethnal Green Academy pupils 15-year-old Amira Abase and 16-year-old Kadiza Sultana. Ms Begum was found in a Syrian refugee camp in February 2019 and said she wanted to return home. Soon afterwards, she gave birth to a boy called Jarrah. He died of pneumonia in March at less than three weeks of age. She had two other children who also died. In the wake of the boy's death, Home Secretary Sajid Javid was criticised over the decision to strip Ms Begum of her British citizenship. Three weeks prior to the death, Ms Begum's sister, Renu Begum, had written to Mr Javid asking him to help her bring the baby to the UK. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""We should not judge outside of a court"" On Monday,the Daily Mail first reported that legal aid had been granted,externalin response to an application made on 19 March. Mr Javid said the granting of legal aid was a decision for legal aid organisations and it was ""not for ministers to comment"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn argued Ms Begum had the right to apply for legal aid. ""She is a British citizen,"" he said. ""She's therefore entitled to apply for legal aid if she has a legal problem just like anybody else is."" He added: ""The whole point of legal aid is that if you're facing a prosecution then you're entitled to be represented and that's a fundamental rule of law, a fundamental point in any democratic society."" Dal Babu, a former chief superintendent in the Metropolitan Police and a friend of the family, said Ms Begum should have legal aid to make sure the correct process is followed. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think legal aid is a principle of the British legal justice system."" Under the1981 British Nationality Act,external, a person can be deprived of their citizenship if the home secretary is satisfied it would be ""conducive to the public good"" and they would not become stateless as a result. It was thought Ms Begum had Bangladeshi citizenship through her mother - although Bangladesh's ministry of foreign affairs said she had been""erroneously identified"" as a Bangladeshi national. Human rights group Liberty said granting legal aid in this case was ""not just appropriate but absolutely necessary to ensure that the government's decisions are properly scrutinised"".

"Families in England will find out on Tuesday whether their children have got into their preferred primary schools. Last year about one in 10 families missed out on their first choice - but 98% got one of their top three places. Primary schools have added 636,000 extra places since 2010 to meet rising numbers - but that demographic bulge is now moving on to secondary. Head teachers' leader Paul Whiteman said securing a place can ""feel like a battle for parents"". More than 600,000 families will find out where they have been offered a school place for the autumn. The national picture on applications will not be known until June, but the chances of getting a first-choice place have been improving in recent years - up from 88% in 2014 to 91% in 2018. But last year, about 2% did not get an offer on their three top preferences or any of the schools they named. Top tips on choosing a primary school Wealthier families do better out of school appeal system Population boom moves from primary to secondary There are big regional variations each year - with authorities such as the East Riding of Yorkshire, Northumberland and Rutland having more than 97% of families getting their first preferences. But the lowest success rates tend to be in London, with only 68% of families in Kensington and Chelsea and 77% in Camden getting their first choice last year. A population boom had put pressure on places - but that has peaked and this year's application numbers could show a downward trend. For the past decade, primary schools have been building extra classrooms as pupil numbers rose by about 15% between 2009 and 2018, up to 4.7 million. The size of the average primary school grew by an extra 42 places, but this has not been spread evenly, with some expanding very significantly and with some areas still struggling to meet demand. Mr Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, called for a more joined-up ""national strategy"" to ensure enough places. Otherwise, he said, ""the annual anxious wait for families will continue"". Mr Whiteman warned of a ""haphazard"" approach to expansion, so that ""new school places are not always being commissioned in the areas they are most needed"". School standards minister Nick Gibb said standards had risen and the primary school sector was ""unrecognisable from a generation ago"". He said 87% of primary schools were now judged good or outstanding, and the use of phonics lessons had improved children's reading. ""What this means in practice is that even in instances where parents aren't getting the news they hoped for today, the likelihood is that their child will be attending a school which will provide a first-class education,"" said Mr Gibb. But the New Schools Network, which promotes free schools, said too many children would still be heading for schools which were below the rating of ""good"". ""Finding out which primary school your child is going to should be a time of excitement, but today nearly 100,000 families will find out their child is being sent to a school that isn't good enough,"" said the group's director, Luke Tryl.

"Former politician Sergiy Tigipko is one of the most influential men in Ukraine One of Ukraine's richest men is being investigated by Scotland Yard over the abduction of his two British grandchildren from the UK to Ukraine. Banker and industrialist Sergiy Tigipko helped his daughter Ganna defy High Court orders to bring her children back to the UK from Kiev, a judge has ruled. The court had ordered Ms Tigipko back to London, where the children's British father lives, so they could see him. Sergiy and Ganna can be named after an exceptional decision by a judge. The children were ""suffering harm"" by being separated from their father, the court heard. The judge heard that publicity could make their mother and grandfather return them. Ms Tigipko said everything she had done since her husband left her in 2015 had been ""for the welfare of my children and nobody else"". She added the children were ""happy and settled in Ukraine now"" and that their father was ""welcome to visit them"". It is believed to be the first time a judge has allowed abductors to be named in this way - usually it only happens when children's whereabouts are unknown. Ms Tigipko met the children's father in 2010 and married in 2012. They settled in north London, and had two daughters. But, in late 2015, the father announced the marriage was over. Funny business at the Ukrainian polls Ukraine bans its Eurovision entrant over Russia row The life of a 17-year-old in Kiev Initially, Ms Tigipko was happy to stay in London. She had founded a clinic in Harley Street. With help from her mother, she bought a Â£9m home in Hampstead, which is one of London's most expensive districts and popular with Russian speakers. The children's father lived nearby with his new wife. But then Ms Tigipko met a new partner too, and married him in 2017 in Ukraine. In November 2017, she took the girls for a visit to Kiev - and stayed there, violating an informal agreement with the father to remain living in the UK. She sold her house in Hampstead and gave up her Harley Street business. In April 2018, the High Court ruled she must return to London to live - but she ignored repeated court orders. Mr Justice Mostyn found that her father, Sergiy, had helped her. He was fully satisfied ""of his deep complicity"", he said in his judgment. As no progress was being made, the girls' father took the exceptional step of asking for the grandfather and mother to be named, hoping that would encourage them to return the children. Mr Tigipko is being investigated by Scotland Yard Mr Tigipko is one of the richest and most powerful men in Ukraine. The billionaire was an ally of Ukraine's former president, Viktor Yanukovych - serving as a vice prime minister in his administration - and twice stood as a presidential candidate himself. In recent years, he has concentrated on his business interests, and told the court he had no further interest in politics. The court heard that before the children were taken to Kiev, they had had a close relationship with their father. But now they have been turned against him. In December, the older girl told a court appointed expert: ""Papa is bad."" He has three children from a previous marriage while his new wife has a son from an earlier relationship. It is believed to be the first time a judge has named abductors in such a case. In family courts, protecting the children's identity is paramount and they are only named when their whereabouts is unknown, as inthe case of Olly Sheridan. Mr Justice Mostyn said that he placed ""great weight"" on the submissions made by the barrister for the children's court-appointed guardian, who had supported publication. He said that child abduction was a ""heinous practice"" and yet ""public awareness is curiously very limited"". Orysia Lutsevych, from the think tank Chatham House, said many in Ukraine would be unsympathetic to the Tigipkos. She said there was a sense that the very rich behave differently, that the rules do not apply to them, that they're ""untouchable"". ""I'm sure lots of Ukrainians will be watching the case,"" she added.

"This video can not be played Dennis Canavan: ""I still wake up in the middle of the night sometimes, asking myself, is this true? Or has it been a bad dream? But very sadly it is not a dream."" One of Scotland's most colourful politicians has revealed he suffers ""indescribable bouts of depression"" following the deaths of four of his children. Dennis Canavan has endured incredible personal tragedy after losing three sons and his only daughter since 1989. He rarely speaks about his personal life but gave a candid interview to theBBC's Good Morning Scotland programme. He admitted he still struggles with grief. Gordon Brewer asked Mr Canavan if his loss has strengthened him in any way. The former Labour MP and Independent MSP said: ""If you had asked me that question just a couple of years ago, I would probably have been in a position to say yes, perhaps it has strengthened my character in some respects. ""But that was before the death of my only daughter, the fourth child I have lost."" Dennis Canavan has suffered intense personal tragedy losing four of his five children The 76-year-old, who represented the Falkirk area in parliament for more than 20 years, continued: ""I find it difficult to speak about it, but the death of a child is the worst thing that can happen to any mum or dad. ""Any bereavement in a family is a sad thing, but it is against the whole natural cycle of life, for a child to die before you, and in my case it has happened not just once or twice or three times, but four times."" Mr Canavan's only daughter, Ruth, died in February 2017. She was the last of four children he had with ex-wife Elnor. He shared the news via social media. Allow Twitter content?

His eldest son Mark died in Australia in March 2007 aged 41 following a three-year battle with motor neurone disease. His second son Dennis died from a brain tumour in December 2006. He was 35. Mr Canavan's third son Paul died from skin cancer aged 16 in 1989. He also has a son, Adam, who is 16. Choked with emotion, Mr Canavan told Brewer: ""I still find it very very difficult to comprehend. ""I still waken up in the middle of the night sometimes, asking myself, is this true? Or has it been a bad dream? ""But very sadly it is not a dream, it is reality and I have to face up to it, I do suffer from terrible, indescribable bouts of depression sometimes. But I just have to struggle on."" Mr Canavan, who retired from Holyrood in 2007, and was chairman of the 2014 Independence referendum Yes campaign, revealed his faith had helped him to cope with the numerous tragedies. He said: ""I think it has strengthened my faith. It's a strange thing and I respect people with different beliefs and disbeliefs. ""But I know if I didn't believe in God and in a life hereafter, I think my depression would be even worse. Dennis Canavan was heavily involved with the Yes campaign ""I take some consolation in the fact I believe that my four deceased children are in God's company that they are not absolutely dead in every respect, that their spirit lives on."" During the Sunday morning half-hour interview, he revealed he uses exercise to improve his mental health. He said: ""Exercise whether it's walking or swimming or going out on my bike, it makes me feel better. "" Mr Canavan was born in Cowdenbeath and before entering politics he worked as a maths teacher from 1968 until 1974. He was assistant head of Holyrood High School in Edinburgh at the time of his first successful election to Westminster. In a 33-year political career he has served as a councillor, MP and MSP. In the interview, Mr Canavan said he believed that Scotland would be independent ""within his lifetime"". He said that SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon should hold a second Scottish independence referendum before 2021, and that lessons have been learned from previous mistakes. He thought the currency union plan was one of them. Mr Canavan thinks Nicola Sturgeon should call a second independence referendum before 2021 ""The currency thing,"" he said, ""turned out to be disastrous. I mean you cannot have a currency union with another partner unless the other partner agrees to that currency union. ""So, it was a hostage to fortune, it was giving our opponents - our unionists opponents - a veto over the policy, so that was a mistake. ""I think that lessons have been learned now, that we've got to come up with a better currency option and I'm glad to see that support is growing now and seems to be accepted within the members of the Scottish government, that idea of an independent currency in Scotland."" The former Labour party member also gave his opinion on the party's leader. He said he thought Jeremy Corbyn would never be prime minister. He said: ""Corbyn doesn't understand Scotland. The best Labour could hope for is a coalition government which would lead to a dilution of policies."" On the question of Brexit, he thinks it might never happen, believing a second EU referendum would see a win for those wanting to remain.

"Riley Jake Jackson died in hospital from ""fire related burns and carbon monoxide toxicity"" A six-year-old boy died after a bedside lamp fell over next to where he was sleeping and caused a house fire, an inquest has heard. Derby Coroners' Court was told the heat from a halogen bulb caused the lamp shade to catch fire on 26 October. Riley Jake Jackson died in hospital from ""fire related burns and carbon monoxide toxicity"" after being rescued from the house in Ilkeston, Derbyshire. Coroner Robert Hunter recorded a conclusion of accidental death. Riley's mother and a neighbour could not open Riley's bedroom door Giving evidence to the inquest, Riley's mother, Cheryl Bradley, said she heard the fire alarm go off upstairs at about 22:30 and ""couldn't describe the fear"". She ran upstairs, found the bedroom door shut and could feel the heat of the flames. Despite numerous attempts, she could not open the door and then ran in to the street and screamed ""please help my son"". A neighbour ran in to the house and tried to open the bedroom door, but also could not. Three fire crews were sent to the scene and two firefighters wearing breathing apparatus took Riley out of the bedroom. Ms Bradley said Riley was ""high-spirited, a joy to be around, very loving, had a thirst for knowledge, a huge character and a very happy little boy"". Dr Hunter said there was ""no other possible conclusion than that of accidental death"". ""Riley's death can only be described as a tragic accident,"" he said. Shortly after Riley's death his mother received messages on social media, which caused extra distress to the family. The coroner said the messages showed a ""disturbing lack of compassion for a mother who has lost her darling little boy"".

"Online retail giant Amazon's website is flooded with fake five-star reviews for products from unfamiliar brands, consumer group Which? has claimed. Household names were largely absent from top-rated reviews on popular items such as headphones, smart watches and fitness trackers, it concluded. Thousands of reviews were unverified, meaning there was no evidence the reviewer bought the product, it said. Amazon said it was using automated technology to weed out false reviews. It said it invested ""significant resources"" to protect its review system ""because we know customers value the insights and experiences shared by fellow shoppers"". ""Even one inauthentic review is one too many,"" it added. But Which?'s probe suggested fake reviews were commonplace. When it searched for headphones, it found all the products on the first page of results were from unknown brands - which it defines as ones its experts have never heard of - rather than known brands, which it defines as household names. Of 12,000 reviews for these, the majority (87%) were from unverified purchases. One example, a set of headphones by an unknown brand called Celebrat, had 439 reviews, all of which were five-star, unverified and were posted on the same day, suggesting they had been automated. Celebrat could not be reached for comment. Do not rely on ratings - delve deeper and read the reviews Check the dates - look at when the reviews were posted. If many of them were posted in a short time period, it's likely they have been computer generated and are fake Filter reviews to remove unverified reviews. Only reviews marked as verified are those that Amazon can confirm were purchased on its website If products have hundreds or thousands of largely positive reviews be wary Source: Which? ReviewMeta, a US-based website that analyses online reviews, said it was shocked at the scale of the unverified reviews, saying they were ""obvious and easy to prevent"". The popularity of online review sites mean they are increasingly relied on by both businesses and their customers, with the government's Competition and Markets Authority estimating such reviews potentially influence Â£23bn of UK customer spending every year. Which? says its findings mean that customers should take reviews with ""a pinch of salt"". ""Look to independent and trustworthy sources when researching a purchase,"" says Which? head of home products Natalie Hitchins.

"Extinction Rebellion blocked Waterloo Bridge on Monday Thousands of people joined protests across central London as climate change activists blocked roads and vandalised Shell's headquarters. Extinction Rebellion campaigners parked a pink boat at Oxford Circus and blocked Marble Arch, Piccadilly Circus and roads around Parliament Square. Protester Yen Chit Chong said: ""This is our last best shot at survival."" Among a total of 52 arrests, five people were detained on suspicion of criminal damage at Shell's HQ. The three men and two women were taken to a police station in central London after a glass door was smashed at the offices near Waterloo. The majority of those arrested were detained on suspicion of public order offences. Just after midnight on Monday, Transport for London (TfL) confirmed it had suspended bus services on the N18 route because Great Portland Street was blocked by protesters. Earlier, police had ordered the protesters to restrict their actions to the Marble Arch area to prevent further disruption. Protesters parked a boat at Oxford Circus to represent the threat posed by rising sea levels Organisers claim protests have been held in more than 80 cities across 33 countries. Protester Olivia Evershed, 23, said: ""I hope that it's really going to bring awareness about the emergency crisis that we are in, and encourage the government to act. ""We've got 12 years to act before there is irreversible damage to the environment and we start to see catastrophic changes. If we don't do anything to change this, our children will die."" A truck was used to block off a road in Marble Arch, with members locking themselves under the vehicle Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Extinction Rebellion said protests would continue throughout the week ""escalating the creative disruption across the capital day by day"". The group said it planned to ""bring London to a standstill for up to two weeks"", and wanted the government to take urgent action to tackle climate change. In Parliament Square, protesters unfurled banners, held up placards and waved flags as speakers took to the stage. Since its launch last year, members have shut bridges, poured buckets of fake blood outside Downing Street, blockaded the BBC and stripped semi-naked in Parliament. It has three core demands: for the government to ""tell the truth about climate change"", reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025, and create a citizens' assembly to oversee progress. Controversially, the group is trying to get as many people arrested as possible. One of the group's founders, Roger Hallam, believes that mass participation and civil disobedience maximise the chances of social change. But critics say they cause unnecessary disruption and waste police time when forces are already overstretched. Protesters caused more than Â£6,000 damage at the Shell headquarters in Belvedere Road Oil company Shell had its London headquarters targeted By intentionally causing more than Â£6,000 damage at the Shell headquarters activists aim to get the case into crown court to put their case to a jury, the campaign said. A Shell spokesman said: ""We respect the right of everyone to express their point of view. We only ask that they do so with their safety and the safety of others in mind."" Allow Twitter content?

By Matthew Cannon, BBC News The unusual sight of a pink yacht stands in the centre of Oxford Circus, surrounded by protesters holding aloft a sea of coloured flags. The focus here is on the future of the planet - and there is a sense of urgency. Some are wearing red to symbolise ""the blood of dying species"", one group wants to ""save the bees"", while a man dressed as a centaur holds a placard which says ""climate change is not a myth... unlike centaurs"". Two young women tell me they are not willing to have children due to their fears for the world they will be bringing them into. Another man, who plans to protest through the night, says the protests will be peaceful but he is willing to be arrested. ""The more the authorities will get fed up with us the more it brings us to their attention,"" he said. Organisers have encouraged people to set up camp in Hyde Park overnight into Tuesday - an offence under Royal Parks legislation.

"A major fire has destroyed the roof of Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris, toppling its spire and leaving the remaining structure of the building in a weakened state. France's culture minister Franck Riester said the ""most precious treasures"" have been saved, including what is said to be the crown of thorns worn by Jesus and the tunic of Saint Louis. The emergency services worked late into Monday night to salvage the art and other priceless pieces stored in the cathedral. The wooden interior has been destroyed. But which other features in the 850-year-old Gothic structure make it stand out in a city of iconic buildings? The cathedral has three rose windows dating back to the 13th Century, which are among its most famous features. The first, and smallest, on the west facade, was finished in around 1225 and celebrated for the way the glass seemingly upheld the stonework around it. The south rose has a diameter of nearly 13m (43ft) and is made up of 84 panels. However, it no longer retains its original stained glass because it was damaged in previous fires. Images of the blaze at Notre-Dame What Notre-Dame means to the French AndrÃ© Finot, cathedral spokesman, told BFMTV that the rose windows appeared not to have been touched by the fire, although there were still fears for them because of the fragility of the building. And Alixe Bovey, a medieval art historian from the Courtauld Institute of Art in London, told BBC Radio Wales that ""much more of [the glass] has survived than looked even remotely possible in the first few hours of the fire"". She added that they ""look more than salvageable"" and ""in really remarkable condition considering what they've been exposed to"". This video can not be played Why Notre Dame is getting new bells The cathedral has 10 bells - the largest, known as Emmanuel, weighs more than 23 tonnes and was installed in the south tower in 1685. The cathedral celebrated its 850th anniversary in 2013 by recasting the smaller bells from the north tower. Each was blessed with the name of a saint to replicate the original bells that were melted for cannon balls during the French Revolution. Writer Victor Hugo used the cathedral as a setting for his 1831 work The Hunchback of Notre-Dame. His main character, Quasimodo, is feared by locals for the way he looks - but finds sanctuary in the cathedral and is employed as a bell-ringer. The Holy Crown of Thorns was rescued from the fire Notre-Dame is home to relics from the Passion of Christ, described as a piece of the cross, a nail and the Holy Crown of Thorns, said to have been worn by Jesus before the crucifixion. Anne Hidalgo, mayor of Paris, tweeted thatfirefighters, police and others formed a human chain,externalto rescue priceless artefacts, such as the crown and tunic said to have been worn by King Louis IX when he brought the crown of thorns to Paris. BBC Europe correspondent Kevin Connolly said firefighters reported that some of the large paintings inside the cathedral were too heavy to take down from the walls and save. Some of the art and artefacts were stored overnight in City Hall but they would be moved to the Louvre museum as soon as possible, said French culture minister Franck Riester. Major paintings in the cathedral would be moved to the museum on Friday, after they had been protected, conserved and restored, he said. Mr Riester said they were mostly undamaged but may have suffered some effects from the smoke. Many of the cathedral's important artefacts - including paintings, sculptures and textiles - were held in its many chapels around the nave. Artwork and relics saved from Notre Dame were temporarily stored in City Hall These being relatively safe, Ms Bovey told the BBC, is thanks to the cathedral's stone vaults being ""more or less sound"" after the blaze - something that didn't look likely when it first started. ""What can happen in fires like this is that they burn so hot that the stone vaults can fail, and then the fire can fall through into the body of the church and scorch the limestone,"" she said. But, she said, that doesn't appear to have happened. ""I feel pretty optimistic looking at the external fabric that [the artefacts are] more than salvageable"". The cathedral has three organs, including the 8,000-pipe Great Organ, first constructed in 1401 and rebuilt in the 18th and 19th Centuries. Despite many restorations and additions over the years, it still contains some pipes first installed in the medieval era. Deputy Mayor Emmanuel Gregoire told French news channel BFMTV that the organ remained intact. Organist Johann Vexo, who was playing a Mass when the fire alarm rang, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It's the most famous instrument in the world. It was absolutely stunning, gorgeous - we don't have any words to describe it, it was a wonderful experience every time. It was such a privilege to work and to play in this wonderful place."" Anyone feeling fit enough to climb the stairs and gain views across Paris has to pass another of the cathedral's best-known features - the gargoyles and grotesques. These are two types of stone sculptures, often featuring mythical creatures. Unlike grotesques, gargoyles have water spouts to carry rainwater off the building, although several have already been replaced by PVC pipes because Notre-Dame's stonework has corroded. The most famous sculpture - known as the Stryge - sits on top of the building, watching out over the city with its head in its hands. An image of the steeple taken last year, contrasted with Monday's blaze Notre-Dame's famous spire, which collapsed during Monday's fire, dates back to the 12th Century. It underwent several changes in the building's history - including being dismantled during the French Revolution, and later rebuilt in the 1860s. Reflecting on its collapse, the Royal Institute of British Architects said: ""The loss of the roof and spire of Notre-Dame, and possibly the stone vault too, is an irreplaceable blow to the heritage of French Gothic architecture. ""Our heart goes out to the people of France, and to lovers of our shared cultural heritage wherever they are."" Most visitors to Notre-Dame will spend some time standing before two Gothic towers which crown the western facade of the cathedral. Work on the western facade began in 1200, but the first tower - the north one - was not completed until 40 years later. Ten years after that, in 1250, the southern tower was completed. Both towers are 68m high, and climbing the 387 steps gives panoramic views of Paris. Officials said that both bell towers remain intact.

"Watching the cathedral go up in flames is deeply upsetting for the locals No other site represents France quite like Notre-Dame. Its main rival as a national symbol, the Eiffel Tower, is little more than a century old. Notre-Dame has stood tall above Paris since the 1200s. It has given its name to one of the country's literary masterpieces. Victor Hugo's novel Hunchback of Notre-Dame is known to the French simply as Notre Dame de Paris. The last time the cathedral suffered major damage was during the French Revolution, when statues of saints were hacked by anti-clerical hotheads. The building survived the 1871 Commune uprising, as well as two world wars, largely unscathed. It is impossible to overstate how shocking it is to watch such an enduring embodiment of our country burn. Locals are not famous for their sunny disposition, but few can walk along the banks of the Seine in the central part of the capital without feeling their spirits rise at the majestic bulk of Notre-Dame. It is one of the few sights sure to make a Parisian feel good about living there. This video can not be played The major operation to try to save the building Like all cherished places everywhere, it is not one residents visit very often. In the three decades I spent in my native city, I can't have been inside Notre-Dame more than three or four times - and then only with foreign visitors. There are many of those. The cathedral is not just the most popular tourist site in Western Europe. Eight centuries after its completion, it is also still a place of worship - about 2,000 services are held there every year. But it is also much more than a religious site. President Emmanuel Macron has expressed the shock of a ""whole nation"" at the fire.  As Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said, Notre Dame is ""part of our common heritage"". Many of those looking on as flames engulf the building are in tears. Their dismay is shared by believers and non-believers alike in a nation where faith has long ceased to be a binding force. Massive fire ravages Notre-Dame cathedral Massive flames at Notre-Dame.

Artwork and relics saved from Notre Dame were temporarily stored in City Hall These being relatively safe, Ms Bovey told the BBC, is thanks to the cathedral's stone vaults being ""more or less sound"" after the blaze - something that didn't look likely when it first started. ""What can happen in fires like this is that they burn so hot that the stone vaults can fail, and then the fire can fall through into the body of the church and scorch the limestone,"" she said. But, she said, that doesn't appear to have happened. ""I feel pretty optimistic looking at the external fabric that [the artefacts are] more than salvageable"". The cathedral has three organs, including the 8,000-pipe Great Organ, first constructed in 1401 and rebuilt in the 18th and 19th Centuries. Despite many restorations and additions over the years, it still contains some pipes first installed in the medieval era. Deputy Mayor Emmanuel Gregoire told French news channel BFMTV that the organ remained intact. Organist Johann Vexo, who was playing a Mass when the fire alarm rang, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It's the most famous instrument in the world. It was absolutely stunning, gorgeous - we don't have any words to describe it, it was a wonderful experience every time. It was such a privilege to work and to play in this wonderful place."" Anyone feeling fit enough to climb the stairs and gain views across Paris has to pass another of the cathedral's best-known features - the gargoyles and grotesques. These are two types of stone sculptures, often featuring mythical creatures. Unlike grotesques, gargoyles have water spouts to carry rainwater off the building, although several have already been replaced by PVC pipes because Notre-Dame's stonework has corroded. The most famous sculpture - known as the Stryge - sits on top of the building, watching out over the city with its head in its hands. An image of the steeple taken last year, contrasted with Monday's blaze Notre-Dame's famous spire, which collapsed during Monday's fire, dates back to the 12th Century. It underwent several changes in the building's history - including being dismantled during the French Revolution, and later rebuilt in the 1860s. Reflecting on its collapse, the Royal Institute of British Architects said: ""The loss of the roof and spire of Notre-Dame, and possibly the stone vault too, is an irreplaceable blow to the heritage of French Gothic architecture. ""Our heart goes out to the people of France, and to lovers of our shared cultural heritage wherever they are."" Most visitors to Notre-Dame will spend some time standing before two Gothic towers which crown the western facade of the cathedral. Work on the western facade began in 1200, but the first tower - the north one - was not completed until 40 years later. Ten years after that, in 1250, the southern tower was completed. Both towers are 68m high, and climbing the 387 steps gives panoramic views of Paris. Officials said that both bell towers remain intact.

"Chiang Mai is a popular tourist destination in northern Thailand A Canadian tourist has fallen to his death after a zipline cable snapped in northern Thailand, authorities say. Authorities in Chiang Mai say the 25-year-old man was on holiday with his girlfriend. The cable gave way soon after he was released from the start of the zipline course on Saturday, local media report. The attraction, Flight of the Gibbon, has reportedly been closed while police investigate. Earlier reports suggested that the man, who has not been officially named, fell 100m (328ft) from the zipline. However, police now say he fell from a height of 12m. He is then said to have tumbled down a hill, a source told the BBC. Thai authorities are investigating several issues, including whether the weight limit was exceeded and any potential negligence on the part of the operators. A spokesperson for Canada's Department for Global Affairs told BBC News: ""Our thoughts and sympathies are with the family and friends of the Canadian citizen who died in Thailand. Consular services are provided to the family and loved ones of the Canadian."" Baby elephants rescued from mud pit in Thailand Songkran: Thailand celebrates Buddhist new year with water fights Flight of the Gibbon's zipline course in Mae Kampong village, Chiang Mai, is about 5km long with 33 different platforms, making it one of the longest in Asia. It was temporarily shut in 2016 after three Israeli tourists collided with each other and fell to the ground, suffering non-fatal injuries.

"Doorstep scammers took more than Â£700,000 from people across Scotland in six months, according to new figures. Police Scotland said 249 victims were targeted between April and September last year. The figures were released ahead of a new campaign, Shut Out Scammers, which aims to raise awareness on cold calls. While half of those hit by scams could be considered ""vulnerable"", police are stressing that a wide rangle of people are falling victim to such frauds. Ch Supt John McKenzie warned: ""Nobody is immune to this kind of crime."" Scotland bank scheme 'prevents' Â£5.5m fraud TSB pledges to refund fraud victims Police also highlighted that many fraudsters have links to organised crime groups. Ch Supt McKenzie continued: ""It is incredibly invasive and victims often feel embarrassed about being deceived. ""We take doorstep crime very seriously and understand the significant impact it has on victims. It is vital that people report crimes to us when they happen. ""Our Shut Out Scammers campaign will help us stop more members of our communities being targeted by those intent on defrauding them of cash or gaining access to their homes. ""We want to make sure victims know where to turn to so that they can receive all the necessary support and assistance. ""There is no specific look to a bogus caller or rogue trader. Be alert, and if you have any concerns at all, do not allow an individual entry to your home, or provide them with any form of payment and do not hesitate to phone the police immediately. ""Always ask for ID and only let callers in if they have an appointment and you know that they are genuine."" The Police Scotland campaign will be carried out in conjunction with a number of partner organisations to highlight prevention advice and support services. Derek Mitchell, chief executive of Citizens Advice Scotland which is one of the partners,  said: ""A scam is a crime and should be treated as such. ""The Scottish CAB (Citizens Advice Bureaux) network is always happy to engage with campaigns like this to help people avoid scams, and to stress the importance of reporting them. ""Scammers rely on people not talking about them to friends and neighbours, so the more we talk about this issue the better. ""If you have experienced any type of scam we would urge you to report it.

"Watching the cathedral go up in flames is deeply upsetting for the locals No other site represents France quite like Notre-Dame. Its main rival as a national symbol, the Eiffel Tower, is little more than a century old. Notre-Dame has stood tall above Paris since the 1200s. It has given its name to one of the country's literary masterpieces. Victor Hugo's novel Hunchback of Notre-Dame is known to the French simply as Notre Dame de Paris. The last time the cathedral suffered major damage was during the French Revolution, when statues of saints were hacked by anti-clerical hotheads. The building survived the 1871 Commune uprising, as well as two world wars, largely unscathed. It is impossible to overstate how shocking it is to watch such an enduring embodiment of our country burn. Locals are not famous for their sunny disposition, but few can walk along the banks of the Seine in the central part of the capital without feeling their spirits rise at the majestic bulk of Notre-Dame. It is one of the few sights sure to make a Parisian feel good about living there. This video can not be played The major operation to try to save the building Like all cherished places everywhere, it is not one residents visit very often. In the three decades I spent in my native city, I can't have been inside Notre-Dame more than three or four times - and then only with foreign visitors. There are many of those. The cathedral is not just the most popular tourist site in Western Europe. Eight centuries after its completion, it is also still a place of worship - about 2,000 services are held there every year. But it is also much more than a religious site. President Emmanuel Macron has expressed the shock of a ""whole nation"" at the fire.  As Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said, Notre Dame is ""part of our common heritage"". Many of those looking on as flames engulf the building are in tears. Their dismay is shared by believers and non-believers alike in a nation where faith has long ceased to be a binding force. Massive fire ravages Notre-Dame cathedral Massive flames at Notre-Dame.

"The World Health Organization says the latest figures paint ""an alarming picture"" The number of measles cases reported worldwide in the first three months of 2019 has quadrupled compared with the same time last year, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The UN body said provisional data indicated a ""a clear trend"", with all regions of the world seeing outbreaks. Africa had witnessed the most dramatic rise - up 700%. The agency said actual numbers may be far greater, since only one in 10 cases globally are reported. Measles is a highly infectious viral illness that can sometimes lead to serious health complications, including infections of the lungs and brain. Ukraine, Madagascar and India have been worst affected by the disease, with tens of thousands of reported cases per million people. Since September, at least 800 people have died from measles in Madagascar alone. Outbreaks have also hit Brazil, Pakistan and Yemen, ""causing many deaths - mostly among young children"", while a spike in case numbers was reported for countries including the US and Thailand with high levels of vaccination coverage. How a preventable disease returned from the past Measles cases triple in Europe Vaccine deniers gaining ground - NHS boss YouTube takes ads off 'anti-vax' videos In total, some 170 countries reported 112,163 measles cases to WHO, in comparison to 28,124 cases across 163 countries during the same period in 2018. The UN says the disease is ""entirely preventable"" with the right vaccines, but global coverage of the first immunisation stage has ""stalled"" at 85%, ""still short of the 95% needed to prevent outbreaks"". In an opinion piece for CNN, WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and UNICEF head Henrietta Fore saidthe world was ""in the middle of a measles crisis"",externaland that ""the proliferation of confusing and contradictory information"" about vaccines was partly to blame. By James Gallagher, health and science correspondent, BBC News It is one of the most contagious viruses around. However, nothing about measles has changed. It has not mutated to become more infectious or more dangerous. Instead the answers are entirely human. There are two stories here - one of poverty and one of misinformation. In poorer countries fewer people are vaccinated and a larger portion of the population is left vulnerable to the virus. This creates the environment for a large outbreak to occur - such as those in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kyrgyzstan and Madagascar. But rich countries with seemingly high vaccination rates are seeing cases spike too. This is because clusters of people are choosing not to vaccinate their children due to the spread of untrue anti-vax messages on social media. It is worth noting these figures are provisional, the WHO says the true figures will be much higher. And that measles is far from harmless. It kills around 100,000 people, mostly children, every year. The pair wrote that it was ""understandable, in such a climate, how loving parents can feel lost"" but that ""ultimately, there is no 'debate' to be had about the profound benefits of vaccines"". They added: ""More than 20 million lives have been saved through measles vaccination since the year 2000 alone."" In response to recent measles outbreaks, calls have mounted in several countries to make immunisation mandatory. Last month,Italy banned children under six from attending schoolsunless they had received vaccines for chickenpox, measles and other illnesses. A public health emergency has also beendeclared in areas of New York, ordering all residents to be vaccinated or face a fine.

"Sana Muhammad, formerly known as Devi Unmathallegadoo, had been eight months pregnant A man who killed his pregnant ex-wife with a crossbow had only intended to confront her new husband about how he was raising his daughter, a jury heard. Ramanodge Unmathallegadoo shot Sana Muhammad at her home in Ilford, east London, in November. The 51-year-old told the Old Bailey he took two crossbows and a knife into the house as a ""deterrent"" but then accidentally shot his former partner. He denies murder and the attempted destruction of the baby. Ms Muhammad died after she was shot through the abdomen, but her unborn son was delivered by emergency caesarean section and survived. Ramanodge Unmathallegadoo was arrested at the house where Sana Muhammad was shot Giving evidence, Mr Unmathallegadoo said he wanted to confront her new husband Imtiaz Muhammad ""over the treatment my daughter was going through."" He told the court the 12-year-old was forced ""to pray in the Islamic faith and she didn't want to"". ""She was forced to eat halal food and she was forced to wear non-European clothes,"" while also being prevented from celebrating Halloween and Christmas, he said. The jury heard the 51-year-old was barred from contacting his children because of a restraining order, but he spoke to her on the way to school and ""could sense her saying 'Daddy help'"". The night before the killing, Mr Unmathallegadoo spent more than two hours moving equipment into the garden shed where he then slept, the Old Bailey was told. Asked why he did not just knock on the door, he said he ""couldn't"" as he was ""scared of Imtiaz"", who he described as a ""big man"". Mr Unmathallegadoo told the court he accidentally shot the crossbow inside the house Mr Unmathallegadoo said Mr and Mrs Muhammad had run upstairs when he accidentally fired the crossbow. He told the court the safety catch had been off as he planned to shoot into the banister rail to scare the couple, and only realised he had hit anyone when one of the children called the emergency services. Ex-wife 'shot with crossbow as she fled' Crossbow killing was 'act of revenge' The 51-year-old denied he had been stockpiling weapons, but instead had planned to take them to his native Mauritius so he could go hunting with his brother. However, during cross-examination he admitted he had not checked how much it would cost to post the items abroad, or whether the retailers could have sent them directly. Mr Unmathallegadoo also said it was ""absolutely incorrect"" that a handwritten note detailing the family's comings and goings had been created so he knew when his children would not be at home during an attack. He told the court he had actually written it so that he would know when he might bump into his children as they went to school. Speaking about his former partner, he said he felt ""really, really distressed at the thought that she got hurt because of me"". The trial continues.

"Jack Ma is stepping down as Alibaba's executive chairman The Chinese billionaire and co-founder of the online shopping giant Alibaba has continued to argue for a 9am to 9pm working day, and a six-day week.

The entrepreneurs' comments come amid reports this week that JD.com is cutting jobs. Mr Liu, who started the company that would become JD.com in 1998, recently wrote about his attitude to work, saying he used to set his alarm to wake him up every two hours to make sure he could offer his customers a full, 24-hour, service.

"Sana Muhammad, formerly known as Devi Unmathallegadoo, had been eight months pregnant A man who killed his pregnant ex-wife with a crossbow had only intended to confront her new husband about how he was raising his daughter, a jury heard. Ramanodge Unmathallegadoo shot Sana Muhammad at her home in Ilford, east London, in November. The 51-year-old told the Old Bailey he took two crossbows and a knife into the house as a ""deterrent"" but then accidentally shot his former partner. He denies murder and the attempted destruction of the baby. Ms Muhammad died after she was shot through the abdomen, but her unborn son was delivered by emergency caesarean section and survived. Ramanodge Unmathallegadoo was arrested at the house where Sana Muhammad was shot Giving evidence, Mr Unmathallegadoo said he wanted to confront her new husband Imtiaz Muhammad ""over the treatment my daughter was going through."" He told the court the 12-year-old was forced ""to pray in the Islamic faith and she didn't want to"". ""She was forced to eat halal food and she was forced to wear non-European clothes,"" while also being prevented from celebrating Halloween and Christmas, he said. The jury heard the 51-year-old was barred from contacting his children because of a restraining order, but he spoke to her on the way to school and ""could sense her saying 'Daddy help'"". The night before the killing, Mr Unmathallegadoo spent more than two hours moving equipment into the garden shed where he then slept, the Old Bailey was told. Asked why he did not just knock on the door, he said he ""couldn't"" as he was ""scared of Imtiaz"", who he described as a ""big man"". Mr Unmathallegadoo told the court he accidentally shot the crossbow inside the house Mr Unmathallegadoo said Mr and Mrs Muhammad had run upstairs when he accidentally fired the crossbow. He told the court the safety catch had been off as he planned to shoot into the banister rail to scare the couple, and only realised he had hit anyone when one of the children called the emergency services. Ex-wife 'shot with crossbow as she fled' Crossbow killing was 'act of revenge' The 51-year-old denied he had been stockpiling weapons, but instead had planned to take them to his native Mauritius so he could go hunting with his brother. However, during cross-examination he admitted he had not checked how much it would cost to post the items abroad, or whether the retailers could have sent them directly. Mr Unmathallegadoo also said it was ""absolutely incorrect"" that a handwritten note detailing the family's comings and goings had been created so he knew when his children would not be at home during an attack. He told the court he had actually written it so that he would know when he might bump into his children as they went to school. Speaking about his former partner, he said he felt ""really, really distressed at the thought that she got hurt because of me"". The trial continues.

"This video can not be played There were gasps from the crowd at the moment Notre-Dameâs spire fell A major fire has engulfed the medieval cathedral of Notre-Dame in Paris, one of France's most famous landmarks. The 850-year-old Gothic building's spire and roof have collapsed but the main structure, including the two bell towers, has been saved, officials say. Firefighters are still working to contain the blaze as teams try to salvage the artwork stored inside. President Emmanuel Macron called it a ""terrible tragedy"". The cause of the fire is not yet clear. Officials say it could be linked to the renovation work that began after cracks appeared in the stone,sparking fears the structure could become unstable. Paris prosecutor's office said it had opened an inquiry into ""accidental destruction by fire"". A firefighter was seriously injured while tackling the blaze. In pictures: Blaze at Notre-Dame Visibly emotional, Mr Macron said the ""worst had been avoided"" and vowed to launch an international fundraising scheme to rebuild the cathedral. The fire began at around 18:30 (16:30 GMT) and quickly reached the roof of the cathedral, destroying its stained-glass windows and the wooden interior before toppling the spire. Some 500 firefighters worked to prevent one of the bell towers from collapsing. More than four hours later, fire chief Jean-Claude Gallet said the main structure had been ""saved and preserved"" from total destruction. The massive cost of restoring Notre-Dame Sections of the cathedral were under scaffolding as part of the extensive renovations and 16 copper statues had been removed last week. Deputy Paris Mayor Emmanuel Gregoire said the building had suffered ""colossal damages"", and teams were working to save the cathedral's remaining artwork. This video can not be played The fire department said a major operation was under way Historian Camille Pascal told French broadcaster BFMTV that ""invaluable heritage"" had been destroyed, adding: ""Happy and unfortunate events for centuries have been marked by the bells of Notre-Dame. We can be only horrified by what we see"". Thousands of people gathered in the streets around the cathedral, observing the flames in silence. Some could be seen openly weeping, while others sang hymns or said prayers. Several churches around Paris rang their bells in response to the blaze, which happened as Catholics celebrate Holy Week. Because of the fire, Mr Macron cancelled a speech on TV in which he was due to address the street protests that have rocked France for months. Visiting the scene, the president said the cathedral was a building ""for all French people"", including those who had never been there. ""We'll rebuild Notre-Dame together"", he said as he praised the ""extreme courage"" and ""professionalism"" of the firefighters. Analysisby Henri Astier, BBCWorld Online No other site represents France quite like Notre-Dame. Its main rival as a national symbol, the Eiffel Tower, is little more than a century old. Notre-Dame has stood tall above Paris since the 1200s. It has given its name to one of the country's literary masterpieces. Victor Hugo's The Hunchback of Notre-Dame is known to the French simply as Notre-Dame de Paris. The last time the cathedral suffered major damage was during the French Revolution. It survived two world wars largely unscathed. Watching such an embodiment of the permanence of a nation burn and its spire collapse is profoundly shocking to any French person. Read more from Henri The church receives almost 13 million visitors each year, more than the Eiffel Tower A Unesco World Heritage site, it was built in the 12th and 13th centuries Several statues of the facade of the Catholic cathedral were removed for renovation The roof, which has been destroyed by the blaze, was made mostly of wood Read more about the treasures of the cathedral The Vatican expressed ""shock and sadness,"" adding that it was praying for the French fire services. Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel has offered her support to the people of France, calling Notre-Dame a ""symbol of French and European culture"". UK Prime Minister Theresa May said in a tweet,external: ""My thoughts are with the people of France tonight and with the emergency services who are fighting the terrible blaze at Notre-Dame cathedral"". Also on Twitter,US President Donald Trump said it was ""horrible to watch"",externalthe fire and suggested that ""flying water tankers"" could be used to extinguish the blaze. In an apparent response, the French Civil Security service said that was not an option as it might result in the collapse of the entire building. Massive flames at Notre-Dame.

"Carson has been described as ""bright and caring"" Police investigating the death of a 13-year-old boy have said drugs were involved and officers are focusing on finding out who supplied them. Carson Price, 13, of Hengoed, Caerphilly,was pronounced dead after being found unconscious in Ystrad Mynach Parkon Friday. A form of MDMA, known as Donkey Kong pills, is also a line of inquiry and Gwent Police is trying to trace Carson's movements prior to his death. No arrests have been made. Supt Nick McLain said a community outreach team - made up of youth workers who discourage young people from committing anti-social behaviour - were in the park on Friday. However, it is not known whether they came across or spoke to Carson. Carson's mother Tatum Chynene Price pleaded with people to help find who sold her son drugs ""The focus of our investigation is around illegal substances and the supply of those substances on the night in question,"" said Supt McLain. ""It has attracted a lot of attention on social media and that has spawned lots of intelligence and information about what has happened in this area on Friday night. Drug probe into 13-year-old's park death 'Shock' as teen found dead in park ""I think where we're focused at the moment is Carson's movement prior to him coming to the park that evening ""It's really important for us to ascertain at the moment is where he went, where he could've come into possession of drugs, and who could've supplied those drugs to him."" Youth workers visited Ystrad Mynach Park prior to Carson's death, but it not known if they spoke to him Supt McLain said ""somebody out there will know where he got those drugs from"". He added: ""It's a small community and people are rightly concerned and they want to tell us what they know.

"This video can not be played ""It was just a horrible shock"" -Alicia Powell was evicted after complaining about a leak Private landlords will no longer be able to evict tenants at short notice without good reason under new plans. The government says it wants to protect renters from ""unethical"" landlords and give them more long-term security. Section 21 notices,externalallow landlords to evict renters without a reason after their fixed-term tenancy period ends. The National Landlords Association said members were forced to use Section 21 because they had ""no confidence"" in the courts to settle possession claims. But an organisation representing tenants said the plans were ""a vital first step to ending profiteering from housing"". Where does rent hit young people hardest? 'No water and rodents' among student housing gripes First Minister Mark Drakeford has announced similar plans for Wales, while in Scotland new rules requiring landlords to give a reason for ending tenancies were introduced in 2017. There are no plans in Northern Ireland to end no-fault evictions where a fixed-term tenancy has come to an end. Housing Secretary James Brokenshire said that evidence showed so-called Section 21 evictions were one of the biggest causes of family homelessness. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the changes would offer more ""stability"" to the growing number of families renting and mean people would not be afraid to make a complaint ""because they may be concerned through a no-fault eviction that they may be thrown out"". A survey of 2,001 private renters by Citizens Advice suggests thattenants who made a formal complaint had a 46% chance of being evicted,externalwithin the next six months. Mr Brokenshire also said the plans would offer ""speedy redress"" to landlords seeking to regain possession of their property for legitimate reasons, such as to sell it or to move into it themselves. At the moment, landlords can give tenants as little as eight weeks' notice after a fixed-term contract ends. Under the government's new plans, landlords would have to provide a ""concrete, evidenced reason already specified in law"" in order to bring tenancies to an end. Mrs May said the major shake-up will protect responsible tenants from ""unethical behaviour"" and give them the ""long-term certainty and the peace of mind they deserve"". The prime minister also said the government was acting to prevent ""unfair evictions"". Michael Downes, 65, who rents out a maisonette in Coleshill, Warwickshire, said that, after his experience with a problem tenant, he feels the system is stacked against landlords. He used Section 21 to evict someone who had not paid rent for four months. He said the other method open to landlords - a Section 8 eviction - meant the renter could halt the process by paying his arrears, only to stop paying again later. Even using the quicker eviction method that is due to be banned, the tenant lived rent-free for six months, costing Mr Downes Â£5,000. If the renter had fought the case in court, it could have taken a year to move him on, Mr Downes said. ""Everything seems to be loaded towards the tenant,"" he said. ""People like me are going to think, is it worth bothering any more?"" The National Landlords Association (NLA) said its members should be able to use a Section 8 possession notice to evict someone who has broken the terms of their tenancy - for example by not paying rent. This sometimes involves landlords spending money taking action in court if the tenants refuse to leave. But NLA chief executive Richard Lambert said many landlords were forced to use Section 21 as they have ""no confidence"" in the courts to deal with Section 8 applications ""quickly and surely"". He said the proposed changes would create a new system of indefinite tenancies by the ""back door"", and the focus should be on improving the Section 8 and court process instead. The National Landlords Association says the changes would make contracts ""meaningless"" A Ministry of Housing spokesman said court processes would ""also be expedited so landlords are able to swiftly and smoothly regain their property"" where such a move is justified. Amina Gichinga, from London Renters Union - which has been campaigning for the end of no-fault evictions - said: ""This campaign success is a vital first step to ending profiteering from housing and towards a housing model based on homes for people, not profit. ""Section 21 is a pernicious piece of legislation that renters across the country will be glad to see the back of.

""Tenants need new rights and protections across the board to end costly rent increases and sub-standard homes as well as to stop unfair evictions,"" Mr Healy added. By Tom Edgington, BBC Reality Check The majority of Section 21 notices do not appear in official statistics - that's because most tenants will leave their property soon after they receive their eviction letter and do not mount a legal challenge. However, where Section 21 notices are challenged, some statistics are available. They show that the use of Section 21 has risen sharply since 2011. Last year10,128 repossessions were carried out by county court bailiffs,externalin England using ""the accelerated procedure"" (which doesn't require a court hearing). A repossession occurs when bailiffs are given permission to remove tenants from a property in order to return it to a landlord. So whilst the official numbers do not tell the whole story, they do show there is a rising trend over the long-term - even if the numbers have dropped a bit over the last couple of years.

"Jack Ma is stepping down as Alibaba's executive chairman The Chinese billionaire and co-founder of the online shopping giant Alibaba has continued to argue for a 9am to 9pm working day, and a six-day week. Jack Ma's backing for the so-called ""996 system"" is being hotly debated in the Chinese media. Last week, Mr Ma wrote that without the system, China's economy was ""very likely to lose vitality and impetus"". His stance was backed by fellow tech entrepreneur Richard Liu, the boss of ecommerce giant JD.com. On Friday, Mr Ma called the opportunity to work 996 hours a ""blessing"". Jack Ma to step down Five things about Jack Ma Mr Liu said years of rapid economic growth in China had boosted the number of ""slackers"". The country has enjoyed economic growth averaging 10% for more than 25 years - from the late 1970s to the mid 2000s - but in subsequent years that has slowed to nearer 6%. The entrepreneurs' comments come amid reports this week that JD.com is cutting jobs. Mr Liu, who started the company that would become JD.com in 1998, recently wrote about his attitude to work, saying he used to set his alarm to wake him up every two hours to make sure he could offer his customers a full, 24-hour, service. He wrote: ""JD in the last four, five years has not made any eliminations, so the number of staff has expanded rapidly, the number of people giving orders has grown and grown, while the those who are working have fallen. ""Instead, the number of slackers has rapidly grown! If this carries on, JD will have no hope! And the company will only be heartlessly kicked out of the market! Slackers are not my brothers!"" Mr Ma co-founded Alibaba, sometimes called China's eBay, in 1999 and has seen it become one of the world's biggest internet companies. The company's market value is now approximately $490bn (Â£374bn), and Mr Ma's personal wealth is estimated at around $40bn.

"This video can not be played ""It was just a horrible shock"" -Alicia Powell was evicted after complaining about a leak Private landlords will no longer be able to evict tenants at short notice without good reason under new plans. The government says it wants to protect renters from ""unethical"" landlords and give them more long-term security. Section 21 notices,externalallow landlords to evict renters without a reason after their fixed-term tenancy period ends. The National Landlords Association said members were forced to use Section 21 because they had ""no confidence"" in the courts to settle possession claims. But an organisation representing tenants said the plans were ""a vital first step to ending profiteering from housing"". Where does rent hit young people hardest? 'No water and rodents' among student housing gripes First Minister Mark Drakeford has announced similar plans for Wales, while in Scotland new rules requiring landlords to give a reason for ending tenancies were introduced in 2017. There are no plans in Northern Ireland to end no-fault evictions where a fixed-term tenancy has come to an end. Housing Secretary James Brokenshire said that evidence showed so-called Section 21 evictions were one of the biggest causes of family homelessness. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the changes would offer more ""stability"" to the growing number of families renting and mean people would not be afraid to make a complaint ""because they may be concerned through a no-fault eviction that they may be thrown out"". A survey of 2,001 private renters by Citizens Advice suggests thattenants who made a formal complaint had a 46% chance of being evicted,externalwithin the next six months. Mr Brokenshire also said the plans would offer ""speedy redress"" to landlords seeking to regain possession of their property for legitimate reasons, such as to sell it or to move into it themselves. At the moment, landlords can give tenants as little as eight weeks' notice after a fixed-term contract ends. Under the government's new plans, landlords would have to provide a ""concrete, evidenced reason already specified in law"" in order to bring tenancies to an end. Mrs May said the major shake-up will protect responsible tenants from ""unethical behaviour"" and give them the ""long-term certainty and the peace of mind they deserve"". The prime minister also said the government was acting to prevent ""unfair evictions"". Michael Downes, 65, who rents out a maisonette in Coleshill, Warwickshire, said that, after his experience with a problem tenant, he feels the system is stacked against landlords. He used Section 21 to evict someone who had not paid rent for four months. He said the other method open to landlords - a Section 8 eviction - meant the renter could halt the process by paying his arrears, only to stop paying again later. Even using the quicker eviction method that is due to be banned, the tenant lived rent-free for six months, costing Mr Downes Â£5,000. If the renter had fought the case in court, it could have taken a year to move him on, Mr Downes said. ""Everything seems to be loaded towards the tenant,"" he said. ""People like me are going to think, is it worth bothering any more?"" The National Landlords Association (NLA) said its members should be able to use a Section 8 possession notice to evict someone who has broken the terms of their tenancy - for example by not paying rent. This sometimes involves landlords spending money taking action in court if the tenants refuse to leave. But NLA chief executive Richard Lambert said many landlords were forced to use Section 21 as they have ""no confidence"" in the courts to deal with Section 8 applications ""quickly and surely"". He said the proposed changes would create a new system of indefinite tenancies by the ""back door"", and the focus should be on improving the Section 8 and court process instead. The National Landlords Association says the changes would make contracts ""meaningless"" A Ministry of Housing spokesman said court processes would ""also be expedited so landlords are able to swiftly and smoothly regain their property"" where such a move is justified. Amina Gichinga, from London Renters Union - which has been campaigning for the end of no-fault evictions - said: ""This campaign success is a vital first step to ending profiteering from housing and towards a housing model based on homes for people, not profit.

"This video can not be played There were gasps from the crowd at the moment Notre-Dameâs spire fell A major fire has engulfed the medieval cathedral of Notre-Dame in Paris, one of France's most famous landmarks. The 850-year-old Gothic building's spire and roof have collapsed but the main structure, including the two bell towers, has been saved, officials say. Firefighters are still working to contain the blaze as teams try to salvage the artwork stored inside. President Emmanuel Macron called it a ""terrible tragedy"". The cause of the fire is not yet clear. Officials say it could be linked to the renovation work that began after cracks appeared in the stone,sparking fears the structure could become unstable. Paris prosecutor's office said it had opened an inquiry into ""accidental destruction by fire"". A firefighter was seriously injured while tackling the blaze. In pictures: Blaze at Notre-Dame Visibly emotional, Mr Macron said the ""worst had been avoided"" and vowed to launch an international fundraising scheme to rebuild the cathedral. The fire began at around 18:30 (16:30 GMT) and quickly reached the roof of the cathedral, destroying its stained-glass windows and the wooden interior before toppling the spire. Some 500 firefighters worked to prevent one of the bell towers from collapsing. More than four hours later, fire chief Jean-Claude Gallet said the main structure had been ""saved and preserved"" from total destruction. The massive cost of restoring Notre-Dame Sections of the cathedral were under scaffolding as part of the extensive renovations and 16 copper statues had been removed last week. Deputy Paris Mayor Emmanuel Gregoire said the building had suffered ""colossal damages"", and teams were working to save the cathedral's remaining artwork. This video can not be played The fire department said a major operation was under way Historian Camille Pascal told French broadcaster BFMTV that ""invaluable heritage"" had been destroyed, adding: ""Happy and unfortunate events for centuries have been marked by the bells of Notre-Dame. We can be only horrified by what we see"". Thousands of people gathered in the streets around the cathedral, observing the flames in silence. Some could be seen openly weeping, while others sang hymns or said prayers. Several churches around Paris rang their bells in response to the blaze, which happened as Catholics celebrate Holy Week. Because of the fire, Mr Macron cancelled a speech on TV in which he was due to address the street protests that have rocked France for months. Visiting the scene, the president said the cathedral was a building ""for all French people"", including those who had never been there. ""We'll rebuild Notre-Dame together"", he said as he praised the ""extreme courage"" and ""professionalism"" of the firefighters. Analysisby Henri Astier, BBCWorld Online No other site represents France quite like Notre-Dame. Its main rival as a national symbol, the Eiffel Tower, is little more than a century old. Notre-Dame has stood tall above Paris since the 1200s. It has given its name to one of the country's literary masterpieces. Victor Hugo's The Hunchback of Notre-Dame is known to the French simply as Notre-Dame de Paris. The last time the cathedral suffered major damage was during the French Revolution. It survived two world wars largely unscathed. Watching such an embodiment of the permanence of a nation burn and its spire collapse is profoundly shocking to any French person. Read more from Henri The church receives almost 13 million visitors each year, more than the Eiffel Tower A Unesco World Heritage site, it was built in the 12th and 13th centuries Several statues of the facade of the Catholic cathedral were removed for renovation The roof, which has been destroyed by the blaze, was made mostly of wood Read more about the treasures of the cathedral The Vatican expressed ""shock and sadness,"" adding that it was praying for the French fire services. Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel has offered her support to the people of France, calling Notre-Dame a ""symbol of French and European culture"". UK Prime Minister Theresa May said in a tweet,external: ""My thoughts are with the people of France tonight and with the emergency services who are fighting the terrible blaze at Notre-Dame cathedral"". Also on Twitter,US President Donald Trump said it was ""horrible to watch"",externalthe fire and suggested that ""flying water tankers"" could be used to extinguish the blaze. In an apparent response, the French Civil Security service said that was not an option as it might result in the collapse of the entire building. Massive flames at Notre-Dame.

"The Yangtze giant softshell turtles thrive in muddy water and can weigh up to 90 kg (200 pounds) One of the world's rarest turtles, a Yangtze giant softshell, has died in China, leaving just three known survivors of the species. The female turtle (Rafetus swinhoei) died in Suzhou zoo in southern China. Experts had tried to artificially inseminate the creature, which was over 90 years old, for a fifth time shortly before she died. The species has suffered from hunting, overfishing and the destruction of its habitat. Several attempts at artificial insemination had taken place in the hope of continuing the species, but they all failed One male, estimated to be more than 100 years old, is left in the Chinese zoo while two other turtles live in the wild in Vietnam. The elusive nature of the turtle means it has been difficult to identify the gender of the pair. Blue Planet producer defends turtle release NI bid to save stranded loggerhead turtle Turtles and tortoises found wrapped in tape Local staff and international experts had attempted to artificially inseminate the female 24 hours before she died on Saturday afternoon. They said there were no complications from the operation and she had been in fine health after the procedure, but deteriorated the next day. The cause of her death is being investigated and the turtle's ovarian tissue was collected for future research.

"The report calls for more funds to be generated locally through an overhaul of the property tax system A new system of property tax and environmental charges should be introduced to boost Scottish council funding, according to a report. The joint paper from Unison and the Jimmy Reid Foundation calls for a ""fundamental review"" of funding. It recommends moving towards a ""more progressive"" system which would shift the burden onto property and land owners rather than council taxpayers. The Scottish government said its own reforms would ""empower"" councils. Mike Kirby, Scottish secretary of Unison, said the balance of funding for local services had changed over the years. He said that approximately 50% of the funding used to come from national government, with 50% raised directly by local authorities. However, he said 85% of funding now came from central government and 15% was raised directly by local authorities. ""Together with an overall reduction in funding, during a period of austerity, this has resulted in severe financial pressures and impacted upon the quality and delivery of vital public services,"" he said. ""Politicians in all spheres must create the time and space for a fundamental review of funding local government. ""This report is a contribution to that essential debate."" Prof Mike Danson, lead author of the report, added: ""Within the constraints of the fiscal powers devolved under successive Scotland Acts, there are still some opportunities to generate greater funding for public services locally. ""Some changes will require time to explore, plan and introduce but it is economically efficient and effective to shift the tax burden onto property and land owners and away from council taxpayers, making the tax system more progressive and more based on ability to pay."" The joint paper recommends options to increase spending on council services, including the introduction of new levies. It also calls for the recruitment of staff to ensure revenues are collected. Other recommendations include looking for more effective support for private and social enterprises. The report says unions should consider how municipalisation of public services could be appropriately pursued, and how local authority debts could be taken over by the Treasury. It also says that an expansion of local public services is possible with a ""fairer system"" of property taxes and environmental charges. Councils could get the option to introduce a workplace parking levy Councils are to receive Â£11.2bn in 2019-20 through the local government finance settlement. This is a ""real-terms"" increase in both revenue - 1.2% - and capital funding - 21.5% - compared to the previous year. A total of 20 local authorities have chosen not to increase council tax by the full 4.79% permitted. A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""The package of local tax reform measures announced at the Budget will deliver the most significant empowerment of local authorities since devolution. ""We will, this year, formally consult on the principles of a locally determined tourist tax, in addition to supporting a Green amendment to the Transport Bill that would allow councils to choose whether they wished to introduce a workplace parking levy."" A Cosla spokesman said: ""Cosla has long said that the current model is not sustainable. We reiterated this point in our essential services campaign. ""Undoubtedly there is a funding issue for local government and we are happy to engage in any debate that gives us more funding and flexibility to deliver essential services for our communities."" The paper is being launched at the STUC's 122nd Annual Congress in Dundee.

"Doorstep scammers took more than Â£700,000 from people across Scotland in six months, according to new figures. Police Scotland said 249 victims were targeted between April and September last year. The figures were released ahead of a new campaign, Shut Out Scammers, which aims to raise awareness on cold calls. While half of those hit by scams could be considered ""vulnerable"", police are stressing that a wide rangle of people are falling victim to such frauds. Ch Supt John McKenzie warned: ""Nobody is immune to this kind of crime."" Scotland bank scheme 'prevents' Â£5.5m fraud TSB pledges to refund fraud victims Police also highlighted that many fraudsters have links to organised crime groups. Ch Supt McKenzie continued: ""It is incredibly invasive and victims often feel embarrassed about being deceived. ""We take doorstep crime very seriously and understand the significant impact it has on victims. It is vital that people report crimes to us when they happen. ""Our Shut Out Scammers campaign will help us stop more members of our communities being targeted by those intent on defrauding them of cash or gaining access to their homes. ""We want to make sure victims know where to turn to so that they can receive all the necessary support and assistance. ""There is no specific look to a bogus caller or rogue trader. Be alert, and if you have any concerns at all, do not allow an individual entry to your home, or provide them with any form of payment and do not hesitate to phone the police immediately. ""Always ask for ID and only let callers in if they have an appointment and you know that they are genuine."" The Police Scotland campaign will be carried out in conjunction with a number of partner organisations to highlight prevention advice and support services. Derek Mitchell, chief executive of Citizens Advice Scotland which is one of the partners,  said: ""A scam is a crime and should be treated as such. ""The Scottish CAB (Citizens Advice Bureaux) network is always happy to engage with campaigns like this to help people avoid scams, and to stress the importance of reporting them. ""Scammers rely on people not talking about them to friends and neighbours, so the more we talk about this issue the better. ""If you have experienced any type of scam we would urge you to report it.

Maisie Williams, who has played Arya Stark since she was a teenager, was there and she told the Observer she has no intention of chasing more fame than she already has, once the show wraps up at the end of the series. ""I feel like I personally have to remove myself,"" said the 22-year-old, ""because I had a taste of that sort of fame with this show and I made a vow to myself: I do not want that. ""My agents say things to me like, 'We'll raise your profile', and I don't really understand what that means because to me it sounds like getting a whole lot more famous, which is something I'm not interested in.

Maisie Williams, Kit Harington, Sophie Turner and Isaac Hempstead Wright attend Belfast screening on Friday night Episode one, starring Williams, Kit Harington as Jon Snow and Emilia Clarke as Daenerys Targaryen, as well as Lena Headey's Cersei Lannister, had a running time of 54 minutes which is, apparently, the shortest of the whopping big-sounding eighth season.

"The ICO is concerned that Facebook likes encourage children to over-share personal information Facebook and Instagram face limits on letting under-18s ""like"" posts on their platforms while Snapchat could be prevented from allowing the age group to build up ""streaks"", under new rules proposed by the UK's data watchdog. It believes the tools encourage users to share more personal data and spend more time on apps than desired. Likes help build up profiles of users' interests while streaks encourage them to send photos and videos daily. The proposal is part of a 16-rule code. Speaking to the BBC's World At One , the Information Commissioner's Office suggested that social media networks could avoid an outright ban on ""likes"" if they stopped collecting personal data when children engaged with them. Snapchat displays a fire icon to represent streaks - which represents the fact that two members have messaged each other for several days in a row To ensure its success, the ICO added that online services must also adopt ""robust"" age-verification systems. In addition to calling for restrictions on children being exposed to so-called ""nudge techniques"",the ICO advocates internet firms,externalmake the following changes among others for their younger members: make privacy settings ""high"" by default switch location-tracking off by default after each session and make it obvious when it had been activated give children choices over which elements of the service they want to activate and then collect and retain the minimum amount of personal data provide ""bite-sized"" explanations in clear language about how users' personal data is used make it clear if parental controls, such as activity-tracking, are being used The ICO suggests that firms that do not comply with the code could face fines of up to 20 million euros (Â£17.2m) or 4% of their worldwide turnover under the General Data Protection Regulation. ""The internet and all its wonders are hardwired into their everyday lives,"" commented Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham. ""We shouldn't have to prevent our children from being able to use it, but we must demand that they are protected when they do. This code does that."" Her office is now seeking feedback as part of a consultation that will run until 31 May. It is envisaged that the rules would come into effect next year. Social media: How can governments regulate it? UK plans social media and internet watchdog Australia targets tech firms with 'abhorrent material' laws The Internet Association UK - which represents Facebook, Snap and other tech firms - has already raised concerns. ""Any new guidelines must be technically possible to implement in practice, and not stifle innovation and opportunities for smaller platforms,"" said its executive director Daniel Dyball. ""We must be careful when designing regulation to ensure any technical challenges, particularly around age verification, are understood and taken into consideration."" Restrictions on Facebook's like button - which registers a user's interest in another user or advertiser's post - and Snapchat streaks - which count the number of consecutive days two members have messaged each other - are not the only nudge behaviours being targeted. The ICO also says that apps should not: show boxes where the Yes button is much bigger than that for No use language that presents a data-sharing option in a much more positive light than the alternative make it much more cumbersome to select the high-privacy option by, for example, requiring more clicks to turn it on The ICO says nudge techniques like those above encourage children to make poor privacy decisions These, it said, exploit ""human susceptibility to reward-seeking behaviours in order to keep users online"". However, the regulator said it was appropriate in some cases to use nudges that encourage children to opt for privacy-enhancing settings, or to take a break after using an online service for some time. The ICO's rules follow a proposal from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) for the creation of an independent tech watchdog that would write its own ""code of practice"" for online companies. The suggestions have already been welcomed by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC). ""Social networks have continually failed to prioritise child safety in their design, which has resulted in tragic consequences,"" commented the charity's Andy Burrows. ""This design code from the ICO is a really significant package of measures, but it must go hand in hand with the government following through on its commitment to enshrine in law a new duty of care on social networks and an independent regulator with powers to investigate and fine."" But the code has drawn criticism from the Adam Smith Institute think tank. ""The ICO is an unelected quango introducing draconian limitations on the internet with the threat of massive fines,"" said its head of research Matthew Lesh. ""It is ridiculous to infantilise people and treat everyone as children."" This new proposed code arrives a week after the sweeping new regulatory powers outlined in the government's Online Harms White Paper and with much less of a fanfare. But whereas the all-powerful regulator is unlikely to be in place for many months or even years, the Information Commissioner's Office expects to get its Children's Code of Practice into law this summer. That means that Facebook and Instagram - among others - will need to think rapidly about whether their platforms risk breaking the new rules. The ICO made clear this morning that its problem with ""likes"" and ""streaks"" is not the features themselves but how they are used to collect data and target children with advertising. So, if the platforms want to hold on to what they regard as useful elements of the social media experience, they'll have to show they work differently for children than for adults. The other key demand from the data watchdog is to make the default privacy settings for platforms suitable for everyone including children. That will mean adults having to opt in to the kind of data collection which is a key part of the business model of social media firms - so this code could pose a real threat to their bottom line.

"As it stands, the UK is likely to take part in European elections It is an ""absolute priority"" for the government to leave the EU by 23 May to avoid having to take part in European elections, Jeremy Hunt has said. The foreign secretary said the public would find it ""hugely disappointing"" to be asked to send MEPs to Brussels. Asked if it could be a disaster for the Tories, he told the BBC ""in terms of polling it certainly looks that way"". Some local Tory activists have signalled they will not campaign and regard the polls as a ""distraction"". Downing Street said that in order to avoid the need for elections, legislation implementing the Brexit withdrawal deal would have to be passed by Parliament by 22 May. Last week, the EU agreed a new Brexit deadline of 31 October. Talks between the government and Labour are set to continue over the Easter parliamentary recess in the hope of finding an agreement that will be acceptable to MPs. Cross-party Brexit talks 'testing ideas' How UK is gearing up for European elections Brexit: What happens next? A series of working groups in key areas, such as environmental standards, security and workers' rights, have been set up to try and find common ground. Speaking on a visit to Japan, Mr Hunt said the talks with Labour had been ""more constructive than people thought"" but ""we don't know if they are going to work"". If they did not lead anywhere, he suggested the government may ""need to find a way to rebuild the DUP-Conservative coalition"", which has come under real strain from Brexit. The Democratic Unionists are supposed to support the government in key parliamentary votes to give it a majority in the House of Commons. But they have refused to support the prime minister's withdrawal agreement over concerns with the controversial Irish backstop, which aims to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. The foreign secretary said Japan would remain a close economic partner whatever happened with Brexit Mr Hunt told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that continuing Brexit ""paralysis"" would be ""highly damaging"" to the UK's global standing and international trading partners ""are worried that we will become submerged in the mire of Brexit indecision"". While Japan and other major foreign investors were keen for the UK to ""make up its mind"" about Brexit, he suggested they would continue to keep faith with the UK even if it left without a deal. ""(Japan) has signed a deal with the EU and, in a no-deal situation, we hope that would roll over and apply for us, although no-deal, I think, is looking much less likely,"" he said. ""I think they are very keen to protect their trading relationship with the UK, but I think they are also wanting to talk to us about other things."" What trade deals has the UK done so far? However, in February, the governmentreleased a statement,externalsaying it would not be able to replicate the EU's free trade deal with Japan after Brexit. And Japan has not agreed to continuing existing trade terms in the event of no deal. Mr Hunt downplayed talk of an imminent Conservative leadership contest, saying it would be a ""sidetrack"" from Brexit. The foreign secretary, along with his predecessor Boris Johnson, are among a long list of potential candidates touted to succeed Mrs May when she stands down. Asked whether the next leader could be someone, like himself, who campaigned to remain in the EU, Mr Hunt replied: ""There is one very big difference between me and Boris, which is that I am foreign secretary and I have a very big job to do to try and get this deal over the line and that has to be my focus. ""I think that what matters is we have a cabinet that believes in Brexit."" On the first day of his trip to Japan, Mr Hunt met the country's prime minister Shinzo Abe and other political leaders. He also took some time out of his political schedule to talk to pupils in a school in Tokyo. Mr Hunt is a fluent Japanese speaker, having taught English as a foreign language in Japan in his 20s.

"Ms Begum left Bethnal Green, east London, in 2015 to join the Islamic State group in Syria Shamima Begum - who joined the Islamic State group aged 15 - is set to be granted legal aid to fight the decision to revoke her UK citizenship. The 19-year-old, who left east London in 2015, was stripped of her citizenship in February, after she was found in a Syrian refugee camp. Her family has previously said it planned to challenge the decision. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the idea of the provision of legal aid to Ms Begum made him ""very uncomfortable"". Mr Hunt added, however, that the UK was ""a country that believes that people with limited means should have access to the resources of the state if they want to challenge the decisions the state has made about them"". Legal aid is financial assistance provided by the taxpayer to those unable to afford legal representation themselves, whether they are accused of a crime or a victim who seeks the help of a lawyer through the court process. It is means-tested and availability has been cut back significantly in recent years in England and Wales. Civil servants at the Legal Aid Agency, which is part of the Ministry of Justice, are responsible for making decisions about who receives legal aid. Earlier, the BBC reported Ms Begum's case had been approved - but sources now say it will be formally signed off in the coming days. What is Shamima Begum's legal status? Legal aid: Who is entitled to it? 'I didn't want to be IS poster girl' The women and children no-one wants The legal aid that is expected to be granted covers a case before the semi-secret Special Immigration Appeals Commission (Siac), which adjudicates on cases where the home secretary has stripped someone of their nationality on grounds of national security. Cases before Siac are among the most complicated legal challenges that the government can face. This is because they typically involve a complex combination of MI5 intelligence reports, which cannot be disclosed to the complainant, and long-standing law on achieving a fair hearing. It is not yet clear when the expected case will be heard but the Siac process can take years to complete - and granting of legal aid in these circumstances is not unusual. Over the last decade or so there have been many other people stripped of nationality on the basis they are linked to terrorism who have been legally-aided during the Siac process. Ms Begum left the UK in February 2015 alongside fellow Bethnal Green Academy pupils 15-year-old Amira Abase and 16-year-old Kadiza Sultana. Ms Begum was found in a Syrian refugee camp in February 2019 and said she wanted to return home. Soon afterwards, she gave birth to a boy called Jarrah. He died of pneumonia in March at less than three weeks of age. She had two other children who also died. In the wake of the boy's death, Home Secretary Sajid Javid was criticised over the decision to strip Ms Begum of her British citizenship. Three weeks prior to the death, Ms Begum's sister, Renu Begum, had written to Mr Javid asking him to help her bring the baby to the UK. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""We should not judge outside of a court"" On Monday,the Daily Mail first reported that legal aid had been granted,externalin response to an application made on 19 March. Mr Javid said the granting of legal aid was a decision for legal aid organisations and it was ""not for ministers to comment"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn argued Ms Begum had the right to apply for legal aid. ""She is a British citizen,"" he said. ""She's therefore entitled to apply for legal aid if she has a legal problem just like anybody else is."" He added: ""The whole point of legal aid is that if you're facing a prosecution then you're entitled to be represented and that's a fundamental rule of law, a fundamental point in any democratic society."" Dal Babu, a former chief superintendent in the Metropolitan Police and a friend of the family, said Ms Begum should have legal aid to make sure the correct process is followed. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think legal aid is a principle of the British legal justice system."" Under the1981 British Nationality Act,external, a person can be deprived of their citizenship if the home secretary is satisfied it would be ""conducive to the public good"" and they would not become stateless as a result. It was thought Ms Begum had Bangladeshi citizenship through her mother - although Bangladesh's ministry of foreign affairs said she had been""erroneously identified"" as a Bangladeshi national. Human rights group Liberty said granting legal aid in this case was ""not just appropriate but absolutely necessary to ensure that the government's decisions are properly scrutinised"".

"Legal aid is the money provided by the government to cover legal costs for people who can't afford them.

The first question is whether you are involved in a civil or criminal case. Criminal cases are generally those in which somebody has been arrested by police, and then a decision has been taken by the Crown Prosecution Service to take them to court. Anybody who has been arrested is entitled to legal advice at the police station, which is paid for by legal aid. If the case moves on to a court, any defendant under 18 or who is receiving certain benefits such as universal credit or income support, is automatically entitled to legal aid. Other people need to go through ameans test,external, which will take into account the applicant's income and savings as well as their household's - for example, whether they have a partner who is earning anything and whether they have children under 18. It will also depend on which court is hearing their case - less serious offences tend to be decided by a magistrates' court, while more serious ones go to the Crown Court. To qualify for legal aid there is also an Interests of Justice (IoJ) test, which depends on the seriousness of the crime involved. Cases going to Crown Court automatically pass the IoJ test. You're more likely to get legal aid if there is a chance you could lose your livelihood or liberty, if you lose the case. People with more than a certain level of income or savings may have to pay some or all of their legal costs. Civil cases involve other matters that could end up in a court or tribunal, such as family matters, debt or housing problems. To get legal aid for a civil caseyou have to demonstrate,externalthat the problem you are dealing with is serious - not all civil cases are eligible for legal aid - and that you can't afford to pay for it yourself. Again, the decision will be based on your income and savings and your household's. If you are under 18, it will also consider the income of your parents. Even if you do get legal aid, you may have to repay your legal costs if you win money or property from the case. Legal aid is not means-tested for cases involving a mental health tribunal, children in care or child abduction. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"Ms Begum was 15 and living in Bethnal Green, London, when she left the UK in 2015 Shamima Begum - the schoolgirl who fled London to join the Islamic State group in Syria - has been stripped of her UK citizenship after expressing a desire to return. It is only possible to strip someone of their UK nationality if they are eligible for citizenship elsewhere - and it is thought Ms Begum could be a Bangladeshi citizen because she was born to a mother believed to be Bangladeshi. However, Bangladesh's ministry of foreign affairs has said Ms Begum is not a Bangladeshi citizen and there is ""no question"" of her being allowed into the country. Expert lawyers with experience in Bangladeshi citizenship cases have told the BBC that under Bangladesh law, a UK national like Ms Begum, if born to a Bangladeshi parent, is automatically a Bangladeshi citizen. That means that such a person would have dual nationality. If the person remains in the UK, their Bangladeshi citizenship remains in existence but dormant. Under this ""blood line"" law, Bangladeshi nationality and citizenship lapse when a person reaches the age of 21, unless they make efforts to activate and retain it. So, it is Ms Begum's age, 19, that is likely - in part - to have given Home Office lawyers and the home secretary reassurance there was a legal basis for stripping her of her UK citizenship. IS teenager to lose UK citizenship IS bride 'is not Bangladeshi citizen' How do countries deal with IS returnees? In 2018, the government lost an appeal case brought by two British citizens of Bangladeshi origin who were stripped of their citizenship when they were abroad. The Special Immigration Appeals Commission ruled that E3 and N3 had not tried to retain their citizenship before they reached the age of 21, and so it had automatically lapsed. This video can not be played Shamima Begum: ""I got tricked and I was hoping someone would have sympathy with me"" That meant that the decision to strip them of their UK citizenship had rendered them stateless. Ms Begum's case is different. Her Bangladeshi citizenship, if established, would remain intact until she reaches 21, even if she has never visited the country or made active efforts to retain her citizenship. Home Secretary Sajid Javid has suggested that the decision to remove Ms Begum's UK citizenship will have no impact on her baby son's nationality. While refusing to comment on individual cases, he told the Commons: ""Children should not suffer. So, if a parent does lose their British citizenship, it does not affect the rights of their child."" Lord Carlile, former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said the baby may also be entitled to Bangladeshi and Dutch nationality - Ms Begum's husband is a Dutch convert to Islam, who she married in Syria. As a British citizen, Ms Begum's child would have a right to enter the UK. However the British government has no consular staff in Syria to help get him out of the country. Even if that were possible, the question of whether he should be separated from his mother would open up a whole new moral conundrum. And after losing two children to illness in Syria, Ms Begum seems desperate to keep her third. Under international law,external, a stateless person is someone who is ""not considered as a national by any state under the operation of its law"". The Universal Declaration of Human Rights,externalstates that everyone has the right to a nationality and ""no-one shall be arbitrarily deprived of their nationality"". The home secretary has the power,externalto strip an individual of their British citizenship on the basis that it is ""conducive to the public good"", as long as the person would not become stateless as a result. The Home Office says that the exception to this is where the UK government believes the person is eligible to acquire the citizenship of another country - even if they do not currently have dual nationality. This video can not be played The BBC asked people in London's Bethnal Green, where Shamima Begum went to school, whether she should be allowed back to the UK Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott has accused Mr Javid of breaching the declaration by stripping Ms Begum of her UK citizenship. However, Mr Javid has said the Home Office would never take that decision if someone only had one nationality. Effectively, yes. If both your parents were born in the UK and you do not have dual nationality, it would not be possible for the Home Office to strip you of your British citizenship, as this would leave you stateless. But for a British child of a dual national or immigrant, who is eligible for another nationality, it would be. Lord Anderson, a former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said it ""effectively brings about two classes of citizenship"". She would need to bring a legal challenge against the home secretary's decision to strip her of her citizenship. This would be heard at the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (Siac). If her family disagreed with that panel's decision, they could appeal on a point of law to a higher court, and ultimately to the UK Supreme Court. Since 2015, Siachas heard seven cases involving loss of citizenship,external, of which two were successful. But it can take years before a case is brought to Siac - so there could be a lot of cases that are still waiting to be heard. Until very recently, the power to strip an individual of their citizenship was rarely used. In 2016 it was used just 14 times, but this increased to 104 in 2017 - the latest year data is available.

"This video can not be played Pete Buttigieg is currently a mayor in Indiana and speaks seven languages Pete Buttigieg has officially launched his bid to become the Democratic Party nominee for the 2020 presidential election and challenge Donald Trump for the White House. He held his launch event in South Bend, the Indiana town where he has served as mayor since 2012. Setting out his vision to ""re-imagine our future"", he promised a ""totally different"" politics from Mr Trump. Should he win, Mr Buttigieg would be the first openly gay US president. Which Democrat will take on Trump in 2020? How a young, gay mayor became a Democratic star Anthony Zurcher casts his eye over the Democrats At 37, he is the youngest entrant in a crowded field of Democratic candidates that features Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, 77, and 69-year-old Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. Despite his relative inexperience, the former Rhodes Scholar has surged in the polls in recent weeks, propelling him from the margins to the front of the pack. In a veiled attack on the Trump administration, he railed against the ""myth being sold"" by those who sought to ""stop the clock and turn it back"". Pete Buttigieg has proven popular in the polls ""It is time to walk away from the politics of the past and toward something totally different,"" he told supporters at his launch event. His campaign has so far focused on gun control, climate change and LGBT rights and other progressive issues he hopes will appeal to millennial voters. Mr Buttigieg's track record as mayor of South Bend, which has seen a struggling economy improve during his tenure, has also earned him plaudits. Since announcing his presidential run in January, Mr Buttigieg has garnered a wave of attention from the media and voters, raising more than $7m (Â£5.3m) in funds in the first quarter of 2019. Analysts believe he could appeal to both moderates and progressives in the Democratic Party. Opinion polls in Iowa and New Hampshire last week put Mr Buttigieg third in both states, behind Bernie Sanders and former Vice-President Joe Biden. Mr Sanders launched his run last month, while Mr Biden, who has faced allegations of inappropriate touching by several women, is yet to announce his candidacy. Allow Twitter content?

At the rally, Mr Buttigieg sought to differentiate himself from rivals as a candidate taking the ""long view"", especially on issues such as climate change. ""I recognise the audacity of doing this as a Midwestern millennial mayor,"" he said. ""More than a little boldâ¦ But we live in a moment that compels us each to act. The forces changing our country today are tectonic."" More than a dozen rivals are running to be the Democratic Party candidate for the presidential election in November 2020. The process of selecting a nominee will begin early next year. Born in South Bend in 1982, Mr Buttigieg studied at Harvard and Oxford, graduating from the latter in 2007 with first-class honours in philosophy, politics and economics. He went on to work as a consultant at McKinsey & Company between 2007 and 2010 and served for seven months in Afghanistan as a Navy reservist in 2014. At 29, he was elected mayor of South Bend, taking office in January 2012. Despite an unsuccessful run for chairman of the Democratic National Committee in 2017, former President Barack Obama name-checked him as a rising star. The video announcing he will run for president focuses on his role in the Rust Belt city's redevelopment and also takes aim at corruption and infighting in Washington. He came out as gay in 2015 and married Chasten Glezman, a middle school teacher, last year. In his rally speech, Mr Buttigieg positioned himself as the voice of millennials. Critics say his campaign has so far emphasised values and his personal story rather than a distinctive policy agenda. He has, however, expressed support for: Tougher action on climate change, including the so-called ""Green New Deal"" proposals Gun control reform, namely universal background checks A wealth tax to fund government spending The withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan Passing the Federal Equality Act, legislation that would give federal non-discrimination protections to LGBT people Pete Buttigieg has joined the race to stop Donald Trump from being re-elected.

"Mahad Egal and his partner Jamie Murray fear the council would not let them back in if they left the flat A family who survived the Grenfell Tower fire has said they are set to be moved out of their temporary home, as the council will no longer pay for it. Mahad Egal and Jamie Murray and their two young children want to stay in the property, but Kensington and Chelsea Council has said it is ""no longer suitable"" and will not renew it. It has offered the family alternative temporary housing instead. The council says that it has not threatened anyone with eviction. The couple has previously been offered a permanent home, but declined it over fears about the use of aluminium, although the council said that all its homes for survivors were safe. Seventy-two people died in the Grenfell Tower fire on 14 June 2017 The couple and their two children, aged three and five, escaped from the fourth floor of Grenfell Towerduring the fire in June 2017, in which 72 people died. They moved into a permanent home last month, but within three weeks had returned to their temporary accommodation - which they first entered in August 2017. Ms Murray told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme that the permanent home had been connected to a building with aluminium decorative casing around the windows. They could see this through the living room window and it made them feel unsafe following their experiences of the fire. The council said the material was not flammable and was ""one of the safest forms of rain-screening building material available in the industry"". But Ms Murray said: ""We were given similar reassurances when we lived in Grenfell Tower. ""[The council] are talking about physical safety, [but] you telling me that I am safe does not make me feel safe."" No-fault evictions to be banned in England Preventable deaths? The story of Grenfell Tower flat 113 Grenfell Tower: Prosecution file 'unlikely' before 2021 Ms Murray added that the stress of their present situation had caused her to experience vomit-inducing anxiety and made her flashbacks worse. In the last two weeks she said she has also suffered a miscarriage. The family added that moving from one property to another with two children would be ""stressful and unnecessary"" and Mr Egal was reporting symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). They said the next time they move, they want it to be their permanent ""forever"" home. The couple said they were now effectively being evicted from their current temporary accommodation. In a legal letter seen by the Victoria Derbyshire programme, Kensington and Chelsea Council state that it was ""no longer suitable"". The family now say they fear leaving the home in case they are not allowed back in. Mr Egal told the BBC that ""every day from now on is a potential eviction day"" and he feared the effect it would have on their children. He added that the council has paid the rent for last week and the weekend just gone, but that is it. Local Labour MP Emma Dent Coad said the council saw some Grenfell survivors as ""troublesome"" and wanted to ""clear the decks"" before the second anniversary of the tragedy on 14 June. She said there was ""no culture change"" at the council, and she could see no justification ""at all"" for wanting to move the family from their temporary accommodation. Kensington and Chelsea Council said in a statement: ""We have worked with more than 180 households from Grenfell Tower to find them a suitable, permanent home. ""A small number of families find they have trouble settling into their new property and if they wish to move, we will find them suitable temporary housing while they consider what they want for the long term.

"The right to food is currently enshrined in international human rights law The human right to food should be put into Scots Law to protect people from rising insecurity, a report to the Scottish government suggests. The Scottish Human Rights Commission believes the move ""would help tackle health inequalities"". Its report was compiled forthe Scottish government's consultation on making Scotland a ""good food nation"". The government said it was committed to protecting internationally-recognised human rights. The right to food is currently enshrined in international legislation. The commission said this right - which involves food being accessible, adequate and available for everyone - is not being realised across Scotland. Food insecurity is ""unacceptably high"", the report said, with more than 480,500 food parcels being handed out by food banks between April 2017 and September 2018. It continues: ""Health inequalities are persistent with many people, including children, unable to afford or access a healthy and nutritious diet."" Before making its submission, the commission spoke to people experiencing food poverty in Scotland, including a mother who lives with her one-year-old son in a rural area. She said: ""My universal credit was delayed and I had 85p left in my bank account. ""I had run out of nappies and wipes and was worried I would have no money for milk or food for my son if it did not come through. ""I had a food parcel delivered recently and I think I'll need another this week. ""To reach a low-cost supermarket is a three-mile walk, making it a six-mile round trip on foot with my baby in a buggy. ""To get the bus would cost me Â£5, which would take a significant chunk out of my weekly food budget."" Commission chairwoman Judith Robertson said: ""International law is clear that governments have obligations to take action to ensure people's right to food is realised. ""The Scottish Human Rights Commission is calling on the government to take action to incorporate the right to food into Scotland's laws as part of its work to make Scotland a good food nation. ""We want to see the Scottish government showing human rights leadership in a practical way."" The consultation document states that the option of exploring a right to food which is directly enforceable under Scots law ""has not been ruled out"". But it suggests any proposals sit within wider human rights responsibilities. The Scottish government said a national taskforce was being established to take forward the group's recommendations. A spokesman added: ""We have also increased our Fair Food Fund to Â£3.5m this year to continue supporting organisations that help to tackle the causes of food insecurity.""

"Extinction Rebellion blocked Waterloo Bridge on Monday Thousands of people joined protests across central London as climate change activists blocked roads and vandalised Shell's headquarters. Extinction Rebellion campaigners parked a pink boat at Oxford Circus and blocked Marble Arch, Piccadilly Circus and roads around Parliament Square. Protester Yen Chit Chong said: ""This is our last best shot at survival."" Among a total of 52 arrests, five people were detained on suspicion of criminal damage at Shell's HQ. The three men and two women were taken to a police station in central London after a glass door was smashed at the offices near Waterloo. The majority of those arrested were detained on suspicion of public order offences. Just after midnight on Monday, Transport for London (TfL) confirmed it had suspended bus services on the N18 route because Great Portland Street was blocked by protesters. Earlier, police had ordered the protesters to restrict their actions to the Marble Arch area to prevent further disruption. Protesters parked a boat at Oxford Circus to represent the threat posed by rising sea levels Organisers claim protests have been held in more than 80 cities across 33 countries. Protester Olivia Evershed, 23, said: ""I hope that it's really going to bring awareness about the emergency crisis that we are in, and encourage the government to act. ""We've got 12 years to act before there is irreversible damage to the environment and we start to see catastrophic changes. If we don't do anything to change this, our children will die.""

Extinction Rebellion said protests would continue throughout the week ""escalating the creative disruption across the capital day by day"". The group said it planned to ""bring London to a standstill for up to two weeks"", and wanted the government to take urgent action to tackle climate change. In Parliament Square, protesters unfurled banners, held up placards and waved flags as speakers took to the stage. Since its launch last year, members have shut bridges, poured buckets of fake blood outside Downing Street, blockaded the BBC and stripped semi-naked in Parliament. It has three core demands: for the government to ""tell the truth about climate change"", reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025, and create a citizens' assembly to oversee progress. Controversially, the group is trying to get as many people arrested as possible. One of the group's founders, Roger Hallam, believes that mass participation and civil disobedience maximise the chances of social change. But critics say they cause unnecessary disruption and waste police time when forces are already overstretched. Protesters caused more than Â£6,000 damage at the Shell headquarters in Belvedere Road Oil company Shell had its London headquarters targeted By intentionally causing more than Â£6,000 damage at the Shell headquarters activists aim to get the case into crown court to put their case to a jury, the campaign said.

"Chiang Mai is a popular tourist destination in northern Thailand A Canadian tourist has fallen to his death after a zipline cable snapped in northern Thailand, authorities say. Authorities in Chiang Mai say the 25-year-old man was on holiday with his girlfriend.

The attraction, Flight of the Gibbon, has reportedly been closed while police investigate.

He is then said to have tumbled down a hill, a source told the BBC. Thai authorities are investigating several issues, including whether the weight limit was exceeded and any potential negligence on the part of the operators.

"Multipacks of Guinness will now come in a cardboard box Drinks giant Diageo has announced that it is removing plastic from multipacks of its Irish stout brand Guinness. Plastic ring carriers and shrink wrap will be also removed from packs of Harp, Rockshore and Smithwick's beers, as part of Diageo's Â£16m initiative. The change will be phased in with multi-can packs sold in ""100% recyclable and biodegradable cardboard"" in Ireland from August this year. The new packaging will then be used in the UK and globally next year. Many companies have been committing to being more green after concerns about plastic waste were highlighted in shows such as the BBC's Blue Planet 2, narrated by Sir David Attenborough. Last year, rival brewer Carlsberg switched to using a glue instead of plastic to hold together its cans. And more recently, Nestle got rid of plastic straws from its products and is using paper ones instead. Last month Coca-Cola started releasing informationon how much plastic it used - three million tonnes of plastic packaging in one year. That was part of a report by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, which is pushing for companies and governments to do more to tackle plastic pollution. In total, 150 companies have pledged to reduce their plastic usage as part of the campaign. Diageo's bottling and packaging plant in Northern Ireland will be the first site producing the new packs, with the firm investing Â£8m in its east Belfast plant. It packages products which are exported around the world, including to the US, Canada, South Korea and Europe. Diageo says under 5% of its total packaging is plastic and the changes will reduce usage by over 400 tonnes annually. Oliver Loomes, country director of Diageo Ireland, said: ""Managing our environmental impact is important for the planet and the financial sustainability of our business. ""We already have one of the most sustainable breweries in the world at (Dublin's) St James's Gate and we are now leading the way in sustainable packaging. This is good news for the environment and for our brand."" Friends of the Earth plastic-free campaigner Emma Priestland welcomed Diageo's move, but added that new legislation was needed to ""end the scourge of plastic pollution that harms our environment and wildlife"". Greenpeace spokesperson Mirjam Kopp said: ""It's great the Diageo is looking at ways to move away from plastic packaging. ""[But] by replacing plastic packaging with cardboard sleeves and boxes, Diageo will increase its reliance on pulp and paper, increasing the pressure on forests and potentially leading to more deforestation that, in turn, accelerates climate change. The real solution is to end throwaway packaging across the board and embrace systems of refill and reuse."" Prime Minister Theresa May has pledged to ban all avoidable plastic waste in the UK by 2042.

"More than 200 pupils spent at least five straight days in isolation booths in schools in England last year A girl who tried to kill herself after spending months in an isolation booth at school has said she felt ""alone, trapped and no-one seemed to care"". The teenager, who has autism, had no direct teaching and ate her lunch in the room, away from friends. Her mother said for months she was unaware of what was happening to her daughter and called on the government to improve guidance for schools. The Department for Education says pupil welfare must always be put first. Its guidelines say children should be in isolation for no longer than is necessary. In a letter to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme, the teenager - who we are calling ""Sophie"" - said: ""I decided I'd rather die than be in isolation because of the mood it left me in. ""I felt alone and trapped at school for such a long time that I felt as though it would be best, as no-one seemed to care anyway."" Her mother, ""Philippa"", estimates that her daughter was placed in an isolation booth at her secondary school more than 240 times in total - beginning in year seven but becoming more frequent in years 10 and 11. The 16-year-old spent every school day from mid-January to March this year in the room, the family say. She explained: ""The room has six booths with a small workspace and sides so you cannot see other people. ""You have to sit in silence and be escorted to the toilet which is embarrassing."" Example of isolation booths used in hundreds of schools in England On one occasion, Sophie said: ""I begged the teachers to ring my Mum as I didn't want to be alone any more. ""They refused and took my phone away, leaving me and a teacher I didn't know in an enclosed room."" After she tried to take her own life, Sophie returned to school but said she would ""dread each day"" when she was again placed in isolation. ""I would often have panic attacks and feel claustrophobic,"" she explained. ""I feel as though isolation rooms should be banned. ""They tend to make students feel isolated and helpless, knocking their self-esteem. ""Due to the amount of stress and trauma throughout school I now suffer with depression and anxiety."" This video can not be played 'Sophie' - voiced by an actor - says ""no-one seemed to care"" about her isolation According to a BBC investigation last year,more than 200 pupils spent at least five straight days in isolation boothsin schools in England last year. And more than 5,000 children with special educational needs also attended isolation rooms at some stage. Government guidance in England says schools are free to decide how long pupils should be kept in isolation, but they should be there ""no longer than is necessary"". The guidelines also say that in order for isolation to be lawful as a punishment it should be ""reasonable"" in all circumstances, and factors such as special educational needs should be taken into account. Schools do not need to record use or report to parents that their child has been sent to isolation, although many do. The school behaviour expert, Tom Bennett, who has advised the government, has said isolation rooms can be effective in tackling disruption in classrooms, and preventing fixed-term exclusions. ""When you're a lone adult with a class of 25 pupils, it only take two people to really persistently wilfully misbehave for that lesson to be completely detonated,"" he told the BBC in November. The family say they understand the need for isolation booths for short spells of time Philippa told the Victoria Derbyshire programme Sophie was now a ""completely different child"". Sophie has selective mutism - she did not speak until the age of eight - as well as autism, and can be ""defiant"" and ""disobedient"", her mother said - but this was ""all part of her diagnosis"". She added that Sophie - who ""does not deal with change very well"" as part of her condition - was ""regularly"" placed in isolation after she reacted badly to a change in teachers, classroom and routine. She said as a result her communication had regressed. ""Being isolated from her friends... made her become more internal - stop talking, stop communicating."" Philippa added that the school had also been aware of her daughter's plans to self-harm before she tried to take her own life, through a letter the teenager had written to them. But the school did not make her aware of the letter at the time, she said. When she discovered that Sophie had been in isolation booths - by now in year 11 at school - she said she felt ""traumatised"". ""I can't even begin to explain how it makes you feel knowing every day I'd send her into the school and she felt that alone that she wanted to take her own life."" The family's solicitor, Simpson Millar, have written to the government demanding action and improvements to isolation guidelines. Philippa said she understood the use of isolation booths in certain instances, but that it was not acceptable to use them as an ""ongoing punishment"". ""It's causing severe mental health problems. Schools should be held responsible."" Follow the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme onFacebook,externalandTwitter,external- and see more of our storieshere.

"Legal aid is the money provided by the government to cover legal costs for people who can't afford them. There have been considerable falls in spending on legal aid since 2010, as the chart above shows. The situations are somewhat different inEngland and Wales,external,Scotland,externalandNorthern Ireland,externalbut in general, to get legal aid you have to show that the situation is serious and you can't afford to pay yourself. As long as the proceedings you are involved in are taking place in the UK, whether you are actually in the UK yourself makes no difference to your eligibility. The first question is whether you are involved in a civil or criminal case. Criminal cases are generally those in which somebody has been arrested by police, and then a decision has been taken by the Crown Prosecution Service to take them to court. Anybody who has been arrested is entitled to legal advice at the police station, which is paid for by legal aid. If the case moves on to a court, any defendant under 18 or who is receiving certain benefits such as universal credit or income support, is automatically entitled to legal aid. Other people need to go through ameans test,external, which will take into account the applicant's income and savings as well as their household's - for example, whether they have a partner who is earning anything and whether they have children under 18. It will also depend on which court is hearing their case - less serious offences tend to be decided by a magistrates' court, while more serious ones go to the Crown Court. To qualify for legal aid there is also an Interests of Justice (IoJ) test, which depends on the seriousness of the crime involved. Cases going to Crown Court automatically pass the IoJ test. You're more likely to get legal aid if there is a chance you could lose your livelihood or liberty, if you lose the case. People with more than a certain level of income or savings may have to pay some or all of their legal costs. Civil cases involve other matters that could end up in a court or tribunal, such as family matters, debt or housing problems. To get legal aid for a civil caseyou have to demonstrate,externalthat the problem you are dealing with is serious - not all civil cases are eligible for legal aid - and that you can't afford to pay for it yourself. Again, the decision will be based on your income and savings and your household's. If you are under 18, it will also consider the income of your parents. Even if you do get legal aid, you may have to repay your legal costs if you win money or property from the case. Legal aid is not means-tested for cases involving a mental health tribunal, children in care or child abduction. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"The Prison Officers' Association said the 23-year-old officer was ""lucky to be alive"" A man has been charged after a prison officer had his throat cut at HMP Nottingham. Police were called at about 10:00 BST on Sunday after what union officials called an ""unprovoked attack"" by a prisoner with a razor blade. The Ministry of Justice said the officer needed 17 stitches. Michael McKenna, 25, has been charged with grievous bodily harm with intent, wounding with intent and a racially aggravated public order offence. He will appear at Nottingham Magistrates' Court later. Prison Officers' Association national chairman Mark Fairhurst said the prison officer was ""lucky to be alive as it [the wound] was very close to the main artery on his neck."" He said the 23-year-old had been a new member of staff. Latest news and stories from the East Midlands HMP Nottingham is a category B male prison which expanded in 2010 to hold 1,060 prisoners.

"A third of millennials could face living in private rented accommodation for the rest of their lives according toa report by the Resolution Foundation. For many, a lifetime of renting means living with the threat of arbitrary evictions, unaffordable rent rises and the whims of landlords. ""The law is so stacked against the tenant,"" says Dan Wilson Craw, from campaign group Generation Rent. Christina, 30, from London, says she felt forced to accept living in a badly-maintained flat for fear of being asked to leave if she pushed her landlord to fix things. ""The flat had a serious mouse problem and the bathroom ceiling was virtually black with mould,"" she says. She also had concerns about her security, explaining: ""He had the keys to my house with all my stuff in it. I started keeping important documents and valuables at work because I didn't trust him."" Dan Wilson Craw says the main problem is ""Section 21"" - a piece of law that allows landlords to evict tenants without a reason. ""It means that you have no idea whether you will be living in your home next year,"" he adds. In 2015, a law was introduced to make so-called revenge evictions- carried out after a tenant complains about something - illegal, but it only applies to rental agreements signed since then. Sam Gomyer feels life as a renter is ""very precarious"" After three years of living in London, part-time student Sam Gomyer is renting his fourth property - two were sold and a rent increase forced him out of the third. ""I felt like I was cursed,"" he told the BBC, with one landlord even pulling out of a deal a week before he was due to move in. ""The laws on that should be different,"" he says. ""I was suddenly in this situation where I thought I had a home but it wasn't legally bound so they can just turn me down last minute - it was very precarious."" Four way to fix the rental market Renting in retirement: How feasible is it? One man, who lives in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire but wished to remain anonymous, told the BBC rent rises every year mean his family struggles to make ends meet. ""Everywhere else we look they are expecting at least a thousand [in rent] so if we lose our current place we're really in trouble,"" he says. ""We can't help but feel restricted in a place that is meant to be our own home. ""It could be reclaimed at any moment at the whim of the landlord or agents."" Matt Winter, a postman from Stevenage, was forced to leave his home of four years when the landlord wanted to sell the property. With three young children - including one child with autism - finding suitable accommodation proved very difficult. The family has now settled into a new home but Matt says he still worries about the future. ""The last year has only opened our eyes to what can happen so easily,"" he adds. A 30-year-old woman, who also didn't want to be named, says her landlady frequently lets herself into her London flat without giving notice. She worries that complaining about this will mean her tenancy is not extended and does not believed the law protects renters such as herself. ""There are laws in some cases but unless you can afford hefty court fees they don't really serve much purpose,"" she says. ""When it boils down to it landlords can pretty much do what they want. We could be out of a home in less than five months, and there's not a thing we can do about it."" Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external Generation Rent, which campaigns for secure and affordable privately rented homes, is calling for the introduction of indefinite tenancies. ""As long as the renter is paying the rent the tenancy would continue - the assumption is that it is a home,"" explains Dan Wilson Craw. He says the majority of landlords behave responsibly, but warns: ""The law is so stacked against the tenant you can't make the assumption that your landlord is one of the good ones."" Chris Norris, director of policy and practice at the National Landlords Association, says: ""In the last few years we've had new laws to prevent so called revenge evictions, greater taxation of landlords, and tougher regulation of letting agents. ""However, the fact remains that the overwhelming majority of tenancies are ended by tenants, not landlords - and the majority of landlords don't simply hike rents or end tenancies without a good reason.""

"Alicia and her boyfriend complained about water damage in their home Alicia Powell, 24, was renting a flat in north London with her boyfriend when she noticed a wet patch on the ceiling. They complained to their property manager but nothing was done so they said they were going to report it to their local council. That's when they were served with asection 21 notice,external- which allows landlords in England and Wales to evict renters without a reason once their tenancy has come to an end. Housing campaign group Generation Rent wants section 21s to be scrapped. It claims it allows landlords to take ""revenge evictions"" against renters who complain about problems in their homes. Generation Rent says renters risk getting evicted if they complain about repairs Councils have the power to inspect private properties and if they find a serious hazard they can take enforcement action against a landlord - which legally protects the tenant from being evicted for six months. But Generation Rent claims thatmany local authorities don't have the resources to get out and inspect a property,externaland it's leaving renters vulnerable. Alicia says she complained to the council about her home and it carried out an inspection - but it said the problems weren't serious enough for it to intervene. ""It's quite a depressing situation, because a lot of us are faced with the prospect of at least a good few years of renting. There doesn't seem to be an end in sight. ""Rather than focusing on buying initiatives like Help To Buy, there needs to be more concentration on the renting situation and how best to support people who are vulnerable."" Lucy says her landlord would let herself into the house when no-one was there Last year the charity Citizens Advice found that tenants who complained about issues in their homewere statistically more likely to get evicted,external. Lucy Bates, 21, also had problems getting repairs done by her landlord after complaining of mould in her bedroom. ""The landlord said the mould was my fault and that I was going to have to clean it myself,"" she tells Newsbeat. ""She also said that if the mould damaged the paint, I'd have to pay for that."" Lucy's solicitor sent a letter to her landlord to try to get something done. But the landlord refused to fix the issue and instead asked the tenants to move out four months before the end of their lease agreement. ""At that point it had created such a strain on my mental health that I didn't care, I just wanted out of that house,"" Lucy said. A section 21 can be used once an assured shorthold tenancy comes to an end Dan Wilson Craw, director of Generation Rent, wants section 21s to be abolished so that tenants can feel secure when renting. ""Getting rid of section 21 would stop this sort of bullying and the practice of revenge evictions,"" he said. ""Another thing we want to see alongside that is limits on rent increases, because that's another tactic that landlords can use to intimidate tenants into not complaining. ""There are people who are putting up with really bad conditions because they are scared of an eviction notice or the rent going up."" The National Landlords Association says many local authorities lack the funds needed to help tenants. Chris Norris, director of policy and practice, said: ""We all want a private rented sector rid of the kind of rogue operators who would rather evict someone than make a repair. ""Local authorities are responsible for enforcing against these landlords, however they often don't have the funding in place to effectively do so."" He also says some landlords rely on section 21s because it's harder to get their properties back through a section 8 possession notice. A section 8 means the renter has broken the terms of their tenancy - for example not paying rent - and sometimes involves landlords spending money taking action in court if the tenants refuse to leave.

"The ICO is concerned that Facebook likes encourage children to over-share personal information Facebook and Instagram face limits on letting under-18s ""like"" posts on their platforms while Snapchat could be prevented from allowing the age group to build up ""streaks"", under new rules proposed by the UK's data watchdog. It believes the tools encourage users to share more personal data and spend more time on apps than desired. Likes help build up profiles of users' interests while streaks encourage them to send photos and videos daily. The proposal is part of a 16-rule code. Speaking to the BBC's World At One , the Information Commissioner's Office suggested that social media networks could avoid an outright ban on ""likes"" if they stopped collecting personal data when children engaged with them. Snapchat displays a fire icon to represent streaks - which represents the fact that two members have messaged each other for several days in a row To ensure its success, the ICO added that online services must also adopt ""robust"" age-verification systems. In addition to calling for restrictions on children being exposed to so-called ""nudge techniques"",the ICO advocates internet firms,externalmake the following changes among others for their younger members: make privacy settings ""high"" by default switch location-tracking off by default after each session and make it obvious when it had been activated give children choices over which elements of the service they want to activate and then collect and retain the minimum amount of personal data provide ""bite-sized"" explanations in clear language about how users' personal data is used make it clear if parental controls, such as activity-tracking, are being used The ICO suggests that firms that do not comply with the code could face fines of up to 20 million euros (Â£17.2m) or 4% of their worldwide turnover under the General Data Protection Regulation. ""The internet and all its wonders are hardwired into their everyday lives,"" commented Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham. ""We shouldn't have to prevent our children from being able to use it, but we must demand that they are protected when they do. This code does that."" Her office is now seeking feedback as part of a consultation that will run until 31 May. It is envisaged that the rules would come into effect next year. Social media: How can governments regulate it? UK plans social media and internet watchdog Australia targets tech firms with 'abhorrent material' laws The Internet Association UK - which represents Facebook, Snap and other tech firms - has already raised concerns. ""Any new guidelines must be technically possible to implement in practice, and not stifle innovation and opportunities for smaller platforms,"" said its executive director Daniel Dyball. ""We must be careful when designing regulation to ensure any technical challenges, particularly around age verification, are understood and taken into consideration."" Restrictions on Facebook's like button - which registers a user's interest in another user or advertiser's post - and Snapchat streaks - which count the number of consecutive days two members have messaged each other - are not the only nudge behaviours being targeted. The ICO also says that apps should not: show boxes where the Yes button is much bigger than that for No use language that presents a data-sharing option in a much more positive light than the alternative make it much more cumbersome to select the high-privacy option by, for example, requiring more clicks to turn it on The ICO says nudge techniques like those above encourage children to make poor privacy decisions These, it said, exploit ""human susceptibility to reward-seeking behaviours in order to keep users online"". However, the regulator said it was appropriate in some cases to use nudges that encourage children to opt for privacy-enhancing settings, or to take a break after using an online service for some time. The ICO's rules follow a proposal from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) for the creation of an independent tech watchdog that would write its own ""code of practice"" for online companies. The suggestions have already been welcomed by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC). ""Social networks have continually failed to prioritise child safety in their design, which has resulted in tragic consequences,"" commented the charity's Andy Burrows. ""This design code from the ICO is a really significant package of measures, but it must go hand in hand with the government following through on its commitment to enshrine in law a new duty of care on social networks and an independent regulator with powers to investigate and fine."" But the code has drawn criticism from the Adam Smith Institute think tank. ""The ICO is an unelected quango introducing draconian limitations on the internet with the threat of massive fines,"" said its head of research Matthew Lesh. ""It is ridiculous to infantilise people and treat everyone as children."" This new proposed code arrives a week after the sweeping new regulatory powers outlined in the government's Online Harms White Paper and with much less of a fanfare. But whereas the all-powerful regulator is unlikely to be in place for many months or even years, the Information Commissioner's Office expects to get its Children's Code of Practice into law this summer. That means that Facebook and Instagram - among others - will need to think rapidly about whether their platforms risk breaking the new rules. The ICO made clear this morning that its problem with ""likes"" and ""streaks"" is not the features themselves but how they are used to collect data and target children with advertising. So, if the platforms want to hold on to what they regard as useful elements of the social media experience, they'll have to show they work differently for children than for adults. The other key demand from the data watchdog is to make the default privacy settings for platforms suitable for everyone including children. That will mean adults having to opt in to the kind of data collection which is a key part of the business model of social media firms - so this code could pose a real threat to their bottom line.

"Multipacks of Guinness will now come in a cardboard box Drinks giant Diageo has announced that it is removing plastic from multipacks of its Irish stout brand Guinness. Plastic ring carriers and shrink wrap will be also removed from packs of Harp, Rockshore and Smithwick's beers, as part of Diageo's Â£16m initiative. The change will be phased in with multi-can packs sold in ""100% recyclable and biodegradable cardboard"" in Ireland from August this year. The new packaging will then be used in the UK and globally next year. Many companies have been committing to being more green after concerns about plastic waste were highlighted in shows such as the BBC's Blue Planet 2, narrated by Sir David Attenborough. Last year, rival brewer Carlsberg switched to using a glue instead of plastic to hold together its cans. And more recently, Nestle got rid of plastic straws from its products and is using paper ones instead. Last month Coca-Cola started releasing informationon how much plastic it used - three million tonnes of plastic packaging in one year. That was part of a report by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, which is pushing for companies and governments to do more to tackle plastic pollution. In total, 150 companies have pledged to reduce their plastic usage as part of the campaign. Diageo's bottling and packaging plant in Northern Ireland will be the first site producing the new packs, with the firm investing Â£8m in its east Belfast plant. It packages products which are exported around the world, including to the US, Canada, South Korea and Europe. Diageo says under 5% of its total packaging is plastic and the changes will reduce usage by over 400 tonnes annually. Oliver Loomes, country director of Diageo Ireland, said: ""Managing our environmental impact is important for the planet and the financial sustainability of our business. ""We already have one of the most sustainable breweries in the world at (Dublin's) St James's Gate and we are now leading the way in sustainable packaging. This is good news for the environment and for our brand."" Friends of the Earth plastic-free campaigner Emma Priestland welcomed Diageo's move, but added that new legislation was needed to ""end the scourge of plastic pollution that harms our environment and wildlife"". Greenpeace spokesperson Mirjam Kopp said: ""It's great the Diageo is looking at ways to move away from plastic packaging. ""[But] by replacing plastic packaging with cardboard sleeves and boxes, Diageo will increase its reliance on pulp and paper, increasing the pressure on forests and potentially leading to more deforestation that, in turn, accelerates climate change. The real solution is to end throwaway packaging across the board and embrace systems of refill and reuse."" Prime Minister Theresa May has pledged to ban all avoidable plastic waste in the UK by 2042.

"This video can not be played Mr Lidington said the talks would continue over the Easter break The government and Labour are ""testing out"" each other's ideas as they try to resolve the Brexit deadlock, cabinet minister David Lidington has said. He told the BBC they had a ""fair bit in common"" over future customs objectives but further compromise was needed. While there was no deadline, he said the sides would ""take stock"" in 10 days and the process could not drag out. But former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said the process was a ""recipe for disaster"" for his party. He called for Prime Minister Theresa May to make way for a new Conservative leader next month - but Mr Lidington insisted replacing the prime minister would ""not change the arithmetic in Parliament"". Talks between the government and Labour are set to continue over the Easter parliamentary recess in the hope of finding a Brexit agreement that will be acceptable to MPs. A series of working groups in key areas, such as environmental standards, security and workers' rights, have been set up to try and find common ground. Cross-party Brexit talks 'positive' Can the Tories and Labour agree on Brexit? Brexit: What happens next? Corbyn: Anti-Semitism evidence 'ignored' The EU has insisted the terms of the UK's withdrawal, rejected three times by MPs, cannot be renegotiated - but there is scope to strengthen the political declaration, a document setting out the parameters of the UK's future relations with the EU, ahead of the new Brexit deadline of 31 October. Mr Lidington, who is regarded as Mrs May's de facto deputy, said he had not set a deadline for the talks to produce a result but the public wanted Parliament to resolve their differences quickly. ""I don't think the question can be allowed to drag out for much longer,"" he said. Asked whether the government could drop its opposition to a customs union with the EU, as demanded by Labour, Mr Lidington said both sides had well-known ""public positions"". He suggested the two sides were considering whether there was a ""mechanism"" to deliver the benefits of a customs union, such as tariff and quota-free trade with the EU, while also enabling the UK to have an independent trade policy and input into EU agreements affecting the UK. ""What we have found in terms of objectivesâ¦ there is a fair bit that both parties would have in common,"" he said. ""If we are going to find an agreement there needs to be movement on both sides. ""I don't want to compromise what is at the moment a space where we are testing with the opposition, and they are testing with us, particular ways in which we could move forward."" This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. But Mr Duncan Smith warned against his party embracing Labour's Brexit policy, telling Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday that he had ""real concerns with some of my colleagues going out lauding Jeremy Corbyn"". ""We need to be very clear in the course of this that we don't end up letting Jeremy Corbyn dictate to us that we stay in a customs union, or we have some kind of second referendum, or stay aligned with the European single market - all of that given to us by Jeremy Corbyn is a recipe for disaster."" He said there was real grassroots anger at the prospect of the Conservatives having to fight European elections at the end of May and the prime minister should leave Downing Street this summer irrespective of whether the withdrawal agreement had been approved or not. ""She said she would go as and when the agreement was ratified, which was looking at around about May, June. I think those dates still stand,"" he said. But Labour's shadow transport Secretary Andy McDonald said the talks would ""count for nothing"" if the Conservatives changed leader and a hard Brexiteer took over from Mrs May. Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn has been warned Labour will ""haemorrhage"" votes in the EU election unless the party explicitly backs a further referendum. MEP Richard Corbett, leader of the party in the EU Parliament,told the Observer,externalLabour risked losing out to parties committed to a public vote. ""If Labour does not re-confirm its support for a confirmatory public vote on any Brexit deal in its manifesto, then it will haemorrhage votes to parties who do have a clear message,"" he said. ""If on the other hand we do offer clarity and a confirmatory ballot we could do very well."" Labour's current policy is to keep all options on the table - including pressing for a further EU referendum. Labour MP David Lammy told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that the current ""rows would continue"" unless the public had the final say on the issue. Several members of the shadow cabinet and many backbenchers, particularly in Leave-supporting areas, are opposed to the idea. What happens after Brexit? Can the Tories and Labour agree?

"The report calls for more funds to be generated locally through an overhaul of the property tax system A new system of property tax and environmental charges should be introduced to boost Scottish council funding, according to a report. The joint paper from Unison and the Jimmy Reid Foundation calls for a ""fundamental review"" of funding. It recommends moving towards a ""more progressive"" system which would shift the burden onto property and land owners rather than council taxpayers. The Scottish government said its own reforms would ""empower"" councils. Mike Kirby, Scottish secretary of Unison, said the balance of funding for local services had changed over the years. He said that approximately 50% of the funding used to come from national government, with 50% raised directly by local authorities. However, he said 85% of funding now came from central government and 15% was raised directly by local authorities. ""Together with an overall reduction in funding, during a period of austerity, this has resulted in severe financial pressures and impacted upon the quality and delivery of vital public services,"" he said. ""Politicians in all spheres must create the time and space for a fundamental review of funding local government. ""This report is a contribution to that essential debate."" Prof Mike Danson, lead author of the report, added: ""Within the constraints of the fiscal powers devolved under successive Scotland Acts, there are still some opportunities to generate greater funding for public services locally. ""Some changes will require time to explore, plan and introduce but it is economically efficient and effective to shift the tax burden onto property and land owners and away from council taxpayers, making the tax system more progressive and more based on ability to pay."" The joint paper recommends options to increase spending on council services, including the introduction of new levies. It also calls for the recruitment of staff to ensure revenues are collected. Other recommendations include looking for more effective support for private and social enterprises. The report says unions should consider how municipalisation of public services could be appropriately pursued, and how local authority debts could be taken over by the Treasury. It also says that an expansion of local public services is possible with a ""fairer system"" of property taxes and environmental charges. Councils could get the option to introduce a workplace parking levy Councils are to receive Â£11.2bn in 2019-20 through the local government finance settlement. This is a ""real-terms"" increase in both revenue - 1.2% - and capital funding - 21.5% - compared to the previous year. A total of 20 local authorities have chosen not to increase council tax by the full 4.79% permitted. A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""The package of local tax reform measures announced at the Budget will deliver the most significant empowerment of local authorities since devolution. ""We will, this year, formally consult on the principles of a locally determined tourist tax, in addition to supporting a Green amendment to the Transport Bill that would allow councils to choose whether they wished to introduce a workplace parking levy."" A Cosla spokesman said: ""Cosla has long said that the current model is not sustainable. We reiterated this point in our essential services campaign. ""Undoubtedly there is a funding issue for local government and we are happy to engage in any debate that gives us more funding and flexibility to deliver essential services for our communities."" The paper is being launched at the STUC's 122nd Annual Congress in Dundee.

"Doctors are raising concerns that changes to GP contracts will lead to a drop in immunisation rates among adults and children in rural areas. MMR and flu injections traditionally given at local doctors' surgeries are to become the responsibility of clinics set up by health boards. The move is designed to reduce the workload of GPs. But some doctors argue that in rural areas people might miss visits due to longer journeys to attend the clinics. NHS Highland said the Vaccine Transformation Programme was a national three-year programme and it was at the early stages of implementing the government policy in its area. The health board added that it would be making sure it did not do anything that increased risks to the population. Rural GP concerns over new contract Dr Philip Wilson, a GP and professor of rural health care, is opposed to the change. He said the new clinics would be shared by different practices and there was a potential risk of some patients missing a clinic visit. Dr Philip Wilson, a GP and professor of rural health care, is opposed to the change ""There is a particular issue about remote communities getting occasional visits,"" he said. ""There are no powers for GPs picking up people opportunistically and increasing immunisation rates. ""There will be an immunisation clinic shared between several different practices, and the consequence of that is that even when patients want to have their immunisation and are able to turn up for the appointments they might have to travel huge distances to get there. ""That, in turn, is going to remove the incentive or make it more difficult for people to actually get immunisations."" Dr Wilson added: ""It makes sense to carry on paying GPs to provide immunisations in rural areas."" Laura Hamlet says longer distances could make it harder to attend clinic appointments Adam Strachura, of Age Scotland, said if the aim of the new set up was get more people inoculated then ""that was a good thing"". But he added that for many older people their GP was key to their overall health and wellbeing. He said: ""Their regular GP is an important part of their health care needs. A GP will be able to look at all their medical issues, as well as administrating injections like the flu vaccination."" Laura Hamlet and her family live in Achiltibuie in Wester Ross. The community, 80 miles (129km) north west of Inverness, is 24 miles (38km) from the nearest village, Ullapool. She said: ""My youngest son is a winter baby, he was born in November, and winter babies tend to pick up lots of coughs and colds, so we had three goes at getting his immunisations."" Rural GPs should continue to be paid to immunise children and adults, says Dr Wilson The mother-of-two said that having to travel longer distances to reach a clinic would be more expensive. She said: ""You could end up having to put it off and in the meantime your child isn't immunised."" NHS Highland said it was not yet clear what changes, if any, would be proposed in rural areas of the Highlands. A spokesman said: ""Some areas in Scotland are further ahead with the changes such as Tayside and Lanarkshire and we are learning the lessons from that work. ""Any changes made in NHS Highland will be piloted first on a small scale before being rolled out. ""Childhood vaccine uptake in Highland, including for Measles Mumps and Rubella (MMR) is over 95%, and the population is well protected. Measles is a very rare infection in Scotland."" He added: ""We work and will continue to work with Highland GPs and the Highland Local Medical Committee to explore how best to deliver vaccinations.""

"The Trussell Trust said there had been a 17% increase in demand for emergency food supplies Food banks in Scotland gave out a record number of food parcels last year, according to new figures. More than 170,000 three-day emergency food supplies were distributed by The Trussell Trust's 52 food banks. The charity said it saw a 17% increase in demand north of the border in 2017/18, compared to the previous year. And it claimed a growing proportion of people referred to Scottish food banks have found that their benefits do not cover the cost of essentials. However, the UK government said it was wrong to link a rise in food bank use to any one cause as the reasons why people use them are complex. Last year The Trussell Trust reported that it had providedmore than 145,000 packages to people in crisis in 2016/17. The key findings of its latest report were: 170,625 food parcels were distributed in Scotland in 2017/18 - 17% more than in the previous year 55,038 parcels went to children 28% of referrals were on a low income, receiving benefits (up from 22% in 2016/17) Debt accounted for 8% of referrals, up from 7% last year Benefits delays (22%) and benefit changes (18%) accounted for a large number of referrals Detailed analysis of a smaller proportion of referrals also revealed that the number of people turning to food banks after receiving a benefits sanction had fallen. The charity estimated it helped approximately 666,476 people last year, as on average people attended their food banks twice. It said the proportion of low income households seeking help from its food banks had increased significantly since April 2016. And it suggested there was an ""urgent need"" to look at the adequacy of current benefit levels. Audrey Flannigan manages one of The Trussell Trust's food banks in Glasgow. She said people whose benefits did not stretch to buying essentials were using the service. ""They need to be able to buy things like soap, toothpaste, put money in the meter, they need to be able to buy the kids new shoes or clothes when they need them,"" she said. ""One of the biggest things has been the change on to Universal Credit,"" she added. ""I'm in no way a benefits adviser or know everything about it, but I do know that asking someone to wait between five and seven weeks before you get your first lot of money surely has to be seen as immoral and inhumane."" This video can not be played 'It's embarrassing, but you can't live on fresh air' - The experience of using a food bank Tony Graham, the director of Scotland at The Trussell Trust, said no-one in Scotland should be left hungry or destitute. ""Food banks are providing absolutely vital, compassionate support in communities across our country, but no charity can replace the dignity of having long-term financial security,"" he added. ""It's completely unacceptable that anyone is forced to turn to a food bank in Scotland, and we'll continue to campaign for systemic change until everyone has enough money coming in to keep pace with the rising cost of essentials like food and housing. ""Universal Credit is the future of our benefits system. It's vital we get it right and ensure levels of payment protect everyone needing its support, particularly groups of people we know are already more likely to need a food bank - disabled people, people dealing with an illness, families with children and single parents. ""This, along with aGood Food Nation Bill,externalthat addresses hunger and destitution, can ensure Scotland leads the way in ending the need for food banks."" A spokeswoman for the Department of Work and Pensions said it was wrong to link increased food bank use to any one cause. She said: ""This research is based on anecdotal evidence from a small, self-selecting sample of less than 0.04% of current Universal Credit claimants, whereas Universal Credit is working for the vast majority who claim it. ""It was also carried out before our significant improvements to Universal Credit came into effect at the Budget; such as 100% advances, which support people before their first payment, removing the seven waiting days and two weeks' extra housing support for claimants moving onto Universal Credit. ""Since 2010, one million people have been lifted out of absolute poverty and employment is at a record high with over 3.2 million more people in work - equating to an extra 1,000 people employed a day, every day. ""Meanwhile we continue to spend Â£90bn a year on welfare to support those who need it most. The best way to help people improve their lives is through employment, with people on Universal Credit moving into work faster and staying in work longer.""

"TSB has become the first UK bank to pledge to refund customers who fall victim to any type of fraud. The ""fraud refund guarantee"" will cover cases where customers are tricked into authorising payments to fraudsters, as well as unauthorised transactions. The move comes as the bank tries to rebuild its imageafter an IT meltdown last Aprilleft 1.9 million customers unable to access their own money. Banks have been under pressure to help tackle the rise in sophisticated fraud. Richard Meddings, acting chief executive of TSB, told Radio 5 live's Wake Up To Money that the move was ""about giving peace of mind to our customers and doing the right thing"". He said: ""It's a major societal blight. Innocent customers are being tricked."" He added that the bank was investing in education for customers and staff about fraud, but also had a message for crooks: ""If you come for one of my customers, we will hunt you down."" Currently, victims who are tricked into transferring money directly from their account to a fraudster are less likely to be reimbursed, because they approved the payments. Some Â£354m was lost last year through this type of scam, known as a ""push"" or ""authorised"" payment fraud, according to banking trade body UK Finance. Financial firms returned just Â£83m of this to customers. Examples of authorised payment fraud include fraudsters posing as builders, solicitors, or other contractors who have carried out work for the victim. They submit a fake invoice containing the fraudster's bank details and it is often not easy to spot that they are not the legitimate payee. TSB suffers Â£105m loss after computer chaos Scam victims more likely to be reimbursed Investment scam targets Instagram users ""The vast majority of fraud claims across UK banking are from innocent victims of fraud who have been targeted by criminals and organised gangs. ""However, all too often these customers must fight to be refunded and are not treated as victims of crime,"" said TSB executive chairman Richard Meddings. TSB said its guarantee - which applies to losses from 14 April - marked a ""step change"" in the industry, where currently customers were only refunded for fraud losses in limited circumstances. Under the guarantee, customers will need to contact the bank to report fraud and it will still investigate the fraud claim, including what happened and how, so it can inform customers and ensure they are protected from future fraud. The bank, which has 5.2 million customers, warned it would not reimburse customers who tried to abuse the guarantee by committing fraud on their own account or by repeatedly ignoring safety advice. Last month, banks and building societies agreed to do more to protect customers,introducing a new voluntary codewhich comes into effect on 28 May. But consumer watchdog Which? said banks needed to do more. ""Other High Street banks are leaving their customers unprotected. All banks must now follow TSB's lead and ensure that their own customers are not left paying for the cost of this crime,"" said Jenny Ross, Which? money editor.

"Demonstrators in Khartoum have vowed to continue their sit-in until a civilian government is in place Sudan's transitional military council has arrested members of the former government and promised not to disperse protesters. A spokesman also urged the opposition to pick the next prime minister and vowed to implement their choice. Months of protests in Sudan led to the ousting and arrest of long-time leader Omar al-Bashir on Thursday. Demonstrators have vowed to stay on the streets until there is an immediate move to civilian rule. A sit-in is continuing outside the defence ministry in the capital Khartoum. In a press conference on Sunday, spokesman Maj Gen Shams Ad-din Shanto said the military council was ""ready to implement"" whatever civilian government the opposition parties agreed. ""We won't appoint a PM. They'll choose one,"" he said, referring to opposition and protest groups. Sudan unrest: The key questions How Sudan's strongmen stayed in power Are military takeovers on the rise in Africa? He also said the army would not remove protesters from their sit-in by force, but called on protesters ""to let normal life resume"" and stop unauthorised roadblocks. ""Taking up arms will not be tolerated,"" he added. The military council also announced a raft of decisions, including: New heads of the army and the police A new head of the powerful National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) Committees to fight corruption, and to investigate the former ruling party The lifting of all media restrictions and censorship The release of police and security officers detained for supporting protesters A review of diplomatic missions, and the dismissal of Sudan's ambassadors to the US and to the UN in Geneva After months of protests, long-serving leader Omar al-Bashir was ousted and detained by the military Protests against a rise in the cost of living began in December but soon developed into a wider call for the removal of Mr Bashir and his government. On Thursdaythe military removed and detained the veteran leaderafter nearly 30 years in power. The coup leader, Defence Minister Awad Ibn Auf, announced the military would oversee a two-year transitional period followed by elections and imposed a three-month state of emergency. Sudan military coup topples Bashir Bashir ousted: How Sudan got here But demonstrators vowed to stay in the streets regardless, demanding an immediate switch to civilian government. Mr Ibn Auf himself stood down the next day, as did the feared security chief Gen Salah Gosh. Lt Gen Abdel Fattah Abdelrahman Burhan was then named as head of the transitional military council, to become Sudan's third leader in as many days. Lt Gen Abdel Fattah Abdelrahman Burhan became head of the transitional military council after the coup leader stepped aside In a televised address on Saturday, Gen Burhan vowed to ""uproot the regime"", pledging to respect human rights, end a night curfew, release political prisoners immediately, dissolve all provincial governments, try those who had killed demonstrators and tackle corruption. But the Sudan Professionals Association (SPA), which has been spearheading the demonstrations, said the council's response ""did not achieve any of the demands of the people"" and urged protests to continue. Among its demands are the restructuring of state security, the arrest of ""corrupt leaders"" and the dissolution of militias that operated under former President Bashir. The whereabouts of Sudan's former leader is currently unknown, but the coup leaders said he was in a secure place. Mr Bashir has been indicted on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur by the International Criminal Court. But the military council has said it will not extradite him, although he could well be put on trial in Sudan. Mr Bashir's National Congress Party on Saturday called his overthrow unconstitutional, and demanded that the military council release the party's imprisoned members. Maj-Gen Shanto said that the former ruling party would have no part in the civilian transitional government but could field candidates in the next elections. Are you protesting?

"Delayed discharges take up much needed hospital beds More than 200 people died in Northern Ireland's hospitals in 2018 while waiting to be discharged. A report bythe charity Marie Curie,externalalso showed delayed discharges resulted in patients spending thousands of extra days in hospital. This was despite the patients being declared ready to go home. The Health and Social Care Board said ensuring all patients were able to either return home or to a community setting was a key priority. Some of the patients had a terminal illness, such as cancer or a respiratory condition. Others may have been approaching the natural end of their lives. In Northern Ireland in 2018 204Total deaths 56Northern Trust 52Belfast Trust 48Southern Trust 34South Eastern Trust 14Western Trust Instead of being cared for at home or in the community, the report says 204 people were stuck in hospital and eventually died there. Freedom of Information requests were sent to all of the five local health trusts. While there is no breakdown of types of illness and patient, the data may also include those who at the last minute decided not to go home. Head of policy and public affairs for Marie Curie Northern Ireland, Joan McEwan, expressed disappointment at the findings. ""The local population is getting older and we are seeing more and more people living with terminal illnesses and complex needs,"" she said. ""Not only is this resulting in greater numbers of hospital admissions, it is also putting massive additional pressure on community care, which is vital in helping the safe and prompt discharge of patients back home."" This video can not be played 'Delays unacceptable for terminally ill' Delayed discharges clog up the system and take up much-needed hospital beds. The report, Every Minute Matters, highlighted that more than 46,000 bed days were lost across the system. This dramatically impacts on the day-to-day running of a hospital. On a more personal note, delayed hospital discharge has a significant impact on terminally ill people, causing distress and frustration, affecting their quality of life and preventing men and women from spending as much time as possible in their own home or community, surrounded by family. The statistics should not come as a surprise. An older population means more people are being admitted to hospital with multiple chronic illnesses. Not enough health care workers or home care packages means people cannot leave hospital. Louise Marshall said it was important for the family that her mother was able to die at home Louise Marshall's mother, Maureen Patrick, died from cancer in February 2018. The 59-year-old was cared for at home during her final days. Ms Marshall said it was very important for the whole family that her mother was able to die at home. ""She always said before she went into hospital that she wanted to make sure she was home, to have her family around her in her last days,"" she said. The County Down woman said it also enabled them to say goodbye in familiar surroundings. ""It definitely is a help - we know we fulfilled my mum's last wishes, she died not afraid and we all got to kiss her and say goodbye,"" she said. Joan McEwan saidthe lack of an assembly and executivehad ""stymied"" HSC transformation. According to Marie Curie, both the departments of health and finance should work with stakeholders to scope out potential funding measures for adult social care including long-term strategic funding for health trusts. Population growth in Northern Ireland has not been matched by increased funding, especially around social care. Between 2007 and 2017, the number of local people older than 65 grew by more than 25%, while the number of those older than 85 grew by more than 30%. In a statement on behalf of the health and social care system, a spokesperson said: ""Growing numbers of people are living longer with complex needs and this is why the reform of adult care and support project has been tasked with identifying and implementing necessary reforms to enhance the support available in communities. ""There is also a very strong commitment to ensuring that any patient in the end stages of life is treated with absolute care and compassion. ""Trusts do their utmost to support and prioritise the wishes of patients at the end of life and their families, including facilitating their return to a home or a community setting where it is appropriate to do so. ""The Palliative Care in Partnership initiative in Northern Ireland brings together statutory and community and voluntary sector providers, including Mare Curie, and also service users and carers to improve how patients with palliative care needs are identified and supported, and also seeks to enhance the range of services available.""

"More than 200 pupils spent at least five straight days in isolation booths in schools in England last year A girl who tried to kill herself after spending months in an isolation booth at school has said she felt ""alone, trapped and no-one seemed to care"". The teenager, who has autism, had no direct teaching and ate her lunch in the room, away from friends. Her mother said for months she was unaware of what was happening to her daughter and called on the government to improve guidance for schools. The Department for Education says pupil welfare must always be put first. Its guidelines say children should be in isolation for no longer than is necessary. In a letter to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme, the teenager - who we are calling ""Sophie"" - said: ""I decided I'd rather die than be in isolation because of the mood it left me in. ""I felt alone and trapped at school for such a long time that I felt as though it would be best, as no-one seemed to care anyway."" Her mother, ""Philippa"", estimates that her daughter was placed in an isolation booth at her secondary school more than 240 times in total - beginning in year seven but becoming more frequent in years 10 and 11. The 16-year-old spent every school day from mid-January to March this year in the room, the family say. She explained: ""The room has six booths with a small workspace and sides so you cannot see other people. ""You have to sit in silence and be escorted to the toilet which is embarrassing."" Example of isolation booths used in hundreds of schools in England On one occasion, Sophie said: ""I begged the teachers to ring my Mum as I didn't want to be alone any more. ""They refused and took my phone away, leaving me and a teacher I didn't know in an enclosed room."" After she tried to take her own life, Sophie returned to school but said she would ""dread each day"" when she was again placed in isolation. ""I would often have panic attacks and feel claustrophobic,"" she explained. ""I feel as though isolation rooms should be banned. ""They tend to make students feel isolated and helpless, knocking their self-esteem. ""Due to the amount of stress and trauma throughout school I now suffer with depression and anxiety."" This video can not be played 'Sophie' - voiced by an actor - says ""no-one seemed to care"" about her isolation According to a BBC investigation last year,more than 200 pupils spent at least five straight days in isolation boothsin schools in England last year. And more than 5,000 children with special educational needs also attended isolation rooms at some stage. Government guidance in England says schools are free to decide how long pupils should be kept in isolation, but they should be there ""no longer than is necessary"". The guidelines also say that in order for isolation to be lawful as a punishment it should be ""reasonable"" in all circumstances, and factors such as special educational needs should be taken into account. Schools do not need to record use or report to parents that their child has been sent to isolation, although many do. The school behaviour expert, Tom Bennett, who has advised the government, has said isolation rooms can be effective in tackling disruption in classrooms, and preventing fixed-term exclusions. ""When you're a lone adult with a class of 25 pupils, it only take two people to really persistently wilfully misbehave for that lesson to be completely detonated,"" he told the BBC in November. The family say they understand the need for isolation booths for short spells of time Philippa told the Victoria Derbyshire programme Sophie was now a ""completely different child"". Sophie has selective mutism - she did not speak until the age of eight - as well as autism, and can be ""defiant"" and ""disobedient"", her mother said - but this was ""all part of her diagnosis"". She added that Sophie - who ""does not deal with change very well"" as part of her condition - was ""regularly"" placed in isolation after she reacted badly to a change in teachers, classroom and routine. She said as a result her communication had regressed. ""Being isolated from her friends... made her become more internal - stop talking, stop communicating."" Philippa added that the school had also been aware of her daughter's plans to self-harm before she tried to take her own life, through a letter the teenager had written to them. But the school did not make her aware of the letter at the time, she said. When she discovered that Sophie had been in isolation booths - by now in year 11 at school - she said she felt ""traumatised"". ""I can't even begin to explain how it makes you feel knowing every day I'd send her into the school and she felt that alone that she wanted to take her own life."" The family's solicitor, Simpson Millar, have written to the government demanding action and improvements to isolation guidelines. Philippa said she understood the use of isolation booths in certain instances, but that it was not acceptable to use them as an ""ongoing punishment"". ""It's causing severe mental health problems. Schools should be held responsible."" Follow the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme onFacebook,externalandTwitter,external- and see more of our storieshere.

"Demonstrators in Khartoum have vowed to continue their sit-in until a civilian government is in place Sudan's transitional military council has arrested members of the former government and promised not to disperse protesters. A spokesman also urged the opposition to pick the next prime minister and vowed to implement their choice. Months of protests in Sudan led to the ousting and arrest of long-time leader Omar al-Bashir on Thursday. Demonstrators have vowed to stay on the streets until there is an immediate move to civilian rule. A sit-in is continuing outside the defence ministry in the capital Khartoum. In a press conference on Sunday, spokesman Maj Gen Shams Ad-din Shanto said the military council was ""ready to implement"" whatever civilian government the opposition parties agreed. ""We won't appoint a PM. They'll choose one,"" he said, referring to opposition and protest groups. Sudan unrest: The key questions How Sudan's strongmen stayed in power Are military takeovers on the rise in Africa? He also said the army would not remove protesters from their sit-in by force, but called on protesters ""to let normal life resume"" and stop unauthorised roadblocks. ""Taking up arms will not be tolerated,"" he added. The military council also announced a raft of decisions, including: New heads of the army and the police A new head of the powerful National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) Committees to fight corruption, and to investigate the former ruling party The lifting of all media restrictions and censorship The release of police and security officers detained for supporting protesters A review of diplomatic missions, and the dismissal of Sudan's ambassadors to the US and to the UN in Geneva After months of protests, long-serving leader Omar al-Bashir was ousted and detained by the military Protests against a rise in the cost of living began in December but soon developed into a wider call for the removal of Mr Bashir and his government. On Thursdaythe military removed and detained the veteran leaderafter nearly 30 years in power. The coup leader, Defence Minister Awad Ibn Auf, announced the military would oversee a two-year transitional period followed by elections and imposed a three-month state of emergency. Sudan military coup topples Bashir Bashir ousted: How Sudan got here But demonstrators vowed to stay in the streets regardless, demanding an immediate switch to civilian government. Mr Ibn Auf himself stood down the next day, as did the feared security chief Gen Salah Gosh. Lt Gen Abdel Fattah Abdelrahman Burhan was then named as head of the transitional military council, to become Sudan's third leader in as many days. Lt Gen Abdel Fattah Abdelrahman Burhan became head of the transitional military council after the coup leader stepped aside In a televised address on Saturday, Gen Burhan vowed to ""uproot the regime"", pledging to respect human rights, end a night curfew, release political prisoners immediately, dissolve all provincial governments, try those who had killed demonstrators and tackle corruption. But the Sudan Professionals Association (SPA), which has been spearheading the demonstrations, said the council's response ""did not achieve any of the demands of the people"" and urged protests to continue. Among its demands are the restructuring of state security, the arrest of ""corrupt leaders"" and the dissolution of militias that operated under former President Bashir. The whereabouts of Sudan's former leader is currently unknown, but the coup leaders said he was in a secure place. Mr Bashir has been indicted on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur by the International Criminal Court. But the military council has said it will not extradite him, although he could well be put on trial in Sudan. Mr Bashir's National Congress Party on Saturday called his overthrow unconstitutional, and demanded that the military council release the party's imprisoned members. Maj-Gen Shanto said that the former ruling party would have no part in the civilian transitional government but could field candidates in the next elections. Are you protesting?

"Jodie Chesney, 17, was stabbed to death in a park in east London in March A murder detective believes he has found a way of forecasting where deadly knife attacks are likely to take place. Det Ch Insp John Massey trawled through records of knife crimes in London over a 12-month period and found a link with fatal stabbings the following year. More than two-thirds of the killings in 2017-18 occurred in neighbourhoods where someone had been attacked with a knife the year before. The study is believed to be one of the first to show such a clear correlation. In one area, around Tanfield Avenue in Neasden, there were eight knife attacks in the 12 months to the end of March 2017 -followed by the fatal stabbing in October of that year of 18-year-old Saif Abdul Magid. Two boys, aged 14, were found guilty of his murder, which police said was the result of a simmering dispute. The research, carried out alongside University of Cambridge criminologists, found that during 2016-17 the Metropolitan Police recorded 3,506 assaults with a knife where the location of the attack had been identified. The stabbings took place in 2,048 of London's 4,835 local census areas - neighbourhoods with a population of about 1,700, which are smaller than council wards. Saif Abdul Magid was stabbed repeatedly in a Neasden street The areas of the stabbings were then compared to the known locations of 97 fatal knife attacks in 2017-18. Results showed 67 of the killings - 69% - occurred where there had been at least one stabbing the previous year. Mr Massey said: ""These findings indicate that officers can be deployed in a smaller number of areas in the knowledge that they will have the best chances there to prevent knife-enabled homicides."" Prof Lawrence Sherman, who co-authored the study, said although solely focusing on knife crime hot-spots was not a ""panacea"" because many killings happened in areas untouched by stabbings, targeting resources made sense. ""If assault data forecasts that a neighbourhood is more likely to experience knife homicide, police commanders might consider everything from closer monitoring of school exclusions to localised use of stop-and-search,"" he said. Knife injuries in 2016-17 by council ward But Prof Sherman warned forces needed to improve their data collection processes to distinguish between arrests for carrying or making threats with knives and stabbings. ""The current definition of knife crime is too broad to be useful,"" he said. ""Police IT is in urgent need of refinement - instead of just keeping case records for legal uses, the systems should be designed to detect crime patterns for prioritising targets. ""We need to transform IT from electronic filing cabinets into a daily crime forecasting tool."" The map displays fatal stabbings during 2017-18 The study, published in the Cambridge Journal of Evidence-Based Policing, also found 21% of the 590 fatal stabbings in London over a 10-year period were flagged by police as involving gangs. The researchers said the figures ""contradict a widespread view that knife-enabled homicides are primarily gang-related"", though in 2017-18 the proportion rose to 29%. In response, Cdr David Musker said the Met was ""always open to reviewing and utilising emerging academic research"" and that it supported the Met's own current research. He added: ""Any research that can help inform both the short and long-term response to violence is very welcome. ""We already conduct high-visibility patrols within high-demand areas and hotspots and proactively police high-risk suspects and known offenders as part of our daily policing plans; we also use predictive analytics and mapping to target our patrols and make best use of our resource, prioritising the greatest areas of threat, risk and harm. ""This is something that the Met, and colleagues across the country, have been developing and utilising to great effect for a number of years."" How London's deadliest year in a decade began Can Chicago cure London's violence? London knife crime: What can Sadiq Khan learn from Glasgow Home Secretary Sajid Javid is due to outline his plans for tackling violent crime in a speech on Monday morning. Mr Javid is expected to say the ""mindset"" of government ""needs to shift"" to combat the issue - and argue for the use of data to improve our understanding of the pathways into and causes of crime. Re-emphasising his support for a ""public health"" approach, the home secretary will also say violent offending should be treated like the ""outbreak of some virulent disease"".

"The right to food is currently enshrined in international human rights law The human right to food should be put into Scots Law to protect people from rising insecurity, a report to the Scottish government suggests. The Scottish Human Rights Commission believes the move ""would help tackle health inequalities"". Its report was compiled forthe Scottish government's consultation on making Scotland a ""good food nation"". The government said it was committed to protecting internationally-recognised human rights. The right to food is currently enshrined in international legislation. The commission said this right - which involves food being accessible, adequate and available for everyone - is not being realised across Scotland. Food insecurity is ""unacceptably high"", the report said, with more than 480,500 food parcels being handed out by food banks between April 2017 and September 2018. It continues: ""Health inequalities are persistent with many people, including children, unable to afford or access a healthy and nutritious diet."" Before making its submission, the commission spoke to people experiencing food poverty in Scotland, including a mother who lives with her one-year-old son in a rural area. She said: ""My universal credit was delayed and I had 85p left in my bank account. ""I had run out of nappies and wipes and was worried I would have no money for milk or food for my son if it did not come through. ""I had a food parcel delivered recently and I think I'll need another this week. ""To reach a low-cost supermarket is a three-mile walk, making it a six-mile round trip on foot with my baby in a buggy. ""To get the bus would cost me Â£5, which would take a significant chunk out of my weekly food budget."" Commission chairwoman Judith Robertson said: ""International law is clear that governments have obligations to take action to ensure people's right to food is realised. ""The Scottish Human Rights Commission is calling on the government to take action to incorporate the right to food into Scotland's laws as part of its work to make Scotland a good food nation. ""We want to see the Scottish government showing human rights leadership in a practical way."" The consultation document states that the option of exploring a right to food which is directly enforceable under Scots law ""has not been ruled out"". But it suggests any proposals sit within wider human rights responsibilities. The Scottish government said a national taskforce was being established to take forward the group's recommendations. A spokesman added: ""We have also increased our Fair Food Fund to Â£3.5m this year to continue supporting organisations that help to tackle the causes of food insecurity.""

"Saif Abdul Magid died was stabbed repeatedly in a Neasden street Two 14-year-old boys have been given life sentences for stabbing another teenager to death. Saif Abdul Magid, 18, was knifed multiple times in the attack on Tanfield Avenue, Neasden, north-west London, on 6 October 2017. The boys, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, were bothfound guilty of murder at the Old Bailey. One boy will have to serve a minimum term of 14 years, the other will have to serve 14-and-a-half years. The jury failed to return a verdict on another boy, 15. Mr Abdul's murder was the culmination of a simmering dispute that had begun the previous day, police said. On 5 October, Mr Abdul had become involved in a fight in Neasden Lane, NW2 which had left him with a facial injury. The following day he returned to the scene and was viciously attacked before collapsing to the ground, the Met said. One injury to his neck proved fatal, police said.. Det Insp Justin Howick said: ""The level of violence directed at Saif on that fateful day was shocking. ""When the defendants, who had chosen to arm themselves with knives, made the decision to attack him as a mob he stood no chance. ""This is another sorry example of the tragic outcomes that can occur when individuals arm themselves on the streets. ""Two young men will now spend a significant amount of time behind bars as a result of their actions, while Saif's family will be left to mourn his needless death.""

"Taofeek Lamidi and Kyall Parnell (left and centre) were fatally stabbed on 31 December; Steve Narvaez Jara died on New Year's Day 2018 In the hours either side of midnight on New Year's Eve 2017, four people were stabbed to death across London. The year that followed would become the city's deadliest in a decade. Long before fireworks illuminated London's skyline, 18-year-old Meschak dos Santos Cornelio answered the buzzer to his Enfield flat on New Year's Eve morning. He knew who it was - Gaille Bola, a man viewed by the Metropolitan Police as one of the most dangerous and active gang members in the capital. Congolese kingpin Gaille Bola, 22, faces life in prison ahead of his sentencing on 11 January Going by the street name ""G"", Bola had been running fourcounty lines drug operationsacross Hertfordshire. He had groomed Meschak into the notorious Get Money Gang (GMG). Meschak took charge of one of the phones the gang used while Bola was in prison for a knife offence. But, after his release, Bola wanted the ""drugs line"" back. This video can not be played What is County Lines? When Meschak refused, Bola - with two cronies - went to the teenager's flat demanding he return the Nokia phone. An attack ensued, ending with Bola plunging a knife into Meschak's heart. After ambushing Meschak, the trio left him for dead and the teenager was airlifted to the Royal London Hospital, Whitechapel, where he would spend the final hours of 2017 fighting for his life. Doctors turned off Meschak's life support system and he died at 20:28 GMT. Bola was found guilty in November of manslaughter. Meschak was fatally stabbed inside a flat on Larmans Road, Enfield Following the conviction, Det Sgt Brett Hagen said Bola had been known to police for many years. ""Bola is high up on the gangs matrix, of the 3,500 people on it he's in the top 10,"" he said. ""He openly bragged in court about making Â£1,000 a day from his county lines. ""He went to the property that morning intending to steal a drugs line phone from Meschak and knowing he would use violence in order to steal it. As a result of his actions another young man is dead."" About an hour before Meschak died, another young man named Taofeek Lamidi was found stabbed near a park close to West Ham Tube station in east London. He was pronounced dead at the scene at 20:22. The crime scene in West Ham near to where Taofeek Lamidi was stabbed to death Described by many as a talented footballer, Mr Lamidi had trials with Chelsea and Colchester United. The 20-year-old had fallen on hard times following the death of both his parents and his brother being deported back to Nigeria. ""Taofeek was a good kid,"" said his former coach Patrick Ganlath. ""He wasn't bad. What he was, was poor."" On the day Mr Lamidi would have celebrated his 21st birthday the prime suspect in the murder case, Ahmed Mohamed, boarded a flight at Heathrow and went on the run. Ahmed Mohamed, 21, flew from Heathrow on 2 January to Nairobi via Amsterdam ""By the time we had taken the case on, Ahmed Mohamed had fled the country,"" said Det Ch Insp Mark Cranwell. ""We strongly believe he is now in Somalia. This wasn't a gang motivated murder at all, but the two knew each other and there was some beef around snitching."" Hours after Mr Lamidi's murder, a third person was fatally stabbed - this time in south London. Det Insp Ian Titterrell told an inquest hearing that a knife was later found on Croydon teenager Kyall Parnell Sitting on the top deck of a Route 68 bus in Tulse Hill, Kyall Parnell, 17, and his friends were confronted by another group of youths who got on the bus at about 22:40. With his hand placed towards his left hip area, Kyall is said to have been ""acting aggressively"" towards one teenager, according to Det Insp Ian Titterrell. ""There was a suggestion of something glinting,"" he said. ""The three males who had just got on the bus, got off it. They were pursued by Kyall and his friends. Witnesses had seen the chasing group in possession of knives."" Two of the fleeing boys hid in a nearby shop. The other was cornered by Kyall's friends who urged the teenager to ""stab him"" and to ""finish him off"". Fearing for his life, the boy, who was later arrested on suspicion of murder, took a knife from his bag and stabbed Kyall in the chest. The 16-year-old suspect was however not charged with a homicide offence after the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and Met Police agreed there was a ""real issue"" of self-defence. But, the night of heightened violence was not over. Fresh into New Year's Day, London recorded its first official murder victim of 2018. Steve Narvaez Jara had been at a flat party in Islington when he was stabbed. The 20-year-old, who studied physics and aerospace at the University of Hertfordshire, died at 03:26. Police stand at Bartholomew Court, Old Street, where Steve Narvaez Jara was fatally stabbed Four men were arrested as part of the murder investigation. But beyond that, details of Mr Narvaez's life and death are sketchy. There are yet to be any charges. However one of the suspects, Israel Ogunsola, was later murdered on 4 April in east London. Targeted by teenager Jonathan Abora, 18-year-old Ogunsola was ""hunted"" andstabbed six times during a sustained attack in Hackney. Police believe Israel Ogunsola and Jonathan Abora knew each other and had been ""embroiled in a dispute"" In the days and months between the murders of Mr Narvaez and Mr Ogunsola, more isolated spates of shootings, stabbings and assaults saw a further 50 people killed in London. The short space of time between the killings led toLondon gaining ominous comparisons to New York's murder rate. As 2018 wore on, however, this proved to be a blip. Nevertheless, for the second consecutive year, London's homicide rate climbed to a level which rattled communities and saw headlines of murders become numbingly routine. Debate among politicians and senior police officers about how to prevent violence was reignited; while a spotlight was shone on the influence of social media and drill music videos throughout much of 2018. Arguments over the effectiveness of stop-and-search resurfaced, tougher sentencing laws were proposed and Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dickrepeatedly expressed how stretched her officers were. This video can not be played Drill: The UK's sound of violence? However, detecting any trends or patterns behind the 2018 homicides is as arduous as it is to solve. The killings were not clustered in certain areas - instead they were spread across London. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map The average age of a homicide victim in 2018 was 35. Teenagers made up 17% and a quarter of killings this year are thought to have been related to domestic violence. Although the issue of knife crime took centre stage this year, only 59% of 132 homicides stemmed from fatal stabbings. Motives and circumstances behind killings varied - as did the age and gender of the victims. London killings: All the victims of 2018 Youth violence is an undeniable issue in the capital. However, criminologist Simon Harding explained the true reasons behind each death were not always plain to see. ""It is much more layered than the screaming headlines lead you to believe,"" he said. ""What we are seeing with gang killings is more of a stab-on-sight mentality which has seemingly unnerved members of the public. ""There is also a doughnut effect - a ring around inner London boroughs where poverty and inequality is more prominent. ""Every year you are sadly going to have a certain percentage of domestic violence murders. There are also always spontaneous flashes of violence which can happen on a night out and often fuelled by alcohol."" The surge in killings over the last 12 months has arguably plagued London's reputation and infected it with a notoriety of being a violent city. Can Chicago cure London's violence? London knife crime: What can Sadiq Khan learn from Glasgow Murder victim's family leave UK and say London 'too dangerous' London violent crime could take 'a generation' to solve But, data shows the 2018 homicide rate was significantly lower than it was at the start of the 21st Century - and London's population has risen since then. Measures havestill been taken during 2018 in attempts to halt hikes in homicides- usually in reaction to a batch of violent deaths over a couple of days. After London endured a spree of killings in April, the Home Office published a newSerious Violence Strategy,externaland ploughed Â£40m into it. Prevention and early intervention were said to be ""at the heart"" of the government's action plan. This video can not be played How the community and local police are trying to make Croydon safer Additionally, asthe capital's homicide rate reached 100 in September,London Mayor Sadiq Khan described the issue as""a disease infecting communities"". Known as the ""public health approach"" it sees police officers working with teachers, councils and NHS staff to bring together knowledge of people involved in a criminal cycle. The mayor set about mirroringmethods used to cut Glasgow's homicide rateby creating a Violence Reduction Unit (VRU). In November, Sadiq Khan warned London's violent crime problem could take a generation to solve Despite being unveiled months ago, a director to lead London's VRU is yet to be appointed and details of the idea remain vague. The true influence of these political approaches will have to wait until well into 2019 - perhaps even later. But, as friends and families of the 132 homicide victims come to terms with new abiding traumas, 2018 is already a year too late.

"Doctors are raising concerns that changes to GP contracts will lead to a drop in immunisation rates among adults and children in rural areas. MMR and flu injections traditionally given at local doctors' surgeries are to become the responsibility of clinics set up by health boards. The move is designed to reduce the workload of GPs. But some doctors argue that in rural areas people might miss visits due to longer journeys to attend the clinics. NHS Highland said the Vaccine Transformation Programme was a national three-year programme and it was at the early stages of implementing the government policy in its area. The health board added that it would be making sure it did not do anything that increased risks to the population. Rural GP concerns over new contract Dr Philip Wilson, a GP and professor of rural health care, is opposed to the change. He said the new clinics would be shared by different practices and there was a potential risk of some patients missing a clinic visit. Dr Philip Wilson, a GP and professor of rural health care, is opposed to the change ""There is a particular issue about remote communities getting occasional visits,"" he said. ""There are no powers for GPs picking up people opportunistically and increasing immunisation rates. ""There will be an immunisation clinic shared between several different practices, and the consequence of that is that even when patients want to have their immunisation and are able to turn up for the appointments they might have to travel huge distances to get there. ""That, in turn, is going to remove the incentive or make it more difficult for people to actually get immunisations."" Dr Wilson added: ""It makes sense to carry on paying GPs to provide immunisations in rural areas."" Laura Hamlet says longer distances could make it harder to attend clinic appointments Adam Strachura, of Age Scotland, said if the aim of the new set up was get more people inoculated then ""that was a good thing"". But he added that for many older people their GP was key to their overall health and wellbeing. He said: ""Their regular GP is an important part of their health care needs. A GP will be able to look at all their medical issues, as well as administrating injections like the flu vaccination."" Laura Hamlet and her family live in Achiltibuie in Wester Ross. The community, 80 miles (129km) north west of Inverness, is 24 miles (38km) from the nearest village, Ullapool. She said: ""My youngest son is a winter baby, he was born in November, and winter babies tend to pick up lots of coughs and colds, so we had three goes at getting his immunisations."" Rural GPs should continue to be paid to immunise children and adults, says Dr Wilson The mother-of-two said that having to travel longer distances to reach a clinic would be more expensive. She said: ""You could end up having to put it off and in the meantime your child isn't immunised."" NHS Highland said it was not yet clear what changes, if any, would be proposed in rural areas of the Highlands. A spokesman said: ""Some areas in Scotland are further ahead with the changes such as Tayside and Lanarkshire and we are learning the lessons from that work. ""Any changes made in NHS Highland will be piloted first on a small scale before being rolled out. ""Childhood vaccine uptake in Highland, including for Measles Mumps and Rubella (MMR) is over 95%, and the population is well protected. Measles is a very rare infection in Scotland."" He added: ""We work and will continue to work with Highland GPs and the Highland Local Medical Committee to explore how best to deliver vaccinations.""

"Large funding shortfalls for special educational needs in schools are causing ""untold misery"" for thousands of families, a teaching union says. National Education Union analysis found spending was not keeping pace with rapidly increasing demand in nearly all (93%) of England's local councils. It said between 2015 and 2018, the number of special needs care plans grew 33%, while funding rose only 6%. The government says it is investing an extra Â£100m in special needs places. The NEU released its analysis of official figures at its annual conference in Liverpool where it will debate the issue. It said nearly two-thirds of England's local councils are spending less per pupil with complex needs than they were three years ago, in real terms. Part of the problem is that since 2014, councils have had to take on support for young people - up to the age of 25 - who are on special needs care plans, known as EHCPs. But councils say this extra duty was not funded properly. The union, whose members see pupils with unmet needs first-hand in class, says schools just do not have the money to fund support for pupils in the way that they need to do. Joint general secretary of the NEU Kevin Courtney said: ""This is an appalling way to be addressing the education of some of our most vulnerable children and young people and is causing untold misery and worry to thousands of families."" The lack of funds has resulted in the loss of necessary support staff who help these children access education, increased waiting times for assessments and cuts to specialist provision, according to the NEU. Children and Families Minister Nadhim Zahawi said it was not right to imply that funding had been cut, adding that his department had increased spending this year on the high needs budgets for those with severe and complex needs. But families in North Yorkshire, Birmingham and East Sussex are taking central government to court over the way it provides funding to local authorities for special needs. The case is due to be heard in the High Court in June. Several local authorities are awaiting decisions after legal challenges were mounted over cuts to their special needs budgets.

"Union officials said it was an ""unprovoked attack"" by a prisoner with a razor blade A prison officer had his throat cut by an inmate at HMP Nottingham, the Ministry of Justice has said. Union officials said it was an ""unprovoked attack"" by a prisoner with a razor blade. The officer, who was assaulted at about 10:00 BST on Sunday, needed 17 stitches. He has since been discharged from hospital. The prison's governor said his thoughts were with the officer, his family and ""the team dealing with the fallout."" Prison Officers' Association national chairman Mark Fairhurst said of the attacker: ""Apparently as soon as his door was unlocked this morning, he attacked the first officer he saw with a razor blade. ""He has cut his neck. The officer has gone to hospital and received 17 stitches. ""At the hospital, staff said he's lucky to be alive as it was very close to the main artery on his neck."" Mr Fairhurst added the officer was a new member of staff, still on his probationary period. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Megan, with mother Victoria, has needed immunoglobulins since the age of two Eight-year-old Megan Steadman's immune system is like that of a newborn and needs a special treatment derived from blood plasma to strengthen it. Production of immunoglobulins was banned in the UK in the 90s over fears about the potential spread of the human version of ""Mad cow disease"". It has since been imported, but is now in short supply and there are calls by patient groups to overturn the ban. The UK government said it was working to address the supply issue. Large amounts of plasma are needed to make the treatment, which is used to treat people whose immune systems have failed. Megan is one of only 5,000 people in the UK with a rare condition called primary immune deficiency. She had a stem cell transplant last year, which her family hope will cure her condition, but for now her life depends on regular infusions of immunoglobulins. Megan says the treatment makes her feel better Her mother Victoria Stoneman, from Aberbargoed, Caerphilly county, said without the treatment Megan may not be able to fight infections. ""This is to strengthen her new immune system, she's like a newborn baby at the moment, she's not ready to be immunised yet. ""So the immunoglobulin treatment keeps her strong and healthy and able to fight infection."" Megan added: ""It makes me feel better."" Ms Stoneman said she first noticed Megan's symptoms when she was two months old. ""[She had] high temperatures that we couldn't bring down and lots of hospitalisation with severe ear infections. She often displayed symptoms of infection without infection. ""She was diagnosed when she was 18 months and was put on immunoglobulin at two and a half."" 'Mad cow disease': What is BSE? Pioneering treatment for CJD brain disease Scientists find CJD resistance gene A cell in the immune system Immunoglobulins are extracted from plasma by a process called fractionation and it takes thousands of units of plasma, donated by a large group of people, to produce a single bottle. The process was banned in the UK in the late 1990s in the wake of the Mad cow disease - or BSE - crisis. Scientists were concerned just one blood donor carrying the human form of the fatal disease - variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) - could theoretically infect a entire batch of immunoglobulins. Since then all supplies have been brought in from other countries. But new treatments have seen the global demand for immunoglobulins rocket. In Wales alone requests for immunoglobulin have increased by 35% since 2013, and there is now concern the situation is unsustainable in the long term. A cow with BSE or Mad Cow Disease in 1990 - at its height in the UK, there were 1,000 new cases a week Liz Macartney, from the charity UKPIPS, which represents patients with primary immune deficiencies, said shortages were already impacting on patients. ""In the past, immunologists would try and assess which product would be better for each patient,"" she said. ""At the moment, we just have to accept whatever the NHS can buy. Potentially it could be devastating. ""Pharmaceutical companies tell us they will continue to make sure there's enough immunoglobulin for all patients who have an immune deficiency, but in the long term we've got to make sure we can produce our own."" Tommy Browne was recently told his medication was going to be altered Tommy Browne, from Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, is a spokesman for the Immune Deficiency Patient Group Wales and was diagnosed with a primary immune deficiency 11 years ago. He was recently told his medication was going to be altered. ""It's a big thing to have it changed because they don't know how you are going to react to a new brand,"" he said. Personalised medicine aim for cancer patients Should we pay people for donating blood? The UK government's Department of Health, which oversees the regulation of treatments, said they were working with NHS England and other partners to address the pressure on supply of immunoglobulin over the last 18 months. Chloe George, from the Welsh Blood Service, which manages the supply of immunoglobulins in Wales, said work was being done across the industry to increase supplies. ""Manufacturers... are also looking at ways to innovate new technologies so they can get more grams of immunglobulin per every unit of plasma,"" she added.

"More than 200 pupils spent at least five straight days in isolation booths in schools in England last year A girl who tried to kill herself after spending months in an isolation booth at school has said she felt ""alone, trapped and no-one seemed to care"". The teenager, who has autism, had no direct teaching and ate her lunch in the room, away from friends. Her mother said for months she was unaware of what was happening to her daughter and called on the government to improve guidance for schools. The Department for Education says pupil welfare must always be put first. Its guidelines say children should be in isolation for no longer than is necessary. In a letter to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme, the teenager - who we are calling ""Sophie"" - said: ""I decided I'd rather die than be in isolation because of the mood it left me in. ""I felt alone and trapped at school for such a long time that I felt as though it would be best, as no-one seemed to care anyway."" Her mother, ""Philippa"", estimates that her daughter was placed in an isolation booth at her secondary school more than 240 times in total - beginning in year seven but becoming more frequent in years 10 and 11. The 16-year-old spent every school day from mid-January to March this year in the room, the family say. She explained: ""The room has six booths with a small workspace and sides so you cannot see other people. ""You have to sit in silence and be escorted to the toilet which is embarrassing."" Example of isolation booths used in hundreds of schools in England On one occasion, Sophie said: ""I begged the teachers to ring my Mum as I didn't want to be alone any more. ""They refused and took my phone away, leaving me and a teacher I didn't know in an enclosed room."" After she tried to take her own life, Sophie returned to school but said she would ""dread each day"" when she was again placed in isolation. ""I would often have panic attacks and feel claustrophobic,"" she explained. ""I feel as though isolation rooms should be banned. ""They tend to make students feel isolated and helpless, knocking their self-esteem. ""Due to the amount of stress and trauma throughout school I now suffer with depression and anxiety."" This video can not be played 'Sophie' - voiced by an actor - says ""no-one seemed to care"" about her isolation According to a BBC investigation last year,more than 200 pupils spent at least five straight days in isolation boothsin schools in England last year. And more than 5,000 children with special educational needs also attended isolation rooms at some stage. Government guidance in England says schools are free to decide how long pupils should be kept in isolation, but they should be there ""no longer than is necessary"". The guidelines also say that in order for isolation to be lawful as a punishment it should be ""reasonable"" in all circumstances, and factors such as special educational needs should be taken into account. Schools do not need to record use or report to parents that their child has been sent to isolation, although many do. The school behaviour expert, Tom Bennett, who has advised the government, has said isolation rooms can be effective in tackling disruption in classrooms, and preventing fixed-term exclusions. ""When you're a lone adult with a class of 25 pupils, it only take two people to really persistently wilfully misbehave for that lesson to be completely detonated,"" he told the BBC in November. The family say they understand the need for isolation booths for short spells of time Philippa told the Victoria Derbyshire programme Sophie was now a ""completely different child"". Sophie has selective mutism - she did not speak until the age of eight - as well as autism, and can be ""defiant"" and ""disobedient"", her mother said - but this was ""all part of her diagnosis"". She added that Sophie - who ""does not deal with change very well"" as part of her condition - was ""regularly"" placed in isolation after she reacted badly to a change in teachers, classroom and routine. She said as a result her communication had regressed. ""Being isolated from her friends... made her become more internal - stop talking, stop communicating."" Philippa added that the school had also been aware of her daughter's plans to self-harm before she tried to take her own life, through a letter the teenager had written to them. But the school did not make her aware of the letter at the time, she said. When she discovered that Sophie had been in isolation booths - by now in year 11 at school - she said she felt ""traumatised"". ""I can't even begin to explain how it makes you feel knowing every day I'd send her into the school and she felt that alone that she wanted to take her own life."" The family's solicitor, Simpson Millar, have written to the government demanding action and improvements to isolation guidelines. Philippa said she understood the use of isolation booths in certain instances, but that it was not acceptable to use them as an ""ongoing punishment"". ""It's causing severe mental health problems. Schools should be held responsible."" Follow the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme onFacebook,externalandTwitter,external- and see more of our storieshere.

"Julian Assange after his removal from the embassy Julian Assange used the Ecuadorean embassy in London as a ""centre for spying"", the country's leader has said. Lenin Moreno also said no other nation had influenced the decision to revoke the WikiLeaks founder's asylum after what he called violations by Assange. PresidentMoreno told the Guardian newspaper Ecuador's old government had provided facilities within the embassy ""to interfere"" with other states.,external Assange's lawyer had earlier accused Ecuador of ""outrageous allegations"". President Moreno - who came to power in 2017 - said of the decision to end Assange's seven-year stay in the embassy: ""Any attempt to destabilise is a reprehensible act for Ecuador, because we are a sovereign nation and respectful of the politics of each country."" He added: ""We can not allow our house, the house that opened its doors, to become a centre for spying."" Julian Assange: Why is the Wikileaks co-founder a wanted man? Julian Assange: Campaigner or attention-seeker? A timeline: Assange in the Ecuadorean embassy On Monday, two left-wing German lawmakers, Heike Hansel and Sevim Dagdelen, and Spanish MEP, Ana Miranda, held a news conference outside Belmarsh prison, where Assange is currently detained. They made a call for EU states to offer him asylum and prevent his extradition to the US. Ms Dagdelen, who is a member of The Left party, said the EU should ""take action"" to protect the ""persecuted political publisher and journalist"". Ecuador's president also made references to Assange's apparently poor hygiene following allegations made by Ecuador's Interior Minister, Maria Paula Romo. Assange's lawyer, Jennifer Robinson, disputed the claims when she appeared on Sky's Sophy Ridge On Sunday. ""I think the first thing to say is Ecuador has been making some pretty outrageous allegations over the past few days to justify what was an unlawful and extraordinary act in allowing British police to come inside an embassy,"" she said. She added that Assange's fears of a US extradition threat had proved correct this week. Assange is expected to fight extradition to the US over an allegation that he had conspired with former army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to break into a classified government computer.

"This video can not be played ""It was just a horrible shock"" -Alicia Powell was evicted after complaining about a leak Private landlords will no longer be able to evict tenants at short notice without good reason under new plans. The government says it wants to protect renters from ""unethical"" landlords and give them more long-term security. Section 21 notices,externalallow landlords to evict renters without a reason after their fixed-term tenancy period ends. The National Landlords Association said members were forced to use Section 21 because they had ""no confidence"" in the courts to settle possession claims. But an organisation representing tenants said the plans were ""a vital first step to ending profiteering from housing"". Where does rent hit young people hardest? 'No water and rodents' among student housing gripes First Minister Mark Drakeford has announced similar plans for Wales, while in Scotland new rules requiring landlords to give a reason for ending tenancies were introduced in 2017. There are no plans in Northern Ireland to end no-fault evictions where a fixed-term tenancy has come to an end. Housing Secretary James Brokenshire said that evidence showed so-called Section 21 evictions were one of the biggest causes of family homelessness. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the changes would offer more ""stability"" to the growing number of families renting and mean people would not be afraid to make a complaint ""because they may be concerned through a no-fault eviction that they may be thrown out"". A survey of 2,001 private renters by Citizens Advice suggests thattenants who made a formal complaint had a 46% chance of being evicted,externalwithin the next six months. Mr Brokenshire also said the plans would offer ""speedy redress"" to landlords seeking to regain possession of their property for legitimate reasons, such as to sell it or to move into it themselves. At the moment, landlords can give tenants as little as eight weeks' notice after a fixed-term contract ends. Under the government's new plans, landlords would have to provide a ""concrete, evidenced reason already specified in law"" in order to bring tenancies to an end. Mrs May said the major shake-up will protect responsible tenants from ""unethical behaviour"" and give them the ""long-term certainty and the peace of mind they deserve"". The prime minister also said the government was acting to prevent ""unfair evictions"". Michael Downes, 65, who rents out a maisonette in Coleshill, Warwickshire, said that, after his experience with a problem tenant, he feels the system is stacked against landlords. He used Section 21 to evict someone who had not paid rent for four months. He said the other method open to landlords - a Section 8 eviction - meant the renter could halt the process by paying his arrears, only to stop paying again later. Even using the quicker eviction method that is due to be banned, the tenant lived rent-free for six months, costing Mr Downes Â£5,000. If the renter had fought the case in court, it could have taken a year to move him on, Mr Downes said. ""Everything seems to be loaded towards the tenant,"" he said. ""People like me are going to think, is it worth bothering any more?"" The National Landlords Association (NLA) said its members should be able to use a Section 8 possession notice to evict someone who has broken the terms of their tenancy - for example by not paying rent. This sometimes involves landlords spending money taking action in court if the tenants refuse to leave. But NLA chief executive Richard Lambert said many landlords were forced to use Section 21 as they have ""no confidence"" in the courts to deal with Section 8 applications ""quickly and surely"". He said the proposed changes would create a new system of indefinite tenancies by the ""back door"", and the focus should be on improving the Section 8 and court process instead. The National Landlords Association says the changes would make contracts ""meaningless"" A Ministry of Housing spokesman said court processes would ""also be expedited so landlords are able to swiftly and smoothly regain their property"" where such a move is justified. Amina Gichinga, from London Renters Union - which has been campaigning for the end of no-fault evictions - said: ""This campaign success is a vital first step to ending profiteering from housing and towards a housing model based on homes for people, not profit. ""Section 21 is a pernicious piece of legislation that renters across the country will be glad to see the back of. ""The law allows landlords to evict their tenants at a moment's notice, leaving misery and homelessness in its wake. This fear of eviction discourages renters from complaining about disrepair and poor conditions."" Alicia Powell, 24, said ""it was a horrible shock"" when she received an eviction notice after complaining about a leak in her north London flat. She and her boyfriend had to find Â£3,000 in moving costs with two months' notice and ""it completely rocks your world, everything is uprooted"", she told BBC Two's Victoria Derbyshire programme. Shelter, a charity which helps people struggling with bad housing or homelessness, said the proposals would ""transform lives"". Chief executive Polly Neate said: ""Government plans to abolish no-fault evictions represent an outstanding victory for England's 11 million private renters."" Labour's shadow housing secretary John Healey said that any promise of help for renters is ""good news"" but added that ""this latest pledge won't work if landlords can still force tenants out by hiking the rent"". The Labour partypreviously said it would scrap so-called Section 21 evictions, among a host of other reforms to the rental sector. ""Tenants need new rights and protections across the board to end costly rent increases and sub-standard homes as well as to stop unfair evictions,"" Mr Healy added. By Tom Edgington, BBC Reality Check The majority of Section 21 notices do not appear in official statistics - that's because most tenants will leave their property soon after they receive their eviction letter and do not mount a legal challenge. However, where Section 21 notices are challenged, some statistics are available. They show that the use of Section 21 has risen sharply since 2011. Last year10,128 repossessions were carried out by county court bailiffs,externalin England using ""the accelerated procedure"" (which doesn't require a court hearing). A repossession occurs when bailiffs are given permission to remove tenants from a property in order to return it to a landlord. So whilst the official numbers do not tell the whole story, they do show there is a rising trend over the long-term - even if the numbers have dropped a bit over the last couple of years.

"A third of millennials could face living in private rented accommodation for the rest of their lives according toa report by the Resolution Foundation. For many, a lifetime of renting means living with the threat of arbitrary evictions, unaffordable rent rises and the whims of landlords. ""The law is so stacked against the tenant,"" says Dan Wilson Craw, from campaign group Generation Rent. Christina, 30, from London, says she felt forced to accept living in a badly-maintained flat for fear of being asked to leave if she pushed her landlord to fix things. ""The flat had a serious mouse problem and the bathroom ceiling was virtually black with mould,"" she says. She also had concerns about her security, explaining: ""He had the keys to my house with all my stuff in it. I started keeping important documents and valuables at work because I didn't trust him."" Dan Wilson Craw says the main problem is ""Section 21"" - a piece of law that allows landlords to evict tenants without a reason. ""It means that you have no idea whether you will be living in your home next year,"" he adds. In 2015, a law was introduced to make so-called revenge evictions- carried out after a tenant complains about something - illegal, but it only applies to rental agreements signed since then. Sam Gomyer feels life as a renter is ""very precarious"" After three years of living in London, part-time student Sam Gomyer is renting his fourth property - two were sold and a rent increase forced him out of the third. ""I felt like I was cursed,"" he told the BBC, with one landlord even pulling out of a deal a week before he was due to move in. ""The laws on that should be different,"" he says. ""I was suddenly in this situation where I thought I had a home but it wasn't legally bound so they can just turn me down last minute - it was very precarious."" Four way to fix the rental market Renting in retirement: How feasible is it? One man, who lives in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire but wished to remain anonymous, told the BBC rent rises every year mean his family struggles to make ends meet. ""Everywhere else we look they are expecting at least a thousand [in rent] so if we lose our current place we're really in trouble,"" he says. ""We can't help but feel restricted in a place that is meant to be our own home. ""It could be reclaimed at any moment at the whim of the landlord or agents."" Matt Winter, a postman from Stevenage, was forced to leave his home of four years when the landlord wanted to sell the property. With three young children - including one child with autism - finding suitable accommodation proved very difficult. The family has now settled into a new home but Matt says he still worries about the future. ""The last year has only opened our eyes to what can happen so easily,"" he adds. A 30-year-old woman, who also didn't want to be named, says her landlady frequently lets herself into her London flat without giving notice. She worries that complaining about this will mean her tenancy is not extended and does not believed the law protects renters such as herself. ""There are laws in some cases but unless you can afford hefty court fees they don't really serve much purpose,"" she says. ""When it boils down to it landlords can pretty much do what they want. We could be out of a home in less than five months, and there's not a thing we can do about it."" Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external Generation Rent, which campaigns for secure and affordable privately rented homes, is calling for the introduction of indefinite tenancies. ""As long as the renter is paying the rent the tenancy would continue - the assumption is that it is a home,"" explains Dan Wilson Craw. He says the majority of landlords behave responsibly, but warns: ""The law is so stacked against the tenant you can't make the assumption that your landlord is one of the good ones."" Chris Norris, director of policy and practice at the National Landlords Association, says: ""In the last few years we've had new laws to prevent so called revenge evictions, greater taxation of landlords, and tougher regulation of letting agents. ""However, the fact remains that the overwhelming majority of tenancies are ended by tenants, not landlords - and the majority of landlords don't simply hike rents or end tenancies without a good reason.""

"Alicia and her boyfriend complained about water damage in their home Alicia Powell, 24, was renting a flat in north London with her boyfriend when she noticed a wet patch on the ceiling. They complained to their property manager but nothing was done so they said they were going to report it to their local council. That's when they were served with asection 21 notice,external- which allows landlords in England and Wales to evict renters without a reason once their tenancy has come to an end. Housing campaign group Generation Rent wants section 21s to be scrapped. It claims it allows landlords to take ""revenge evictions"" against renters who complain about problems in their homes. Generation Rent says renters risk getting evicted if they complain about repairs Councils have the power to inspect private properties and if they find a serious hazard they can take enforcement action against a landlord - which legally protects the tenant from being evicted for six months. But Generation Rent claims thatmany local authorities don't have the resources to get out and inspect a property,externaland it's leaving renters vulnerable. Alicia says she complained to the council about her home and it carried out an inspection - but it said the problems weren't serious enough for it to intervene. ""It's quite a depressing situation, because a lot of us are faced with the prospect of at least a good few years of renting. There doesn't seem to be an end in sight. ""Rather than focusing on buying initiatives like Help To Buy, there needs to be more concentration on the renting situation and how best to support people who are vulnerable."" Lucy says her landlord would let herself into the house when no-one was there Last year the charity Citizens Advice found that tenants who complained about issues in their homewere statistically more likely to get evicted,external. Lucy Bates, 21, also had problems getting repairs done by her landlord after complaining of mould in her bedroom. ""The landlord said the mould was my fault and that I was going to have to clean it myself,"" she tells Newsbeat. ""She also said that if the mould damaged the paint, I'd have to pay for that."" Lucy's solicitor sent a letter to her landlord to try to get something done. But the landlord refused to fix the issue and instead asked the tenants to move out four months before the end of their lease agreement. ""At that point it had created such a strain on my mental health that I didn't care, I just wanted out of that house,"" Lucy said. A section 21 can be used once an assured shorthold tenancy comes to an end Dan Wilson Craw, director of Generation Rent, wants section 21s to be abolished so that tenants can feel secure when renting. ""Getting rid of section 21 would stop this sort of bullying and the practice of revenge evictions,"" he said. ""Another thing we want to see alongside that is limits on rent increases, because that's another tactic that landlords can use to intimidate tenants into not complaining. ""There are people who are putting up with really bad conditions because they are scared of an eviction notice or the rent going up."" The National Landlords Association says many local authorities lack the funds needed to help tenants. Chris Norris, director of policy and practice, said: ""We all want a private rented sector rid of the kind of rogue operators who would rather evict someone than make a repair. ""Local authorities are responsible for enforcing against these landlords, however they often don't have the funding in place to effectively do so."" He also says some landlords rely on section 21s because it's harder to get their properties back through a section 8 possession notice. A section 8 means the renter has broken the terms of their tenancy - for example not paying rent - and sometimes involves landlords spending money taking action in court if the tenants refuse to leave.
