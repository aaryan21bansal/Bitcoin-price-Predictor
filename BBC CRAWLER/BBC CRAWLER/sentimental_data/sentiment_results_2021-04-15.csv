"MPs and peers are calling for funding for families forced to buy medicinal cannabis for their children privately. The treatment was made legal with a prescription in 2018 for those with an ""exceptional clinical need"". But a cross-party letter from 100 politicians says only three NHS prescriptions have been given out since, forcing families to spend thousands on private treatments. The government said it sympathised with those facing hard-to-treat conditions. The change in law came about after the cases of Alfie Dingley and Billy Caldwell, who had both been denied access to cannabis oil to treat their rare forms of epilepsy. The Home Office later granted the boys licences to access the treatment. But after a review by experts, the then home secretary Sajid Javid introduced legislation to make it legal for specialist doctors to provide prescriptions for cannabis-derived medicinal products in ""exceptional circumstances"". Medical cannabis products to be legalised 'I've spent Â£34,000 to keep my epileptic daughter alive' Medical cannabis 'expectations unfairly raised' Over two years have passed since the law changed, but the All Parliamentary Group on Access to Medical Cannabis Under Prescription said dozens of families were not seeing the benefit. In a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the group's chair, Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi, said instead, parents were having to fund raise up to Â£2,000 a month to pay for the treatment privately. ""In any circumstance, this is a severe financial burden for families already having to cope with very sick children and Covid restrictions have rendered most fund-raising impossible,"" she added. ""The reasons for the lack of NHS prescriptions appear to be complex and will inevitably take time to resolve. However, the families to which we refer simply do not have time. ""They are emotionally and financially broken and their children are at risk of being without their life-transforming medicine within weeks."" Backed by 100 MPs and peers from all parties, Ms Antoniazzi appealed to the PM to ""grant access to some form of compassionate funding until the wider issues can be resolved"". Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi has written to the PM on behalf of the families The APPG receives help with its administration from campaign group End Our Pain, which has welcomed the intervention. Group director Peter Carroll said the situation was ""desperate"" for the families, telling the BBC: ""When the law was changed, we thought as campaigners 'job done', there will be prescriptions - but it didn't happen."" He claimed the advice given out by various medical bodies on prescriptions for the treatment had been ""extremely cautious"", and as a result, ""we are in this crazy situation where it is totally legal, but hardly any specialist doctors will prescribe it"". But Mr Carroll said the call for funding for the families was ""the only thing that can work in very short term"". He added: ""We can't fight the other battles and win in weeks - the only way forward right now is to give these families the money to pay for prescriptions in the short term. ""I appeal to the government, give them money, stop them having to do online raffles for fundraising so they can focus on caring for some of the sickest children in the country."" A spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said: ""We sympathise with every patient and every family courageously confronting life with hard-to-treat conditions."" The spokesman added that after the law was changed in 2018 on prescriptions, the department was considering ""what further action we can take with regard to broader access to unlicensed cannabis-based products, while giving immediate priority to resolving the supply of Bedrocan oils from the Netherlands, which many patients are receiving.""

"This video can not be played Ash fell like snow on Saint Vincent following the eruptions Volcanic eruptions on St Vincent have blanketed the Caribbean island in ash, forcing 16,000 residents from their homes and leaving many without power or running water. Many of those there say they do not know when or if they will be able to return home. Shellisa Nanton, 26, lives with her family in the red zone - the areas at highest risk - in Georgetown. She told the BBC they had just hours to leave before La Soufriere erupted on Friday. ""We felt tremors in the days leading up to the eruption but we were not told to evacuate until the last minute. ""We were frantic when we heard the call to leave. We had to gather our things so quickly,"" she said. Shellisa said it was painful to leave the home she shared with her mother, sister, her sister's partner and their two-year-old child. ""We were all scrambling to get our belongings together and we could feel the heat. It was heart wrenching and overwhelming to just leave our home like that, leaving behind so many memories. ""We've had hurricanes before but nothing like this."" Layers of ash are covering roads and buildings in St Vincent Shellisa says they were lucky that they were able to leave the red zone in their truck. Many others did not have any transportation. ""When we finally got the truck going we passed many people on the narrow roads, who like us were leaving, but on foot and carrying what they could. It was so sad and depressing to see. ""We were on the road all night until we reached the south. I don't know how many people made it out."" Shellisa and her family are now living with a family friend in the south of the island in Campden Park. She says this is their home for now. ""We don't know if we can go home. We don't know if there's a home to go back to. ""We are planning to stay here for at least a few months. We just don't know yet the extent of the damage. It's very sad."" On the island's green zone away from the La Soufriere volcano Shanniel Johnson lives with her extended family. She told the BBC despite living in the safer' green zone the ash from the eruption caused massive devastation which has only just improved somewhat thanks to the rain. ""Roofs caved in on homes because of the heavy ash fall. It's been dark for a few days and there have been more eruptions since Friday,"" she told the BBC. Shanniel says the ash carpeting the island had left them without water to drink, cook or wash. ""The ash contaminated the water but thankfully it has rained recently so the ash is clearing in some areas. ""But we need humanitarian aid. A lot of people have been displaced and are in shelters."" Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves has been visiting shelters across the island ""Many of my family members live in red zones in the north of the island and I've been helping them to move down south where I live,"" Jomo Thomas told the BBC. ""It's an horrific scene - since Friday there has been a series of eruptions,"" the lawyer explained. ""About four or five thousand are in shelters. But the problem is that many of the shelters are schools and because they are in the tropics there is a lot of ventilation, so the dust can easily come through."" Many of those who can are trying to leave the island. Rhiannon West and her family are British nationals, living on the island under temporary residency rules. The teacher hopes to return to the UK with her partner and six-month-old baby. ""We stood outside our home on Saturday and watched as the volcano erupted and a huge billowing cloud of ash was sent into the air. It was incredible but also terrifying. ""Since then we've been sheltering indoors with everything closed. ""It's scary thinking about what we can do to protect the baby ""We keep losing electricity, have no water supply and no bottled water left at the closest shops."" ""This could go on for weeks and neither of us can work because of the power supply issues. ""The atmosphere is just very eerie.""

"The Duke of Edinburgh was given a ceremonial funeral at Windsor with bands and a military escort. Only 30 mourners were allowed to attend because of coronavirus restrictions. These are the guests who were at the service in St George's Chapel, Windsor, on Saturday 17 April. The Queen said Prince Philip had ""quite simply, been my strength and stay all these years"". The Queen joined the procession to the chapel in the state Bentley, following behind the walking members of the Royal Family and staff. She married the duke in 1947, five years before she became Queen on the death of her father King George VI. Her constant companion, the duke was the longest-serving consort of any British monarch. He retired from royal duties in 2017 having completed more than 22,000 solo engagements. Prince Charles said his father was a ""much-loved and appreciated figure"" and he and the Royal Family would miss him greatly. He added that over the last 70 years his father had ""given the most remarkable, devoted service to the Queen, to my family and to the country, but also to the whole of the Commonwealth"". Prince Charles is the Queen's eldest son and first in line to the throne. The prince walked behind the Land Rover in the procession, alongside other members of the Royal Family and household staff. Camilla married Prince Charles in April 2005, although they had been close friends since the 1970s. Both had been married previously, Charles to Diana, who died in a car crash in 1997, and Camilla to cavalry officer Andrew Parker Bowles, whom she divorced in 1995. The couple first met at a Windsor polo match in 1970. In April 2012, the Queen made the duchess a Dame Grand Cross, the highest female rank in the Royal Victorian Order. Princess Anne said her father was her ""teacher, supporter and critic"". The duke's only daughter said he would leave a ""legacy which can inspire us all"". She said she ""most wanted to emulate"" her father's example of a ""life well-lived and service freely given"". The Princess Royal and other members of the Royal Family walked in procession behind the Land Rover which carried the duke's coffin. Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence married the Princess Royal in 1992. He is her second husband.

He was always somebody you could go to and he would always listen so it's a great loss. Prince Andrew and other members of the Royal Family walked in procession behind the Land Rover which carried the duke's coffin. Prince Andrew stepped back from royal duties in 2019 after criticism of his ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein intensified following a BBC interview. Prince Edward said his father had been ""a great source of support and encouragement and guidance"" all the way through his life. ""He's always been there as that rock in the Queen's life. Certainly within his family that was exactly the same,"" he said. After a brief period with the Royal Marines, the prince formed his own TV production company but now supports the Queen in her official duties and carries out public engagements for charities. He joined his brothers, sister and other members of the Royal Family in the procession behind the Land Rover which carried the duke's coffin.

The prince, second in line to the throne after his father Charles, said he would miss the duke, who would have wanted the family ""to get on with the job"". He joined other members of the Royal Family walking in procession behind the Land Rover which carried the duke's coffin. The prince, who was 15 when his mother Diana died, is married to Catherine and they have three children. Kate Middleton became Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, after marrying Prince William in 2011. They have three children - George, Charlotte and Louis,  all under 10 years old. The duchess supports a number of charitable causes and organisations, several of which are centred around providing children with the best possible start in life. She is also a keen photographer and known for taking candid snaps of the Royal Family. Prince Harry said his grandfather was ""a man of service, honour and great humour"" and the ""legend of banter"". He joined other members of the Royal Family walking in procession behind the Land Rover which carried the duke's coffin. The funeral is the first time that Prince Harry has visited the UK since he and his wife Meghan stepped back from royal duties last March. Meghan is pregnant with their second child and remained at the couple's home in California, after being advised by her doctor not to travel.

"Joe Biden promised a tougher approach to Russia The US has announced sanctions against Russia in response to what it says are cyber-attacks and other hostile acts. The measures, which targetÂ dozens of Russian entities and officials, aim to deter ""Russia's harmful foreign activities"", the White House said. The statement says Russian intelligence was behind last year's massive ""SolarWinds"" hack, and accuses Moscow of interference in the 2020 election. Russia denies all the allegations and says it will respond in kind. The sanctions announced on Thursday are detailed in an executive order signed by President Joe Biden. They come at a tense time for relations between the two countries. Russia to consider Biden plan for Putin summit US Treasury and commerce department hacked SolarWinds: Why the Sunburst hack matters Mr Putin is said to be considering Mr Biden's offer of a summit Last month the UStargeted seven Russian officials and more than a dozen government entitiesover the poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny. Russia says it was not involved. In a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday, Mr Biden vowed to defend US national interests ""firmly"", while proposing a meeting with Mr Putin to find areas where the two countries could work together. On Thursday, Mr Biden described his decision to impose sanctions on Russia as ""proportionate"". ""I was clear with President Putin that we could have gone further, but I chose not to do so,"" Mr Biden told reporters. ""The United States is not looking to kick off a cycle of escalation and conflict with Russia."" He added that the way forwards is through ""thoughtful dialogue and diplomatic process"". A statement from the White House said the new sanctions show the US ""will impose costs in a strategic and economically impactful manner on Russia"" if it continues its ""destabilising international action"". It reaffirms the administration's view that the Russian government is behind cyber-attacks and has been trying to ""undermine the conduct of free and fair democratic elections"" in the US and allied nations. It specifically blames Russia's foreign intelligence service, the SVR, for the SolarWinds attack, which gave cyber-criminals potential access to 18,000 government and private computer networks. Last December,then US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he believed Russia was behind it. The latest sanctions target 32 entities and officials accused of trying to influence the 2020 US presidential election ""and other acts of disinformation"". Ten diplomats are being expelled. The executive order also bars US financial institutions from purchasing rouble-denominated bonds from June. The Biden administration is trying to tread a careful line. US officials want to impose costs for a range of unacceptable behaviour from Moscow and deter further acts. They also want to signal they are going to take a tougher line than the Trump administration. But they also say they do not want to see a downward spiral in relations. The message they have is that their response is ""resolute but proportionate"". The SolarWinds cyber-espionage campaign was a primary concern. To maximise the impact they have combined response to this with sanctions over election interference and other issues. Diplomatic expulsions and sanctions against individuals will largely be shrugged off by Moscow as expected. The financial sanctions regarding Russian sovereign debt are a step-up though. The US has also published a huge amount of detail about Russian intelligence activities ranging from front companies involved in spreading disinformation to Russian tech companies allegedly supporting its intelligence services. The hope will be that this also makes it harder for the Russians to operate. But past experience suggests all of this is unlikely to deter the Kremlin. The new US weapon against Russia? Detail The White House meanwhile acknowledged there was little evidence to support claims that Russia had offered bounties to Taliban militants for killing American soldiers. The intelligence assessment was first reported last June by the New York Times, and was cited by Mr Biden on the campaign trial last year to accuse then-President Donald Trump of not standing up to Russia. Mr Trump at the time called it ""fake news"". On Thursday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters the intelligence community had determined it had only ""low to moderate confidence"" in the claims, which are said to have come from interrogations of Afghan detainees. Shortly after the sanctions were announced, Russia's foreign ministry called them ""hostile steps which dangerously raise the temperature of confrontation"". ""Such aggressive conduct will of course get a decisive response,"" the statement added. The US ambassador has been called to the foreign ministry. What Biden's foreign policy 'reset' really means The EU, Nato and the UK have all issued statements in support of the US measures. In his first foreign policy speech in February, Mr Biden vowed to stand up to Russia. ""The days of the United States rolling over in the face of Russia's aggressive actionsâ¦ are over,"" he said. The Obama-Biden administration was accused of standing by while Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. But in recent days Mr Biden has warned the Kremlin against aggressive actions in Ukraine. Russia is beefing up its military presence in the border area. Mr Biden's predecessor rarely criticised Mr Putin. In a report last monthUS intelligence agencies concludedthe Russian president had probably directed online efforts to help Mr Trump win a second term as US president. And yet, according to the Carnegie Moscow Center, Mr Trump imposed a record total of more than 40 rounds of sanctions on Moscow. In 2018 he expelled 60 Russian diplomats from the US. Ukraine's military also fears Russian aggression in the east of the country Why US spy world is feeling so uneasy right now US cyber-security firm hit by 'state-sponsored' attack This video can not be played Experts have been warning for years that it's not a matter of if, but when, hackers will kill somebody Russia to consider Biden plan for Putin summit US Treasury and commerce department hacked Has Putin's war in Ukraine failed?

"Bill Crothers says he was ""transparent"" about the role he took on with Greensill Capital A former senior civil servant embroiled in a row over his job at Greensill Capital took another post without reporting it, it has emerged. Bill Crothers has come under fire for working at the now-failed finance firm while still on the government payroll. It has now come to light he took on another trustee role without seeking the advice of the necessary committee. Mr Crothers apologised to the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments for what he called an ""honest mistake"". But the chair of the committee, Lord Pickles, said he had breached government rules. The news comes after Lord Pickles warned the existing guidelines on ministers and top officials taking jobs with private firms needed urgent reforms as there did not appear to be ""any boundaries at all"" between civil servants and the private sector. Labour says things are becoming ""murkier"" and lobbyists have an ""open door"" to government. What jobs can ex-ministers do and what are the rules? Civil servants ordered to declare second jobs Top civil servant 'joined Greensill before quitting' What's the Greensill lobbying row about? The government has announced a review of contacts between top officials and ministers after the row over Greensill Capital, access, influence and lobbying has engulfed Westminster. The review will include former prime minister David Cameron's dealing with the firm, as well as Mr Crothers. It will be led by Nigel Boardman, a non-executive board member of the department for business. A number of Commons Select Committees have also announced their own inquiries. On Wednesday, Mr Johnson orderedConservative MPs to vote down Labour's callfor a ""full"" MP-led inquiry into Greensill and lobbying more widely. It emerged on Tuesday that Mr Crothers - a former government procurement officer - joined Greensill as an adviser in 2015 while still working as a civil servant, after getting the go-ahead from the Cabinet Office. But an exchange of letters between him and Lord Pickles, published on Thursday, also revealed he had failed to alert the committee about a different job he took in 2016 as a trustee with the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply Mr Crothers apologised in his letter for what he described an ""honest mistake"", saying he did not think he had to report the role as it was unpaid and with a not-for-profit charity. But Lord Pickles said the rules applied to both paid and unpaid jobs and it was therefore a breach of the regulations. This video can not be played Lord Pickles: ""I hope this doesn't sound rude, but there doesn't seem to have been any boundaries at all"" Earlier, the Tory peer Lord Pickles told the Commons public administration committee he had warned of a scandal but the Greensill lobbying affair was ""not where I expected it to come from"". He added: ""There is nothing wrong with lobbyists. What is wrong is with unregulated lobbying, secret lobbying - people getting an undue advantage. ""Our entire political careers have been built by lobbying of some sort. But where it becomes wrong is where it is not properly regulated and is transparent."" Speaking about Mr Crothers, Lord Pickles said it was not unusual for civil servants to have second jobs and to share their expertise. But he said the former civil servant's ""excuse"" when justifying his work with Greensill surprised him. ""It did seem, talking to other colleagues who had enjoyed being civil servants in the past, that they also shared my surprise - this seems to be a new thing, or a new excuse,"" he said. He said contractors and consultants to the government should have to sign a memorandum of understanding about the restrictions that would be placed on them after completing their public sector work. Lord Pickles also expressed his frustration that his committee had a ""very limited and defined role"", but added that most people do follow the rules and it is ""only a tiny minority"" who cause problems. This video can not be played Lobbying row: PM Johnson says we must ""get to the bottom of it"" Speaking on a visit to Dartmouth College in Devon, Boris Johnson said he agreed with Lord Pickles that reform was needed. The PM said: ""I think the most important thing is for us to get to the bottom of it properly and I want all ministers and civil servants to be making the information that needs to be known known to Mr Boardman and let's see what he has to say. ""We need to understand what's gone on here."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said more and stronger lobbying rules are needed because the current system ""is not working"". He said ministers were being lobbied for ""massive"" procurement contracts ""involving millions sometimes billions of pounds"".

"This video can not be played Friedrich Joussen tells the BBC's Aaron Heslehurst that he is optimistic about the summer. Successful vaccine programmes will prevent another washout for summer holidaymakers, the boss of Europe's largest tour company has told the BBC. ""We are optimistic about the summer,"" said Friedrich Joussen, who runs TUI. The firm - which owns a fleet of aircraft, cruise ships and a chain of travel agencies - said bookings in March alone had hit 2.8 million. As a result, it expected to operate up to 75% of its normal schedule for the summer season. ""We are still confident that we will have a decent summer,"" said Mr Joussen, pointing to coronavirus vaccination programmes in the UK, US and Europe. What are the rules for UK and foreign holidays? The company, which sells holidays to 180 different countries, suffered heavy losses during the pandemic. Across the industry, income slumped by almost $4.5 trillion last year, leaving more than 62 million people without work, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC). The industry body is pressing for international travel to resume in June to stem further job losses. But Mr Joussen said he expected some countries to ask travellers to prove they had been vaccinated before they were allowed to cross the border. Although he thinks demonstrating a negative test result would be just as effective in preventing the spread of the virus. However, for that strategy to be successful, he said the cost of those tests should be reduced. ""The cheaper it gets, the better it works and the less harmful it is for the general economy,"" he said. European countries have ramped up their vaccination programmes in recent weeks, as the continent experiences a third wave of infections in the face of new variants. Nevertheless, Mr Joussen is optimistic about the summer. ""All medical advice we are getting as a company says that existing vaccines are working with existing variants,"" Mr Joussen said. ""Now they might be less efficient sometimes, but still it's much better than not being vaccinated."" In the past year, TUI has been forced to borrow billions from the German government just to stay afloat. But analysts have warned that in the wake of the crisis, the part-nationalised firm may struggle to compete against leaner rivals, as the industry reels from more than 12 months of international travel bans. Mr Joussen said the German state stepped in at a time of great uncertainty, when the firm was struggling to survive and could not raise money from private investors. ""Berlin is a very rational investor,"" he said, adding: ""Germany would want to exit the loan as soon as possible.""

"Colin and Cuthbert caterpillar cakes- Marks & Spencer has begun legal action against Aldi, arguing the supermarket's Cuthbert the Caterpillar cake infringes its Colin the Caterpillar trademark. M&S claims that their similarity leads consumers to believe they are of the same standard and ""rides on the coat-tails"" of M&S's reputation. It lodged an intellectual property claim with the High Court this week. M&S wants Aldi to remove the product from sale and agree not to sell anything similar in the future. The retailer has three trademarks relating to Colin, which it believes means Colin has acquired and retains an enhanced distinctive character and reputation. The food and drinks with trademarked shapes The battle to stop people from copying shapes The product was launched around 30 years ago. Colin's appearance has been substantially unchanged since around 2004, except for adaptations for events such as Halloween and Christmas, and related products such as Connie the Caterpillar. A spokesman said: ""Because we know the M&S brand is special to our customers and they expect only the very best from us, love and care goes into every M&S product on our shelves. ""So we want to protect Colin, Connie and our reputation for freshness, quality, innovation and value."" Colin is central to M&S's partnership with cancer charity Macmillan, and the retailer has created a Colin product for the annual World's Biggest Coffee Morning fundraising event. The cake is a sponge with milk chocolate and buttercream, topped with chocolate sweets and a smiling white chocolate face. M&S was the first retailer to sell a caterpillar cake, but many supermarkets have since created their own similar products. Other cakes include Waitrose's Cecil, Sainsbury's Wiggles, Tesco's Curly, and Asda's Clyde the Caterpillar. In 2018, Nestlelost its battleto trademark the four-finger shape of a Kit Kat, which it had been trying to do for more than a decade Toblerone's shape was registered in 1998, but in 2017 it faced a dispute with Poundland - which designed a version with two rows of triangular bumps - that was settled out of court Swiss chocolate maker Lindt & Spruengli defeated a legal challenge in 2015 from rival confectioner Haribo, which soughtto stop it making its gold chocolate bears The food and drinks with trademarked shapes No break for Kit Kat in trademark case Legal row shop becomes Morrisinghs Sainsbury's in lookalike shop sign row Lindt defeats Haribo over gold bear Deadly wildfires rage across LA as fierce winds threaten more destruction UK records coldest night of winter as snap to last into weekend Sisters seemed fine before going missing, relative says 'I paid fake doctor thousands for fillers - now I look like a gargoyle' The Papers: 'Lost Angeles' and 'Musk seeks plan to oust Starmer' Pop star Chappell Roan wins BBC Sound Of 2025 Weekly quiz: Zendaya looked happy but who else sparkled at the Golden Globes?

"The distinctive ""Jenners"" is normally seen at the top of the department store building The owner of Edinburgh's Jenners building has begun an investigation after signs bearing its name were removed from the landmark shop. Witnesses spotted the distinctive gold-coloured lettering being taken down on Wednesday. A spokesman for the Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen, who owns the listed building, said they were ""very surprised"" the signs had been removed. Frasers Group, which operates the store, has been asked for comment. City of Edinburgh Council said it was also investigating whether the removal of the signs was a breach of planning rules ""given the historical significance of the building"". ""We'll take action if appropriate,"" Neil Gardiner, the planning convener added. The signs had been removed when this photograph was taken on Thursday The Jenners building has occupied a prime location on Princes Street for 183 years. It was bought by Mr Povlsen - who is one of Scotland's biggest landowners - in 2017, reportedly for Â£53m. The store is currently operated by the Mike Ashley's Frasers Group, which owns the commercial rights to the Jenners trading name. It said it would be quitting the site in May after the two sides were unable to come to an agreement. Frasers Group includes Sports Direct, House of Fraser and Evans Cycles. Anders Krogh Vogdrup - the director of AAA United, which owns the Jenners building - told BBC Scotland: ""We are very surprised seeing the signage being taken down. We are convinced that the signage is part of the listed building. ""We have not discussed any such step with Sports Direct, and certainly not given any authorisation to do so. We will look in to this matter, contacting Sports Direct. ""We can only once again emphasise that the Jenners building of Edinburgh is an institution and, despite the changing face of retail, it is our aspiration that there will continue to be a retail store for as long as we are its stewards. ""Our involvement in the Jenners building, is first and foremost about helping to preserve a unique historic building in Edinburgh. Already when we acquired the building, we knew that it came with a great deal of responsibility. ""Jenners is an iconic building in Edinburgh, and we take the responsibility very seriously. "" The building owner is currently in advanced talks with a new tenant to move into the department store.

"This video can not be played Lord Pickles: ""I hope this doesn't sound rude, but there doesn't seem to have been any boundaries at all"" The rules on ministers and top officials taking jobs with private firms need urgent reform, the government's adviser on them has said. Lord Pickles said there did not appear to be ""any boundaries at all"" between civil servants and the private sector. It comes after news a top civil servant worked for Greensill Capital while still on the government payroll. Labour says things are becoming ""murkier"" and lobbyists have an ""open door"" to government. Greensill Capital is at the centre of a row about access, influence and lobbying that has engulfed Westminster. What jobs can ex-ministers do and what are the rules? Civil servants ordered to declare second jobs Top civil servant 'joined Greensill before quitting' What's the Greensill lobbying row about? The government has announced a review of contacts between top officials and ministers, including former prime minister David Cameron, and the now failed finance firm. It will be led by Nigel Boardman, a non-executive board member of the department for business. Speaking on a visit to Dartmouth College in Devon, Boris Johnson said he agreed with Lord Pickles that reform was needed. The PM said: ""I think the most important thing is for us to get to the bottom of it properly and I want all ministers and civil servants to be making the information that needs to be known known to Mr Boardman and let's see what he has to say. ""We need to understand what's gone on here."" This video can not be played Lobbying row: PM Johnson says we must ""get to the bottom of it"" On Wednesday, Mr Johnson orderedConservative MPs to vote down Labour's callfor a ""full"" MP-led inquiry into Greensill and lobbying more widely. Tory peer Lord Pickles chairs the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba) which advises former ministers and civil servants on outside employment. He told the Commons public administration committee he had warned of a scandal but ""this is not where I expected it to come from"". He added: ""There is nothing wrong with lobbyists. What is wrong is with unregulated lobbying, secret lobbying - people getting an undue advantage. ""Our entire political careers have been built by lobbying of some sort... it becomes wrong when it is not properly regulated, recorded and transparent."" Former ministers and senior civil servants must seek advice before taking up a new job in the two years after they leave Whitehall By political reporter Brian Wheeler Former government ministers - and top civil servants - are never short of job offers, but what sort of work should they be allowed to do after leaving the corridors of power? Lord Pickles' Acoba committee is meant to ensure that they don't use their insider knowledge and contacts to enrich themselves for two years after leaving the government. The danger is that if they get too cosy with business it could lead to bias and corruption. The Acoba committee has long been criticised for being toothless - and Eric Pickles appears to agree. As things stand, he is neither a watchdog nor a regulator, he says. His committee is there to offer advice, which is not always sought. He appears determined to change this, although he says there is no need for the ""thermonuclear"" option of fines and new laws. Only that if you break the rules, there must be ""consequences"". On Tuesday it emerged that a former government procurement officer, Bill Crothers, joined Greensill as an adviser in 2015 while still working as a civil servant - after getting the go-ahead from the Cabinet Office. Lord Pickles said that while it was not unusual for civil servants to have second jobs and to share their expertise, Mr Crothers' ""excuse"" when justifying his work with Greensill surprised him. ""It did seem, talking to other colleagues who had enjoyed being civil servants in the past, that they also shared my surprise - this seems to be a new thing, or a new excuse."" Bill Crothers says he was ""transparent"" about the role he took on with Greensill Capital He said contractors and consultants to the government should have to sign a memorandum of understanding about the restrictions that would be placed on them after completing their public sector work. ""Simple steps could be taken now"" he said to tighten things up including ""looking carefully at contracts of employment"" and changes could be put in place ""well before the summer"". He said the public was ""entitled"" to know the arrangements for second jobs. ""I mean, if Mr Crothers had decided he wanted to have a milk round or something, I don't think we would be terribly worried. ""But his particular position, in terms of running procurement and working for a commercial organisation, is something that does require a full and frank and transparent explanation,"" he added. He  expressed his frustration that Acoba had a ""very limited and defined role,"" but added that most people do follow the rules and it is ""only a tiny minority"" who cause problems. What inquiries are being held? Government-commissioned review to report by the end of June will include David Cameron's role and how senior civil servant Bill Crothers was given permission to work for Greensill while on the government payroll The head of the civil service, Simon Case, has ordered all government departments to disclose senior staff with second jobs and outside interests by the end of the week Treasury Select Committee announced investigation into Greensill Capital on Tuesday with details set out next week Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee has just announced its own inquiry in to ""topical issues arising around Greensill"" Committee on Standards in public life looking at the wider issues Cabinet Office review of the Lobbying Act, launched before the Greensill row, will take it into account Committee on Standards in Public Life Commons public accounts committee is also looking into Greensill controversy It was possible to create a ""robust system"" without spending ""enormous sums"" of money and creating layers of bureaucracy, Lord Pickles told MPs.

He said ministers were being lobbied for ""massive"" procurement contracts ""involving millions sometimes billions of pounds"".

"Former Prime Minister David Cameron made about Â£3.3m from shares in the collapsed finance company Greensill Capital, documents obtained by BBC Panorama suggest. Last month an MPs' report accused Mr Cameron of ""a significant lack of judgement"" in lobbying the government on behalf of the company, although it said he did not break any rules. In 2020, Mr Cameron tried to persuade ministers to allow Greensill - who employed him as an adviser - to join a scheme called the Corporate Covid Financing Facility (CCFF). This would have allowed the company to issue loans, insured by the government, to help firms through the pandemic. However, Mr Cameron - and the company's founder, Lex Greensill - were unsuccessful in their attempts. Greensill Capital collapsed this year, with the loss of 440 jobs, and possible billion-pound losses for investors. Mr Cameron has consistently declined to say how much he was being paid by Greensill, except that it was ""far more"" than his salary as PM. However, BBC's Panorama has obtained a letter from Greensill Capital to the former PM which suggests that he made Â£3.29m after selling a tranche of Greensill shares in 2019. David Cameron 'made $10m' before company's collapse As well as the shares, Mr Cameron is reported to have received a salary of $1m (Â£720,000) a year as a part-time adviser. The programme also understands that the former prime minister was paid a bonus of $700,000 (Â£504,000) in 2019 on top of his salary. In total, it looks like he made around $10m before tax for two-and-a-half years' part-time work. Mr Cameron's spokesman said his remuneration was a private matter. Australian banker Lex Greensill originally worked for David Cameron at No 10 in the early 2010s Mr Cameron has been accused of trying to exploit private contacts with former government colleagues, for his own benefit. The former PM used private channels,externalto lobby ministers and former colleagues. He and his staff sent45 emails, texts and WhatsApp messagesconcerning Greensill between 5 March and 26 June 2020. Among these were nine WhatsApp messages to Chancellor Rishi Sunak and 12 text messages to Sir Tom Scholar, the Treasury's top civil servant. The Bank of England haspublished correspondence,externalshowing that Mr Cameron had contacted senior officials several times, in an unsuccessful attempt to win their support. Along with Lex Greensill, Mr Cameron met Health Secretary Matt Hancock for a ""private drink"" in 2019to discuss a new payment scheme for NHS staff. A report last month by the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee said that while no lobbying rules were broken, Mr Cameron's actions showed there was a ""good case for strengthening them"", with the current ones offering ""insufficient strength"". It also said that the Treasury was right to reject the former PM's proposals, but it ""should have encouraged"" him into ""more formal lines of communication as soon as it had identified his personal financial incentives"". ACabinet Office reviewcommissioned by Boris Johnson also criticised Mr Cameron, and said he had understated his relationship with Greensill when lobbying the Treasury. However, it said that ""his actions were not unlawful"". Several other reviews are investigating matters related to lobbying and Greensill. Responding to the Treasury Committee report, Mr Cameron admitted that he should have used more formal channels, but said he had worked for Greensill primarily because he thought the firm could help small businesses during an economic crisis. However, Deputy Labour Leader Angela Rayner said the fact that Mr Cameron had been cleared of breaking rules proved ""that the rules that are supposed to regulate lobbying are completely unfit for purpose"". Current rules,externalstate that ""on leaving office, ministers will be prohibited from lobbying government for two years"". Before accepting new jobs, former ministers are supposed to inform a body called the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba). Acoba advises civil servants and politicians on what they can and can't do after leaving public service. However, although former ministers are required to contact Acoba, they are not obliged to act on its advice. Acoba's head, Lord Pickles, has called for ex-ministers who work as lobbyiststo go on a register for up to 10 years to ensure ""transparency"", The company's collapse earlier this year was triggered after its insurer refused to renew cover for the loans Greensill was making. Greensill was theprincipal financial backer of Liberty Steel, which employs 3,000 people in England, Scotland and Wales. Talks are now underwayto try to secure Liberty's future.

"The Duke of Edinburgh was given a ceremonial funeral at Windsor with bands and a military escort. Only 30 mourners were allowed to attend because of coronavirus restrictions. These are the guests who were at the service in St George's Chapel, Windsor, on Saturday 17 April. The Queen said Prince Philip had ""quite simply, been my strength and stay all these years"". The Queen joined the procession to the chapel in the state Bentley, following behind the walking members of the Royal Family and staff. She married the duke in 1947, five years before she became Queen on the death of her father King George VI. Her constant companion, the duke was the longest-serving consort of any British monarch. He retired from royal duties in 2017 having completed more than 22,000 solo engagements. Prince Charles said his father was a ""much-loved and appreciated figure"" and he and the Royal Family would miss him greatly. He added that over the last 70 years his father had ""given the most remarkable, devoted service to the Queen, to my family and to the country, but also to the whole of the Commonwealth"". Prince Charles is the Queen's eldest son and first in line to the throne. The prince walked behind the Land Rover in the procession, alongside other members of the Royal Family and household staff. Camilla married Prince Charles in April 2005, although they had been close friends since the 1970s. Both had been married previously, Charles to Diana, who died in a car crash in 1997, and Camilla to cavalry officer Andrew Parker Bowles, whom she divorced in 1995. The couple first met at a Windsor polo match in 1970. In April 2012, the Queen made the duchess a Dame Grand Cross, the highest female rank in the Royal Victorian Order. Princess Anne said her father was her ""teacher, supporter and critic"". The duke's only daughter said he would leave a ""legacy which can inspire us all"". She said she ""most wanted to emulate"" her father's example of a ""life well-lived and service freely given"". The Princess Royal and other members of the Royal Family walked in procession behind the Land Rover which carried the duke's coffin. Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence married the Princess Royal in 1992. He is her second husband. He joined his wife and other members of the Royal Family in procession behind the Land Rover which carried the duke's coffin. Prince Andrew said his father's death was a terrible loss: ""We've lost the grandfather of the nation."" Speaking of his father, Prince Andrew said: ""He was so calm. He was always somebody you could go to and he would always listen so it's a great loss. Prince Andrew and other members of the Royal Family walked in procession behind the Land Rover which carried the duke's coffin. Prince Andrew stepped back from royal duties in 2019 after criticism of his ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein intensified following a BBC interview. Prince Edward said his father had been ""a great source of support and encouragement and guidance"" all the way through his life. ""He's always been there as that rock in the Queen's life. Certainly within his family that was exactly the same,"" he said. After a brief period with the Royal Marines, the prince formed his own TV production company but now supports the Queen in her official duties and carries out public engagements for charities. He joined his brothers, sister and other members of the Royal Family in the procession behind the Land Rover which carried the duke's coffin. Sophie Rhys-Jones became the Countess of Wessex after marrying Prince Edward in 1999. The Countess of Wessex carries out royal duties and also visits a large number of her own charities and organisations. The earl and countess have two children. Prince William paid tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh, saying his ""grandfatherâs century of life was defined by service - to his country and Commonwealth, to his wife and Queen, and to our family"". The prince, second in line to the throne after his father Charles, said he would miss the duke, who would have wanted the family ""to get on with the job"". He joined other members of the Royal Family walking in procession behind the Land Rover which carried the duke's coffin. The prince, who was 15 when his mother Diana died, is married to Catherine and they have three children. Kate Middleton became Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, after marrying Prince William in 2011. They have three children - George, Charlotte and Louis,  all under 10 years old. The duchess supports a number of charitable causes and organisations, several of which are centred around providing children with the best possible start in life. She is also a keen photographer and known for taking candid snaps of the Royal Family. Prince Harry said his grandfather was ""a man of service, honour and great humour"" and the ""legend of banter"". He joined other members of the Royal Family walking in procession behind the Land Rover which carried the duke's coffin. The funeral is the first time that Prince Harry has visited the UK since he and his wife Meghan stepped back from royal duties last March. Meghan is pregnant with their second child and remained at the couple's home in California, after being advised by her doctor not to travel. Peter Phillips is the Queen and Duke of Edinburghâs eldest grandchild. He is the son of Princess Anne and her first husband, Captain Mark Phillips. He joined other members of the Royal Family walking in procession behind the Land Rover which carried the duke's coffin. Mr Phillips married Canadian Autumn Kelly in 2008 and together they have two daughters, Savannah and Isla. Mr Phillips and his wife announced they were getting divorced in February 2020. Zara Tindall is the Princess Royal's daughter but, like her brother Peter Phillips, does not have a royal title, as they are descended from the female line. She followed her mother and father with a highly successful riding career - including winning a silver medal at the London 2012 Olympics. She married former England rugby player Mike Tindall in 2011 and the couple have three children. Their third child, born in March, is Lucas Philip Tindall. His middle name is reported to be a tribute to the duke and Mr Tindall's father Philip. Former England rugby player Mike Tindall joined the Royal Family when he married the Princess Royal's daughter Zara in 2011. Mr Tindall - who won the 2003 Rugby World Cup with England - does not hold a royal title and is not an HRH. He hosts a podcast about rugby. Mike and Zara Tindall have three children - two girls and a boy. Princess Beatrice is the elder daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York. Her full title is Her Royal Highness Princess Beatrice of York. She has no official surname, but uses the name York. She married property tycoon Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi at The Royal Chapel of All Saints at Royal Lodge, Windsor, in July 2020. Edoardo, an Italian property tycoon, married the duke's granddaughter Princess Beatrice at The Royal Chapel of All Saints at Royal Lodge, Windsor, in July 2020. He has a young son called Wolfie with Dara Huang, his ex-fiancee. Edoardo and Princess Beatrice are said to have started a relationship after her sister Princess Eugenie's wedding to Jack Brooksbank in October 2018. Princess Eugenie paid tribute to her grandfather on social media, saying how she remembered laughing at his jokes, and asking him about his ""spectacular life and service in the navy"". Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank's son, August, was born in February, the Queen and duke's ninth great-grandchild. His middle name is Philip, in honour of the duke. Princess Eugenie is the younger daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York. Her full title is Her Royal Highness Princess Eugenie of York and she is 10th in line to the throne. She married her long-term boyfriend Jack Brooksbank at St George's Chapel, Windsor, on 12 October 2018. Jack Brooksbank, who married Princess Eugenie in 2018, is a drinks executive for a tequila company. He met the princess through their mutual love of skiing, with friends introducing them while they were in Verbier, Switzerland. The couple have one child. Mr Brooksbank started working life in the hospitality industry, eventually becoming manager of a club which was often attended by Prince Harry and Princess Beatrice. After helping to launch a Mexican-themed pub in Chelsea, co-founded by Harry's friend Guy Pelly, he got a job as a brand ambassador for a tequila manufacturer. Lady Louise Windsor is the elder child of the Earl and Countess of Wessex. The couple decided to give their children ""courtesy"" titles as sons or daughters of an earl, rather than the style prince or princess. It is thought this decision was made to avoid some of the burdens of royal titles. Her brother is James, Viscount Severn. Viscount Severn is the younger child of the Earl and Countess of Wessex. The couple decided to give their children ""courtesy"" titles as sons or daughters of an earl, rather than the style prince or princess. It is thought this decision was made to avoid some of the burdens of royal titles. His sister is Lady Louise. Edward, Duke of Kent, is a first cousin of the Queen, through his father, while his mother was a cousin to Philip. The Duke of Kent is involved with over 140 different charities, organisations and professional bodies which cover a wide range of issues, from commemorating the war dead, to fostering the development of British technology and industry. Now in his 80s, Prince Edward regularly carries out royal duties on behalf of the Queen. He and his wife live in the grounds of Kensington Palace in the royal residence Wren House. Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester, is the youngest grandchild of King George V and Queen Mary. Now in his 70s, the duke is a full-time working member of the Royal Family, carrying out regular royal duties for his first cousin, the Queen. Princess Alexandra is a cousin of the Queen and was one of the bridesmaids at her wedding to Prince Philip. She is a working member of the Royal Family. She is patron or president of more than 100 organisations which reflect her wide-ranging interests, from the arts to health care. She also supports the Queen in her duties as Head of State, attending ceremonial occasions alongside other members of the Royal Family. Prince Bernhard is Prince Philip's great-nephew. His grandmother, Princess Theodora of Greece and Denmark, was the duke's second eldest sister. She married a German nobleman, Berthold, Margrave of Baden, who served as a German officer in World War Two. As such, the couple did not attend the duke's wedding in 1947. Prince Bernhard manages the family estates and the wineries in Germany. Prince Donatus represented the families of Prince Philip's two younger sisters, Sophie and Cecilie, who both married into the Hesse family. Princess Sophie spent time with the Queen and Prince Philip at Balmoral after their marriage, despite not being invited to the wedding because her husband was a German officer. Prince Philip's sister Cecilie was killed in a plane crash in 1937, along with members of her family. Her one surviving daughter died shortly afterwards of meningitis. Prince Donatus has often been a guest of the Queen and Prince Philip at the Windsor horse show. Prince Philipp is one of the Duke of Edinburgh's great-nephews from Germany -  he's the grandson of the duke's eldest sister, Princess Margarita. He issued a statement confirming his invitation to the funeral: ""It really is an incredible honour and we are all extremely touched and privileged to be included on behalf of the wider family"" . The duke used to be a frequent visitor to his great-nephew's family home at Langenburg Castle in Germany. All four of the duke's sisters married German princes. The husbands of three of them - Margarita, Theodora and Sophie - served as German officers in World War Two. As a result, they were not invited to his wedding in 1947. The Earl of Snowdon is the Queen's nephew. His mother was the Queen's sister Princess Margaret, who was married to photographer Antony Armstrong-Jones. The earl joined other members of the Royal Family walking in procession behind the Land Rover which carried the duke's coffin. Lady Mountbatten joined the Royal Family when she married Norton Knatchbull, Lord Romsey. His mother was the 2nd Countess Mountbatten of Burma, third cousin of the Queen. Prince Philip taught Lady Mountbatten to drive a carriage and she was a close friend of the royal couple for many years. She now runs the Broadlands estate in Hampshire, former home of Earl Mountbatten, where the Queen and Prince Philip spent their honeymoon. Lady Sarah Chatto is the Queen's only niece. Her parents were the late Princess Margaret, the Queen's sister, and Lord Snowdon. She was one of the bridesmaids at the wedding of Prince Charles and Princess Diana. The lesser-known royal is said to share a close relationship with the Queen and has accompanied her to her favourite hideaway, Craigowan Lodge in Aberdeenshire. Artist and former actor Daniel Chatto is married to the Queen's niece, Lady Sarah. The couple have two sons. They are reported to have met on a film set in India, where he had a small part in the film Heat and Dust. The procession to St George's Chapel for the funeral service was led by the band of the Grenadier Guards. The band was followed by the Major General's party and military chiefs of staff, including the Chief of the Defence Staff General Sir Nicholas Carter, and First Sea Lord Admiral Tony Radakin. Admiral Radakin paid tribute to the duke's naval career, saying: ""He was one of us."" In procession behind the specially adapted Land Rover carrying Prince Philip's coffin were Princes Charles, Andrew, Edward and Princess Anne, as well as grandsons Princes William and Harry. They were joined by Princess Anne's son Peter Phillips, her husband Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence and the Earl of Snowdon. Members of the duke's staff followed behind them, including his private secretary Brigadier Archie Miller Bakewell, a personal protection officer, two pages and two valets. The mourners wore masks and were spaced far apart at the Quire end of the chapel, in line with coronavirus restrictions. The Queen travelled to the service with her lady-in-waiting Susan Hussey but inside she sat on her own, close to the altar. Next to her in the same row was Prince Andrew and directly opposite, across the Quire, sat Prince Charles with Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. The Dean of Windsor, David Conner, conducted the funeral service and gave the commendation as the coffin was lowered into the royal vault. Others attending included a small choir of four singers. The choir, who were in the nave of the chapel, sang pieces of music chosen by the duke. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, gave the blessing at the end of the service.

"Government departments have been ordered to find out by the end of the week whether senior officials have rule-breaking second jobs. Cabinet Secretary Simon Case has asked colleagues to declare paid roles or outside interests that ""might conflict"" with Civil Service rules. The move comes after it emerged a top official joined a financial firm while still working for the government. Bill Crothers says his recruitment by Greensill Capital was ""transparent"". Letters to an appointments watchdogpublished on Tuesday,externalrevealed his part-time role as an adviser at the firm had been signed off by the Cabinet Office. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson told MPs on Wednesday it was ""not clear"" that ""boundaries have been properly understood"". Labour has described Mr Crothers' dual employment, which happened in 2015, as ""extraordinary and shocking"". Top civil servant 'joined Greensill before quitting' What's the Greensill lobbying row about? Tories reject Labour plan for MP-led lobbying probe Mr Crothers had been the government's chief procurement officer prior to being taken on by Greensill, which has since collapsed. Revelations about the firm's attempts to influence government have led to Mr Johnson launching a lawyer-led review into its access to ministers and civil servants. Labour argues a special House of Commons committee should investigate instead - but the government rejects this, andvoted down the planon Wednesday. In a letter to senior officials, seen by the BBC, Mr Case - the UK's top civil servant - said there were issues of ""acute concern"" over recruitment. He said the need to give civil servants the chance to gain experience life outside Whitehall has been ""recognised for many decades by successive governments"". ""But this must only be done in a way which can maintain the integrity and impartiality of the Civil Service,"" he wrote. He added: ""In particular, there needs to be transparency and full and proper management of any outside interests."" Mr Case ordered colleagues to declare by the end of the week if they ""come across"" instances of senior civil servants with second jobs or outside interests ""which might conflict with their obligations under the [Civil Service] Code"". This sets outs the rules on ""honesty"", ""integrity"", ""objectivity"" and ""impartiality"". Simon Case became head of the civil service in September 2020 Mr Crothers joined Greensill as an adviser to its board in September 2015, while he remained a Civil Service employee. Letters to the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba) watchdog published on Tuesday show the move was approved by the Cabinet Office under its internal conflicts of interest policy. Mr Crothers later went on to join the company as a director in late 2016, after leaving government in November 2015. In a letter to Acoba's chairman, Lord Pickles, Mr Crothers wrote: ""I am concerned that there may be a view that I did not follow proper process regarding my role with Greensill Capital. ""I assure you that I completely respect the required process and your office, took steps to comply, and believe that I did so."" He adds: ""I was transparent about the move to Greensill Capital, and it was well known at the time."" But in a letter to the current head of the Cabinet Office, Lord Pickles said there had been a ""lack of transparency"" about the process - and called for more details. Concerns about Greensill's access to government were sparked by revelations last month that former Prime Minister David Cameron had lobbied on behalf of the company after leaving office. His efforts involvedtexting Chancellor Rishi Sunakand contacting other ministers about a government-backed Covid loan scheme on behalf of the firm. Along with the company's founder, Lex Greensill, Mr Cameron also met Health Secretary Matt Hancock for a ""private drink"" in 2019 todiscuss a new payment scheme for NHS staff. The former prime minister began working as an adviser to the company in August 2018, two years after leaving Downing Street in July 2016. Mr Cameron has said he did not break any codes of conduct or rules on lobbying, and welcomes the government's review. On Wednesday, the Commons Treasury select committee said it planned to launch an inquiry into the ""lessons"" from Greensill Capital's demise. Other parliamentary committees are reportedly considering bids to invite the former prime minister to give evidence. A spokesman for Mr Cameron said he would ""respond positively"" to such requests ""when the terms of reference of each inquiry are clear"". What's the David Cameron lobbying row about?

"In public, Prince Philip always took second place He outlived nearly everyone who knew him and might explain him. And so we have been left with a two-dimensional portrait of the duke; salt-tongued and short-tempered, a man who told off-colour jokes and made politically incorrect remarks, an eccentric great-uncle who'd been around forever and towards whom most people felt affection - but who rather too often embarrassed himself and others in company. With his death will come reassessment. Because Prince Philip was an extraordinary man who lived an extraordinary life; a life intimately connected with the sweeping changes of our turbulent 20th Century, a life of fascinating contrast and contradiction, of service and some degree of solitude. A complex, clever, eternally restless man. His mother and father met at the funeral of Queen Victoria in 1901. At a time when all but four of Europe's nations were monarchies, his relatives were scattered through European royalty. Some royal houses were swept away by World War One; but the world into which Philip was born was still one where monarchies were the norm. His grandfather was the King of Greece; his great-aunt Ella was murdered along with the Russian tsar, by the Bolsheviks, at Ekaterinberg; his mother was a great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria. His four older sisters would all marry Germans. While Philip fought for Britain in the Royal Navy, three of his sisters actively supported the Nazi cause; none would be invited to his wedding. When peace came, and with it eventual economic recovery, Philip would throw himself into the construction of a better Britain, urging the country to adopt scientific methods, embracing the ideas of industrial design, planning, education and training. A decade before Harold Wilson talked of the ""white heat of the technological revolution"", Philip was urging modernity on the nation in speeches and interviews.  And as the country and the world became richer and consumed ever more, Philip warned of the impact on the environment, well before it was even vaguely fashionable. Eighteen months after his birth, his family was in exile His childhood quickly taught him the values of self-reliance He was forged by the turmoil of his first decade and then moulded by his schooling. His early years were spent wandering, as his place of birth ejected him, his family disintegrated and he moved from country to country, none of them ever his own. When he was just a year old, he and his family were scooped up by a British destroyer from his home on the Greek island of Corfu after his father had been condemned to death. They were deposited in Italy.  One of Philip's first international journeys was spent crawling around on the floor of the train from an Italian port city, ""the grubby child on the desolate train pulling out of the Brindisi night,"" as his sister Sophia later described it. In Paris, he lived in a house borrowed from a relative; but it was not destined to become a home. In just one year, while he was at boarding school in Britain, the mental health of his mother, Princess Alice, deteriorated and she went into an asylum; his father, Prince Andrew, went off to Monte Carlo to live with his mistress; and his four sisters married and went to live in Germany.  In the space of 10 years he had gone from a prince of Greece to a wandering, homeless, and virtually penniless boy with no-one to care for him. ""I don't think anybody thinks I had a father,"" he once said. Andrew would die during the war. Philip went to Monte Carlo to pick up his father's possessions after the Germans had been driven from France; there was almost nothing left, just a couple of clothes brushes and some cuff-links. By the time he went to Gordonstoun, a private school on the north coast of Scotland, Philip was tough, independent and able to fend for himself; he'd had to be. Gordonstoun would channel those traits into the school's distinct philosophy of community service, teamwork, responsibility and respect for the individual.  And it sparked one of the great passions of Philip's life - his love of the sea. Philip adored the school as much as his son Charles would despise it.  Not just because the stress it put on physical as well as mental excellence - he was a great sportsman.  But because of its ethos, laid down by its founder Kurt Hahn, an exile from Nazi Germany. Prince Philip became one of the youngest first lieutenants in the Royal Navy But he had to give up his career to support the Queen The Duke of Edinburgh's children would not bear his name, Mountbatten That ethos became a significant, perhapsthesignificant, part of the way that Philip believed life should be lived. It shines through the speeches he gave later in his life. ""The essence of freedom,"" he would say in Ghana in 1958, ""is discipline and self-control."" The comforts of the post-war era, he told the British Schools Exploring Society a year earlier, may be important ""but it is much more important that the human spirit should not be stifled by easy living"". And two years before that, he spoke to the boys of Ipswich School of the moral as well as material imperatives of life, with the ""importance of the individual"" as the ""guiding principle of our society"". And at Gordonstoun was born one of the great contradictions of Philip's fascinating life. The importance of the individual was what in Kurt Hahn's eyes differentiated Britain and liberal democracies from the kind of totalitarian dictatorship that he had fled. Philip put that centrality of the individual, and individual agency - the ability we have as humans to make our own moral and ethical decisions - at the heart of his philosophy. And yet he was throughout his life, first in the navy and then in the many decades of life in the Palace, tightly bound by rules of tradition, of precedent, of command and hierarchy. He had little, if anything, in the way of agency. Did he say one thing and do another, as members of the Royal Family are often accused of? Or was his first choice - to serve - by necessity his last? The navy ran deep in the Duke of Edinburgh's family. He is pictured sitting at the wheel of the nuclear-powered submarine HMS Churchill Prince Philip gave between 60 and 80 speeches every year, decade after decade, on topics that reflected his vast range of interests At Dartmouth Naval College in 1939, the two great passions of his life would collide. He had learned to sail at Gordonstoun; he would learn to lead at Dartmouth. And his driving desire to achieve, and to win, would shine through. Despite entering the college far later than most other cadets, he would graduate top of his class in 1940. In further training at Portsmouth, he gained the top grade in four out of five sections of the exam. He became one of the youngest first lieutenants in the Royal Navy. The navy ran deep in his family. His maternal grandfather had been the First Sea Lord, the commander of the Royal Navy; his uncle, ""Dickie"" Mountbatten, had command of a destroyer while Philip was in training. In war, he showed not only bravery but guile. It was his natural milieu. ""Prince Philip"", wrote Gordonstoun headmaster Kurt Hahn admiringly, ""will make his mark in any profession where he will have to prove himself in a trial of strength"". Others had their reservations about the brilliant and ambitious young officer. In peace, once he had his own command, he drove his men hard, much too hard for some.  ""If he had a fault, it was a tendency to intolerance,"" wrote one biographer.  That kind of comment would recur. Contemporaries were more blunt. ""One of his crew,"" writes another biographer, ""said he would rather die than serve under him again."" In Dartmouth in 1939, as war became ever more certain, the navy was his destiny.  He had fallen in love with the sea itself. ""It is an extraordinary master or mistress,"" he would say later, ""it has such extraordinary moods.""  But a rival to the sea would come. When King George VI toured the Naval College, accompanied by Philip's uncle, he brought with him his daughter, Princess Elizabeth. Philip was asked to look after her. He showed off to her, vaulting the nets of the tennis court in the grounds of the college. He was confident, outgoing, strikingly handsome, of royal blood if without a throne.  She was beautiful, a little sheltered, a little serious, and very smitten by Philip. Prince Philip with his uncle, Earl Mountbatten, at the Royal Marines Barracks in 1965 The Queen, with one of the Royal corgis, chats with polo-playing Prince Philip at Windsor Great Park Their engagement was announced in July 1947 Did he know then that this was a collision of two great passions? That he could not have the sea and the beautiful young woman? For a time after their wedding in 1948, he did have both. As young newlyweds in Malta, he had what he so prized - command of a ship -  and they had two idyllic years together. But the illness and then early death of King George VI brought it all to an end. He knew what it meant, the moment he was told.  Up in a lodge in Kenya, touring Africa, with Princess Elizabeth in place of the King, Philip was told first of the monarch's death. He looked, said his equerry Mike Parker, ""as if a tonne of bricks had fallen on him"". For some time he sat, slumped in a chair, a newspaper covering his head and chest. His princess had become the Queen.  His world had changed irrevocably. For someone who almost never displayed anything close to self-pity, and rarely spoke of his own emotions, he was by his own standards candid about the loss of his naval calling. ""There's never been 'if only',"" he said once, ""except perhaps that I regret not having been able to continue a career in the navy"". Those who knew the man and his passions are blunter.  The former First Sea Lord, Admiral Lord West, says Philip did his duty; but of the end of his time in the navy he says, ""I know it was a huge loss to him.  I know it."" That moment, when princess became Queen, revealed another great contradiction of Philip's life. He was born and brought up in a world almost entirely run by men.  He was a rugged, physical man who was brought up and then worked in an entirely male environment. He celebrated masculinity, telling Mike Parker on the birth of his first son Charles, ""It takes a man to have a boy."" But literally overnight, and for 65 years to follow, it became his life to support his wife, the Queen. He would walk behind her. He would give up his job for her. He would apologise if he came into a room after her. At her coronation he knelt before her, his hands enclosed by hers, and swore to be her ""liege man of life and limb"". His children would not bear his name, Mountbatten. ""I'm nothing but a bloody amoeba,"" he exclaimed at that. But there was nothing to be done. She was the Queen. He was her husband. Prince Philip talked of the upending of circumstance little. ""Within the house,"" he said of the time before the Queen's accession, ""I suppose I naturally filled the principal position. People used to come and ask me what to do.  In 1952 the whole thing changed very, very considerably."" Prince Philip had hundreds of patronages and projects with a focus on youth, science, the outdoors and sport Prince Philip helped sustain the monarchy The transition to life in the Palace was brutal. ""Philip,"" said his equerry, ""was constantly being squashed, snubbed, ticked off, rapped over the knuckles... I felt Philip did not have any friends or helpers."" Philip may not have helped himself; one biographer writes that in the early years Palace staff felt he was ""difficult to deal with... prickly... arrogant... defensive"". He was looked upon with suspicion by some in the court, as something of an adventurer, as perhaps a fortune hunter.  He had German blood, and this was just after the herculean effort of defeating Nazi Germany. In response, Philip began what would become a lifetime of near-ceaseless activity; abroad he was at the side of the Queen on the long tours they undertook, sometimes breaking off to pursue interests particular to him - sporting, industrial or research. She nearly always travelled with him as her companion; but he also travelled alone.  It was he, not she, that made the farewells to colonial possessions in the 1950s and 1960s. At home there were patronages and projects, hundreds upon hundreds of them, with a focus on youth, science, the outdoors and sport. He played cricket, squash, polo; he swam, sailed, rowed and rode horses and carriage drove. He learnt to fly, and developed his own photographs. Within the Palace he was a moderniser, striding the corridors, rootling around the cellars, trying to find out what everyone did. He took over the management of the estate at Sandringham and over the years significantly redeveloped it. ""He believes he has a creative mission,"" wrote an early biographer, ""to present the monarchy as a dynamic, involved and responsive institution that will address itself to some of the problems of contemporary British society."" He was young and very good looking; he smiled and joked and was at ease in front of the cameras. When he visited a boys' club in London in the late 1950s, a photo shows him with a broad smile on his face, looking crisp in a double-breasted pinstripe suit, his hair slicked back with brilliantine, surrounded by the upturned faces of boys and their mothers all shoving and trying to get close to him. There is more than a whiff of Beatlemania to the moment. In his study on the first floor of Buckingham Palace, overlooking the gardens and Green Park, surrounded by thousands of books, with a model of his first command HMS Magpie to one side, he would research and write and type out his speeches. (In 1986 he would buy, always the moderniser, what he called a ""splendid gadget"" that he called ""a miniature word processor"".) He gave between 60 and 80 speeches every year, decade after decade, on topics that reflected his vast range of interests. Out of the speeches comes a picture of the man.  For someone who sat through so much of it, he was clearly impatient with ceremony. ""A lot of time and energy,"" he told students and staff at the Chesterfield College of Technology, ""has been spent on arranging for you to listen to me to take a long time to declare open a building which everyone knows is open already."" Reflecting his dizzying range of interests, there was sometimes a touch of the gentleman-farmer to his thoughts - well-organised arguments that don't really go anywhere, a lot of anecdotal evidence (""it seems to me..."") garnered from his extensive travels. Despite modernising instincts, he was a conservative, somewhat suspicious of the machinations of the big city. He spoke of ""urban dwellers"" and of the ""average citizen"" dumping rubbish from their car. He preferred practical solutions to highfalutin theory - ""The enterprise is doomed,"" he told the Commonwealth Conference on Industrial Relations, ""if it is allowed to enter the rarefied atmosphere of theory."" He was an environmentalist before anyone really knew what that was. He warned of the ""greedy and senseless exploitation of nature."" And in 1982 he brought up a topic that now grips us, but back then was almost never spoken of, ""a hotly-debated issue directly attributable to the development of industry... the build-up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,"" which he referred to as the ""greenhouse effect"". His relationship with his eldest son improved in later years And he constantly did himself down, shrugging as to why anyone should want to hear him speak: ""I have very little experience of self-government,"" he told one audience, ""I am one of the most governed people you could meet...."" His example of irrational behaviour? - ""making and listening to speeches on important occasions"". Or speaking before the Brussels Expo in 1958 - ""I feel I can claim to be an expert at going round exhibitions."" He knew most speeches were a dull formality that had to be got through - and he was happy to let his audience have a laugh at his expense. It is another contradiction in a life of them; that someone who cared so much about how we live our lives, about how to pursue a good and moral life, about how government and society might try to channel our instincts, should end up being popularly portrayed as a saloon-bar bore, his retirement from public life in 2017 accompanied by lists of his ""gaffes"", off-colour comments and salty jokes. That he could be rude, startlingly so at times, there is no doubt. Part of it was impatience, that dynamo whirring away, the desire to get things done double-quick. Part of it may have been deafness, inherited from his almost wholly deaf mother. But part of it was just plain bad manners, a disregard for what others felt and a thoughtlessness that came from position and temperament. There was for a long time a fair amount of barking and shouting at those who failed to please him, and not a lot of thanking those that did. Looking back down the decades, two great contrasts stand out. The first, that between a life led in the public eye, and a really quite private man. The boy shuttling between guardians and schools and countries quickly learnt to seal off his private side from public view. Inside the Palace it became his world view. Most of his biographers' personal queries were met with a shrug, as if to say ""I don't know why you are bothering"". He once said of his son Charles: ""He is a romantic, I am a pragmatist. And because I don't see things as a romantic would, I'm [perceived as] unfeeling."" There can be little doubt that he was stung by the accusation. But his inner thoughts were not for public consumption. And the second great, related, contrast is that between the near unceasing whirl of his public life, and a degree of solitude in his private. Of course there was family, though all his sisters pre-deceased him. But few, if any, great friendships are recorded, a corollary of his private nature and the pattern of his many decades. ""Life,"" wrote one biographer, ""hasn't enabled him to build up friendships. He is going round the world at such a lick."" And royalty is its own curious cage, repelling outsiders. ""What the royal family offers you is friendliness,"" said the late James Callaghan, prime minister in the 1970s, ""not friendship."" Obituary: HRH the Duke of Edinburgh Who he was, what he did and why he mattered Prince Philip: A life in pictures Duke of Edinburgh: A life in London Major General Charles Stickland of the Royal Marines, of which for 64 years Philip was Captain General, tells of when the duke flew into an exercise in Norway. He was supposed to say a quick hello to the enlisted men and then have lunch with the commanding officer. Instead he ""asked two of the corporals to spoon food into his mess tin, sat on a Bergan [rucksack], told stories and chatted away with my troops when he was supposed to be having a posh lunch and then got back on the helicopter, having inspired a group of young men as to why it was great to be a Royal Marine"". It was vintage Philip; no ceremony, hierarchy pushed to one side, the big group over the more intimate gathering. Because of his desire for privacy, because of his position, and because nearly all who knew him best have gone, our understanding of him will always be incomplete. But that's also because of what kind of person he was, because of the contradictions and contrasts that emerged over the decades. ""A mercurial man like His Royal Highness,"" said the artist and architect Sir Hugh Casson, ""needs a loose fit portrait."" He was asked once what his life had been about (the sort of question that normally received an incredulous snort). Had it been about supporting the Queen? ""Absolutely, absolutely,"" he replied. He didn't see himself as a leader, though lead he could. And his own achievements he consistently played down. Accepting the Freedom of the City of London in 1948, he spoke for himself and for what he called other ""followers"", with trademark modesty. ""Our only distinction,"" he said, ""was that we did what we were told to do, to the very best of our ability, and kept on doing it."" The Royal family Â© 2025 BBC.

"Around 4.7 million people were waiting for routine operations and procedures in England in February - the most since 2007, NHS England figures show. Nearly 388,000 people were waiting more than a year for non-urgent surgery compared with just 1,600 before the pandemic began. During January and February, the pressure on hospitals caused by Covid-19 was particularly acute. NHS England said two million operations took place despite the winter peak. However, surgeons said hospitals were still under huge pressure due to the second wave of Covid, which had led to ""a year of uncertainty, pain and isolation"" for patients waiting for planned treatment. Speaking on a visit to Dartmouth, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the government would ""make sure that we give the NHS all the funding that it needs... to beat the backlog"". He said the situation had been ""made worse by Covid"", and added: ""We do need people to take up their appointments and to get the treatment that they need.""

Around 40% of all patients who have received hospital treatment for Covid since the pandemic began were admitted in the first two months of the year. But he said ""the hard work and dedication of staff"" helped to deliver almost two million operations and procedures ""in the face of the winter wave"". Tim Mitchell, vice-president of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said: ""Although the most urgent operations, for cancer and life-threatening conditions went ahead, hundreds of thousands of patients waiting for routine surgery such as hip and knee operations, cochlear implants and vascular operations had their treatment cancelled or postponed. ""People have been patient as they've seen the battering the pandemic has given the NHS, but how much longer can they be expected to wait?"" Surgeons are calling for massive investment in the health service so that vital operations can continue no matter what comes its way in the future.  4.7 millionPeople waiting for routine operations and procedures in February - highest since records began in 2007 387,885People waiting more than 52 weeks to start hospital treatment in February 304,000People waiting more than 52 weeks to start hospital treatment the previous month 1,613People waiting more than 52 weeks to start hospital treatment in February last year 400,000Patients with Covid-19 needing hospital treatment over the last year Zen Khan had an operation on his pancreas postponed three times Zen Kahn, from London, spent much of the past year in pain waiting for a vital, but not urgent, operation to remove a mass on his pancreas. The 23-year-old, who has severe learning difficulties and mental health issues, was originally told he would have surgery in September 2020 - but in the end he waited until March 2021. ""He was losing weight, turning yellow, and getting weaker and weaker,"" his older brother Waqas says of that time. Zen continued to be in pain and was on strong painkillers for a long time. ""It definitely affected my mum a lot - she was completely devastated,"" his brother says. ""Just to see him deteriorate daily, it was hard on us as a family."" Dr Katie Urch, divisional director of surgery at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, where Zen was treated, said surgery that was ""absolutely time-critical"" was prioritised. ""As our services begin to resume, our clinical teams are constantly reviewing our waiting lists to ensure we're managing care as safely and effectively as possible,"" she said. Zen finally had surgery at the end of March The full scale of the backlog of non-Covid work which has built up because hospitals had to focus on coronavirus patients has been laid bare again. Things are likely to get worse before they get better as the NHS tries to deal with new patients being referred for treatment as well as those already on waiting lists. There is no obvious quick fix. The workforce is already over-stretched and training more staff takes years. The government has allocated some extra cash to the NHS in England to try to help deal with the backlog. But there have been calls for significant extra investment to fund overtime payments and make maximum seven-days-a-week use of operating theatres. There have been warnings that the NHS in all parts of the UK will take years to recover from the consequences of Covid care and longer-term plans to expand the workforce and build new hospital facilities will be needed soon.

"The distinctive ""Jenners"" is normally seen at the top of the department store building The owner of Edinburgh's Jenners building has begun an investigation after signs bearing its name were removed from the landmark shop. Witnesses spotted the distinctive gold-coloured lettering being taken down on Wednesday. A spokesman for the Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen, who owns the listed building, said they were ""very surprised"" the signs had been removed. Frasers Group, which operates the store, has been asked for comment. City of Edinburgh Council said it was also investigating whether the removal of the signs was a breach of planning rules ""given the historical significance of the building"". ""We'll take action if appropriate,"" Neil Gardiner, the planning convener added. The signs had been removed when this photograph was taken on Thursday The Jenners building has occupied a prime location on Princes Street for 183 years. It was bought by Mr Povlsen - who is one of Scotland's biggest landowners - in 2017, reportedly for Â£53m. The store is currently operated by the Mike Ashley's Frasers Group, which owns the commercial rights to the Jenners trading name. It said it would be quitting the site in May after the two sides were unable to come to an agreement. Frasers Group includes Sports Direct, House of Fraser and Evans Cycles. Anders Krogh Vogdrup - the director of AAA United, which owns the Jenners building - told BBC Scotland: ""We are very surprised seeing the signage being taken down. We are convinced that the signage is part of the listed building. ""We have not discussed any such step with Sports Direct, and certainly not given any authorisation to do so. We will look in to this matter, contacting Sports Direct. ""We can only once again emphasise that the Jenners building of Edinburgh is an institution and, despite the changing face of retail, it is our aspiration that there will continue to be a retail store for as long as we are its stewards. ""Our involvement in the Jenners building, is first and foremost about helping to preserve a unique historic building in Edinburgh. Already when we acquired the building, we knew that it came with a great deal of responsibility. ""Jenners is an iconic building in Edinburgh, and we take the responsibility very seriously. "" The building owner is currently in advanced talks with a new tenant to move into the department store.

"Zeebrugge: Channel ports have new measures for handling UK freight Two key European Parliament committees have overwhelmingly approved the UK's post-Brexit trade deal with the EU, bringing its ratification closer. The wide-ranging EU-UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement was clinched on 24 December. It is in force provisionally. The EU still has concerns about the way the UK is implementing the separate protocol for Northern Ireland. MEPs are yet to vote on the trade deal in a full session. The deadline for that is the end of this month. There were 108 votes in favour, one against and four abstentions in the parliament's trade and foreign affairs committees. There was relief on both sides when the deal was finally struck before Christmas, because a no-deal scenario on 1 January would have meant the imposition of many tariffs (import taxes) and quotas under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. Even with the deal, Brexit has brought extra paperwork and other administrative costs for UK and EU businesses. But without the deal the costs would have been greater, along with disruption to transport and various other EU-UK links. This video can not be played Is the point-scoring coming to an end - or have we only seen the first half of this grudge match? The EU is in a legal row with the UK because the UK government unilaterally extended a series of ""grace periods"" to ease trade between Britain and Northern Ireland. Under the protocol, new EU checks are to be imposed on that trade, but the UK's move has delayed them. Why are there Brexit checks in Northern Ireland? The controversial protocol, which followed years of legal wrangling, is designed to keep Northern Ireland inside the EU's single market for goods. But as Britain is now outside, various bureaucratic hurdles have arisen. And that has fuelled political tensions. The protocol is seen as a factor in the recent street clashes in Belfast. The different rules are aimed at maintaining an open border - and smooth trade - between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which remains in the EU. The key points of the deal What does the deal mean for fishing? How your Europe holidays will change The threat of non-ratification is still there. EU governments approved the deal, but MEPs still have to ratify it, otherwise no-deal becomes reality. Austrian MEP Andreas Schieder gave a mixed message. He said the deal would ""bind the UK to our current high labour and environmental standards"", but warned that ""all progress could be lost if the UK continues to unilaterally breach the Withdrawal Agreement and the protocol on Northern Ireland"". The BBC's Kevin Connolly in Brussels says the parliament's threat is the only real tool for applying pressure on the UK - but now ratification looks more likely. UK Brexit Minister Lord Frost is to hold talks over dinner in Brussels shortly with EU Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic, in a further bid to resolve the protocol dispute.

Join us tomorrow for more live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. Today's updates have been brought to you by Emma Harrison, Vanessa Barford, Jen Meierhans, Mary O'Connor and Hazel Shearing. Here's a reminder of some of today's coronavirus news from around the world: Here's a recap of today's coronavirus developments in the UK:  There have been almost 4.4 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 127,000 people have died within 28 days of a positive test, the latest government figures show. More than 32 million people in the UK have now had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine. Find out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average withour postcode look-up tool. The vaccination rate for staff at older adult care homes is below the level recommended by scientists advising the government in more than half of England's local authorities, figures show. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) says 80% of care home staff and 90% of residents need to be vaccinated to provide a minimum level of protection against Covid-19 outbreaks. Figures just published by NHS England show that 86 out of 149 local authorities have not reached this threshold for employees. In 22 areas less than 70% of staff have had a first jab. Lambeth in south London had the lowest uptake at 50.1%. The figures suggest more than 96,000 eligible staff have not received a vaccine. It could be mandatory for care home staff in England to get a jab in new plans under consultation by the government.

Since the start of the year, only students on hands-on courses have been allowed in-person teaching. Universities Minister Michelle Donelan said it was a ""cautious approach"" to the easing of restrictions.

Read more about the new indicative dates here. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was ""glad"" she had the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine, amid concerns about rare cases of blood clots. ""There have been concerns raised and I said that I'm confident it's safe, but now I'm not just saying that, I've also had the AstraZeneca vaccine,"" she said. Ms Sturgeon praised the ""well-oiled machine"" at the SSE Hydro in Glasgow and urged others to get vaccinated when they are invited. ""I guess like many people I felt quite emotional because it's so important this vaccination programme in helping us all get back to normal,"" she said. Covid travel restrictions around Scotland are due to be eased on Friday, earlier than expected, but there will bea much more significant relaxation in the rules from 26 April. Will RossAfrica editor, BBC World Service Some African nations will need to increase health spending by 50% to vaccinate 60% of their populations, the IMF says The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that more than 30 million people in sub-Saharan Africa are being pushed into poverty by the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. It has called on wealthier nations to help African countries get better access to vaccines. The IMF estimates that some African countries - aiming to vaccinate 60% of their populations - will need to increase their health spending by 50%. Last year, economies in sub-Saharan Africa contracted by almost 2% - the worst year on record. The lockdowns have hurt
businesses from market-stall holders to tourist resorts and multinationals. Having a young population seems
to have helped protect the continent from the coronavirus. But with Africa's population
growing so fast, vast numbers of young people need work. So the lockdowns need to end as
soon as possible and the vaccines need to be rolled out quickly to reduce the economic
impact across the continent. The IMF estimates that they will recover this year with a growth spurt of 3.4%, although all other regions in the world are expected to experience greater economic growth. Benefit Cosmetics hasbacktracked on a policythat reportedly saw NHS workers turned away for beauty treatments. A nurse wrote on Facebook that NHS staff were being refused ""on the basis that [they] work with Covid patients."" Responding to the healthcare worker's post, Benefit Cosmetics wrote earlier in the week that it was a ""blanket policy"" to refuse service to anyone who has been in contact ""with anyone suspected of Covid or having its symptoms"". It said this was needed to ""protect staff and other customers"". But social media users lashed out on the brand's pages, with some calling for a boycott. The beauty brand is now allowing NHS workers to receive eyebrow and eyelash treatments if they were wearing medical grade personal protective equipment (PPE) when in contact with coronavirus patients and no-one else in their household has recently had Covid or shown symptoms. All customers will be asked a series of ""screening questions"", which have now been updated, on arrival for their appointments. A spokeswoman for the firm said it had updated its policy, and regrets ""any hurt or upset caused"". She added: ""We would like to stress that this is in no way to discriminate against our hard working NHS, who we love dearly. Like all processes in action, ours were being tweaked and have now been updated."" Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, China Media Analyst Today, both Hong Kong and Taiwan have expanded their

But there will be a much more significant relaxation in the rules from 26 April, when those parts of Scotland currently under Covid protectionlevel four,externalrules are moved into tolevel three,external. This will mean:  But how ready is Scotland to unlock restrictions? The BBC's Christopher Sleightexplains five things to know about the state of the pandemic. Northern Ireland's ministers have agreed that indoor hospitality venues, including pubs and hotels, will reopen on 24 May. It is understood unlicensed and licensed premises such as restaurants, beer gardens, coffee shops and cafes can open outdoors on 30 April. We will bring you more updates as we have them. With lockdown restrictions easing in England, visits to care homes are now possible for families.

There were also 2,672 new infections. Jose TembeBBC News, Maputo Those wishing to travel are finding it costly to get Covid tests Four suspected members of a counterfeit ring producing fake Covid-19 negative certificates
have been arrested, the authorities say. The gangâs operations centred around the Ressano Garcia border post where people need negative Covid-19
results to travel to neighbouring South Africa, Mozambiqueâs National Criminal Investigation
Service (Sernic) said. Two suspects were arrested
in mid-March and the others on Monday in the capital, Maputo, Sernic spokesperson
Hilario Lole said. Three of those arrested were government health
workers - another was someone who touted their services, he said. The gang charged between $50 (Â£36) and $60 for each ""test"" with a guaranteed negative
result. It is not easy to get a free Covid-19 test
at government-run hospitals for the purposes of travel - and private clinics tend to
charge around $100 for a test. Many Mozambicans travel to South Africa for work or to buy goods to resell back home. Thousands of people are dying every day in Brazil with Covid-19 Brazil's ""failed Covid-19 response"" is driving the country to a ""humanitarian catastrophe"", the international charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) has said. The country has seen a sharp rise in cases and deaths in recent weeks, fuelled by more transmissible variants of the virus and a lack of co-ordinated national measures. President Jair Bolsonaro has strongly opposed imposing a lockdown, despite growing calls from health experts, and criticised state governors and mayors for announcing local restrictions. ""The federal government has all but refused to adopt evidence-based comprehensive public health guidelines, leaving Brazil's dedicated medical staff to manage the sickest in intensive care units and improvise solutions when beds are unavailable,"" MSF's international president Dr Christos Christou said in a statement. ""This has put Brazil into a permanent state of mourning and led to the near collapse of Brazil's health system."" The virus continues to circulate across the country and the situation is unlikely to improve in April as some states and cities are already easing restrictions, according to the health institute Fiocruz. Patients with Covid-19 are occupying more than 90% of intensive care beds in most states, Fiocruz said, while some parts of the country have reported short supplies of oxygen and anaesthetics needed to help patients with serious complications. The country recorded 73,513 new cases and 3,459 deaths in 24 hours on Wednesday, according to the health ministry. As the pandemic rages, hundreds of babies and young children have died,as our colleagues Nathalia Passarinho and Luis Barrucho from BBC Brasil report. Irish government ministers have insisted that the Republic is on course to continue a cautious reopening of society in May and to meet its end of June vaccination target. Taoiseach (Irish PM) MÃ­cheÃ¡l Martin has said he expects 80% of the adult population to be offered or to have had a first dose by the end of June and around 55% to be fully vaccinated. He has estimated that the Republic's vaccination programme is about a month behind Northern Ireland's. The Republic has been described as having the longest lockdown in the world.

More than 32 million people in the UK have now had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine. Find out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average withour postcode look-up tool. The vaccination rate for staff at older adult care homes is below the level recommended by scientists advising the government in more than half of England's local authorities, figures show. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) says 80% of care home staff and 90% of residents need to be vaccinated to provide a minimum level of protection against Covid-19 outbreaks. Figures just published by NHS England show that 86 out of 149 local authorities have not reached this threshold for employees. In 22 areas less than 70% of staff have had a first jab. Lambeth in south London had the lowest uptake at 50.1%. The figures suggest more than 96,000 eligible staff have not received a vaccine. It could be mandatory for care home staff in England to get a jab in new plans under consultation by the government.

Since the start of the year, only students on hands-on courses have been allowed in-person teaching. Universities Minister Michelle Donelan said it was a ""cautious approach"" to the easing of restrictions. The University of the West of England's vice chancellor, Steve West, said it was a ""crushing decision for our students"". ""I still have a difficulty in understanding the evidence base upon which it's OK to have half but not all students,"" he says. Read more reactionhere.

Read more about the new indicative dates here. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was ""glad"" she had the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine, amid concerns about rare cases of blood clots. ""There have been concerns raised and I said that I'm confident it's safe, but now I'm not just saying that, I've also had the AstraZeneca vaccine,"" she said. Ms Sturgeon praised the ""well-oiled machine"" at the SSE Hydro in Glasgow and urged others to get vaccinated when they are invited. ""I guess like many people I felt quite emotional because it's so important this vaccination programme in helping us all get back to normal,"" she said. Covid travel restrictions around Scotland are due to be eased on Friday, earlier than expected, but there will bea much more significant relaxation in the rules from 26 April. Will RossAfrica editor, BBC World Service Some African nations will need to increase health spending by 50% to vaccinate 60% of their populations, the IMF says The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that more than 30 million people in sub-Saharan Africa are being pushed into poverty by the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. It has called on wealthier nations to help African countries get better access to vaccines. The IMF estimates that some African countries - aiming to vaccinate 60% of their populations - will need to increase their health spending by 50%. Last year, economies in sub-Saharan Africa contracted by almost 2% - the worst year on record. The lockdowns have hurt
businesses from market-stall holders to tourist resorts and multinationals. Having a young population seems
to have helped protect the continent from the coronavirus. But with Africa's population
growing so fast, vast numbers of young people need work. So the lockdowns need to end as
soon as possible and the vaccines need to be rolled out quickly to reduce the economic
impact across the continent. The IMF estimates that they will recover this year with a growth spurt of 3.4%, although all other regions in the world are expected to experience greater economic growth. Benefit Cosmetics hasbacktracked on a policythat reportedly saw NHS workers turned away for beauty treatments. A nurse wrote on Facebook that NHS staff were being refused ""on the basis that [they] work with Covid patients."" Responding to the healthcare worker's post, Benefit Cosmetics wrote earlier in the week that it was a ""blanket policy"" to refuse service to anyone who has been in contact ""with anyone suspected of Covid or having its symptoms"". It said this was needed to ""protect staff and other customers"". But social media users lashed out on the brand's pages, with some calling for a boycott. The beauty brand is now allowing NHS workers to receive eyebrow and eyelash treatments if they were wearing medical grade personal protective equipment (PPE) when in contact with coronavirus patients and no-one else in their household has recently had Covid or shown symptoms. All customers will be asked a series of ""screening questions"", which have now been updated, on arrival for their appointments. A spokeswoman for the firm said it had updated its policy, and regrets ""any hurt or upset caused"". She added: ""We would like to stress that this is in no way to discriminate against our hard working NHS, who we love dearly. Like all processes in action, ours were being tweaked and have now been updated."" Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, China Media Analyst Today, both Hong Kong and Taiwan have expanded their

"This video can not be played Scottish election 2021: SNP pledges NHS funds and indyref push Nicola Sturgeon has promised to provide a ""transformational"" increase in NHS funding if the SNP wins the election. Speaking as she launched the party's manifesto, Ms Sturgeon said frontline NHS spending would increase by at least 20% over the next five years - which she said would total Â£2.5bn. The SNP leader repeated her call for an independence referendum to be held within the next parliamentary term. But added it would be a ""dereliction of duty"" to do so during the pandemic. The manifesto also promises a Â£10bn investment programme in NHS facilities, and a minimum 25% rise in mental health spending. And it pledges to abolish NHS dental charges, which Ms Sturgeon said would ""ensure that cost is not a barrier to accessing health care"". At-a-glance: SNP manifesto Scottish National Party policies explained A simple guide to the SNP In a video speech to coincide with its publication, Ms Sturgeon said the coronavirus pandemic had ""turned life as we know it upside down"". Ms Sturgeon received her first Covid vaccination jab at the NHS Louisa Jordan in the SSE Hydro in Glasgow after launching her party's manifesto But she said her party was putting forward ""unashamedly optimistic"" proposals that would ""build a better nation"" rather than return things to how they were before. And she described the manifesto as a ""serious programme for serious times"". SCOTLAND ALERTS:Get extra updates on BBC election coverage Ms Sturgeon said: ""If the SNP is re-elected, we will use our experience to undertake a full-scale post-pandemic remobilisation of the NHS. ""Investment in the NHS is already at record levels. But the pandemic has placed exceptional pressures on our NHS - and that requires an exceptional response. ""Over the next parliament, we will increase frontline NHS spending by at least 20%. This will deliver an additional Â£2.5bn for frontline health services - and is almost double what an inflation-only increase would amount to.""

The first minister admitted that her government had made mistakes in response to Covid-19, but insisted that it had learned from those errors. She added: ""A year ago, we had to act fast without the knowledge we have now about this virus - and without the benefit of the hindsight we have today. ""I know we didn't get every decision right, but we have done our level best and we have learned from experience. ""It is that combination of commitment and experience that I believe is so vital for these times."" This video can not be played Election 2021: How does Scotland's voting system work? The party's other key manifesto pledges include: An additional Â£500m to support new, green jobs and reskill people for the jobs of the future Investment of Â£33bn in infrastructure projects over the next five years, and build 100,000 more affordable homes over the next decade Freeze the rates of income tax throughout the next parliament A Young Person's Guarantee of either a university or college place, an apprenticeship, a job, training or working experience placement, or a formal volunteering programme. Double the value of the Scottish Child Payment from Â£10 per week for every child in a low income family, to Â£20 per week Extend free bus travel to under-22s and bring ScotRail back into public ownership Ms Sturgeon also said her government would ""move towards what is known as a minimum income guarantee"". She said the first step would to establish independently assessed minimum income standards. Ms Sturgeon added: ""We will then identify the extent to which we can use our existing powers over social security, as well as our investments in fair work, childcare and public services to ensure that people meet these income standards. ""We will lay the foundation for the introduction of a Citizens' Basic Income should Scotland choose to become independent and gain the tax and social security powers that are necessary to make that a reality."" The SNP plan to increase NHS spending by at least Â£2.5bn over the next five years goes beyond the Â£2bn minimum promised by the Conservatives. There is no doubt that this would be a significant uplift - almost twice the rate of inflation. But it is not money for nothing. The SNP wants the NHS to work harder, to increase treatment activity by 10% compared to pre-pandemic levels to help clear the big backlog of cases caused by covid. To achieve that and meet the rising costs of healthcare plus a 4% pay rise for many health workers, increased spending on mental health and the abolition of charges for dentistry - the NHS will have no trouble spending more money. By prioritising the NHS in its plans for recovery from the pandemic, the SNP is aligning itself with the public service that is most popular with and highly valued by Scottish voters. On a second referendum, Ms Sturgeon said it was ""vital"" that people who live in Scotland were able to decide the future that they want. But she stressed that she was not proposing holding a referendum while the country was still grappling with the Covid crisis. Ms Sturgeon said: ""That would be a dereliction of my duty as first minister to dedicate all of my energies to leading us through the crisis. ""But it would also be a dereliction of my duty as first minister - my duty  to this and future generations - to let Westminster take Scotland so far in the wrong direction that we no longer have the option to change course. ""So, it is my judgment that the people of Scotland should decide Scotland's future through an independence referendum in the next term of parliament.""

Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the SNP wanted to ""put a referendum roadblock in front of Scotland's recovery"". He added: ""This is a manifesto to create a new crisis at the earliest opportunity, when we're going to be tackling the health and economic crisis for years to come."" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that stopping the SNP winning an overall majority in the election was ""crucial"". He said this was because it would force the government to focus entirely on the coronavirus recovery rather than on an independence referendum. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said the country was still waiting for the SNP to deliver promises they had made in 2007. Mr Rennie said: ""They have a one-track mind for independence that prevents them getting anything else done."" The Scottish Greens, who are the only other major party to have launched their manifesto so far, want to see a referendum held during the next Holyrood term if there is a ""simple majority"" of MSPs in favour of one.

"Unlicensed and licensed premises such as restaurants, beer gardens, and cafes can open outdoors earlier than expected, as can gyms. Non-essential retail will reopen from 30 April. Two more coronavirus-related deaths were reported by the Department of Health on Thursday, bring its death toll to 2,132 A further 159 people have tested positive for Covid-19 There are 76 people in hospital with Covid-19 - eight of them are in intensive care That concludes our live coverage of the announcement that there will be significant easing of coronavirus restrictions in Northern Ireland from 23 April onwards. Here's a reminder of those changes. That's all from us, have a good evening and stay safe. The chair of the British Medical Association in NI, Dr Tom Black has urged everyone in Northern Ireland to continue following public health regulations as further Covid-19 restrictions begin to ease. âAs these restrictions are lifted here we need everyone to continue to follow the social distancing and face covering guidance,"" he says. ""We also need to watch the data and be ready to act quickly if we see numbers rising again.â Dr Black has called on greater coordination between Stormont and the Irish government to help minimise any potential further outbreaks of the virus. ""Unlike the rest of the UK, we share a border with the Republic of Ireland and, as infection rates in the Derry and Strabane border area is currently showing us, greater coordination on public health measures is needed between the two jurisdictions."" Belfast
Chamber has said it is glad that dates have finally been provided for businesses to reopen. ""Every day, I speak with
business owners who are in distress and despair and were becoming devoid of
hope,"" the chamber's Simon Hamilton said. ""We firmly believed that the amazing speed and scale of the
vaccination roll-out and the continually improving health data justified giving
those businesses indicative dates for reopening.  ""Thankfully, retail, close contact services, hospitality, leisure and tourism businesses now have clear reopening dates that are significantly better than those mooted in the media this morning. ""They can now plan and prepare for trading again in just a few weeksâ time. ""We now look forward to working with departments and the council to deliver a safe reopening of our cityâs economy."" Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallonhas confirmed action plans for a priority booking system for driving tests,externalfollowing the executiveâs decision to reinstate practical driving tests from 23 April. Between now and 26 April, those customers affected by the restrictions and who had their appointments cancelled and fee refunded will be advised by the DVA how they can book a new test date before the booking system will open in three phases. âAll driving test services across these islands are experiencing high demand with longer than usual waiting times, like all public facing services, the Covid restrictions mean that the DVA has had to adapt its services to ensure that they can be provided safely,"" the minister said. ""The department, the DVA and I remain committed to minimising disruption and ensuring our plan for the restoration of services is in hand, and most importantly remain committed to protecting the lives of staff and customers during this pandemic.â Andrew Lynas, of Lynas Foodservice, says he would have liked to see quicker reopening. ""But at least weâve got clarity on outdoor dates and then I
think the big one for us will be 24 May when we get indoor hospitality â hotels
etc,"" he said. ""It's some dates for us to move towards, for our customers to move towards and it gives us a bit of hope. ""I think there was real despair and despondency this morning. At least we have a bit more clarity and we have some dates ""Iâm going home happier â I wouldnât say happy, but happier."" Independent MLA Claire Sugden has a question from the caravanners out there. Does the easing of restrictions apply to touring caravans or just to statics? Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill says that at the moment it's just the static caravans. Tourers will have to wait for a further announcement.  How confident are the ministers that their easement strategy wonât result to a spike in cases, asks Gerry Carroll. âThereâs a whole lot of factors which mean we donât know what the scenario will be in a couple of months time,â responds Michelle OâNeill. The deputy first minister says the executive discussed how best to encourage adherence to the regulations. Mr Caroll, the People Before Profit MLA, asks if the ministers will look at the vaccination criteria âto include people in retail, hospitality and especially people in schoolsâ. The priority is set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccine and Immunisation, responds First Minister Arlene Foster. Retail NI chief executive Glyn Roberts says today's announcement that non-essential retail, close contact services and hospitality now have dates to reopen is a ""significant step
forward"". Mr Roberts says 30 April is a ""hugely important day"" and calls on the NI executive to work with
industry groups and councils on the preparation for the reopening of high
streets. âPublic hand sanitisers, Covid marshals and agreed Covid compliance signage for businesses all need to be in place ahead of reopening to reassure consumers that our high streets are safe to return to and also to reduce levels of the transmission of the virus,"" he says. âThere
is a lot of hard work ahead of reopening, but today is real progressâ. Northern Ireland Assembly When will we see the removal of social distancing and mandatory face masks? Thatâs the question from Paul Givan of the DUP. Michelle OâNeill responds that âyou canât close your eyes and ignore the fact that weâre still in a pandemicâ. âWe need to try and avoid any further lockdown scenarios,â adds the deputy first minister. She adds that lockdowns were ânecessary at different times throughout the pandemicâ. The SDLP's Justin McNulty asks if he will be able to be present at the birth of his son, who is expected on 20 April. Congratulations ring out from around the chamber. ""You've given the gender away and everything. I hope that was discussed at home and you're not going to get a clip,"" says Michelle O'Neill. The deputy first minister says the issue was discussed at the executive meeting today and that she hopes it works for Mr McNulty. ""At least you can't say you were bored,"" chips in Speaker Alex Maskey.  Alliance MLA Paula Bradshaw says there has been much discussion about mental health in relation to the pandemic, but asks what consideration has been given to the impact on the physical health of the population. First Minister Arlene Foster acknowledges there has been a ""concentration"" on the mental health and well-being of the population ""for very obvious reasons"". She adds that the executive has always encouraged people ""to take some exercise if they can"". Mrs Foster said she thought the minister for communities and minister for health would want to look at physical well-being. ""The minister for education is very keen that young people get back to sport as quickly as possible - sport is now allowed within schools - however inter-school sports is still not in a place where we can see that happening simply because we cannot involve too much mixing in terms of the inter-schools but we hope that that can happen in the near future.""  Health Minister Robin Swann has said Northern Ireland ""is moving
in the right direction and
itâs important to bring optimism and certainty to this improving picture"". He added: âAs we
look forward to a better summer, we must not lose sight of the fact that the
virus is still a threat. ""The more we increase vaccination uptake rate, the more we strengthen our defences. âThe executiveâs phased and gradual approach to easing restrictions is the right one. Opening everything up at the same time would not be the responsible way forward. ""We must not jeopardise the progress we have made.â Northern Ireland Assembly Michelle OâNeill tells MLAs that she recently got a her first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at her GP. âTo get that call is just fantastic, and you feel so liberated by it,â adds the deputy first minister. She says âwhy weâre able to make these announcements today is in part because of the sacrifice of the public, because of the work of the health care staff and because of the vaccination team and the rollout of the vaccination programmeâ. Northern Ireland Assembly Christopher Stalford of the DUP says people are âsick to the back teeth of restrictionsâ - particularly young people studying at university who want to return to classrooms. Arlene Foster responds that courses which have practical teaching, such as medicine, are taught face-to-face, while those which can be taught online are being taught online. The first minister accepts that students are missing âthat critical experienceâ of university life. Northern Ireland Assembly Robbie Butler of the Ulster Unionist Party talks about the wedding industry, âwhich has been hit hardâ. He asks the first and deputy first ministers to outline âif there are any other funding opportunities between now and weddings actually happeningâ for those who âfell between the gapsâ. Arlene Foster responds that âwe have not reached a point where we can have wedding receptions indoors just yetâ. The first minister adds âthey do need time to plan, people need to knowâ. âI have emails from people who have changed their weddings three, four times,â she says, adding âtheyâll certainly not forget their wedding when they finally get thereâ. Caoimhe Archibald of Sinn FÃ©in asks if the executive will continue to provide ongoing support for businesses that continue to be affected by the restrictions. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill says there's no doubt that the tourism and hospitality sectors ""have been the worst impacted"". She says the amount paid to support the hospitality sector ""is double what's paid elsewhere"". Ms ONeill says the executive has decided to continue with the grant-aid support for the hospitality sector and for gyms ""until we get to the end"". SDLP MLA Colin McGrath says ""a lot of what has been announced"" today in terms of the easing of restrictions is ""indicative"" and ""falls short"" of ""what a lot of people will want in their sectors"". He asks whether Mrs Foster and Ms O'Neill will commit to publishing the data and indicators that would be used ""to make these important decisions"".   Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill says that ""it is incorrect to say a lot of this is not clear"" and there is only one section of the announcements that is ""indicative"" - which is the further end as you would expect"". ""That is just because we need to judge it based on the prevailing health circumstances at that time,"" she says. ""The indicative section refers to 24 May and that's because we are trying to give people the ability to plan and all being well and with the public's support these will be the confirmed dates."" Ms O'Neill said there was a ""considerable"" amount of data ""put out"" by the Department of Health and she was ""more than content"" for that to continue to be shared.  Northern Ireland Assembly Pam Cameron is the deputy chair of the health committee and wants to know if thereâs been any agreement on a passenger locator form for those travelling to NI from the Republic of Ireland. Thatâs something that hasnât yet been resolved, says Arlene Foster. The first minister adds that earlier today, the chief scientific adviser outlined the possible outcomes and spread of the virus in the six months at the executive. âFrom what weâve seen there will be new variants unfortunatelyâ of Covid-19, says Mrs Foster. Is the test, trace and protect system able to cope with the âincreased burdenâ that PCR testing of all contacts of a positive case will place on the system, asks DUP MLA Ms Cameron. Michelle OâNeill says the system âneeds to be 100% perfectâ and âactively finding cases and dealing with them head onâ. The deputy first minister adds that âwe need to try and avoidâ another circuit of lockdown. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill says this is a good day: ""Itâs a day of optimism. Itâs a day where we can look forward in the hope of a brighter future for all."" She says the restrictions have been necessary to suppress the virus, save lives and protect the health service ""but they have taken their toll"". It's time to move forward ""with caution and have maximum mitigations in place"". The deputy first minister notes that people have been living
under the current lockdown for 110 days. She says the
executive knows that âour people need hope and that our people need us to take
some steps out of restrictionsâ. âTake care
of yourselves and each other,â says Ms OâNeill. She offers
some indicative times for future easements. From 24 May the executive hopes to: Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,1.0
"The Covid surge in January hit key services including cancer and routine surgery, NHS England figures show. Less than half the expected number of operations were done, pushing the waiting list to a record-high of 4.6m. More than 300,000 of those have been waiting more than a year for treatment - compared to 1,600 before the pandemic began. Surgeons described it as a dire situation which would take a long time to turnaround. Tim Mitchell, of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said: ""Behind today's statistics are people waiting in limbo. ""Many will be in considerable pain, others will have restricted mobility and be at risk of isolation and loneliness. ""Dealing with this daunting backlog will take time, and also sustained investment in the NHS,"" he said. Similar problems are also being seen in Scotland where 39,000 people have been waiting over a year for treatment. The NHS Confederation has warned the true picture could be much worse with nearly 6 million fewer referrals made by GPs in England for routine treatments, which includes operations such as knee and hip replacements, last year, suggested there was an additional hidden backlog. The organisation, which represents hospitals, said it was likely people have not sought help or found it difficult to access services during the pandemic. The numbers starting treatment for cancer and being referred for urgent check-ups returned to pre-pandemic levels in the autumn. But the data for January showed a dip in numbers for the first time since the first wave - just under 23,000 people started treatment, compared to nearly 27,500 in January 2020. Michelle Mitchell, Cancer Research UK's chief executive, said: ""While it's positive that urgent referrals did not plummet as they did in the first wave, these January figures show that the pandemic continues to have a devastating impact on cancer patients."" NHS England said given the scale of Covid admissions seen in January, some disruption had been unavoidable. Medical director Prof Stephen Powis said: ""Admitting more than 100,000 Covid patients to hospital in a single month inevitably had a knock-on effect on some non-urgent care. ""However, thanks to the hard work of NHS staff and the innovations in treatment and care developed over the course of the pandemic, hospitals treated more than one million people with other conditions in January, at the peak of the winter wave, nearly twice as many as they did last April. ""That is a testament to the skill, dedication and commitment nurses, doctors, therapists and countless other staff showed in the most challenging period in NHS history.""

"The number of hours ambulances spent waiting to offload patients in parts of England is ""off the scale"", the Royal College of Emergency Medicine says. Data leaked to BBC News shows ambulance waiting times at hospitals in the South East rose by 36% in December compared to the same month in 2019. People are also having to wait longer for ambulances to arrive when called. Ambulance services say it is taking longer to hand over patients but they are doing all they can to meet demand. It comes as the NHS faces unprecedented pressure because of the Covid pandemic. A paramedic working in London told BBC News he had encountered patients left waiting up to 12 hours for an ambulance in the last week. One patient in London with a broken leg had to wait outside at night for six hours before an ambulance arrived to collect him, he said. On another occasion, paramedics were called to attend to a young man with Covid-19 whose oxygen levels were ""so low"". He was given oxygen when they arrived - but that was eight hours after the ambulance was called. Incidents such as these are ""dangerous"" and the service is ""on its knees"", the paramedic added. London 999 calls as high as Covid first wave peak Ambulance service records busiest day ever The figures also show that at one point on Monday this week more than 700 patients were left waiting for an ambulance to arrive in London when none was available. Different statistics obtained by BBC News highlight the number of hours spent waiting to offload patients at hospitals half an hour after ambulances arrived at hospitals in the South East. This video can not be played What does it mean if the NHS is overwhelmed? South East Coast Ambulance service lost 7,803 hours queuing outside hospitals, an increase on 5,732 hours in 2019. Kent saw the greatest rise in this period. One of its hospitals, Medway Maritime Hospital, saw a doubling in ambulance waiting times. These figures are ""off the scale"", according to Royal College of Emergency Medicine Vice President Adrian Boyle. ""It is not because more ambulances are being called, it's because the amount of time they're spending outside a hospital has increased,"" he said. Dr Boyle says ambulances left queuing outside hospitals meant crews were not available to respond to other emergencies. He says services are facing a ""crisis"" unlike any other he has seen. ""People may feel they have a winter crisis every year but this is a different order of magnitude"", he added. ""This is the worst winter crisis I've been through in my 25 years of practising as a doctor."" Ambulance services say they are are doing everything they can to meet the demand. A London Ambulance Service Trust spokesperson said: ""We are continuing to prioritise the most seriously ill and injured patients, and our team of trained clinicians in our control rooms are working hard to monitor and maintain contact with many other patients as needed while they are waiting for ambulance crews to arrive."" A South East Coast Ambulance Service Trust spokesperson said: ""We are doing everything we can to increase the number of staff available to meet this demand, including increasing overtime, to ensure crews are as available as possible to respond to patients in the community.""

"This video can not be played Scottish election 2021: SNP pledges NHS funds and indyref push Nicola Sturgeon has promised to provide a ""transformational"" increase in NHS funding if the SNP wins the election. Speaking as she launched the party's manifesto, Ms Sturgeon said frontline NHS spending would increase by at least 20% over the next five years - which she said would total Â£2.5bn. The SNP leader repeated her call for an independence referendum to be held within the next parliamentary term. But added it would be a ""dereliction of duty"" to do so during the pandemic. The manifesto also promises a Â£10bn investment programme in NHS facilities, and a minimum 25% rise in mental health spending. And it pledges to abolish NHS dental charges, which Ms Sturgeon said would ""ensure that cost is not a barrier to accessing health care"". At-a-glance: SNP manifesto Scottish National Party policies explained A simple guide to the SNP In a video speech to coincide with its publication, Ms Sturgeon said the coronavirus pandemic had ""turned life as we know it upside down"". Ms Sturgeon received her first Covid vaccination jab at the NHS Louisa Jordan in the SSE Hydro in Glasgow after launching her party's manifesto But she said her party was putting forward ""unashamedly optimistic"" proposals that would ""build a better nation"" rather than return things to how they were before. And she described the manifesto as a ""serious programme for serious times"". SCOTLAND ALERTS:Get extra updates on BBC election coverage Ms Sturgeon said: ""If the SNP is re-elected, we will use our experience to undertake a full-scale post-pandemic remobilisation of the NHS. ""Investment in the NHS is already at record levels. But the pandemic has placed exceptional pressures on our NHS - and that requires an exceptional response. ""Over the next parliament, we will increase frontline NHS spending by at least 20%. This will deliver an additional Â£2.5bn for frontline health services - and is almost double what an inflation-only increase would amount to.""

The first minister admitted that her government had made mistakes in response to Covid-19, but insisted that it had learned from those errors. She added: ""A year ago, we had to act fast without the knowledge we have now about this virus - and without the benefit of the hindsight we have today. ""I know we didn't get every decision right, but we have done our level best and we have learned from experience. ""It is that combination of commitment and experience that I believe is so vital for these times."" This video can not be played Election 2021: How does Scotland's voting system work? The party's other key manifesto pledges include: An additional Â£500m to support new, green jobs and reskill people for the jobs of the future Investment of Â£33bn in infrastructure projects over the next five years, and build 100,000 more affordable homes over the next decade Freeze the rates of income tax throughout the next parliament A Young Person's Guarantee of either a university or college place, an apprenticeship, a job, training or working experience placement, or a formal volunteering programme. Double the value of the Scottish Child Payment from Â£10 per week for every child in a low income family, to Â£20 per week Extend free bus travel to under-22s and bring ScotRail back into public ownership Ms Sturgeon also said her government would ""move towards what is known as a minimum income guarantee"". She said the first step would to establish independently assessed minimum income standards. Ms Sturgeon added: ""We will then identify the extent to which we can use our existing powers over social security, as well as our investments in fair work, childcare and public services to ensure that people meet these income standards. ""We will lay the foundation for the introduction of a Citizens' Basic Income should Scotland choose to become independent and gain the tax and social security powers that are necessary to make that a reality."" The SNP plan to increase NHS spending by at least Â£2.5bn over the next five years goes beyond the Â£2bn minimum promised by the Conservatives. There is no doubt that this would be a significant uplift - almost twice the rate of inflation. But it is not money for nothing. The SNP wants the NHS to work harder, to increase treatment activity by 10% compared to pre-pandemic levels to help clear the big backlog of cases caused by covid. To achieve that and meet the rising costs of healthcare plus a 4% pay rise for many health workers, increased spending on mental health and the abolition of charges for dentistry - the NHS will have no trouble spending more money. By prioritising the NHS in its plans for recovery from the pandemic, the SNP is aligning itself with the public service that is most popular with and highly valued by Scottish voters. On a second referendum, Ms Sturgeon said it was ""vital"" that people who live in Scotland were able to decide the future that they want. But she stressed that she was not proposing holding a referendum while the country was still grappling with the Covid crisis. Ms Sturgeon said: ""That would be a dereliction of my duty as first minister to dedicate all of my energies to leading us through the crisis. ""But it would also be a dereliction of my duty as first minister - my duty  to this and future generations - to let Westminster take Scotland so far in the wrong direction that we no longer have the option to change course. ""So, it is my judgment that the people of Scotland should decide Scotland's future through an independence referendum in the next term of parliament.""

Eg 'W1A 1AA' or 'Westminster'   The UK government has repeatedly refused to give its backing to a referendum, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson insisting that the vote held in 2014 settled the matter for a generation. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the SNP wanted to ""put a referendum roadblock in front of Scotland's recovery"". He added: ""This is a manifesto to create a new crisis at the earliest opportunity, when we're going to be tackling the health and economic crisis for years to come."" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that stopping the SNP winning an overall majority in the election was ""crucial"". He said this was because it would force the government to focus entirely on the coronavirus recovery rather than on an independence referendum. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said the country was still waiting for the SNP to deliver promises they had made in 2007. Mr Rennie said: ""They have a one-track mind for independence that prevents them getting anything else done."" The Scottish Greens, who are the only other major party to have launched their manifesto so far, want to see a referendum held during the next Holyrood term if there is a ""simple majority"" of MSPs in favour of one.

"Around 4.7 million people were waiting for routine operations and procedures in England in February - the most since 2007, NHS England figures show. Nearly 388,000 people were waiting more than a year for non-urgent surgery compared with just 1,600 before the pandemic began. During January and February, the pressure on hospitals caused by Covid-19 was particularly acute. NHS England said two million operations took place despite the winter peak. However, surgeons said hospitals were still under huge pressure due to the second wave of Covid, which had led to ""a year of uncertainty, pain and isolation"" for patients waiting for planned treatment. Speaking on a visit to Dartmouth, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the government would ""make sure that we give the NHS all the funding that it needs... to beat the backlog"". He said the situation had been ""made worse by Covid"", and added: ""We do need people to take up their appointments and to get the treatment that they need."" NHS England recently announced that a Â£1bn fund would be used to help trusts restore operations and other services to get as many people treated as possible. NHS waits at record high as second wave hits care Hospital waiting list 'may double to 10m by April' Year-long routine surgery waits 'worst since 2008' Professor Stephen Powis, national medical director for the NHS in England, said treating 400,000 patients with Covid-19 over the course of the last year had ""inevitably had an impact on the NHS"". Around 40% of all patients who have received hospital treatment for Covid since the pandemic began were admitted in the first two months of the year. But he said ""the hard work and dedication of staff"" helped to deliver almost two million operations and procedures ""in the face of the winter wave"". Tim Mitchell, vice-president of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said: ""Although the most urgent operations, for cancer and life-threatening conditions went ahead, hundreds of thousands of patients waiting for routine surgery such as hip and knee operations, cochlear implants and vascular operations had their treatment cancelled or postponed. ""People have been patient as they've seen the battering the pandemic has given the NHS, but how much longer can they be expected to wait?"" Surgeons are calling for massive investment in the health service so that vital operations can continue no matter what comes its way in the future.  4.7 millionPeople waiting for routine operations and procedures in February - highest since records began in 2007 387,885People waiting more than 52 weeks to start hospital treatment in February 304,000People waiting more than 52 weeks to start hospital treatment the previous month 1,613People waiting more than 52 weeks to start hospital treatment in February last year 400,000Patients with Covid-19 needing hospital treatment over the last year Zen Khan had an operation on his pancreas postponed three times Zen Kahn, from London, spent much of the past year in pain waiting for a vital, but not urgent, operation to remove a mass on his pancreas. The 23-year-old, who has severe learning difficulties and mental health issues, was originally told he would have surgery in September 2020 - but in the end he waited until March 2021. ""He was losing weight, turning yellow, and getting weaker and weaker,"" his older brother Waqas says of that time. Zen continued to be in pain and was on strong painkillers for a long time. ""It definitely affected my mum a lot - she was completely devastated,"" his brother says. ""Just to see him deteriorate daily, it was hard on us as a family."" Dr Katie Urch, divisional director of surgery at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, where Zen was treated, said surgery that was ""absolutely time-critical"" was prioritised. ""As our services begin to resume, our clinical teams are constantly reviewing our waiting lists to ensure we're managing care as safely and effectively as possible,"" she said. Zen finally had surgery at the end of March The full scale of the backlog of non-Covid work which has built up because hospitals had to focus on coronavirus patients has been laid bare again. Things are likely to get worse before they get better as the NHS tries to deal with new patients being referred for treatment as well as those already on waiting lists. There is no obvious quick fix. The workforce is already over-stretched and training more staff takes years. The government has allocated some extra cash to the NHS in England to try to help deal with the backlog. But there have been calls for significant extra investment to fund overtime payments and make maximum seven-days-a-week use of operating theatres. There have been warnings that the NHS in all parts of the UK will take years to recover from the consequences of Covid care and longer-term plans to expand the workforce and build new hospital facilities will be needed soon. Cancer figures for England show that the number of people starting treatment for the disease in February 2021 was 6% lower compared with the same time last year. Although there has been a slight improvement in the numbers referred to a cancer specialist by their GP since January, the total number over the past year is more than 370,000 down on normal, Macmillan Cancer Support said. Sara Bainbridge, head of policy at the charity said: ""Tens of thousands of people are still missing a diagnosis due to disruption caused by the pandemic, which could affect their prognosis. ""It's vital that cancer services continue to be prioritised and that those with cancer are not forgotten."" Cancer Research UK said without the funding and resources the NHS needs, ""the UK faces the prospect of cancer survival going backwards for the first time in decades"".

More than 32 million people in the UK have now had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine. Find out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average withour postcode look-up tool. The vaccination rate for staff at older adult care homes is below the level recommended by scientists advising the government in more than half of England's local authorities, figures show. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) says 80% of care home staff and 90% of residents need to be vaccinated to provide a minimum level of protection against Covid-19 outbreaks. Figures just published by NHS England show that 86 out of 149 local authorities have not reached this threshold for employees. In 22 areas less than 70% of staff have had a first jab. Lambeth in south London had the lowest uptake at 50.1%. The figures suggest more than 96,000 eligible staff have not received a vaccine. It could be mandatory for care home staff in England to get a jab in new plans under consultation by the government.

Universities Minister Michelle Donelan said it was a ""cautious approach"" to the easing of restrictions. The University of the West of England's vice chancellor, Steve West, said it was a ""crushing decision for our students"". ""I still have a difficulty in understanding the evidence base upon which it's OK to have half but not all students,"" he says. Read more reactionhere. Hospitality businesses in Northern Ireland will be allowed to open earlier than initially proposed,BBC News understands. Stormont ministers have been meeting to agree dates for the reopening of a number of sectors - and that meeting has now finished. Health Minister Robin Swann said yesterdaythe time was right for the NI Executive to further ease restrictions, after some outdoor retail reopened on Monday. Read more about the new indicative dates here. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was ""glad"" she had the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine, amid concerns about rare cases of blood clots. ""There have been concerns raised and I said that I'm confident it's safe, but now I'm not just saying that, I've also had the AstraZeneca vaccine,"" she said. Ms Sturgeon praised the ""well-oiled machine"" at the SSE Hydro in Glasgow and urged others to get vaccinated when they are invited. ""I guess like many people I felt quite emotional because it's so important this vaccination programme in helping us all get back to normal,"" she said. Covid travel restrictions around Scotland are due to be eased on Friday, earlier than expected, but there will bea much more significant relaxation in the rules from 26 April. Will RossAfrica editor, BBC World Service Some African nations will need to increase health spending by 50% to vaccinate 60% of their populations, the IMF says The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that more than 30 million people in sub-Saharan Africa are being pushed into poverty by the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. It has called on wealthier nations to help African countries get better access to vaccines. The IMF estimates that some African countries - aiming to vaccinate 60% of their populations - will need to increase their health spending by 50%. Last year, economies in sub-Saharan Africa contracted by almost 2% - the worst year on record. The lockdowns have hurt
businesses from market-stall holders to tourist resorts and multinationals. Having a young population seems
to have helped protect the continent from the coronavirus. But with Africa's population
growing so fast, vast numbers of young people need work. So the lockdowns need to end as
soon as possible and the vaccines need to be rolled out quickly to reduce the economic
impact across the continent. The IMF estimates that they will recover this year with a growth spurt of 3.4%, although all other regions in the world are expected to experience greater economic growth. Benefit Cosmetics hasbacktracked on a policythat reportedly saw NHS workers turned away for beauty treatments. A nurse wrote on Facebook that NHS staff were being refused ""on the basis that [they] work with Covid patients."" Responding to the healthcare worker's post, Benefit Cosmetics wrote earlier in the week that it was a ""blanket policy"" to refuse service to anyone who has been in contact ""with anyone suspected of Covid or having its symptoms"". It said this was needed to ""protect staff and other customers"". But social media users lashed out on the brand's pages, with some calling for a boycott. The beauty brand is now allowing NHS workers to receive eyebrow and eyelash treatments if they were wearing medical grade personal protective equipment (PPE) when in contact with coronavirus patients and no-one else in their household has recently had Covid or shown symptoms. All customers will be asked a series of ""screening questions"", which have now been updated, on arrival for their appointments. A spokeswoman for the firm said it had updated its policy, and regrets ""any hurt or upset caused"". She added: ""We would like to stress that this is in no way to discriminate against our hard working NHS, who we love dearly.

Jose TembeBBC News, Maputo Those wishing to travel are finding it costly to get Covid tests Four suspected members of a counterfeit ring producing fake Covid-19 negative certificates
have been arrested, the authorities say. The gangâs operations centred around the Ressano Garcia border post where people need negative Covid-19
results to travel to neighbouring South Africa, Mozambiqueâs National Criminal Investigation
Service (Sernic) said. Two suspects were arrested
in mid-March and the others on Monday in the capital, Maputo, Sernic spokesperson
Hilario Lole said. Three of those arrested were government health
workers - another was someone who touted their services, he said. The gang charged between $50 (Â£36) and $60 for each ""test"" with a guaranteed negative
result. It is not easy to get a free Covid-19 test
at government-run hospitals for the purposes of travel - and private clinics tend to
charge around $100 for a test. Many Mozambicans travel to South Africa for work or to buy goods to resell back home. Thousands of people are dying every day in Brazil with Covid-19 Brazil's ""failed Covid-19 response"" is driving the country to a ""humanitarian catastrophe"", the international charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) has said. The country has seen a sharp rise in cases and deaths in recent weeks, fuelled by more transmissible variants of the virus and a lack of co-ordinated national measures. President Jair Bolsonaro has strongly opposed imposing a lockdown, despite growing calls from health experts, and criticised state governors and mayors for announcing local restrictions. ""The federal government has all but refused to adopt evidence-based comprehensive public health guidelines, leaving Brazil's dedicated medical staff to manage the sickest in intensive care units and improvise solutions when beds are unavailable,"" MSF's international president Dr Christos Christou said in a statement. ""This has put Brazil into a permanent state of mourning and led to the near collapse of Brazil's health system."" The virus continues to circulate across the country and the situation is unlikely to improve in April as some states and cities are already easing restrictions, according to the health institute Fiocruz. Patients with Covid-19 are occupying more than 90% of intensive care beds in most states, Fiocruz said, while some parts of the country have reported short supplies of oxygen and anaesthetics needed to help patients with serious complications. The country recorded 73,513 new cases and 3,459 deaths in 24 hours on Wednesday, according to the health ministry.

"Lynda and Wayne Rickard are accused of murdering their wealthy landlord A reclusive millionaire was ""completely in thrall"" to a live-in tenant who starved him to death to steal his fortune, a court has heard. Anthony Sootheran's body was found at his home, High Havens Farm, near South Newington, Oxfordshire, in March 2014. The 59-year-old was ""controlled"" by Lynda Rickard, 62, who allowed his room to become a ""foul, unhygienic cell"", a prosecutor told Reading Crown Court. She and her husband Wayne Rickard, 66, both from Banbury, deny murder. Anthony Sootheran died after being ""deprived of food and drink"", the court previously heard Mrs Rickard admits forging wills in the names of both Mr Sootheran and his mother, Joy, as well as spending tens of thousands of pounds of their money, the jury has been told. Oliver Saxby QC, prosecuting, said the millionaire apparently ate little food in the three weeks before his death. He was ""virtually immobile"", allowing a large pressure sore to develop on his back, the prosecutor said. In the view of a health expert, Mr Sootheran would have survived if he had been medically treated a week before his death, the jury heard. He said a visitor in October 2013, Richard Stubbs, was ""horrified"" by Mr Sootheran's condition and the state of his room. Joy Sootheran's will was forged by Mrs Rickard ""The bed linen was stained and looked like it had not been changed in months. A window pane was broken. In the corner, there was a pile of Anthony's hair,"" Mr Saxby said. ""There was no television in the room. There were no books, or magazines. In short, it was a foul, unhygienic, cell."" The prosecutor said family members, Ian and Deborah Charles, met the millionaire in 2013 to discuss their suspicions about his mother's will. He said: ""[Mrs Rickard] kept prompting Anthony with his answers - he seemed to be looking to her for his cue and, in Mrs Charles' eyes, was completely in her thrall."" Other visitors were resisted or blocked by Mrs Rickard, who refused to give Mr Sootheran's daughter the code to the farm gates, the prosecutor said. The victim died from a lung infection caused by malnutrition either on 18 March 2014 when his body was found or up to three days before, Mr Saxby added. (Left to right) Denise Neal, Shanda Robinson and Michael Dunkley deny fraudulently signing forged wills His forged will left the farm and a third of his Â£3.5m estate to Mrs Rickard, the jury has been told. The Rickards were denied probate, lost a court challenge over the will and were evicted from the farm in 2017, the court heard. As alternatives to the murder charge, Mrs Rickard denies gross negligence manslaughter, while her husband denies causing or allowing the death of a vulnerable adult. They both deny fraudulently using Ms Sootheran's money to buy a Mitsubishi Shogun car. Three of Mrs Rickard's friends, Shanda Robinson, 51, and Michael Dunkley, 49, from Banbury, and Denise Neal, 41, from Lower Tysoe, Warwickshire, deny fraudulently signing wills. However, another friend, June Alsford, 78, from Aynho, Northamptonshire, has admitted the charge. Mr Rickard denies perverting the course of justice by attempting to pass off a will as genuine while Ms Robinson denies conspiring to do the same. The trial continues.

"The sneakers are worth an estimated $1m A pair of shoes designed and worn by musician Kanye West that are going up for auction are the most valuable to appear on the market, the auction house selling them says. The Nike Air Yeezy 1 Prototypes have an estimate of $1 million (Â£726,000). West first wore the shoes while performing at the Grammys in 2008. They are now being sold by shoe collector Ryan Chang, through Sotheby's auction house, and will be on display in Hong Kong from Friday. In recent years, sneakers have gained the same collectable status as wine or jewellery. Sotheby's, a global auction house, held its first ever sale dedicated entirely to sneakers in 2019. Brahm Wachter, head of streetwear and modern collectibles at Sotheby's, said in a statement that the shoes were ""critical to the development of the Yeezy franchise, which became one of the most important sneaker and lifestyle brands in history"". The sneakers are a US size 12, or a UK 11 - West's shoe size. Kanye West wore the sneakers while performing at the 2008 Grammys The seven-figure estimate for the Yeezys beats the previous record sale price for sneakers - a pair of 1985 Nike Air Jordan 1s, which were sold by Christie's last year for $615,000 (Â£446,000). However, there are no records for shoes that have been bought privately. It is believed that the most expensive sneakers ever created were designed by Bicion and Mache Custom Kicks in 2016. The shoes, which are embellished with diamonds and sapphires, were estimated at $4 million. The Yeezys are being sold as part of a private sale, which means neither the buyer nor the final sale price will be publicised unless the buyer themselves comes forward. The sneaker range was developed with Nike between 2007 and 2009. This was the first time Nike had collaborated with someone who wasn't an athlete. West wore the Prototypes during an emotional performance of Stronger and Hey Mama at the Grammys in 2008, just a few months after the death of his mother. West and Kardashian agree on joint custody Kim Kardashian 'files to divorce Kanye West' Kanye West back at Gap with Yeezy fashion line The Air Yeezy 1 was then launched in a limited series in 2009, followed by the Air Yeezy 2 in 2012. But in 2013 West ended his partnership with Nike, saying that his share of the revenue from the shoes was insufficient. The following year, he began working with Adidas. Partnering with Adidas proved to be a lucrative decision. The collaboration generated almost $1.7 billion in 2020, Forbes and Bloomberg report.

"Instagram is popular with young children, even though it has a joining age of 13 A group of public health advocates from around the world wants Facebook to scrap its plans to launch a version of Instagram for children. A letter,externalfrom the Campaign for a Commercial-free Childhood, signed by 99 groups and individuals, claims the ""image-obsessed"" platform is dangerous for children's health and privacy. Plans for an Instagram for under-13s have been mooted in recent weeks. Facebook, which owns Instagram, said it would be ""managed by parents"". ""Kids are already online, and want to connect with their family and friends, have fun, and learn. We want to help them do that in a safe and age-appropriate way, and find practical solutions to the ongoing industry problem of kids lying about their age to access apps,"" the social media giant told the BBC. ""We're working on new age verification methods to keep under-13s off Instagram, and have just started exploring an Instagram experience for kids that is age-appropriate and managed by parents. ""We agree that any experience we develop must prioritise their safety and privacy, and we will consult with experts in child development, child safety and mental health, and privacy advocates to inform it. We also won't show ads in any Instagram experience we develop for people under the age of 13."" Instagram fixes mistake promoting harmful diet content Police uncover teenage girl 'suicide' Instagram group In March,Buzzfeed reported,externalon an internal company post in which executives discussed plans to build a version of the photo-sharing app that could be used by children who are under the legal age to join Instagram. Facebook, along with other social media platforms, is under growing pressure to find ways to stop the under-13s joining. But children can do so by lying about their age. In the letter, the signatories point out that those under the age of 13 already on Instagram are unlikely to ""abandon it for a new site that seems babyish"". ""The real target of Instagram for kids will be much younger children,"" it said. Josh Golin, Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood executive director, said: ""Instagram's business model relies on extensive data collection, maximising time on devices, promoting a culture of over-sharing and idolising influencers, as well as a relentless focus on often altered physical appearance. It is certainly not appropriate for seven-year olds."" Kathryn Montgomery, senior strategist at the US digital rights group Center for Digital Democracy, said: ""Facebook claims that creating an Instagram for kids will help keep them safe on the platform. ""But the company's real goal is to expand its lucrative and highly profitable Instagram franchise to an even younger demographic, introducing children to a powerful commercialised social media environment that poses serious threats to their privacy, health and wellbeing."" The letter cites research from the The Royal Society for Public Health which rated Instagram as the worst social media platform for youth mental health. The report claims Instagram is linked to a increased risk of eating disorders, cyber-bullying and sexual grooming. Just this week,Instagram was forced to apologiseafter a ""mistake"" meant diet content was promoted to users with eating disorders. And the father of UK teenager Molly Russell, who took her own life in 2017,said that the platform was partly responsible,because she had viewed material about depression and suicide on it, even though such content is banned. ""Instagram's focus on photo-sharing and appearance makes the platform particularly unsuitable for children who are in the midst of crucial stages of developing their sense of self,"" the letter reads. ""Children and teens (especially young girls) have learned to associate overly sexualised, highly edited photos of themselves with more attention on the platform, and popularity among their peers."" There is also unnecessary commercial pressure on children, says the letter, quoting analysis by digital monitoring agency Sprout Social that suggests one in every three Instagram posts is an advert. YouTube for Kids, which doesn't show adverts, was recently criticised for ""smuggling in"" marketing and advertising with product placements. Instagram has also faced criticism for not making it clear when posts are paid-for ads. The letter added that Facebook had ""a long track record of exploiting young people"", citing a design flaw in Messenger Kids which allowed young children to circumvent parental controls. The letter, addressed to Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg, is signed by 35 organisations and 64 individual experts, including the Electronic Privacy Information Center, Global Action Plan and Kidscape. Facebook is not the only platform under fire for the way it treats young people. Dutch privacy group the Foundation for Market Information Research has alleged that TikTok violates children's privacy under GDPR rules. It plans to file a formal complaint.

"Rebecca Bostock, from Winchcombe in Gloucestershire, said she was in pain for 16 months A rare, undiagnosed medical condition left a woman in ""excruciating"" pain for 16 months before an emergency operation saved her life. Rebecca Bostock began to experience stomach swelling and had problems keeping down food in January 2020. The mystery complaint was eventually found to be Superior Mesenteric Artery Syndrome (SMAS) when she was rushed into hospital on Good Friday this year. ""I don't want anyone to go through what I went through,"" she said. The 32-year-old underwent an emergency operation after her stomach swelled up so much she was struggling to breathe Ms Bostock, 32, underwent the emergency operation at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital where nurses told her they had only treated three cases of SMAS in 27 years, and that the condition affects fewer than 1% of the population. She was told that if she had not been rushed into hospital for treatment on that day, then she may not have survived. ""My stomach was swollen so much that I couldn't breathe, I was being sick and couldn't keep any medication down,"" she said. ""I was on a downward spiral. They took me into imaging and diagnosed SMAS and I was taken away for the operation. ""They said I needed the operation straight away or I wouldn't survive even a couple more hours,"" she said. Rebecca's weight dropped by almost three stone as her body rejected food Before the operation, Ms Bostock, from Winchcombe, said she had been in pain for 16 months, with stomach swelling, fever, sickness, diarrhoea and dizziness. She also lost almost three stone in weight. She visited GPs and the emergency department several times but was told the pain was likely to be caused by endometriosis or irritable bowel syndrome. ""I was referred to a gynaecologist around the time of the first lockdown but everything shut down and I didn't see one for months. ""I was advised to change my diet, which seemed to help at first, but then the symptoms deteriorated again to the point where I struggled to walk and couldn't breathe."" Ms Bostock was taken to hospital by fiance Chris Turton on Good Friday when her condition worsened significantly SMAS is a condition affecting the digestive system, which occurs when part of the small intestine is compressed between two arteries, causing a partial or complete blockage. The operation involved releasing the blockage to open the pathway, or ""re-plumbing"" the stomach as Ms Bostock was told by her surgeon. She is still unable to eat solid foods but hopes to introduce them to her diet soon and wants to raise awareness of the rare condition so that others can learn to spot the signs earlier. Rebecca hopes to use her experience of suffering from the condition to prevent others having to go through what she did ""I want to tell my story to raise awareness I feel blessed and relieved,"" she said. ""I'm so thankful to the doctors and nurses who saved my life. I get so emotional thinking about it and I can't thank them enough. ""It is so rare and even doctors don't know about it, so helping people to spot the signs and be able to rule it out is so important.""

"Pte Towers braved heavy machine gun fire and barbed wire as he raced to the stranded platoon A Victoria Cross awarded to a World War One soldier who braved enemy fire to deliver orders to a stranded platoon has sold for Â£248,000 at auction. Pte James Towers received the medal for volunteering to take the orders despite having seen five messengers shot down in Mericourt, France in October 1918. More than a decade later, the Broughton farmer told a newspaper he felt he had to help, as ""they were my pals"". The medal previouslysold for Â£144,000 in an auction in 2015. Christopher Mellor-Hill, spokesman for Dix Noonan Webb auctioneers said Pte Towers' ""display of supreme courage and determination [was] a great inspiration to all ranks"". The then-21-year-old soldier's actions came as his unit, 2nd Battalion, The Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) held a railway embankment at Mericourt on 6 October 1918. One platoon became cut off from the rest and did not receive the order to retreat when the soldiers came under heavy attack. Five volunteers were shot down attempting to take the message to them, before Pte Towers succeeded, braving heavy machine gun fire and barbed wire as he raced to their position. He received his medal from King George V on 8 May 1919. Pte Towers was awarded the Victoria Cross (far left) in 1919 Pte Towers, who died in 1977, told the newspaper in November 1929 that the ""worst part was that I didn't know just where our chaps were"".

"Sara Tilston, manager of Stockport hospice charity Beechwood Cancer Care, which is only open to shoppers, not droppers, this week. People should call and check before they drop off donations at charity shops, a trade association has warned. There are fears the pent-up demand to donate after lockdown could lead to overcrowding in shops, the Charity Retail Association said. Chief executive Robin Osterley said ""we have two asks of the generous public"". ""Be thoughtful - is this stuff you'd be prepared to buy yourself? And the second is to contact the shop before you roll up with armfuls of goods."" The Salvation Army made record sales on Monday, after non-essential shops reopened in England and Wales. Meanwhile Oxfam reported a 77% increase in sales compared with 2019, and Cancer Research UK took half a million pounds - more than double what it was expecting. But the same big names are encouraging would-be donors to phone and book a slot to drop. Charity Retail Association chief, Robin Osterley - better prepared this time Managing donations has been a Covid learning curve for the sector,as lockdowns have prompted mass clear-outsof unwanted goods. However, charity shops are better prepared this time, Mr Osterley said. Take for example Stockport hospice charity, Beechwood Cancer Care. There's been a queue of customers at its Heald Green precinct. But it is only open to shoppers, not droppers, this week. Its manager, Sara Tilston, said it had been really busy: ""Yesterday was brilliant, we loved it. ""People have really struggled for money this year and being able to get extra supplies a lot cheaper is important."" She was turning away donations this week, but said that from next week she would accept donations on Tuesdays and Fridays, from the back door. ""We want to use up to the donations that we've collected through lockdown."" There's extra pressure on these volunteer-run services to be safe and compliant. In all the fanfare of the 12 April reopening in England, the return of the humble charity shop was anticipated for a variety of reasons. The stores offer valuable employment and volunteering experience to thousands of people, many of whom are likely to be vulnerable or isolated otherwise. Second-hand fashion has gained a big following among the environmentally conscious - as well as bargain hunters. Moreover, for many making a purchase, this is a need not a desire. The pandemic hasnudged 3.5 million more people into financial dire straits. Susanne Burwell's haul of unwanted goods includes a wetsuit - but it isn't destined for the charity shop But lockdown has also given many of us yet another chance to have a good old clear out. Take Susanne Burwell, in Hull, who has a haul of good quality items that stretches across her dining table and all over her sofa. ""I've got a suitcase full of clothes and all my shoes ready to go,"" she told the BBC. She also has a range of sporting items to pass on - a wetsuit, a bike and badminton rackets. ""It's become a weight on my mind. I just want to have the space again, but I am quite excited that things might get another life."" However, she said she wouldn't be taking them to the charity shop this time. ""I remember last time it was 'please don't bring us any more stuff, we don't have room for it'. I've heard charity shops are quite full again, so I'm booking a car boot."" Although it has got more difficult to donate, with set days and queues to hand on unwanted items, Robin Osterley said most people were still willing to wait to give their things away, rather than sell them. He said there had been a steady stream of donations this week already. He simply wishes his members could have stayed open throughout lockdown, like supermarkets. ""People have been sitting on piles of clothes for a long time, and we are grateful they have been doing that. ""For us it's been more frustrating to be classed as non-essential retail. We feel we are very much essential."" His organisation is keen to stress the contribution charity shops make to UK life, listing their presence on struggling high streets, the volunteering skills people can earn, as well as the cash boost to hundreds of good causes. Last year,a government committee warned that the funding gap left by closing charity shops,externalwould create irreparable damage to the sector. Its survival will rely on the support of shoppers and droppers alike. Ms Tilson, in Stockport, said charity shops weren't just about donations and bargains: ""We also help those who want to come out for a chat, just to see us. ""It was so good to see regular customers when we opened. Who needs Primark anyway?""

Join us tomorrow for more live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. Today's updates have been brought to you by Emma Harrison, Vanessa Barford, Jen Meierhans, Mary O'Connor and Hazel Shearing. Here's a reminder of some of today's coronavirus news from around the world: Here's a recap of today's coronavirus developments in the UK:  There have been almost 4.4 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 127,000 people have died within 28 days of a positive test, the latest government figures show. More than 32 million people in the UK have now had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine. Find out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average withour postcode look-up tool. The vaccination rate for staff at older adult care homes is below the level recommended by scientists advising the government in more than half of England's local authorities, figures show. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) says 80% of care home staff and 90% of residents need to be vaccinated to provide a minimum level of protection against Covid-19 outbreaks. Figures just published by NHS England show that 86 out of 149 local authorities have not reached this threshold for employees. In 22 areas less than 70% of staff have had a first jab. Lambeth in south London had the lowest uptake at 50.1%. The figures suggest more than 96,000 eligible staff have not received a vaccine. It could be mandatory for care home staff in England to get a jab in new plans under consultation by the government. A former floor-layer who started streaming himself playing computer games during lockdown has doubled his income and says it is ""surreal"" people pay to watch him.

Since the start of the year, only students on hands-on courses have been allowed in-person teaching. Universities Minister Michelle Donelan said it was a ""cautious approach"" to the easing of restrictions. The University of the West of England's vice chancellor, Steve West, said it was a ""crushing decision for our students"". ""I still have a difficulty in understanding the evidence base upon which it's OK to have half but not all students,"" he says. Read more reactionhere. Hospitality businesses in Northern Ireland will be allowed to open earlier than initially proposed,BBC News understands. Stormont ministers have been meeting to agree dates for the reopening of a number of sectors - and that meeting has now finished. Health Minister Robin Swann said yesterdaythe time was right for the NI Executive to further ease restrictions, after some outdoor retail reopened on Monday. Read more about the new indicative dates here. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was ""glad"" she had the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine, amid concerns about rare cases of blood clots. ""There have been concerns raised and I said that I'm confident it's safe, but now I'm not just saying that, I've also had the AstraZeneca vaccine,"" she said. Ms Sturgeon praised the ""well-oiled machine"" at the SSE Hydro in Glasgow and urged others to get vaccinated when they are invited. ""I guess like many people I felt quite emotional because it's so important this vaccination programme in helping us all get back to normal,"" she said. Covid travel restrictions around Scotland are due to be eased on Friday, earlier than expected, but there will bea much more significant relaxation in the rules from 26 April. Will RossAfrica editor, BBC World Service Some African nations will need to increase health spending by 50% to vaccinate 60% of their populations, the IMF says The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that more than 30 million people in sub-Saharan Africa are being pushed into poverty by the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. It has called on wealthier nations to help African countries get better access to vaccines. The IMF estimates that some African countries - aiming to vaccinate 60% of their populations - will need to increase their health spending by 50%. Last year, economies in sub-Saharan Africa contracted by almost 2% - the worst year on record. The lockdowns have hurt
businesses from market-stall holders to tourist resorts and multinationals. Having a young population seems
to have helped protect the continent from the coronavirus. But with Africa's population
growing so fast, vast numbers of young people need work. So the lockdowns need to end as
soon as possible and the vaccines need to be rolled out quickly to reduce the economic
impact across the continent. The IMF estimates that they will recover this year with a growth spurt of 3.4%, although all other regions in the world are expected to experience greater economic growth. Benefit Cosmetics hasbacktracked on a policythat reportedly saw NHS workers turned away for beauty treatments. A nurse wrote on Facebook that NHS staff were being refused ""on the basis that [they] work with Covid patients."" Responding to the healthcare worker's post, Benefit Cosmetics wrote earlier in the week that it was a ""blanket policy"" to refuse service to anyone who has been in contact ""with anyone suspected of Covid or having its symptoms"". It said this was needed to ""protect staff and other customers"". But social media users lashed out on the brand's pages, with some calling for a boycott. The beauty brand is now allowing NHS workers to receive eyebrow and eyelash treatments if they were wearing medical grade personal protective equipment (PPE) when in contact with coronavirus patients and no-one else in their household has recently had Covid or shown symptoms. All customers will be asked a series of ""screening questions"", which have now been updated, on arrival for their appointments. A spokeswoman for the firm said it had updated its policy, and regrets ""any hurt or upset caused"". She added: ""We would like to stress that this is in no way to discriminate against our hard working NHS, who we love dearly. Like all processes in action, ours were being tweaked and have now been updated."" Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, China Media Analyst Today, both Hong Kong and Taiwan have expanded their

Christopher SleightBBC Scotland News As we wait for more detail on Northern Ireland's dates for easing lockdown, let's take a look at what the timeline looks like for Scotland. From tomorrow,Covid restrictions will be eased- earlier than expected - which will allow people to travel to meet up, and groups of six adults from six households to meet outdoors. But there will be a much more significant relaxation in the rules from 26 April, when those parts of Scotland currently under Covid protectionlevel four,externalrules are moved into tolevel three,external.

There were also 2,672 new infections. Jose TembeBBC News, Maputo Those wishing to travel are finding it costly to get Covid tests Four suspected members of a counterfeit ring producing fake Covid-19 negative certificates
have been arrested, the authorities say. The gangâs operations centred around the Ressano Garcia border post where people need negative Covid-19
results to travel to neighbouring South Africa, Mozambiqueâs National Criminal Investigation
Service (Sernic) said. Two suspects were arrested
in mid-March and the others on Monday in the capital, Maputo, Sernic spokesperson
Hilario Lole said. Three of those arrested were government health
workers - another was someone who touted their services, he said. The gang charged between $50 (Â£36) and $60 for each ""test"" with a guaranteed negative
result. It is not easy to get a free Covid-19 test
at government-run hospitals for the purposes of travel - and private clinics tend to
charge around $100 for a test. Many Mozambicans travel to South Africa for work or to buy goods to resell back home. Thousands of people are dying every day in Brazil with Covid-19 Brazil's ""failed Covid-19 response"" is driving the country to a ""humanitarian catastrophe"", the international charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) has said. The country has seen a sharp rise in cases and deaths in recent weeks, fuelled by more transmissible variants of the virus and a lack of co-ordinated national measures. President Jair Bolsonaro has strongly opposed imposing a lockdown, despite growing calls from health experts, and criticised state governors and mayors for announcing local restrictions. ""The federal government has all but refused to adopt evidence-based comprehensive public health guidelines, leaving Brazil's dedicated medical staff to manage the sickest in intensive care units and improvise solutions when beds are unavailable,"" MSF's international president Dr Christos Christou said in a statement. ""This has put Brazil into a permanent state of mourning and led to the near collapse of Brazil's health system."" The virus continues to circulate across the country and the situation is unlikely to improve in April as some states and cities are already easing restrictions, according to the health institute Fiocruz. Patients with Covid-19 are occupying more than 90% of intensive care beds in most states, Fiocruz said, while some parts of the country have reported short supplies of oxygen and anaesthetics needed to help patients with serious complications. The country recorded 73,513 new cases and 3,459 deaths in 24 hours on Wednesday, according to the health ministry. As the pandemic rages, hundreds of babies and young children have died,as our colleagues Nathalia Passarinho and Luis Barrucho from BBC Brasil report. Irish government ministers have insisted that the Republic is on course to continue a cautious reopening of society in May and to meet its end of June vaccination target. Taoiseach (Irish PM) MÃ­cheÃ¡l Martin has said he expects 80% of the adult population to be offered or to have had a first dose by the end of June and around 55% to be fully vaccinated. He has estimated that the Republic's vaccination programme is about a month behind Northern Ireland's. The Republic has been described as having the longest lockdown in the world.

It comes after news a top civil servant worked for Greensill Capital while still on the government payroll. Labour says things are becoming ""murkier"" and lobbyists have an ""open door"" to government.

""Simple steps could be taken now"" he said to tighten things up including ""looking carefully at contracts of employment"" and changes could be put in place ""well before the summer"". He said the public was ""entitled"" to know the arrangements for second jobs. ""I mean, if Mr Crothers had decided he wanted to have a milk round or something, I don't think we would be terribly worried.

"Around 4.7 million people were waiting for routine operations and procedures in England in February - the most since 2007, NHS England figures show. Nearly 388,000 people were waiting more than a year for non-urgent surgery compared with just 1,600 before the pandemic began. During January and February, the pressure on hospitals caused by Covid-19 was particularly acute. NHS England said two million operations took place despite the winter peak. However, surgeons said hospitals were still under huge pressure due to the second wave of Covid, which had led to ""a year of uncertainty, pain and isolation"" for patients waiting for planned treatment. Speaking on a visit to Dartmouth, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the government would ""make sure that we give the NHS all the funding that it needs... to beat the backlog"". He said the situation had been ""made worse by Covid"", and added: ""We do need people to take up their appointments and to get the treatment that they need."" NHS England recently announced that a Â£1bn fund would be used to help trusts restore operations and other services to get as many people treated as possible. NHS waits at record high as second wave hits care Hospital waiting list 'may double to 10m by April' Year-long routine surgery waits 'worst since 2008' Professor Stephen Powis, national medical director for the NHS in England, said treating 400,000 patients with Covid-19 over the course of the last year had ""inevitably had an impact on the NHS"". Around 40% of all patients who have received hospital treatment for Covid since the pandemic began were admitted in the first two months of the year. But he said ""the hard work and dedication of staff"" helped to deliver almost two million operations and procedures ""in the face of the winter wave"". Tim Mitchell, vice-president of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said: ""Although the most urgent operations, for cancer and life-threatening conditions went ahead, hundreds of thousands of patients waiting for routine surgery such as hip and knee operations, cochlear implants and vascular operations had their treatment cancelled or postponed. ""People have been patient as they've seen the battering the pandemic has given the NHS, but how much longer can they be expected to wait?"" Surgeons are calling for massive investment in the health service so that vital operations can continue no matter what comes its way in the future.  4.7 millionPeople waiting for routine operations and procedures in February - highest since records began in 2007 387,885People waiting more than 52 weeks to start hospital treatment in February 304,000People waiting more than 52 weeks to start hospital treatment the previous month 1,613People waiting more than 52 weeks to start hospital treatment in February last year 400,000Patients with Covid-19 needing hospital treatment over the last year Zen Khan had an operation on his pancreas postponed three times Zen Kahn, from London, spent much of the past year in pain waiting for a vital, but not urgent, operation to remove a mass on his pancreas. The 23-year-old, who has severe learning difficulties and mental health issues, was originally told he would have surgery in September 2020 - but in the end he waited until March 2021. ""He was losing weight, turning yellow, and getting weaker and weaker,"" his older brother Waqas says of that time. Zen continued to be in pain and was on strong painkillers for a long time. ""It definitely affected my mum a lot - she was completely devastated,"" his brother says. ""Just to see him deteriorate daily, it was hard on us as a family."" Dr Katie Urch, divisional director of surgery at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, where Zen was treated, said surgery that was ""absolutely time-critical"" was prioritised. ""As our services begin to resume, our clinical teams are constantly reviewing our waiting lists to ensure we're managing care as safely and effectively as possible,"" she said. Zen finally had surgery at the end of March The full scale of the backlog of non-Covid work which has built up because hospitals had to focus on coronavirus patients has been laid bare again. Things are likely to get worse before they get better as the NHS tries to deal with new patients being referred for treatment as well as those already on waiting lists. There is no obvious quick fix. The workforce is already over-stretched and training more staff takes years. The government has allocated some extra cash to the NHS in England to try to help deal with the backlog. But there have been calls for significant extra investment to fund overtime payments and make maximum seven-days-a-week use of operating theatres. There have been warnings that the NHS in all parts of the UK will take years to recover from the consequences of Covid care and longer-term plans to expand the workforce and build new hospital facilities will be needed soon. Cancer figures for England show that the number of people starting treatment for the disease in February 2021 was 6% lower compared with the same time last year. Although there has been a slight improvement in the numbers referred to a cancer specialist by their GP since January, the total number over the past year is more than 370,000 down on normal, Macmillan Cancer Support said. Sara Bainbridge, head of policy at the charity said: ""Tens of thousands of people are still missing a diagnosis due to disruption caused by the pandemic, which could affect their prognosis. ""It's vital that cancer services continue to be prioritised and that those with cancer are not forgotten."" Cancer Research UK said without the funding and resources the NHS needs, ""the UK faces the prospect of cancer survival going backwards for the first time in decades"".

"This video can not be played Are the Taliban preparing for peace or more war? Driving to Taliban-controlled territory doesn't take long. Around 30 minutes from the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif, passing large craters left by roadside bombs, we meet our host: Haji Hekmat, the Taliban's shadow mayor in Balkh district. Perfumed and in a black turban, he's a veteran member of the group, having first joined the militants in the 1990s when they ruled over the majority of the country. The Taliban have arranged a display of force for us. Lined up on either side of the street are heavily armed men, one carrying a rocket propelled grenade launcher, another an M4 assault rifle captured from US forces. Balkh was once one of the more stable parts of the country; now it's become one of the most violent. Baryalai, a local military commander with a ferocious reputation, points down the road, ""the government forces are just there by the main market, but they can't leave their bases. This territory belongs to the mujahideen"". It's a similar picture across much of Afghanistan: the government controls the cities and bigger towns, but the Taliban are encircling them, with a presence in large parts of the countryside. The militants assert their authority through sporadic checkpoints along key roads. As Taliban members stop and question passing cars, Aamir Sahib Ajmal, the local head of the Taliban's intelligence service, tells us they're searching for people linked to the government. ""We will arrest them, and take them prisoner,"" he says. ""Then we hand them over to our courts and they decide what will happen next."" The Taliban believe victory is theirs. Sitting over a cup of green tea, Haji Hekmat proclaims, ""we have won the war and America has lost"". The decision by US President Joe Biden to delay the withdrawal of remaining US forces to September, meaning they will remain in the country past the 1 May deadline agreed last year, has sparked a sharp reaction from the Taliban's political leadership. Nonetheless, momentum seems to be with the militants. ""We are ready for anything,"" says Haji Hekmat. ""We are totally prepared for peace, and we are fully prepared for jihad."" Sitting next to him, a military commander adds: ""Jihad is an act of worship. Worship is something that, however much of it you do, you don't get tired."" Haji Hekmat, the Taliban's shadow mayor in Balkh district, joined the group in the 1990s For the past year, there has been an apparent contradiction in the Taliban's ""jihad"". They stopped attacks on international forces following the signing of an agreement with the US, but continued to fight with the Afghan government. Haji Hekmat, though, insists there is no contradiction. ""We want an Islamic government ruled by the Sharia. We will continue our jihad until they accept our demands."" On whether or not the Taliban would be willing to share power with other Afghan political factions, Haji Hekmat defers to the group's political leadership in Qatar. ""Whatever they decide we will accept,"" he repeatedly says. Afghans face pivotal moment as US 'closes the book' A year of violence on the road to peace Fears rise as US ends its longest war How much has the Afghanistan war cost the US? The Taliban don't see themselves as a mere rebel group, but as a government-in-waiting. They refer to themselves as the ""Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan,"" the name they used when in power from 1996 until being overthrown in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. Now, they have a sophisticated ""shadow"" structure, with officials in charge of overseeing everyday services in the areas they control. Haji Hekmat, the Taliban mayor, takes us on a tour. We're shown a primary school, filled with young boys and girls scribbling in UN-donated textbooks. While in power in the 1990s, the Taliban banned female education, though they often deny that. Even now, there are reports that in other areas older girls are not allowed to attend classes. But here at least the Taliban say they're actively encouraging it. ""As long as they wear hijab, it's important for them to study,"" says Mawlawi Salahuddin, in charge of the Taliban's local education commission. In secondary schools, he says, only female teachers are allowed, and the veil is mandatory. ""If they follow the Sharia, there is no problem."" Some fear girls will be denied access to education if the Taliban take power again Local sources told us the Taliban removed art and citizenship classes from the curriculum, replacing them with Islamic subjects, but otherwise follow the national syllabus. So do the Taliban send their own daughters to school? ""My daughter's very young, but when she grows up, I will send her to school and the madrassa, as long as it's implementing the hijab and Sharia,"" says Salahuddin. The government pays the salaries of staff, but the Taliban are in charge. It's a hybrid system in place across the country. At a nearby health clinic, run by an aid organisation, it's a similar story. The Taliban allow female staff to work, but they must have a male chaperone at night, and the male and female patients have been segregated. Contraception and information about family planning is readily available. The Taliban clearly want us to see them in a more positive light. When we drive past a crowd of schoolgirls making their way home, Haji Hekmat gestures excitedly, proud to be contradicting our expectations. Concerns over the Taliban's views on women's rights remain, however. The group has no female representation at all, and in the 1990s prevented women from working outside the home. Women are allowed to work at this local health clinic, but have male chaperones at night Driving through the villages in Balkh district, we do see plenty of women, not all of whom are wearing the all-encompassing burqa, walking around freely. At the local bazaar, however, there are none. Haji Hekmat insists there is no ban on them, though in a conservative society he says they generally wouldn't attend in any case. 'The Taliban tried to kill me - for being a woman' We are accompanied by the Taliban at all times, and the few local residents we speak to all profess their support for the group, and gratitude to them for improving security and decreasing crime. ""When the government were in control, they used to jail our people and demand bribes to free them,"" says one elderly man. ""Our people suffered a lot, now we are happy with the situation."" The Taliban's ultra-conservative values do clash less with those in more rural areas, but many, particularly in the cities, fear they want to resurrect the brutal Islamic Emirate of the 1990s, undercutting freedoms that many young people have grown up with over the past two decades. One local resident spoke to us later, on condition of anonymity, and told us the Taliban were far stricter than they admitted in our interviews. He described villagers being slapped or beaten for shaving their beards, or having stereos smashed for listening to music. ""People have no choice but to do what they say,"" he told the BBC, ""even over minor issues they get physical. People are scared."" One resident told the BBC people are frightened into obeying the local Taliban Haji Hekmat was part of the Taliban in the 1990s. While the younger fighters milling around us are happy snapping photos and selfies, he initially moves to cover his face with his turban when he sees our camera. ""Old habits,"" he says with a grin, before later allowing us to film his face. Under the Taliban's old regime, photography was banned. Did they make mistakes when in power, I ask him? Would they behave in the same way again now? ""The Taliban before and the Taliban now are the same. So comparing that time and now - nothing has changed,"" says Haji Hekmat. ""But,"" he adds, ""there are changes in personnel of course. Some people are harsher and some are calmer. That's normal."" The Taliban have appeared to be deliberately vague about what they mean by the ""Islamic government"" they want to create. Some analysts see that as a deliberate attempt to avoid internal frictions between hardline and more moderate elements. Can they both accommodate those with different views and not alienate their own base? Coming into power could prove their biggest test. As we eat a lunch of chicken and rice, we hear the rumble of at least four separate airstrikes in the distance. Haji Hekmat is unperturbed. ""It's far away, don't worry,"" he says. Airpower, particularly that provided by the Americans, has been crucial over the years in holding back the Taliban's advance. The US already drastically cut back its military operations after signing an agreement with the Taliban last year, and many fear that following their withdrawal the Taliban will be placed to launch a military takeover of the country. Haji Hekmat derides the Afghan government, or ""Kabul administration"" as the Taliban refer to it, as corrupt and un-Islamic. It's hard to see how men like him will reconcile with others in the country, unless it's on their own terms. ""This is jihad,"" he says, ""it is worship. We don't do it for power but for Allah and His law. To bring Sharia to this country. Whoever stands against us we will fight against them.""

Lord Pickles' Acoba committee is meant to ensure that they don't use their insider knowledge and contacts to enrich themselves for two years after leaving the government. The danger is that if they get too cosy with business it could lead to bias and corruption. The Acoba committee has long been criticised for being toothless - and Eric Pickles appears to agree. As things stand, he is neither a watchdog nor a regulator, he says. His committee is there to offer advice, which is not always sought. He appears determined to change this, although he says there is no need for the ""thermonuclear"" option of fines and new laws. Only that if you break the rules, there must be ""consequences"". On Tuesday it emerged that a former government procurement officer, Bill Crothers, joined Greensill as an adviser in 2015 while still working as a civil servant - after getting the go-ahead from the Cabinet Office. Lord Pickles said that while it was not unusual for civil servants to have second jobs and to share their expertise, Mr Crothers' ""excuse"" when justifying his work with Greensill surprised him. ""It did seem, talking to other colleagues who had enjoyed being civil servants in the past, that they also shared my surprise - this seems to be a new thing, or a new excuse."" Bill Crothers says he was ""transparent"" about the role he took on with Greensill Capital He said contractors and consultants to the government should have to sign a memorandum of understanding about the restrictions that would be placed on them after completing their public sector work. ""Simple steps could be taken now"" he said to tighten things up including ""looking carefully at contracts of employment"" and changes could be put in place ""well before the summer"". He said the public was ""entitled"" to know the arrangements for second jobs. ""I mean, if Mr Crothers had decided he wanted to have a milk round or something, I don't think we would be terribly worried. ""But his particular position, in terms of running procurement and working for a commercial organisation, is something that does require a full and frank and transparent explanation,"" he added.

Lord Pickles said there did not appear to be ""any boundaries at all"" between civil servants and the private sector. It comes after news a top civil servant worked for Greensill Capital while still on the government payroll.

"Instagram has apologised after a mistake with its algorithm promoted diet content to users with eating disorders. The search function in the app automatically recommended terms including âappetite suppressantsâ and âfastingâ to some people. Eating disorder campaigners told the BBC that vulnerable people could be triggered and even relapse. The social media platform said harmful terms have now been removed. Users were given search terms based on what they had liked and followed on the app A spokesman for Facebook, which owns Instagram, told the BBC it was a âmistakeâ and the issue was resolved on Monday. âWe recently rolled out a new search functionality on Instagram beyond hashtags and usernames, to help you more easily discover and explore content youâre most interested in,â he added. âAs part of this new feature, when you tap on the search bar, weâll suggest topics you may want to search for. âThose suggestions, as well as the search results themselves, are limited to general interests, and weight loss should not have been one of them."" âI could be triggered by this imagery and language and have a relapse. âWhen I use the app, Iâm often promoted things like calorie counting images and diet methods. âPeople go to Instagram for support with their illness. But if you look at and research eating disorder recovery, then Instagram just throws harmful stuff at you, it can be really damaging. âI know there are extremely helpful posts including what I create for others. But the triggering imagery should be stopped because I donât want to be bombarded on how to lose weight. âI try to click off it and put my phone away as soon as I see it because it upsets me."" Instagram bans any content that âpromotes, encourages or glorifies eating disordersâ and restricts posts advertising weight-loss products to over-18s. Hope Virgo, an eating disorder campaigner with more than 10,000 followers on the platform, said the issue is getting worse on the app. âVulnerable people are getting inundated with this content, and they arenât even actively searching for it,"" she said. âInstagram has the resources and expertise to remove content that triggers people and instead promote healthy messaging.â This video can not be played 'My anorexia really loved Instagram' But users with a history of eating disorders have told the BBC they are repeatedly recommended âdamagingâ content on the app. This includes things like calorie counting posts and diet or exercise plans for weight loss. Instagram said it only recommends discussions of fitness and healthy eating on the app's Explore section. Dr Joshua Wolrich, an NHS doctor and author of Food Isnât Medicine, was alerted to the issue by a follower on Instagram who said they were triggered. âEating disorders have one of the highest mortality rates of any mental health illness, so it is really important that they are dealt with in the right way,â he added. âIf people are following eating disorder accounts that are helping them in their recovery, it is then really harmful to then suddenly be shown something with exactly the opposite messaging.â Dr Wolrich suggested that an optional function for users to switch off any weight loss-related content could help.

"This video can not be played Are the Taliban preparing for peace or more war? Driving to Taliban-controlled territory doesn't take long. Around 30 minutes from the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif, passing large craters left by roadside bombs, we meet our host: Haji Hekmat, the Taliban's shadow mayor in Balkh district. Perfumed and in a black turban, he's a veteran member of the group, having first joined the militants in the 1990s when they ruled over the majority of the country. The Taliban have arranged a display of force for us. Lined up on either side of the street are heavily armed men, one carrying a rocket propelled grenade launcher, another an M4 assault rifle captured from US forces. Balkh was once one of the more stable parts of the country; now it's become one of the most violent. Baryalai, a local military commander with a ferocious reputation, points down the road, ""the government forces are just there by the main market, but they can't leave their bases. This territory belongs to the mujahideen"". It's a similar picture across much of Afghanistan: the government controls the cities and bigger towns, but the Taliban are encircling them, with a presence in large parts of the countryside. The militants assert their authority through sporadic checkpoints along key roads. As Taliban members stop and question passing cars, Aamir Sahib Ajmal, the local head of the Taliban's intelligence service, tells us they're searching for people linked to the government. ""We will arrest them, and take them prisoner,"" he says. ""Then we hand them over to our courts and they decide what will happen next."" The Taliban believe victory is theirs. Sitting over a cup of green tea, Haji Hekmat proclaims, ""we have won the war and America has lost"". The decision by US President Joe Biden to delay the withdrawal of remaining US forces to September, meaning they will remain in the country past the 1 May deadline agreed last year, has sparked a sharp reaction from the Taliban's political leadership. Nonetheless, momentum seems to be with the militants. ""We are ready for anything,"" says Haji Hekmat. ""We are totally prepared for peace, and we are fully prepared for jihad."" Sitting next to him, a military commander adds: ""Jihad is an act of worship. Worship is something that, however much of it you do, you don't get tired."" Haji Hekmat, the Taliban's shadow mayor in Balkh district, joined the group in the 1990s For the past year, there has been an apparent contradiction in the Taliban's ""jihad"". They stopped attacks on international forces following the signing of an agreement with the US, but continued to fight with the Afghan government. Haji Hekmat, though, insists there is no contradiction. ""We want an Islamic government ruled by the Sharia. We will continue our jihad until they accept our demands."" On whether or not the Taliban would be willing to share power with other Afghan political factions, Haji Hekmat defers to the group's political leadership in Qatar. ""Whatever they decide we will accept,"" he repeatedly says. Afghans face pivotal moment as US 'closes the book' A year of violence on the road to peace Fears rise as US ends its longest war How much has the Afghanistan war cost the US? The Taliban don't see themselves as a mere rebel group, but as a government-in-waiting. They refer to themselves as the ""Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan,"" the name they used when in power from 1996 until being overthrown in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. Now, they have a sophisticated ""shadow"" structure, with officials in charge of overseeing everyday services in the areas they control. Haji Hekmat, the Taliban mayor, takes us on a tour. We're shown a primary school, filled with young boys and girls scribbling in UN-donated textbooks. While in power in the 1990s, the Taliban banned female education, though they often deny that. Even now, there are reports that in other areas older girls are not allowed to attend classes. But here at least the Taliban say they're actively encouraging it. ""As long as they wear hijab, it's important for them to study,"" says Mawlawi Salahuddin, in charge of the Taliban's local education commission. In secondary schools, he says, only female teachers are allowed, and the veil is mandatory. ""If they follow the Sharia, there is no problem."" Some fear girls will be denied access to education if the Taliban take power again Local sources told us the Taliban removed art and citizenship classes from the curriculum, replacing them with Islamic subjects, but otherwise follow the national syllabus. So do the Taliban send their own daughters to school? ""My daughter's very young, but when she grows up, I will send her to school and the madrassa, as long as it's implementing the hijab and Sharia,"" says Salahuddin. The government pays the salaries of staff, but the Taliban are in charge. It's a hybrid system in place across the country. At a nearby health clinic, run by an aid organisation, it's a similar story. The Taliban allow female staff to work, but they must have a male chaperone at night, and the male and female patients have been segregated. Contraception and information about family planning is readily available. The Taliban clearly want us to see them in a more positive light. When we drive past a crowd of schoolgirls making their way home, Haji Hekmat gestures excitedly, proud to be contradicting our expectations. Concerns over the Taliban's views on women's rights remain, however. The group has no female representation at all, and in the 1990s prevented women from working outside the home. Women are allowed to work at this local health clinic, but have male chaperones at night Driving through the villages in Balkh district, we do see plenty of women, not all of whom are wearing the all-encompassing burqa, walking around freely. At the local bazaar, however, there are none. Haji Hekmat insists there is no ban on them, though in a conservative society he says they generally wouldn't attend in any case. 'The Taliban tried to kill me - for being a woman' We are accompanied by the Taliban at all times, and the few local residents we speak to all profess their support for the group, and gratitude to them for improving security and decreasing crime. ""When the government were in control, they used to jail our people and demand bribes to free them,"" says one elderly man. ""Our people suffered a lot, now we are happy with the situation."" The Taliban's ultra-conservative values do clash less with those in more rural areas, but many, particularly in the cities, fear they want to resurrect the brutal Islamic Emirate of the 1990s, undercutting freedoms that many young people have grown up with over the past two decades. One local resident spoke to us later, on condition of anonymity, and told us the Taliban were far stricter than they admitted in our interviews. He described villagers being slapped or beaten for shaving their beards, or having stereos smashed for listening to music. ""People have no choice but to do what they say,"" he told the BBC, ""even over minor issues they get physical. People are scared."" One resident told the BBC people are frightened into obeying the local Taliban Haji Hekmat was part of the Taliban in the 1990s. While the younger fighters milling around us are happy snapping photos and selfies, he initially moves to cover his face with his turban when he sees our camera. ""Old habits,"" he says with a grin, before later allowing us to film his face. Under the Taliban's old regime, photography was banned. Did they make mistakes when in power, I ask him? Would they behave in the same way again now? ""The Taliban before and the Taliban now are the same. So comparing that time and now - nothing has changed,"" says Haji Hekmat. ""But,"" he adds, ""there are changes in personnel of course. Some people are harsher and some are calmer. That's normal."" The Taliban have appeared to be deliberately vague about what they mean by the ""Islamic government"" they want to create. Some analysts see that as a deliberate attempt to avoid internal frictions between hardline and more moderate elements. Can they both accommodate those with different views and not alienate their own base? Coming into power could prove their biggest test. As we eat a lunch of chicken and rice, we hear the rumble of at least four separate airstrikes in the distance. Haji Hekmat is unperturbed. ""It's far away, don't worry,"" he says. Airpower, particularly that provided by the Americans, has been crucial over the years in holding back the Taliban's advance. The US already drastically cut back its military operations after signing an agreement with the Taliban last year, and many fear that following their withdrawal the Taliban will be placed to launch a military takeover of the country. Haji Hekmat derides the Afghan government, or ""Kabul administration"" as the Taliban refer to it, as corrupt and un-Islamic. It's hard to see how men like him will reconcile with others in the country, unless it's on their own terms. ""This is jihad,"" he says, ""it is worship. We don't do it for power but for Allah and His law. To bring Sharia to this country. Whoever stands against us we will fight against them.""

"Food delivery firm Deliveroo has apologised to riders after a software error meant some were overpaid a bonus. Riders were promised a payout of between Â£200 to Â£10,000 after Deliveroo listed its shares in London last month. A spokesperson for the firm said all rider payments had been halted while the glitch was sorted out, but that riders had all now received the bonus. Meanwhile, Deliveroo reported that orders and sales more than doubled in the first three months of 2021. Riders were notified that they would get a bonus which was due to be credited to their app accounts on Tuesday. Deliveroo said in a statement: ""A technical error meant a small number of riders were offered a higher payment than intended. ""We have apologised to riders for this confusion. The Â£16m thank-you fund has been paid in full and is a sign of our appreciation of their contribution."" Deliveroo declined to say whether riders who had been paid extra in error would be able to keep additional money. Deliveroo has been rapidly gaining customers as people have looked for food delivery options during the coronavirus pandemic. In the first three month of the year the number of customers using the delivery firm each month rose by 91% year-on-year to 7.1 million. But Deliveroo shares dived when it listed on the London Stock Exchange last month, and fell more than 4% in afternoon trading on Thursday. The firm said in a statement,externalit was unsure how much of the quarterly growth was due to lockdown. But it still expects full year sales to rise by 30% to 40%. The firm is loss making and as this was trading update did not offer guidance on future profits. Founder and chief executive Will Shu said: ""This is our fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating growth, but we are mindful of the uncertain impact of the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions. ""So while we are confident that our value proposition will continue to attract consumers, restaurants, grocers and riders throughout 2021, we are taking a prudent approach to our full year guidance."" Deliveroo said that orders soared by 121% in the UK in the past three months to 34 million as the pandemic takeaway boom continued during the third national lockdown. In its overseas markets orders were up 108% to 37 million. Deliveroo shares tumble on stock market debut More investors shun Deliveroo over workers' rights However, the company said it expects its current rate of growth ""to decelerate as lockdowns ease"", although the extent of the slowdown remains ""uncertain"". The update comes weeks after the group's flotation on the London Stock Exchange, which saw the value of its shares cut by a third in a week amid investor concerns over corporate governance and worker rights. Will Shu said riders value flexibility above all else Deliveroo riders are self-employed, meaning they are not entitled to earn a minimum wage from the company, or holiday and sick pay. Mr Shu said on an analyst call on Thursday that self-employment was ""the only way you can give complete rider flexibility, which is what they want"". ""I'm very supportive of pensions and holiday pay, but in a manner that is congruent with [riders] being able to log in and log out,"" he said. ""I don't personally support one model."" ""There is a trade-off between flexibility and security,"" Mr Shu added. ""Riders want to have flexibility and they value that above everything else."" In its update the firm said rider satisfaction in the UK was at an all time high of 89% at the end of March. Michael Hewson, an analyst at CMC Markets, said: ""This morning's update is certainly encouraging, and shows the business is heading in the right direction.

"This video can not be played Lord Pickles: ""I hope this doesn't sound rude, but there doesn't seem to have been any boundaries at all"" The rules on ministers and top officials taking jobs with private firms need urgent reform, the government's adviser on them has said. Lord Pickles said there did not appear to be ""any boundaries at all"" between civil servants and the private sector. It comes after news a top civil servant worked for Greensill Capital while still on the government payroll. Labour says things are becoming ""murkier"" and lobbyists have an ""open door"" to government. Greensill Capital is at the centre of a row about access, influence and lobbying that has engulfed Westminster. What jobs can ex-ministers do and what are the rules? Civil servants ordered to declare second jobs Top civil servant 'joined Greensill before quitting' What's the Greensill lobbying row about? The government has announced a review of contacts between top officials and ministers, including former prime minister David Cameron, and the now failed finance firm. It will be led by Nigel Boardman, a non-executive board member of the department for business. Speaking on a visit to Dartmouth College in Devon, Boris Johnson said he agreed with Lord Pickles that reform was needed. The PM said: ""I think the most important thing is for us to get to the bottom of it properly and I want all ministers and civil servants to be making the information that needs to be known known to Mr Boardman and let's see what he has to say. ""We need to understand what's gone on here."" This video can not be played Lobbying row: PM Johnson says we must ""get to the bottom of it"" On Wednesday, Mr Johnson orderedConservative MPs to vote down Labour's callfor a ""full"" MP-led inquiry into Greensill and lobbying more widely. Tory peer Lord Pickles chairs the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba) which advises former ministers and civil servants on outside employment. He told the Commons public administration committee he had warned of a scandal but ""this is not where I expected it to come from"". He added: ""There is nothing wrong with lobbyists. What is wrong is with unregulated lobbying, secret lobbying - people getting an undue advantage. ""Our entire political careers have been built by lobbying of some sort... it becomes wrong when it is not properly regulated, recorded and transparent."" Former ministers and senior civil servants must seek advice before taking up a new job in the two years after they leave Whitehall By political reporter Brian Wheeler Former government ministers - and top civil servants - are never short of job offers, but what sort of work should they be allowed to do after leaving the corridors of power? Lord Pickles' Acoba committee is meant to ensure that they don't use their insider knowledge and contacts to enrich themselves for two years after leaving the government. The danger is that if they get too cosy with business it could lead to bias and corruption. The Acoba committee has long been criticised for being toothless - and Eric Pickles appears to agree. As things stand, he is neither a watchdog nor a regulator, he says. His committee is there to offer advice, which is not always sought. He appears determined to change this, although he says there is no need for the ""thermonuclear"" option of fines and new laws. Only that if you break the rules, there must be ""consequences"". On Tuesday it emerged that a former government procurement officer, Bill Crothers, joined Greensill as an adviser in 2015 while still working as a civil servant - after getting the go-ahead from the Cabinet Office. Lord Pickles said that while it was not unusual for civil servants to have second jobs and to share their expertise, Mr Crothers' ""excuse"" when justifying his work with Greensill surprised him. ""It did seem, talking to other colleagues who had enjoyed being civil servants in the past, that they also shared my surprise - this seems to be a new thing, or a new excuse."" Bill Crothers says he was ""transparent"" about the role he took on with Greensill Capital He said contractors and consultants to the government should have to sign a memorandum of understanding about the restrictions that would be placed on them after completing their public sector work. ""Simple steps could be taken now"" he said to tighten things up including ""looking carefully at contracts of employment"" and changes could be put in place ""well before the summer"". He said the public was ""entitled"" to know the arrangements for second jobs. ""I mean, if Mr Crothers had decided he wanted to have a milk round or something, I don't think we would be terribly worried. ""But his particular position, in terms of running procurement and working for a commercial organisation, is something that does require a full and frank and transparent explanation,"" he added. He  expressed his frustration that Acoba had a ""very limited and defined role,"" but added that most people do follow the rules and it is ""only a tiny minority"" who cause problems.

"Food delivery firm Deliveroo has apologised to riders after a software error meant some were overpaid a bonus. Riders were promised a payout of between Â£200 to Â£10,000 after Deliveroo listed its shares in London last month. A spokesperson for the firm said all rider payments had been halted while the glitch was sorted out, but that riders had all now received the bonus. Meanwhile, Deliveroo reported that orders and sales more than doubled in the first three months of 2021. Riders were notified that they would get a bonus which was due to be credited to their app accounts on Tuesday. Deliveroo said in a statement: ""A technical error meant a small number of riders were offered a higher payment than intended. ""We have apologised to riders for this confusion. The Â£16m thank-you fund has been paid in full and is a sign of our appreciation of their contribution."" Deliveroo declined to say whether riders who had been paid extra in error would be able to keep additional money. Deliveroo has been rapidly gaining customers as people have looked for food delivery options during the coronavirus pandemic. In the first three month of the year the number of customers using the delivery firm each month rose by 91% year-on-year to 7.1 million. But Deliveroo shares dived when it listed on the London Stock Exchange last month, and fell more than 4% in afternoon trading on Thursday. The firm said in a statement,externalit was unsure how much of the quarterly growth was due to lockdown. But it still expects full year sales to rise by 30% to 40%. The firm is loss making and as this was trading update did not offer guidance on future profits. Founder and chief executive Will Shu said: ""This is our fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating growth, but we are mindful of the uncertain impact of the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions. ""So while we are confident that our value proposition will continue to attract consumers, restaurants, grocers and riders throughout 2021, we are taking a prudent approach to our full year guidance."" Deliveroo said that orders soared by 121% in the UK in the past three months to 34 million as the pandemic takeaway boom continued during the third national lockdown. In its overseas markets orders were up 108% to 37 million. Deliveroo shares tumble on stock market debut More investors shun Deliveroo over workers' rights However, the company said it expects its current rate of growth ""to decelerate as lockdowns ease"", although the extent of the slowdown remains ""uncertain"". The update comes weeks after the group's flotation on the London Stock Exchange, which saw the value of its shares cut by a third in a week amid investor concerns over corporate governance and worker rights. Will Shu said riders value flexibility above all else Deliveroo riders are self-employed, meaning they are not entitled to earn a minimum wage from the company, or holiday and sick pay. Mr Shu said on an analyst call on Thursday that self-employment was ""the only way you can give complete rider flexibility, which is what they want"". ""I'm very supportive of pensions and holiday pay, but in a manner that is congruent with [riders] being able to log in and log out,"" he said. ""I don't personally support one model."" ""There is a trade-off between flexibility and security,"" Mr Shu added. ""Riders want to have flexibility and they value that above everything else."" In its update the firm said rider satisfaction in the UK was at an all time high of 89% at the end of March. Michael Hewson, an analyst at CMC Markets, said: ""This morning's update is certainly encouraging, and shows the business is heading in the right direction. ""It remains to be seen whether it will be enough to tempt shareholders back on board after the losses [in the share price] seen since the beginning of the month.""

"This video can not be played Lord Pickles: ""I hope this doesn't sound rude, but there doesn't seem to have been any boundaries at all"" The rules on ministers and top officials taking jobs with private firms need urgent reform, the government's adviser on them has said. Lord Pickles said there did not appear to be ""any boundaries at all"" between civil servants and the private sector. It comes after news a top civil servant worked for Greensill Capital while still on the government payroll. Labour says things are becoming ""murkier"" and lobbyists have an ""open door"" to government. Greensill Capital is at the centre of a row about access, influence and lobbying that has engulfed Westminster. What jobs can ex-ministers do and what are the rules? Civil servants ordered to declare second jobs Top civil servant 'joined Greensill before quitting' What's the Greensill lobbying row about? The government has announced a review of contacts between top officials and ministers, including former prime minister David Cameron, and the now failed finance firm. It will be led by Nigel Boardman, a non-executive board member of the department for business. Speaking on a visit to Dartmouth College in Devon, Boris Johnson said he agreed with Lord Pickles that reform was needed. The PM said: ""I think the most important thing is for us to get to the bottom of it properly and I want all ministers and civil servants to be making the information that needs to be known known to Mr Boardman and let's see what he has to say. ""We need to understand what's gone on here."" This video can not be played Lobbying row: PM Johnson says we must ""get to the bottom of it"" On Wednesday, Mr Johnson orderedConservative MPs to vote down Labour's callfor a ""full"" MP-led inquiry into Greensill and lobbying more widely. Tory peer Lord Pickles chairs the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba) which advises former ministers and civil servants on outside employment. He told the Commons public administration committee he had warned of a scandal but ""this is not where I expected it to come from"". He added: ""There is nothing wrong with lobbyists. What is wrong is with unregulated lobbying, secret lobbying - people getting an undue advantage. ""Our entire political careers have been built by lobbying of some sort... it becomes wrong when it is not properly regulated, recorded and transparent."" Former ministers and senior civil servants must seek advice before taking up a new job in the two years after they leave Whitehall By political reporter Brian Wheeler Former government ministers - and top civil servants - are never short of job offers, but what sort of work should they be allowed to do after leaving the corridors of power? Lord Pickles' Acoba committee is meant to ensure that they don't use their insider knowledge and contacts to enrich themselves for two years after leaving the government. The danger is that if they get too cosy with business it could lead to bias and corruption. The Acoba committee has long been criticised for being toothless - and Eric Pickles appears to agree. As things stand, he is neither a watchdog nor a regulator, he says. His committee is there to offer advice, which is not always sought. He appears determined to change this, although he says there is no need for the ""thermonuclear"" option of fines and new laws. Only that if you break the rules, there must be ""consequences"". On Tuesday it emerged that a former government procurement officer, Bill Crothers, joined Greensill as an adviser in 2015 while still working as a civil servant - after getting the go-ahead from the Cabinet Office. Lord Pickles said that while it was not unusual for civil servants to have second jobs and to share their expertise, Mr Crothers' ""excuse"" when justifying his work with Greensill surprised him. ""It did seem, talking to other colleagues who had enjoyed being civil servants in the past, that they also shared my surprise - this seems to be a new thing, or a new excuse."" Bill Crothers says he was ""transparent"" about the role he took on with Greensill Capital He said contractors and consultants to the government should have to sign a memorandum of understanding about the restrictions that would be placed on them after completing their public sector work. ""Simple steps could be taken now"" he said to tighten things up including ""looking carefully at contracts of employment"" and changes could be put in place ""well before the summer"". He said the public was ""entitled"" to know the arrangements for second jobs. ""I mean, if Mr Crothers had decided he wanted to have a milk round or something, I don't think we would be terribly worried. ""But his particular position, in terms of running procurement and working for a commercial organisation, is something that does require a full and frank and transparent explanation,"" he added. He  expressed his frustration that Acoba had a ""very limited and defined role,"" but added that most people do follow the rules and it is ""only a tiny minority"" who cause problems. What inquiries are being held? Government-commissioned review to report by the end of June will include David Cameron's role and how senior civil servant Bill Crothers was given permission to work for Greensill while on the government payroll The head of the civil service, Simon Case, has ordered all government departments to disclose senior staff with second jobs and outside interests by the end of the week Treasury Select Committee announced investigation into Greensill Capital on Tuesday with details set out next week Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee has just announced its own inquiry in to ""topical issues arising around Greensill"" Committee on Standards in public life looking at the wider issues Cabinet Office review of the Lobbying Act, launched before the Greensill row, will take it into account Committee on Standards in Public Life Commons public accounts committee is also looking into Greensill controversy It was possible to create a ""robust system"" without spending ""enormous sums"" of money and creating layers of bureaucracy, Lord Pickles told MPs. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said more and stronger lobbying rules are needed because the current system ""is not working"". He said ministers were being lobbied for ""massive"" procurement contracts ""involving millions sometimes billions of pounds"".

"Instagram has apologised after a mistake with its algorithm promoted diet content to users with eating disorders. The search function in the app automatically recommended terms including âappetite suppressantsâ and âfastingâ to some people. Eating disorder campaigners told the BBC that vulnerable people could be triggered and even relapse. The social media platform said harmful terms have now been removed. Users were given search terms based on what they had liked and followed on the app A spokesman for Facebook, which owns Instagram, told the BBC it was a âmistakeâ and the issue was resolved on Monday. âWe recently rolled out a new search functionality on Instagram beyond hashtags and usernames, to help you more easily discover and explore content youâre most interested in,â he added. âAs part of this new feature, when you tap on the search bar, weâll suggest topics you may want to search for. âThose suggestions, as well as the search results themselves, are limited to general interests, and weight loss should not have been one of them."" âI could be triggered by this imagery and language and have a relapse. âWhen I use the app, Iâm often promoted things like calorie counting images and diet methods. âPeople go to Instagram for support with their illness. But if you look at and research eating disorder recovery, then Instagram just throws harmful stuff at you, it can be really damaging. âI know there are extremely helpful posts including what I create for others. But the triggering imagery should be stopped because I donât want to be bombarded on how to lose weight. âI try to click off it and put my phone away as soon as I see it because it upsets me."" Instagram bans any content that âpromotes, encourages or glorifies eating disordersâ and restricts posts advertising weight-loss products to over-18s. Hope Virgo, an eating disorder campaigner with more than 10,000 followers on the platform, said the issue is getting worse on the app. âVulnerable people are getting inundated with this content, and they arenât even actively searching for it,"" she said. âInstagram has the resources and expertise to remove content that triggers people and instead promote healthy messaging.â This video can not be played 'My anorexia really loved Instagram' But users with a history of eating disorders have told the BBC they are repeatedly recommended âdamagingâ content on the app. This includes things like calorie counting posts and diet or exercise plans for weight loss. Instagram said it only recommends discussions of fitness and healthy eating on the app's Explore section. Dr Joshua Wolrich, an NHS doctor and author of Food Isnât Medicine, was alerted to the issue by a follower on Instagram who said they were triggered. âEating disorders have one of the highest mortality rates of any mental health illness, so it is really important that they are dealt with in the right way,â he added. âIf people are following eating disorder accounts that are helping them in their recovery, it is then really harmful to then suddenly be shown something with exactly the opposite messaging.â Dr Wolrich suggested that an optional function for users to switch off any weight loss-related content could help.

Join us tomorrow for more live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. Today's updates have been brought to you by Emma Harrison, Vanessa Barford, Jen Meierhans, Mary O'Connor and Hazel Shearing. Here's a reminder of some of today's coronavirus news from around the world: Here's a recap of today's coronavirus developments in the UK:  There have been almost 4.4 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 127,000 people have died within 28 days of a positive test, the latest government figures show. More than 32 million people in the UK have now had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine. Find out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average withour postcode look-up tool. The vaccination rate for staff at older adult care homes is below the level recommended by scientists advising the government in more than half of England's local authorities, figures show. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) says 80% of care home staff and 90% of residents need to be vaccinated to provide a minimum level of protection against Covid-19 outbreaks. Figures just published by NHS England show that 86 out of 149 local authorities have not reached this threshold for employees. In 22 areas less than 70% of staff have had a first jab. Lambeth in south London had the lowest uptake at 50.1%. The figures suggest more than 96,000 eligible staff have not received a vaccine. It could be mandatory for care home staff in England to get a jab in new plans under consultation by the government. A former floor-layer who started streaming himself playing computer games during lockdown has doubled his income and says it is ""surreal"" people pay to watch him.

Since the start of the year, only students on hands-on courses have been allowed in-person teaching. Universities Minister Michelle Donelan said it was a ""cautious approach"" to the easing of restrictions. The University of the West of England's vice chancellor, Steve West, said it was a ""crushing decision for our students"". ""I still have a difficulty in understanding the evidence base upon which it's OK to have half but not all students,"" he says. Read more reactionhere. Hospitality businesses in Northern Ireland will be allowed to open earlier than initially proposed,BBC News understands. Stormont ministers have been meeting to agree dates for the reopening of a number of sectors - and that meeting has now finished. Health Minister Robin Swann said yesterdaythe time was right for the NI Executive to further ease restrictions, after some outdoor retail reopened on Monday. Read more about the new indicative dates here. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was ""glad"" she had the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine, amid concerns about rare cases of blood clots. ""There have been concerns raised and I said that I'm confident it's safe, but now I'm not just saying that, I've also had the AstraZeneca vaccine,"" she said. Ms Sturgeon praised the ""well-oiled machine"" at the SSE Hydro in Glasgow and urged others to get vaccinated when they are invited. ""I guess like many people I felt quite emotional because it's so important this vaccination programme in helping us all get back to normal,"" she said. Covid travel restrictions around Scotland are due to be eased on Friday, earlier than expected, but there will bea much more significant relaxation in the rules from 26 April. Will RossAfrica editor, BBC World Service Some African nations will need to increase health spending by 50% to vaccinate 60% of their populations, the IMF says The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that more than 30 million people in sub-Saharan Africa are being pushed into poverty by the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. It has called on wealthier nations to help African countries get better access to vaccines. The IMF estimates that some African countries - aiming to vaccinate 60% of their populations - will need to increase their health spending by 50%. Last year, economies in sub-Saharan Africa contracted by almost 2% - the worst year on record. The lockdowns have hurt
businesses from market-stall holders to tourist resorts and multinationals. Having a young population seems
to have helped protect the continent from the coronavirus. But with Africa's population
growing so fast, vast numbers of young people need work. So the lockdowns need to end as
soon as possible and the vaccines need to be rolled out quickly to reduce the economic
impact across the continent. The IMF estimates that they will recover this year with a growth spurt of 3.4%, although all other regions in the world are expected to experience greater economic growth. Benefit Cosmetics hasbacktracked on a policythat reportedly saw NHS workers turned away for beauty treatments. A nurse wrote on Facebook that NHS staff were being refused ""on the basis that [they] work with Covid patients."" Responding to the healthcare worker's post, Benefit Cosmetics wrote earlier in the week that it was a ""blanket policy"" to refuse service to anyone who has been in contact ""with anyone suspected of Covid or having its symptoms"". It said this was needed to ""protect staff and other customers"". But social media users lashed out on the brand's pages, with some calling for a boycott. The beauty brand is now allowing NHS workers to receive eyebrow and eyelash treatments if they were wearing medical grade personal protective equipment (PPE) when in contact with coronavirus patients and no-one else in their household has recently had Covid or shown symptoms. All customers will be asked a series of ""screening questions"", which have now been updated, on arrival for their appointments. A spokeswoman for the firm said it had updated its policy, and regrets ""any hurt or upset caused"". She added: ""We would like to stress that this is in no way to discriminate against our hard working NHS, who we love dearly. Like all processes in action, ours were being tweaked and have now been updated."" Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, China Media Analyst Today, both Hong Kong and Taiwan have expanded their

Christopher SleightBBC Scotland News As we wait for more detail on Northern Ireland's dates for easing lockdown, let's take a look at what the timeline looks like for Scotland. From tomorrow,Covid restrictions will be eased- earlier than expected - which will allow people to travel to meet up, and groups of six adults from six households to meet outdoors. But there will be a much more significant relaxation in the rules from 26 April, when those parts of Scotland currently under Covid protectionlevel four,externalrules are moved into tolevel three,external.

In England and Scotland, people aged 45 and overare now being invited to book their jabs. InNorthern Ireland,those aged 40-45 are eligible to get a Covid vaccine, while in some areas in Wales 40-49 year-olds are being invited. A further 30 people have died after contracting coronavirus in the UK,according to government daily statistics.,external It brings the total number of deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test to 127,191. There were also 2,672 new infections. Jose TembeBBC News, Maputo Those wishing to travel are finding it costly to get Covid tests Four suspected members of a counterfeit ring producing fake Covid-19 negative certificates
have been arrested, the authorities say. The gangâs operations centred around the Ressano Garcia border post where people need negative Covid-19
results to travel to neighbouring South Africa, Mozambiqueâs National Criminal Investigation
Service (Sernic) said. Two suspects were arrested
in mid-March and the others on Monday in the capital, Maputo, Sernic spokesperson
Hilario Lole said. Three of those arrested were government health
workers - another was someone who touted their services, he said. The gang charged between $50 (Â£36) and $60 for each ""test"" with a guaranteed negative
result. It is not easy to get a free Covid-19 test
at government-run hospitals for the purposes of travel - and private clinics tend to
charge around $100 for a test. Many Mozambicans travel to South Africa for work or to buy goods to resell back home. Thousands of people are dying every day in Brazil with Covid-19 Brazil's ""failed Covid-19 response"" is driving the country to a ""humanitarian catastrophe"", the international charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) has said. The country has seen a sharp rise in cases and deaths in recent weeks, fuelled by more transmissible variants of the virus and a lack of co-ordinated national measures. President Jair Bolsonaro has strongly opposed imposing a lockdown, despite growing calls from health experts, and criticised state governors and mayors for announcing local restrictions. ""The federal government has all but refused to adopt evidence-based comprehensive public health guidelines, leaving Brazil's dedicated medical staff to manage the sickest in intensive care units and improvise solutions when beds are unavailable,"" MSF's international president Dr Christos Christou said in a statement. ""This has put Brazil into a permanent state of mourning and led to the near collapse of Brazil's health system."" The virus continues to circulate across the country and the situation is unlikely to improve in April as some states and cities are already easing restrictions, according to the health institute Fiocruz. Patients with Covid-19 are occupying more than 90% of intensive care beds in most states, Fiocruz said, while some parts of the country have reported short supplies of oxygen and anaesthetics needed to help patients with serious complications. The country recorded 73,513 new cases and 3,459 deaths in 24 hours on Wednesday, according to the health ministry. As the pandemic rages, hundreds of babies and young children have died,as our colleagues Nathalia Passarinho and Luis Barrucho from BBC Brasil report. Irish government ministers have insisted that the Republic is on course to continue a cautious reopening of society in May and to meet its end of June vaccination target. Taoiseach (Irish PM) MÃ­cheÃ¡l Martin has said he expects 80% of the adult population to be offered or to have had a first dose by the end of June and around 55% to be fully vaccinated. He has estimated that the Republic's vaccination programme is about a month behind Northern Ireland's. The Republic has been described as having the longest lockdown in the world.

"Psychedelic drug psilocybin, found in magic mushrooms, is as good at reducing symptoms of depression as conventional treatment, a small, early-stage study has suggested. But when it comes to actively improving people's well-being and ability to feel pleasure, the psychedelic drug may have had a more powerful effect. Psychedelics are being studied for a range of mental-health conditions. But experts caution that this is a small trial with more research needed. For the past three decades, since Prozac hit the market, new drugs for depression and anxiety have generally been variations on the same theme. Yet for a considerable chunk of people they cause undesirable side-effects, stop working over time or don't work in the first place. The psilocybin trial's leaders said there was appetite for ""novel"" treatments that took a different approach. The trial's 59 participants were given either psilocybin or a common antidepressant called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). The scientists from Imperial College London's Centre for Psychedelic Research measured participants' mood and functioning using a number of different scales. Their primary measure scores people's symptoms of depression based on their answers to questions about sleep, energy, appetite, mood and suicidal thoughts. These questions are largely negatively focused: they ask whether someone is feeling sad, but not whether they are feeling happy. By this measure, psilocybin performed as well as a conventional antidepressant - an SSRI called escitalopram. All 59 participants saw comparable reductions in their depressive symptoms. But on several other measures - though they weren't the scientists' primary focus - the psychedelic drug performed considerably better. That includes measures of work and social functioning, mental well-being and the ability to feel happy. The study is among the first to pit the psychedelic head-to-head with a traditional depression treatment - and to open the trial to anyone with moderate-to-severe depression, not just those for whom all other treatments had failed. As well as being a small trial, though, this represents a relatively early phase in the research, so more studies will be needed to prove this effect. The study is ""not a quantum leap"", according to Guy Goodwin, professor of psychiatry at the University of Oxford. ""It is under-powered and does not prove that psilocybin is a better treatment than standard treatment with escitalopram for major depression. ""However, it offers tantalising clues that it may be"". It adds to the growing body of research suggesting psychedelics could be a viable alternative treatment for depression, anxiety, substance misuse and other common conditions. And, Prof Goodwin added, the work ""underlines the broader point that research in depression has been too driven by ratings of particular symptoms rather than the return of positive mood and patient well-being"". SSRIs like fluoxetine (the generic name for Prozac), citalopram, escitalopram and sertraline are the drugs doctors will reach for first when treating depression and anxiety. They are thought to work on the brain's stress system, muting responses, which can ""take the edge off"", study author Dr Robin Carhart-Harris explained, making painful emotions easier to bear. But they don't necessarily help people ""feel great,"" he said - and for some the drugs blunt all emotions, both positive and negative. This emotional blunting can be an unwelcome side-effect. On the other hand, psilocybin seems to work on receptors in the brain associated with ""re-ordering"" the way we think about things. Dr Carhart-Harris said that after psychedelic therapy, participants reported feeling ""recalibrated, reset like they haven't for years"" and ""enjoying life"". Psychedelic therapy could 'reset' depressed brain ""They get more at the root cause of suffering [rather than] plastering over or muting their symptoms."" People in the psilocybin treatment group also experienced fewer of the side-effects that often bother people taking SSRIs: drowsiness, sexual dysfunction and dry mouth. They did have more of the transient symptoms, such as headaches on the day after receiving the drug, though. And the experience of the ""trip"" itself was not easy, the study's co-author Prof David Nutt explained. ""This is hard, hard work. It's often very challenging."" Those being given psilocybin received two relatively high doses of the drug, three weeks apart, while people on the escitalopram arm of the study took that pill every day for six weeks. Both groups were given therapy. Prof Nutt said the therapy was ""as important as the drug action"" - the scientists are anxious to warn against people trying to self-medicate. ""It's not the drug alone. We're not sure the drug alone would have an intrinsic antidepressant effect,"" he said. In order to try to ""blind"" people as to which group they were in - to prevent their expectations altering how they responded to the medication - those on the psychedelic arm were given a daily placebo pill and those on the SSRI arm had two guided sessions during which they were given 1mg of psilocybin (not enough to have a real effect). For obvious reasons, though, it is quite challenging to ""blind"" people to whether or not they've received a large dose of psychedelics. But Dr Carhart-Harris said other studies suggested people continued to feel better for months after psilocybin treatment, making it unlikely to be just the effect of positive expectations. The participants in the Imperial study are being followed up for six months after their initial six-week treatment.

"Sara Tilston, manager of Stockport hospice charity Beechwood Cancer Care, which is only open to shoppers, not droppers, this week. People should call and check before they drop off donations at charity shops, a trade association has warned. There are fears the pent-up demand to donate after lockdown could lead to overcrowding in shops, the Charity Retail Association said. Chief executive Robin Osterley said ""we have two asks of the generous public"". ""Be thoughtful - is this stuff you'd be prepared to buy yourself? And the second is to contact the shop before you roll up with armfuls of goods."" The Salvation Army made record sales on Monday, after non-essential shops reopened in England and Wales. Meanwhile Oxfam reported a 77% increase in sales compared with 2019, and Cancer Research UK took half a million pounds - more than double what it was expecting. But the same big names are encouraging would-be donors to phone and book a slot to drop. Charity Retail Association chief, Robin Osterley - better prepared this time Managing donations has been a Covid learning curve for the sector,as lockdowns have prompted mass clear-outsof unwanted goods. However, charity shops are better prepared this time, Mr Osterley said. Take for example Stockport hospice charity, Beechwood Cancer Care. There's been a queue of customers at its Heald Green precinct. But it is only open to shoppers, not droppers, this week. Its manager, Sara Tilston, said it had been really busy: ""Yesterday was brilliant, we loved it. ""People have really struggled for money this year and being able to get extra supplies a lot cheaper is important."" She was turning away donations this week, but said that from next week she would accept donations on Tuesdays and Fridays, from the back door. ""We want to use up to the donations that we've collected through lockdown."" There's extra pressure on these volunteer-run services to be safe and compliant. In all the fanfare of the 12 April reopening in England, the return of the humble charity shop was anticipated for a variety of reasons. The stores offer valuable employment and volunteering experience to thousands of people, many of whom are likely to be vulnerable or isolated otherwise. Second-hand fashion has gained a big following among the environmentally conscious - as well as bargain hunters. Moreover, for many making a purchase, this is a need not a desire. The pandemic hasnudged 3.5 million more people into financial dire straits. Susanne Burwell's haul of unwanted goods includes a wetsuit - but it isn't destined for the charity shop But lockdown has also given many of us yet another chance to have a good old clear out. Take Susanne Burwell, in Hull, who has a haul of good quality items that stretches across her dining table and all over her sofa. ""I've got a suitcase full of clothes and all my shoes ready to go,"" she told the BBC. She also has a range of sporting items to pass on - a wetsuit, a bike and badminton rackets. ""It's become a weight on my mind. I just want to have the space again, but I am quite excited that things might get another life."" However, she said she wouldn't be taking them to the charity shop this time. ""I remember last time it was 'please don't bring us any more stuff, we don't have room for it'. I've heard charity shops are quite full again, so I'm booking a car boot."" Although it has got more difficult to donate, with set days and queues to hand on unwanted items, Robin Osterley said most people were still willing to wait to give their things away, rather than sell them. He said there had been a steady stream of donations this week already. He simply wishes his members could have stayed open throughout lockdown, like supermarkets. ""People have been sitting on piles of clothes for a long time, and we are grateful they have been doing that. ""For us it's been more frustrating to be classed as non-essential retail. We feel we are very much essential."" His organisation is keen to stress the contribution charity shops make to UK life, listing their presence on struggling high streets, the volunteering skills people can earn, as well as the cash boost to hundreds of good causes. Last year,a government committee warned that the funding gap left by closing charity shops,externalwould create irreparable damage to the sector. Its survival will rely on the support of shoppers and droppers alike. Ms Tilson, in Stockport, said charity shops weren't just about donations and bargains: ""We also help those who want to come out for a chat, just to see us. ""It was so good to see regular customers when we opened. Who needs Primark anyway?""

"The first model will be a mini version of the Tesla Roadster. Matchbox is launching a series of toy cars based on real-life electric vehicles and making some using recycled materials as part of a global relaunch. The first will be a mini version of the Tesla Roadster and will be followed by other models along with scaled-down charging stations. The toymaker wants to raise awareness among children of the environmental impact of motoring. Other firms, including Lego, are also bringing out more sustainable toys. Child power pushes Lego to ditch plastic bags Waitrose in plastic toy move after girl's plea Barbie has best sales in more than five years Other Matchbox cars being launched will be based on electric and hybrid vehicles made by Nissan, Toyota and BMW. The Tesla Roadster will be the first die-cast model made from 99% recycled materials and will go on sale next year. The toy car is made from recycled zinc and plastic with just 1% from non-recycled stainless steel. It will come in zero-plastic packaging made from paper and wood fibre. The aim of the sets is to raise ""environmental consciousness"" among children, and ""empower the next generation of Matchbox fans to help steer us towards a sustainable future,"" Roberto Stanichi, global head of vehicles at Mattel, told the BBC. ""Since the inception of the modern-day die-cast car nearly 70 years ago, Matchbox has been using design and innovation to connect kids with the real world around them through play,"" he added. The formerly UK-based Matchbox, which is now owned by US toymaker Mattel, was created in 1953 and sells more than 40 million die-cast vehicles each year. Mattel, which also owns the Hot Wheels brand, plans to use 100% recycled, recyclable or bio-based plastic materials in the manufacturing of all its products and packaging by 2030. Lego has said it will start replacing plastic packaging with paper bags this year as the toy brick maker aims to become more sustainable. The Danish company said it had been prompted by letters from children asking it to remove the single-use plastic bags. Lego will also be investing up to $400m (Â£310m) over three years to improve its sustainability efforts. Lego bricks themselves are made of plastic, although the company is exploring alternative materials. Waitrose has said it will no longer sell children's magazines with plastic disposable toys to help tackle pollution. The retailer said the free plastic toys have a short lifespan and cannot easily be recycled. This comes amid calls from some of the children they are aimed at to stop giving away free plastic toys.

"Instagram has apologised after a mistake with its algorithm promoted diet content to users with eating disorders. The search function in the app automatically recommended terms including âappetite suppressantsâ and âfastingâ to some people. Eating disorder campaigners told the BBC that vulnerable people could be triggered and even relapse. The social media platform said harmful terms have now been removed. Users were given search terms based on what they had liked and followed on the app A spokesman for Facebook, which owns Instagram, told the BBC it was a âmistakeâ and the issue was resolved on Monday. âWe recently rolled out a new search functionality on Instagram beyond hashtags and usernames, to help you more easily discover and explore content youâre most interested in,â he added. âAs part of this new feature, when you tap on the search bar, weâll suggest topics you may want to search for. âThose suggestions, as well as the search results themselves, are limited to general interests, and weight loss should not have been one of them."" âI could be triggered by this imagery and language and have a relapse. âWhen I use the app, Iâm often promoted things like calorie counting images and diet methods. âPeople go to Instagram for support with their illness. But if you look at and research eating disorder recovery, then Instagram just throws harmful stuff at you, it can be really damaging. âI know there are extremely helpful posts including what I create for others. But the triggering imagery should be stopped because I donât want to be bombarded on how to lose weight. âI try to click off it and put my phone away as soon as I see it because it upsets me."" Instagram bans any content that âpromotes, encourages or glorifies eating disordersâ and restricts posts advertising weight-loss products to over-18s. Hope Virgo, an eating disorder campaigner with more than 10,000 followers on the platform, said the issue is getting worse on the app. âVulnerable people are getting inundated with this content, and they arenât even actively searching for it,"" she said. âInstagram has the resources and expertise to remove content that triggers people and instead promote healthy messaging.â This video can not be played 'My anorexia really loved Instagram' But users with a history of eating disorders have told the BBC they are repeatedly recommended âdamagingâ content on the app. This includes things like calorie counting posts and diet or exercise plans for weight loss. Instagram said it only recommends discussions of fitness and healthy eating on the app's Explore section. Dr Joshua Wolrich, an NHS doctor and author of Food Isnât Medicine, was alerted to the issue by a follower on Instagram who said they were triggered. âEating disorders have one of the highest mortality rates of any mental health illness, so it is really important that they are dealt with in the right way,â he added. âIf people are following eating disorder accounts that are helping them in their recovery, it is then really harmful to then suddenly be shown something with exactly the opposite messaging.â Dr Wolrich suggested that an optional function for users to switch off any weight loss-related content could help.

"Bill Crothers says he was ""transparent"" about the role he took on with Greensill Capital A top civil servant joined financial firm Greensill Capital as an adviser while still working for the government, a lobbying watchdog has revealed. Bill Crothers's part-time position had been ""agreed"" to by the Cabinet Office, the Office of the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments added. Its chairman Lord Pickles complained of a ""lack of transparency"" over the situation. But Mr Crothers said he had been taken on by Greensill in a ""transparent"" way. Labour called his dual employment ""extraordinary and shocking"". Johnson urged to launch 'full' Cameron inquiry Analysis: Review into lobbying may change little David Cameron and Greensill: What's it all about? The disclosure about Mr Crothers - who had been the government's chief procurement officer prior to being taken on by Greensill - is the latest of several stories involving the now-collapsed financial firm. It employed former prime minister David Cameron as an adviser from 2018. The Financial Times and the Sunday Times revealed that Mr Cameron had contacted several ministers, including Chancellor Rishi Sunak, to push for greater involvement in government loans schemes for the company. Boris Johnson has set up an inquiry into lobbying - attempts to persuade governments to change policy - including Greensill's role. Government sources said this would also now look at the situation surrounding Mr Crothers. Lord Pickles is asking for Whitehall ""guidance"" on possible ""conflicts of interest"" Mr Crothers, who had already left his job as chief procurement officer but remained a Civil Service employee, joined Greensill as an adviser to its board in September 2015. The letter from Conservative peer Lord Pickles to leading civil servant Alex Chisholm says: ""This was agreed by the Cabinet Office under its internal conflicts-of-interest policy."" Lord Pickles asks for ""guidance on the conflicts-of-interest process"" undertaken. The letter adds: ""The lack of transparency around this part-time employment with Greensill may have left the misleading impression that Mr Crothers had wilfully ignored the obligation to seek advice."" Mr Crothers left the Civil Service in November 2015, two months after taking up his role at Greensill. He became a director of the firm in late 2016. A letter from Mr Crothers to Lord Pickles, a former Conservative Party chairman, written earlier this week, has also been published. In it, he says: ""I am concerned that there may be a view that I did not follow proper process regarding my role with Greensill Capital. ""I assure you that I completely respect the required process and your office, took steps to comply, and believe that I did so."" He adds: ""I was transparent about the move to Greensill Capital, and it was well known at the time."" The shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves said: ""This is an extraordinary and shocking revelation. ""The Conservatives have weakened the rules so much they may as well rip them up and start again."" The government inquiry in to lobbying is expected to report  by the end of June, but Labour says it does not go far enough. It will use an opposition day debate on Wednesday to force a vote on whether to establish a new Commons select committee to investigate the issue. Unlike regular opposition day votes which are symbolic, this one would be binding if it passes because Parliament would be deciding if it should do something. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said there would be a response to Mr Pickles's letter ""in due course"". They added that the ""review into Greensill Capital and supply-chain finance"" would be ""wide-ranging"". Mr Cameron has said he did not break any codes of conduct or rules on lobbying and that he welcomes the investigation launched by Mr Johnson.

"Government departments have been ordered to find out by the end of the week whether senior officials have rule-breaking second jobs. Cabinet Secretary Simon Case has asked colleagues to declare paid roles or outside interests that ""might conflict"" with Civil Service rules. The move comes after it emerged a top official joined a financial firm while still working for the government. Bill Crothers says his recruitment by Greensill Capital was ""transparent"". Letters to an appointments watchdogpublished on Tuesday,externalrevealed his part-time role as an adviser at the firm had been signed off by the Cabinet Office. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson told MPs on Wednesday it was ""not clear"" that ""boundaries have been properly understood"". Labour has described Mr Crothers' dual employment, which happened in 2015, as ""extraordinary and shocking"". Top civil servant 'joined Greensill before quitting' What's the Greensill lobbying row about? Tories reject Labour plan for MP-led lobbying probe Mr Crothers had been the government's chief procurement officer prior to being taken on by Greensill, which has since collapsed. Revelations about the firm's attempts to influence government have led to Mr Johnson launching a lawyer-led review into its access to ministers and civil servants. Labour argues a special House of Commons committee should investigate instead - but the government rejects this, andvoted down the planon Wednesday. In a letter to senior officials, seen by the BBC, Mr Case - the UK's top civil servant - said there were issues of ""acute concern"" over recruitment. He said the need to give civil servants the chance to gain experience life outside Whitehall has been ""recognised for many decades by successive governments"". ""But this must only be done in a way which can maintain the integrity and impartiality of the Civil Service,"" he wrote. He added: ""In particular, there needs to be transparency and full and proper management of any outside interests."" Mr Case ordered colleagues to declare by the end of the week if they ""come across"" instances of senior civil servants with second jobs or outside interests ""which might conflict with their obligations under the [Civil Service] Code"". This sets outs the rules on ""honesty"", ""integrity"", ""objectivity"" and ""impartiality"". Simon Case became head of the civil service in September 2020 Mr Crothers joined Greensill as an adviser to its board in September 2015, while he remained a Civil Service employee. Letters to the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba) watchdog published on Tuesday show the move was approved by the Cabinet Office under its internal conflicts of interest policy. Mr Crothers later went on to join the company as a director in late 2016, after leaving government in November 2015. In a letter to Acoba's chairman, Lord Pickles, Mr Crothers wrote: ""I am concerned that there may be a view that I did not follow proper process regarding my role with Greensill Capital. ""I assure you that I completely respect the required process and your office, took steps to comply, and believe that I did so."" He adds: ""I was transparent about the move to Greensill Capital, and it was well known at the time."" But in a letter to the current head of the Cabinet Office, Lord Pickles said there had been a ""lack of transparency"" about the process - and called for more details. Concerns about Greensill's access to government were sparked by revelations last month that former Prime Minister David Cameron had lobbied on behalf of the company after leaving office. His efforts involvedtexting Chancellor Rishi Sunakand contacting other ministers about a government-backed Covid loan scheme on behalf of the firm. Along with the company's founder, Lex Greensill, Mr Cameron also met Health Secretary Matt Hancock for a ""private drink"" in 2019 todiscuss a new payment scheme for NHS staff. The former prime minister began working as an adviser to the company in August 2018, two years after leaving Downing Street in July 2016. Mr Cameron has said he did not break any codes of conduct or rules on lobbying, and welcomes the government's review. On Wednesday, the Commons Treasury select committee said it planned to launch an inquiry into the ""lessons"" from Greensill Capital's demise. Other parliamentary committees are reportedly considering bids to invite the former prime minister to give evidence. A spokesman for Mr Cameron said he would ""respond positively"" to such requests ""when the terms of reference of each inquiry are clear"". What's the David Cameron lobbying row about?
