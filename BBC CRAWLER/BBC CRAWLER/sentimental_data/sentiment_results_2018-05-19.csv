"Warrington was underdog with bookmakers and now has 27 wins from 27 fights Josh Warrington made history by becoming the first man from Leeds to win a world boxing title with a stunning split-decision upset victory over Wales' Lee Selby. Selby, who was cut above both eyes by accidental head clashes inside the first six rounds, could not recover from a superb start by the Yorkshireman. The judges scored the contest 116-112 115-113 113-115, giving Warrington the IBF world featherweight title at Elland Road, home of his beloved Leeds United. Warrington, 27, came into the fight as a 4-1 outsider with the bookmakers but produced the performance of a lifetime, showing relentless energy and courage as he continued to power forward for 36 pulsating minutes. Selby, 31, had said he would be at ease in the ""Lion's Den"" but he could not overcome what Warrington served up in front of a hostile crowd as he moved to 27 wins from as many bouts. The Welshman came back into the contest in the middle rounds but Warrington finished strongly and could now be set for a trip to Belfast to face former two-weight world champion Carl Frampton in August. Selby's defeat was a first defeat in nine years and just the second in his career. 'I could die a happy man' - Warrington savours world title win Warrington (right) cut Selby over both eyes inside the first six rounds Stadium fights in the UK are becoming commonplace, so much so that this was the fifth in a little over a year in an outdoor arena. But there was something of a throwback about this one, with Selby figuratively taking on the might of an entire football club. Warrington is synonymous with Leeds United - he is the chairman of their supporters' club - and there was palpable excitement in the air even before his extraordinary ring entrance. Warrington's ring walk will endure in the memory, with one of Leeds' greatest ever players, Lucas Radebe, leading out the challenger as the strains of the Kaiser Chiefs - named after Radebe's first club - played him in with 'I Predict A Riot'. Both Ricky Hatton and Tony Bellew have fought at the football stadiums of the clubs they love, Manchester City and Everton respectively, but Leeds is not a city with split footballing loyalties and the wall of noise that greeted Warrington was special even by recent standards. However, the noise was equally loud for Selby's ring walk - a chorus of boos and abuse, rather than cheers and adulation. Having made the bold statement that his previous four title defences, against Fernando Montiel, Eric Hunter, Jonathan Victor Barros and Eduardo Ramirez, were all tougher foes than Warrington, silencing the home crowd was to be no easy task, especially as Warrington began aggressively and on the front foot. Warrington was relentless in the early exchanges, tagging Selby above his left eye and opening a cut at the start of the second session from a clash of heads. He won both the opening rounds and was asking more questions of Selby than many would have expected. Selby's two cuts were worked on relentlessly by his corner Known as the 'Welsh Floyd Mayweather' for his mean defensive skills, Selby was expected to box off the back foot and allow Warrington to be the aggressor, but he was drawn into a toe-to-toe dust-up, arguably playing into Warrington's game plan perfectly. It stood to reason that Warrington would have a good game plan for the Welshman, considering his trainer and father Sean O'Hagan prepared Samir Mouneimne, the featherweight who inflicted Selby's only previous career defeat in 2009. Another clash of heads in the sixth round opened another cut, this time around Selby's right eye, and prompted a furious reaction from Selby's corner, especially when it seemed referee Michael Alexander was contemplating ending the action. Warrington dropped to his knees when the decision was read out However, with his cornerman Chris Sanigar minimising the damage from the cuts, Selby began to come on strong in the later rounds, still trading with Warrington but using his reach advantage to ensure he was landing when the home favourite was missing. He may wish he had adopted the tactic from the start but Warrington continued to press with punches to the back of the head aggravating Selby, who complained throughout the contest to no avail. Warrington continued to come forward, however, and showed he has more than merited the big fights and pay days ahead. Warrington becomes the first men's world boxing champion from Leeds After the fight, Selby didn't speak to the media, but new world featherweight champion Warrington said: ""I can't put it into words, I've worked hard over the last 18 weeks and during that time I've had two baby girls born. I'm overcome with emotion, it was sheer grit, and the crowd got me through this. On a potential fight with Carl Frampton in Belfast, Warrington added: ""I don't mind going anywhere. ""I've been a fan of Carl's and two weeks ago I said I would beat Lee Selby and go to Windsor Park. We will sit down with Frank Warren and get the fight sorted. ""But I prefer the end of the year as I need some time to be a dad and let this sink in."" Frampton, who was ringside for 5 live, said: ""I would love to fight Josh Warrington. I would love him to come to Belfast and fight me. ""It was a fantastic performance. My next fight will be in Belfast, that's all I know."" Mike Costello (right), Carl Frampton (centre) and Jamie Moore (left) called the action on BBC Radio 5 live BBC Sport boxing correspondent Mike Costello:That was a special, special performance. Warrington was told he would need the performance of his life and he has produced it. It was a magical performance. Former British and European champion Jamie Moore on BBC Radio 5 live:It's a fantastic performance and Josh has sent a statement out to the featherweight division. I don't think he will be ready to face Carl Frampton on 18 August. It would be unfair for Josh Warrington to do that. Three months turnaround is far too much. A lot of us have overlooked Josh Warrington. He has shocked a lot of people tonight.

"Motorists face tougher MOT tests on their vehicles from Sunday, as an updated test introduces new categories under which a vehicle can fail or pass. The categories include ""dangerous"", ""major"" and ""minor"" which determine whether a car, van or motorcycle must be taken off the road or can be driven as long as repairs are carried out. The MOT will also be tougher on diesel emissions. Vehicles with a diesel particulate filter will now have to pass new tests. What the stricter MOT test means for you That filter captures and stores exhaust soot to reduce emissions. A diesel vehicle will fail its MOT if there is smoke of any colour coming from the exhaust or there is any evidence that the diesel particulate filter has been tampered with. These faults will be classed as ""major"" under the new categories. Defects found during an MOT will be categorised as: Dangerous: Fail. The vehicle is a ""direct and immediate risk to road safety or has a serious impact on the environment"". It must not be driven until it has been repaired. Major: Fail. The fault ""may affect the vehicle's safety, put other road users at risk or have an impact on the environment"". The car, van or motorcycle must be repaired immediately. Minor: Pass. A defect has ""no significant effect on the safety of the vehicle or impact on the environment"". It must be repaired as soon as possible Advisory: Pass. A defect could become more serious in the future. ""Monitor and repair it if necessary."" Pass: The vehicle meets the minimum legal standard. Named originally after the Ministry of Transport, there are 30 million MOT tests a year in Britain. And around a third of them fail with indicators and lights being the most common cause. Now that number is set to rise - initially at least - as the test gets a bit tougher. It will be especially strenuous on diesel cars, and that affects around half of UK road users. Most newer diesels have a particulate filter but if the tester sees any smoke at all emerging from the exhaust, that car will fail. If someone has tampered with the filter, that too is a 'fail'. The advice as ever is to regularly check for any leaks, low tyre pressure and that all your lights - front, side and back - are working.  Fail to prepare: prepare to fail. A wider range of a vehicle's parts will also be tested including: the tyres, to check if they are underinflated; the brake fluid, to investigate if it has been contaminated; and fluid leaks, to make sure they do not pose an environmental risk. Thefull list can be found here.,external There is good news for drivers of classic cars - vehicles more than 40 years old, or produced before 31 May 1978, will not need an MOT. A spokesman for the RAC motoring organisation said these vehicles were often ""rare classics"" and well maintained by their owners so were ""deemed not to be such a road risk"".

"The UK's corporate regulatory system is ""not fit for purpose"" and would be overhauled under a Labour government, John McDonnell is to say. In a speech, the shadow chancellor will say there ""will be no more Carillion scandals on Labour's watch"". The firm, which employed about 20,000 people in the UK, collapsed with Â£1.5bn of debts in January. Two MPs' committees said in a report this week it showed regulators were ""toothless"". Carillion 'had rotten corporate culture' Carillion 'aggressively managed' accounts Carillion: Six charts that explain what happened They also called for a potential break-up of the big four audit firms, after they ""waved through"" the indebted construction firm's accounts. Speaking at a Labour event in central London, Mr McDonnell will say that he has commissioned an independent review of the UK's corporate auditing and accounting regime, by Prem Sikka, professor of accounting and finance at Sheffield University. His findings will then be fed into Labour proposals to reform the regulatory system. Mr McDonnell will say the MPs' report this week ""once again highlighted the catastrophic failure and inadequacy of our regulatory system"". Mr McDonnell says there must be a crackdown on poor auditing and accountancy practice Accounting and pensions regulators ""have once more failed to do their jobs"" he will say, and the lack of transparency means ""nobody ever seems to be punished for their transgressions"". He will criticise the ""regulatory maze"" - citing 29 regulators for the financial sector alone - for creating opportunities for ""waste, duplication, obfuscation and buck-passing"". ""That is why it is essential that we have a crackdown on poor practices in the accounting and auditing industry,"" he will say. ""Under the next Labour government the big six firms will not be allowed to continue to act like a cartel that prevents new market entrants or drive down standards. ""Otherwise it will further infect the rest of our economy and business community. "" Thousands of people lost their jobs when Carillion collapsed in January. It held numerous public contracts, such as the maintenance of schools and prisons, all of which had to be brought under government control, at a cost to the taxpayer. In a damning100-page report,externallast week, the Work and Pensions and the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy committees said: The Big Four accountancy firms were a ""cosy club incapable of providing the degree of independent challenge needed"" Carillion's collapse had exposed ""systemic flaws"" in corporate Britain and showed regulators were ""toothless"" ""Carillion could happen again, and soon"" But Carillion's former finance director, Richard Adam, said he rejected the committees' conclusions and objected to quotes in the MPs' report, which he said had been misattributed to him. And former chairman Philip Green said the board had ""always strived to act in the interests of the company and all its stakeholders"". Responding to the MPs' report, a KPMG spokesman said it had conducted its audits of Carillion ""appropriately"", and Ernst & Young said it was ""disappointed that despite all efforts the business was not rescued"". Deloitte said it was ""disappointed"" with the committees' conclusions while PwC said it was helping save ""thousands of jobs"" as the official receiver.

"Moqtada Sadr has ruled himself out of becoming prime minister An alliance headed by a former Shia militia chief who led two uprisings against the US-led invasion of Iraq has won the parliamentary elections. But Moqtada Sadr, who is also staunchly opposed to Iranian involvement in the country, cannot become prime minister as he did not stand as a candidate. However, he is expected to play a major role in forming the new government. The party of outgoing PM Haider al-Abadi was pushed into third place, behind a pro-Iranian alliance. Mr Sadr's win represents a remarkable comeback for the cleric after he was sidelined for years by Iranian-backed rivals. These elections were the first since Iraq declared victory over the Islamic State group in December. Some 5,000 American troops remain in Iraq supporting local forces, which were fighting IS. What are the differences between Sunni and Shia Muslims? Final results released by the election commission early on Saturday showed Mr Sadr's Saeroun bloc won 54 seats, compared to Prime Minister Abadi's 42. The pro-Iranian Fatah alliance went into second place with 47 seats. But Mr Sadr's nationalist alliance - formed of his own party and six mainly secular groups, including the Iraqi communist party - failed to win more than 55 of the 329 seats up for grabs, so he faces the complex task of drawing together a governing coalition. Mr Sadr, who made his name as a militia chief fighting US forces after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, has reinvented himself as an anti-corruption champion, and also campaigned on a platform of investing in public services. On Monday, Mr Sadr's supporters had celebrated as early results came in The defeat of Mr Abadi's alliance came as many voters expressed dissatisfaction with corruption in public life. Despite his poor showing, he may yet return as prime minister after negotiations which must now be completed within 90 days to form a new government. The war against âIslamic Stateâ in maps and charts Iraq country profile Whoever is named prime minister will have to oversee the reconstruction of Iraq following the battle against IS, which seized control of large parts of the country in 2014. International donors pledged $30bn (Â£22bn) at a conference in February but Iraqi officials have estimated that as much as $100bn is required. More than 20,000 homes and businesses were destroyed in the second city of Mosul alone. More than two million Iraqis are still displaced across the country and IS militants continue to mount deadly attacks despite having lost control of the territory they once held. Turnout at the 12 May election was only 44.5% - much lower than in previous polls. Driving the risky roads of Iraq. Video, 00:10:41Driving the risky roads of Iraq Return to Mosul after IS.

"The Church of Scotland has moved a step closer to allowing ministers to conduct same-sex marriages. The Kirk's General Assembly backed a motion which tasked a committee with drafting church law on the issue. Its legal questions committee was asked to report back to the annual meeting of the decision-making body in 2020. Under the plans outlined in the motion, ministers and deacons would be allowed to conduct same-sex weddings ""if they wish"". The motion was carried by 345 votes to 170 and the result was announced on the Church of Scotland's official Twitter feed. The move comes almost a year after theScottish Episcopal Church voted to allow gay couples to marry in church. It became the first major Christian church in the UK to allow same-sex marriage.

A minister of Dornoch Cathedral in the Highlands,she was previously known for presiding over the wedding of Madonna and Guy Ritchiein 2000. Her appointment came in the year the Church marks the 50th anniversary of the ordination of women. The 59-year-old is the fourth woman to hold the title. Speaking before the ceremony, Mrs Brown said: ""The prospect of becoming Moderator of the General Assembly is slightly scary but incredibly exciting. ""It will be a challenging year but I am really up for it. ""As the ambassador for the Church, I am really looking forward to meeting people and hearing their stories as my theme is 'walking with'. ""I also want to highlight how important walking, which is an ancient spiritual tradition, is for our physical and mental health, an issue that I plan to raise with political leaders."" The Right Rev Susan Brown was installed as Moderator in a ceremony at the beginning of the General Assembly. Nicola Sturgeon and the Duke of Buccleuch, who represented the Queen as Lord High Commissioner to the Assembly, were at the ceremony. During the ceremony her predecessor, the Very Rev Dr Derek Browning, welcomed the new Moderator saying, ""full-blooded, soul-warming, kind-hearted parish ministry,"" has been the centre of her work. ""On this year when we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the ordination of women to the Ministry of Word and Sacrament it is particularly special that you as a committed parish minister will be our Moderator,"" Dr Browning added, ""It is also a delight that having served in two Highland parishes that you will also represent that important part of our country for the first time in a number of years."" About 730 commissioners from Scotland and beyond are attending the General Assembly on The Mound to make decisions on matters of Kirk policy and governance. The Duke of Buccleuch was given an official welcome to Holyrood Palace in Edinburgh on Friday During the Church of Scotland's Assembly on Tuesday, a public procession will take place to mark 50 years of the ordination of women within the Kirk. Nearly 300 people are expected to take part in the event in central Edinburgh, exactly half a century on from the Assembly's decision in 1968 to permit women to become ministers. Wednesday brings discussion of a report from the Church and Society Council, which proposes the Kirk ""should, over the next two years, divest from fossil fuel companies unless there is clear evidence that these companies are themselves modifying their policy and practice"". The General Assembly meets for a week every year in May. It has the authority to make laws determining how the Church operates and can also act as the Kirk's highest court.

"An H-6K bomber is believed to have landed on Woody Island China has for the first time landed bombers on disputed territory in the South China Sea, its air force said, prompting fresh US warnings that it is destabilising the region. The long-range H-6K bomber was among those which took part in drills on islands and reefs to improve China's ability to ""reach all territory"". The sea, a key trade route, is subject to overlapping claims by six countries. China has been accused of militarising the sea to support its vast claims. The latest move could provoke new tension in the region. Beijing's defence ministry did not specify where the bombers landed but said the training involved simulated strikes against sea targets. An H-6K pilot, Ge Daqing, was quoted in a statement as saying that the training ""sharpens our courage and enhances our capabilities in a real war"". Why is the South China Sea contentious? China's 'globalised' military power China's Xi inspects massive naval display Experts fromthe Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative,external(AMTI) said a video from the Chinese Communist Party's People's Daily newspaper showed an H-6K landing and taking off from a base on Woody Island, the largest of the Paracel Islands.

Woody Island, which China calls Yongxing, is also claimed by Vietnam and Taiwan. Although China has deployed fighter jets to Woody Island in the past, this is the first time bombers have landed on a South China Sea island, the AMTI said. It added that an H-6K could reach all of South East Asia from the island. Analysts say bombers will likely soon land in the Spratly Islands further south, where runways and hangars have been built on reefs. From there H-6Ks could reach northern Australia or US bases on Guam, says the AMTI. The US has sailed warships close to artificial islands built by Beijing in the South China Sea to challenge what it sees as Chinese efforts to restrict freedom of navigation in a strategically important area. Vietnam 'scraps new offshore oil project' A Pentagon spokesman told Reuters news agency that the US ""remains committed to a free and open Indo-Pacific"".

"Hirozaku Kore-eda received the festival's highest honour The Japanese family drama Shoplifters has received the coveted award for best film, the Palme d'Or, at the Cannes Film Festival. The runner-up Grand Prix went to US director Spike Lee's anti-racism satire BlacKkKlansman. Led by actor Cate Blanchett, the jury announced their top picks after what was a politically charged festival. Disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, who sparked the #MeToo movement, was particularly called out. Spike Lee tells world to âwake upâ Cannes Film Festival: 10 films to watch Whitney 'sexually abused', film claims While presenting an award, Italian actress Asia Argento said: ""I want to make a prediction: Harvey Weinstein will never be welcomed here ever again."" This video can not be played ""We know who you are, and we're not going to allow you to get away with it any longer."" Mr Weinstein, who has since retreated from the spotlight, has denied all allegations of non-consensual sexual activity. Only three female directors were among the 21 in contention for the festival's 71st top prize, many of which drew critical acclaim ahead of the famously unpredictable awards night. Choosing the winner of festival's top gong, which went to Japanese indie filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda, was ""painful"" in light of the strong competition, said Blanchett.

"This video can not be played The plane came down in a field near Havana's main airport Cuban officials say they have found one of the two black boxes from a plane that crashed near Havana airport, killing more than 100 people, in ""good condition"". Transport Minister Adel Yzquierdo says he hopes the second device will be recovered soon. He revised the official death toll up to 110 people, including 11 foreigners. Three women survived the crash, but are said to be in a critical condition with serious burns. The incident is Cuba's worst air disaster in decades, and two days of national mourning began on Saturday. Officials said investigators are combing through the wreckage of the plane, a Boeing 737 which was nearly 40 years old, at the field where it crashed some 20km (12 miles) south of the Cuban capital. The black box which has already been recovered will hold key flight data and information about what happened to the plane. Cuba country profile Major air disasters timeline Mr Yzquierdo told journalists that the 110 dead included 99 Cubans, six Mexican crew members, two tourists from Argentina, one from Mexico, and two passengers from Western Sahara. The Argentine couple were named by their government as Dora Beatriz Cifuentes and Oscar Hugo Almaras, both in their sixties. Several victims' relatives have travelled to Havana to help identify the deceased. The first secretary of Communist Party in HolguÃ­n comforts relatives of the crash victims Those coming from HolguÃ­n - the plane's intended destination - and other eastern parts of Cuba made the 700km (435-mile) trip on buses, escorted by the National Revolutionary Police, EFE news agency reported. President Miguel Diaz-Canel has visited the morgue where the victims are being identified. Cuban authorities do not plan to release the full list of the dead until all victims' families have been informed. The Boeing 737-201 crashed at 12:08 (16:08 GMT) on Friday, shortly after taking off from Havana on an internal flight to HolguÃ­n. It's too early to say what caused the crash, but eyewitnesses on the ground described seeing the jet burst into flames before crashing into a field close to a wooded area near the airport. Wreckage was spread over a large area ""I saw it taking off,"" supermarket worker Jose Luis told the AFP news agency. ""All of a sudden, it made a turn, and went down. We were all amazed."" ""We heard an explosion and then saw a big cloud of smoke go up,"" Gilberto Menendez, who runs a restaurant near the crash site, told Reuters. Mexico's transport department said on its website that ""during take-off (the plane) apparently suffered a problem and dived to the ground"". Boeing said that it was ready to send a technical team to Cuba, ""as permitted under US law and at the direction of the US National Transportation Safety Board and Cuban authorities"". A US trade embargo has been in force against Cuba for many decades. Four people initially survived the crash but one died after being taken to hospital, the director of Havana's Calixto Garcia hospital, Carlos Alberto Martinez, told Reuters. The three survivors are all women, according to Cuban Communist Party newspaper Granma: one aged between 18 and 25, one in her thirties and the third aged 39. A survivor of the plane crash attended by emergency workers ""She is alive but very burnt and swollen,"" one of the women's relatives at the hospital told Reuters. By Will Grant, BBC Cuba Correspondent Two days of national mourning have begun, with the entire island sharing a little of the pain of the many families affected by the disaster. But in their grief, people also want answers. They are demanding an explanation as to why a routine flight from Havana came crashing down in a field barely a minute after it took off, with over 100 passengers and crew on board. The country's new President, Miguel Diaz-Canel, faces his first real test in providing those answers. He visited the crash site to thank the emergency services and announced an investigation was already under way. Flags are flying at half-mast in Cuba as the island grieves the disaster It emerged that the previous President, RaÃºl Castro, was recuperating from minor surgery on a hernia, and he too expressed his condolences to the victims' families. The families of the survivors face an anxious wait to see if they will pull through, and their countrymen are praying that at least some will have survived this catastrophe. The plane had been leased to state airline Cubana de AviaciÃ³n by the Mexican company Aerolineas Damojh. The Mexican authorities said the plane was built in 1979 and had been successfully inspected last November. Mexico earlier said it was sending two civil aviation specialists to join the investigation. Aerolineas Damojh, also known as Global Air, has three planes in operation. Crowds of shocked onlookers gathered at the crash site According to industry research,last year was the safest in history for commercial airline travelwith no passenger jet crashes. But there have been several serious air disasters this year. Last month, a military plane crashed shortly after take-off in Algeria, killing more than 250 people In February, a Saratov Airlines plane crashed near Moscow, killing 71 people In March, a US-Bangla Airlines flight crashed in Kathmandu, Nepal; 51 people died Cuba's deadliest air crash was in 1989, when a Soviet-made Ilyushin-62M passenger plane crashed near Havana, killing 126 people on board and another 24 people on the ground.

"This video can not be played US Bishop wows with wedding address American Bishop Michael Curry has captured the world's attention with along and powerful addressat the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. The Chicago-born bishop spoke passionately about the power of love, quoting Dr Martin Luther King Jr. ""There's power in love, don't underestimate it,"" he said. The wide-ranging and colourful speech was seen as a significant break from tradition. The Most Reverend Michael Curry became the first black presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church - like the Church of England, part of the Anglican Communion - when he was appointed in 2015. He has spoken out on social justice issues in the past, including LGBT rights and sexual abuse. The address, replete with historical references, had churchgoers, including David Beckham and the Duchess of Cornwall smiling. Others appeared transfixed. The bride and groom, who invited Bishop Curry to speak, sat near the preacher and held hands as they watched him speak. Prince Harry and Meghan married at Windsor Follow the wedding live This video can not be played Watch Bishop Curry's 14-minute sermon in full Bishop Curry addressed the audience as ""brothers and sisters"". ""When love is the way, we will let justice roll down like a mighty stream and righteousness like an ever-flowing brook,"" he said, quoting the bible and raising his arms. ""When love is the way, poverty will become history. When love is the way, the Earth will be a sanctuary."" He continued, referencing the African-American spiritual song Down by the Riverside, which was sung by slaves: ""When love is the way, we will lay down our swords and shields down by the riverside to study war no more. ""When love is the way, there's plenty good room, plenty good room for all of God's children. ""Because when love is the way, we actually treat each other, well, like we're actually family.""

Bishop Curry spoke at length in the last part of his speech about fire, quoting the late French philosopher and Jesuit priest Pierre Teilhard de Chardin. The Frenchman, he said, had ""suggested that the discovery and harnessing of fire was one of the great technological discoveries of human history"". He then listed the many uses of fire, from cooking food, to aviation, to ""broadcasting this wedding around the world"". The preacher later returned to de Chardin, who he said had argued that ""if humanity ever captured the energy of love, it would be the second time in history that we have discovered fire"". When we discover the ""redemptive power of love"", he said, ""we will make of this old world, a new world"". Talking to the bride and groom, he finished his speech by saying: ""My brother, my sister, God love you, God bless you, and may God hold us all in those almighty hands of love."" He was ordained as a priest in 1978, is the presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church and has spoken on issues including social justice, immigration policy and marriage equality He most recently campaigned for the creation of family day care providers, educational centres and investment in inner-city neighbourhoods in all three of his parish ministries - North Carolina, Ohio, and Maryland In North Carolina, he helped to refocus the church's development goals to fund malaria nets to save more than 100,000 lives Bishop Curry defended the Episcopal Church's move to allow same sex couples to marry in church in 2015, which caused some churches to cut ties The US Episcopal Church is one of only two Anglican churches worldwide that allow gay marriage in church - the other being the Scottish Episcopal Church Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

"This video can not be played Watch Bishop Curry's 14-minute sermon in full Bishop Michael Curry - the first black presiding bishop of the US Episcopal Church - gave a rousing sermon at the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. Here is his speech in full: ""And now in the name of our loving, liberating and life-giving God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Amen. ""From the Song of Solomon, in the Bible: Set me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm; for love is strong as death, passion fierce as the grave. Its flashes are flashes of fire, a raging flame. Many waters cannot quench love, neither can floods drown it. ""The late Dr Martin Luther King Jr once said, and I quote: 'We must discover the power of love, the redemptive power of love. And when we do that, we will make of this old world a new world, for love is the only way.' ""There's power in love. Don't underestimate it. Don't even over-sentimentalise it. There's power, power in love. Who is Bishop Michael Curry? Royal wedding in pictures Look of love: Harry lifts the veil ""If you don't believe me, think about a time when you first fell in love. The whole world seemed to centre around you and your beloved. ""Oh there's power, power in love. Not just in its romantic forms, but any form, any shape of love. There's a certain sense in which when you are loved, and you know it, when someone cares for you, and you know it, when you love and you show it - it actually feels right. ""There is something right about it. And there's a reason for it. The reason has to do with the source. We were made by a power of love, and our lives were meant - and are meant - to be lived in that love. That's why we are here. ""Ultimately, the source of love is God himself: the source of all of our lives. There's an old medieval poem that says: 'Where true love is found, God himself is there'. ""The New Testament says it this way: 'Beloved, let us love one another, because love is of God, and those who love are born of God and know God. Those who do not love do not know God.' Why? 'For God is love.' ""There's power in love. There's power in love to help and heal when nothing else can. ""There's power in love to lift up and liberate when nothing else will. ""There's power in love to show us the way to live. ""Set me as a seal on your heart... a seal on your arm, for love is as strong as death. ""But love is not only about a young couple. Now the power of love is demonstrated by the fact that we're all here. Two young people fell in love, and we all showed up. ""But it's not just for and about a young couple, who we rejoice with. It's more than that. ""Jesus of Nazareth on one occasion was asked by a lawyer to sum up the essence of the teachings of Moses, and he went back and he reached back into the Hebrew scriptures, to Deuteronomy and Leviticus, and Jesus said: 'You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, all your mind and all your strength. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like it: Love your neighbour as yourself.' ""And then in Matthew's version, he added, he said: 'On these two, love of God and love of neighbour, hang all the law, all the prophets, everything that Moses wrote, everything in the holy prophets, everything in the scriptures, everything that God has been trying to tell the world... love God, love your neighbours, and while you're at it, love yourself.' ""No. ""Someone once said that Jesus began the most revolutionary movement in human history. ""A movement grounded in the unconditional love of God for the world - and a movement mandating people to live that love, and in so doing to change not only their lives but the very life of the world itself. ""I'm talking about power. Real power. Power to change the world. ""If you don't believe me, well, there were some old slaves in America's Antebellum South who explained the dynamic power of love and why it has the power to transform. ""They explained it this way. They sang a spiritual, even in the midst of their captivity. It's one that says 'There is a balm in Gilead...' a healing balm, something that can make things right. ""'There is a balm in Gilead to make the wounded whole, there is a balm in Gilead to heal the sin-sick soul.' ""And one of the stanzas actually explains why. They said: 'If you cannot preach like Peter, and you cannot pray like Paul, you just tell the love of Jesus, how he died to save us all.""' ""Oh, that's the balm in Gilead! This way of love, it is the way of life. They got it. He died to save us all. ""He didn't die for anything he could get out of it. Jesus did not get an honorary doctorate for dying. He didn't... he wasn't getting anything out of it. He gave up his life, he sacrificed his life, for the good of others, for the good of the other, for the wellbeing of the world... for us. ""That's what love is. Love is not selfish and self-centred. Love can be sacrificial, and in so doing, becomes redemptive. And that way of unselfish, sacrificial, redemptive love changes lives, and it can change this world. ""If you don't believe me, just stop and imagine. Think and imagine a world where love is the way."" ""Imagine our homes and families where love is the way. Imagine neighbourhoods and communities where love is the way. ""Imagine governments and nations where love is the way. Imagine business and commerce where this love is the way. ""Imagine this tired old world where love is the way. When love is the way - unselfish, sacrificial, redemptive. ""When love is the way, then no child will go to bed hungry in this world ever again. ""When love is the way, we will let justice roll down like a mighty stream and righteousness like an ever-flowing brook. ""When love is the way, poverty will become history. When love is the way, the earth will be a sanctuary. ""When love is the way, we will lay down our swords and shields, down by the riverside, to study war no more. ""When love is the way, there's plenty good room - plenty good room - for all of God's children. ""Because when love is the way, we actually treat each other, well... like we are actually family. ""When love is the way, we know that God is the source of us all, and we are brothers and sisters, children of God. ""My brothers and sisters, that's a new heaven, a new earth, a new world, a new human family. ""And let me tell you something, old Solomon was right in the Old Testament: that's fire. ""Pierre Teilhard de Chardin - and with this I will sit down, we gotta get you all married - French Jesuit Pierre Teilhard de Chardin was arguably one of the great minds, great spirits of the 20th century. ""Jesuit, Roman Catholic priest, scientist, a scholar, a mystic. ""In some of his writings, he said, from his scientific background as well as his theological one, in some of his writings he said - as others have - that the discovery, or invention, or harnessing of fire was one of the great scientific and technological discoveries in all of human history. ""Fire to a great extent made human civilisation possible. Fire made it possible to cook food and to provide sanitary ways of eating which reduced the spread of disease in its time. ""Fire made it possible to heat warm environments and thereby made human migration around the world a possibility, even into colder climates. ""Fire made it possible - there was no Bronze Age without fire, no Iron Age without fire, no Industrial Revolution without fire. ""The advances of fire and technology are greatly dependent on the human ability and capacity to take fire and use it for human good. ""Anybody get here in a car today? An automobile? Nod your heads if you did - I know there were some carriages. But those of us who came in cars, fire - the controlled, harnessed fire - made that possible. ""I know that the Bible says, and I believe it, that Jesus walked on the water. But I have to tell you, I did not walk across the Atlantic Ocean to get here. ""Controlled fire in that plane got me here. Fire makes it possible for us to text and tweet and email and Instagram and Facebook and socially be dysfunctional with each other. ""Fire makes all of that possible, and de Chardin said fire was one of the greatest discoveries in all of human history. ""And he then went on to say that if humanity ever harnesses the energy of fire again, if humanity ever captures the energy of love - it will be the second time in history that we have discovered fire. ""Dr King was right: we must discover love - the redemptive power of love. And when we do that, we will make of this old world, a new world.

"Janet Daby was chosen from a shortlist made up of only black and ethnic minority women Members of the Labour Party have selected Janet Daby to stand in the Lewisham East by-election. Ms Daby was chosen after hustings in south-east London on Saturday froma shortlist made up of only black and ethnic minority women. She beat Sakina Sheikh and Claudia Webbe to run as the party's candidate for the by-election on 14 June. Brenda Dacres pulled out of the contest on Friday because of health reasons. Ms Daby said it was an ""honour"" to be put forward to run for Parliament. Jeremy Corbyn congratulated Ms Daby and said she would make a ""great advocate"" for people in Lewisham. Heidi Alexander is Sadiq Khan's new deputy mayor for transport The by-election was sparked by the resignation of Heidi Alexander, who is going to work for London Mayor Sadiq Khan. Ms Alexander won the south-east London constituency by more than 21,000 votes in last year's general election, with the Conservatives second and Liberal Democrats third. She is to become London's new deputy mayor for transport. Janet Daby's selection will be seen as a boost for the Labour Party's centrists. Her views on Brexit put her at odds with party leader Jeremy Corbyn. He has ruled out remaining in the single market - but Ms Daby was cheered by Labour members as she told them she was ""pro-EU"" and wanted to ""stay in the single market and customs union"". Heidi Alexander claimed Jeremy Corbyn's shadow cabinet was dysfunctional when she quit it. So there had been speculation that she might be replaced with a more left-wing candidate. But Sakina Sheikh, who was backed by Momentum and is thought to be a favourite of Corbyn's, along with Claudia Webbe - who had the support of several unions - both lost by a long way. Ms Daby received more than 60% of the vote.

"Northern services operate across the North East, North West and Yorkshire Train services across large parts of the north of England are set to undergo a major change this weekend. Rail routes covered by Northern will see current train times and stopping patterns change from Sunday. Arriva Rail North Ltd, which operates the Northern franchise, says 90% of the services will be affected and there may be some disruption. The firm operates services across the north from Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield and Newcastle. Northern said it was ""a significant operational challenge"" and the biggest change in many years. It said passengers should check their travel arrangements before embarking on a journey. Northern said it expected some localised disruption to services The company said there would be an extra 1,300 services added to the network. Northern's train planners said their efforts were hampered by an electrification delay on parts of the routes ""leaving less than four months to fully re-plan our May 2018 timetable, less than half the normal time required"". A spokesman said: ""This is a significant operational challenge, and given the late nature of the planning for this, we do expect some localised service disruption, which could happen at very short notice while the new timetable beds in. ""We will continue to do everything we can to ensure we minimise any service disruption and keep customers informed. ""Over the last four weeks we have been focused on ensuring our customers know that timetables are changing with a 'check before you travel' message across stations, trains and online channels.""

"Louie and Derek Edyvean celebrated their diamond wedding anniversary in January A 1950s love letter has been returned to the woman who wrote it to her future husband more than 60 years ago. Louie Edyvean, 79, put it in a sugar jar with her marriage certificate but gave it to a charity shop by mistake after downsizing five years ago. The china pot was bought by Cornwall resident, Cathy Davies, who gave it to her friend Lizzie Dixon. She found the love letter after accidentally smashing the jar on the ground at her home in Roche. More on this story and other Cornwall news Ms Davies put photos of the love letter and marriage certificate on a local Facebook group page, and says hundreds of people replied offering to help track the couple down. A member of their family spotted the post within five hours of it being posted and got in touch. The letter was put in a jar and accidentally given to a charity shop ""I never thought we'd find them,"" she said. ""To actually find the couple was amazing. ""A friend of mine rang me and said, 'I think I know the daughter-in-law'. She was called Michelle Edyvean, which was the same surname as the elderly couple."" Ms Davies says she was then invited around to their house and personally delivered the love letter back to Derek and Louie. ""I went up the road, found their little bungalow, knocked on their door, and they invited me in,"" she said. ""They were the cutest couple. Derek and Louie Edyvean married at Roche Parish Church on 8 January 1958 ""Louie hugged me and said, 'You're the lady who's been looking for us'. ""I gave it to them and they couldn't thank me enough. I left in tears and cried all the way home."" Louie says she made a copy of their wedding certificate in 1961 after misplacing the original, which was in their antique sugar shaker all along. She celebrates her 80th birthday next week after writing the love letter when she was a teenager.

FT: Celtic 2-0 Motherwell Motherwell manager Stephen Robinson, speaking to BBC Scotland: ""Firstly, congratulations to Celtic, they're a very good side.
First 20 minutes we sat off them to much, we played with a bit of fear,
which was disappointing, but after that I can't faulty them. Second-half, the
fear factored disappeared, we created chances, hit the crossbar, potentially
through on goal. The young squad of players that we have here and I can't ask for
anything more. ""We did have chances, and thatâs credit to the players.
Playing against a very good Celtic side, the difference in finances is
incredible. He scores the first goal and itâs a super finish, that's the
difference in the sides in terms of quality. From there, theyâre in control. The
performance in the second half made me very proud, to go toe-to-toe with
Celtic. We maybe regret the first 20 minutes. ""[At half-time] we said, 'stop playing with fear, youâre giving them too much respect'. We stood
off them for the two goals, when youâre playing against top-class footballers.
This is a huge learning curve for our players. ""Weâve had a terrific season, from where weâve come from. We
only stayed up last season in the second last game. To be in two cup finals
and one point off the top six, weâre a small club and this bunch of players
have done the fans proud. ""We have to [build on it] and we have our eyes on players we feel can turn us
into a top-six side."" Motherwell manager Stephen Robinson was proud of his team's second-half display FT: Celtic 2-0 Motherwell Celtic captain Scott Brown, speaking to BBC Scotland: ""This is the best feeling that you can ever experience.  Look at these fans, who turn up every week.  Hampden seems to be a special place for us. ""A double Treble - I don't think anyone would have had that on the cards when the manager first came in. But it just shows you where hard work can get you. ""We have made the Champions League [group stages] for the last two years, and we have got to do that again next year. ""We have to go again. It all starts again in four weeks. Some players will be going to play international games but the rest of us will chill and recharge the batteries.

"Sean Combs, also known as Diddy, is a rapper, record producer and entrepreneur Rapper Sean ""Diddy"" Combs, also known by his stage names Puff Daddy and P Diddy, has been revealed as the buyer of a Kerry James Marshall painting that fetched $21.1m (Â£15.6m) at auction. The sum is believed to be the most ever paid for a work by a living African-American artist. The painting, Past Times, depicts black Americans picnicking, waterskiing and listening to music in a Chicago park. It measures up at an imposing four metres (13ft) wide. Jack Shainman, Marshall's gallerist and art dealer, confirmed the identity of the new owner. ""I know that this work has found a home in a collection with purpose and an eye toward preserving legacy - that of Sean Combs - and that means a lot,"" he told the New York Times. Past Times sold for more than 800 times its 1997 price of $25,000 Diddy went to Sotheby's auction house to view the picture, according to the paper. The painting had been expected to fetch around $8m. In the event, its price was four times higher than the previous record for a work by 62-year-old Marshall. Chicago's Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority (MPEA) sold Past Times for more than 800 times what it paid in 1997, the year the work was completed. The MPEA originally bought the piece for $25,000 from the Los Angeles Koplin Gallery. Marshall is known for painting scenes of African-American life. He was born in Alabama, and grew up in south central Los Angeles before moving to Chicago. The artist received a MacArthur Foundation genius grant in 1997, and previously taught at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Diddy supports The Weeknd over 'racist' ad Diddy's plan to buy Panthers called 'brilliant' Kerry James Marshall: Challenging racism in art history The MPEA is required to spend a share of its budget on art for public display, and currently owns more than 100 pieces. Past Times had hung in the McCormick Place Convention Centre in Chicago, gradually accruing value. Sotheby's said there had been four bidders for the picture. Combs' winning bid was apparently delivered by phone.

"The children of Meghan Markle's close friends have been given key roles in the wedding What does Meghan Markle's life in Toronto tell us about the new royal? For years, she lived in the Canadian city relatively under the radar. That was before she became publicly linked to Prince Harry - arguably the world's most eligible bachelor - and subsequently the most googled actress of 2016. The Los Angeles native had settled into her adopted city of Toronto where Suits, the cable legal drama in which she co-stars, is filmed. The American actress would spend time at Trinity Bellwoods Park in the trendy West Queen West neighbourhood, dine at restaurants near her home in the Annex, grab groceries at specialty shops in Kensington Market, and have drinks at the private Soho House club downtown. Harry condemns press 'abuse' of girlfriend 'Meghan who?' LA shrugs over Harry's girlfriend Here are five things about the actress's Toronto life that offer a hint into what she might be like as a royal. Vancouver's Amanda Dishaw, who runs the blog Meghan's Mirror along with US-based colleague Christine O'Brien, says Ms Markle is ""very loyal to a very small group of friends"". Even before meeting Prince Harry, Ms Markle was embraced by a duo that Toronto Life magazine called the city's""most polished power couple"",external- Jessica and Ben Mulroney. Ben Mulroney is the son of former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and is a prominent TV host and entertainment reporter - Canada's answer to Ryan Seacrest. Ben and Jessica Mulroney, pictured in 2009 Jessica Mulroney, with a career in fashion and marketing, is from one of Montreal's most prominent clans, a descendant of the founder of a national shoe retail empire. She is also fashion adviser to Sophie Gregoire-Trudeau, the wife of current Canadian PM Justin Trudeau. Until Ms Markle dialled down her once robust social media presence - her last Instagram post was in April, the same month she shuttered her lifestyle blog The Tig - the two regularly appeared in cameos on each other's feeds. They've posted pictures of themselves at a Toronto Blue Jays baseball game, holidaying on the Italian island of Capri and spending a weekend evening drinking wine on the sofa. The Mulroneys and Trudeaus - Canada's pre-eminent political families - are close, and Ms Markle knows the Trudeaus through her humanitarian work. Mulroney's children- Ivy, four, and seven-year-old twins Brian and John - are among the bridesmaids and pageboys at the wedding. It is also rumoured that the Canadian stylist was involved in helping to plan the event. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

She was photographed arriving at Heathrow Airport with her family on Tuesday night. Former society columnist Rosemary Sexton says the two families are ""Canadian royalty"". ""It seems only fitting that she hangs around with [them]."" Mr Trudeau, like other political leaders, was not invited to the wedding. The actress is also good friends with Markus Anderson, the Toronto-based global membership director of Soho House, who is rumoured to have introduced the couple and was another regular on Ms Markle's Instagram. This video can not be played Meghan Markle's 'low profile' in Toronto Dishaw says she's been surprised at how few paparazzi photographs have been taken of the actress in recent months. The photos that have emerged often show Ms Markle on the way to the gym, shopping with Mulroney, or walking her dogs. Despite her high-profile friendships, she seems to prefer more private spots over the fashionable ones.  She's often spotted heading to hot yoga at one of the more reasonably priced studios in the city. Dishaw says Ms Markle goes to places more focused on ""the overall sense of wellness rather than the trendiest kind of yoga classes"". Meghan Markle and Prince Harry hold hands during their first public appearance as a couple ""In London she won't be going to the really trendy popular places in Belgravia. She'll probably try to find a place a little bit quieter,"" she says. The actress' style is a casual and minimalist California-girl-meets-downtown-Toronto style that Ms Markle has dubbed ""Aspirational Girl Next Door,external"". It's a uniform - jeans, simple shirts, flats, a nice coat - and Dishaw says ""she's gotten it down to an art"". Ms Markle didn't veer from the look during her first public appearance at the Invictus Games with Prince Harry, even wearing a favourite pair of distressed jeans Dishaw says are still ""hotly, hotly debated"" on the blog. Meghan Markle's oxblood jacket from Canadian designer Mackage quickly sold out Her style, which includes accessible pieces from chain stores, is easy to imitate. UK fashion boosted by 'Kate effect' Meghan Markle on her love for Harry Ms Markle already had a reputation as a fashion maven from her now defunct lifestyle site, The Tig. She also helped design two quickly sold-out capsule collections for Canadian retailer Reitmans. The collections were made up of affordable pieces based on her personal style and that of her Suits character, Rachel Zane. Dishaw and her colleague also run a site dedicated to Ms Markle's future sister-in-law, the Duchess of Cambridge. Dishaw says she's seen interest move from what the duchess wears to ""really getting on board with the Meghan style"". ""It's really interesting for us to see this shift in royal fandom - this big shift towards Meghan and distancing themselves from Kate,"" she says. Why the fashion industry loves Meghan Markle Last December, staff at Canadian fashion house Mackage came into work to find a single item - a double breasted coat Ms Markle wore during her first public appearance after the engagement announcement - had sold out overnight. A white coat she wore by another Canadian brand, Line the Label, also flew off shelves. The coat has since been christened ""The Meghan"". Meghan Markle and Prince Harry share a joke Ms Markle has become increasingly used to fame during her acting career. In 2016,she told the Toronto Star newspaper,externalthat when she first moved to the city, Suits wasn't even airing in the country. She said she spent her first two years going to yoga studio ""Moksha downtown and trolling for girlfriends"". As Suits got broader exposure, including a Netflix deal, she described ""getting used to being famous so far from my support and comfort systems"" as an odd experience that brought the cast closer together. Over time, she has proven adept at crafting a polished social media image, garnering 1.9 million Instagram followers. Ms Markle also appears comfortable in the public eye, sharing her passion for philanthropy and interest in social activism. She is a global ambassador for World Vision Canada and involved with the One Young World summits and the UN's gender equality campaign. Ms Markle (second from left) with Suits cast in 2014 She has written openly about her struggle in Hollywood as a biracial actress. ""I've never wanted to be a lady who lunches - I've always wanted to be a woman who works,"" she has said on The Tig. ""And this type of work is what feeds my soul, and fuels my purpose."" Still, the actress told Vanity Fair earlier this year the media storm that comes with dating Prince Harry ""has its challenges"". ""There's always been some titillation for society watchers to see members of very different social classes fall in love - it's a Cinderella fairy tale coming true,"" says Sexton. But the former columnist says Ms Markle seems to have ""a poise and a sweetness and a calm demeanour that should stand her in good stead to go into the Royal Family"". Unlike Prince Harry, the actress wasn't raised with media scrutiny. This video can not be played Meghan Markle: Meet Prince Harry's girlfriend She grew up in a middle-class family in LA - her father was a lighting director, her mother is a social worker and yoga instructor - and has spoken about struggling to make ends meet in her early acting days. Ms Markle graduated from Northwestern Universitywith a double major in theatre and international studies. ""There's a stability to a normal middle-class person that perhaps the skittish temperamental blueblood might not possess,"" Sexton says. Ms Markle has spoken about how she has embraced Canada as a second home, a place she has lived in for nine months of the year for seven years, even getting used to Canadian winters. Dishaw says that her blog's American readers like to think of  Ms Markle as the next Grace Kelly - an American princess - but that Canadian visitors like to argue she came into her own while living in Toronto. That connection to Canada is something Dishaw believes ""plays in her favour with the Royal family"", given the country's status as a Commonwealth nation. Sexton says ""it wouldn't matter a hoot who Prince Harry had on his arm as far as Canadian society goes, because he or she would be welcomed with open arms"". But she says that having a Canadian - even an adopted one - marrying royalty is ""a real feather in our cap"".

A fanfare will sound at the bride's arrival. Introit Eternal source of light divine, With double warmth thy beams display, And with distinguished glory shine, To add a lustre to this day. Congregation remain standing. Dean of Windsor greets congregation The Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you: and also with you. God is love, and those who live in love live in God and God lives in them. 1 John 4.16 All sit. The Dean of Windsor reads: In the presence of God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, we have come together to witness the marriage of Henry Charles Albert David and Rachel Meghan, to pray for God's blessing on them, to share their joy and to celebrate their love. Marriage is a gift of God in creation through which husband and wife may know the grace of God. It is given that as man and woman grow together in love and trust, they shall be united with one another in heart, body and mind, as Christ is united with his bride, the Church. The gift of marriage brings husband and wife together in the delight and tenderness of sexual union and joyful commitment to the end of their lives. It is given as the foundation of family life in which children are born and nurtured and in which each member of the family, in good times and in bad, may find strength, companionship and comfort, and grow to maturity in love. Marriage is a way of life made holy by God, and blessed by the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ with those celebrating a wedding at Cana in Galilee. Marriage is a sign of unity and loyalty which all should uphold and honour. It enriches society and strengthens community. No one should enter into it lightly or selfishly but reverently and responsibly in the sight of almighty God. Harry and Meghan are now to enter this way of life. They will each give their consent to the other and make solemn vows, and in token of this they will each give and receive a ring. We pray with them that the Holy Spirit will guide and strengthen them, that they may fulfil God's purposes for the whole of their earthly life together. All stand. Hymn Lord of All Hopefulness All remain standing as the Archbishop leads: The declarations First, I am required to ask anyone present who knows a reason why these persons may not lawfully marry, to declare it now. The Archbishop says to the Couple: The vows you are about to take are to be made in the presence of God, who is judge of all and knows all the secrets of our hearts; therefore if either of you knows a reason why you may not lawfully marry, you must declare it now. The Archbishop says to the bridegroom: Harry, will you take Meghan to be your wife? Will you love her, comfort her, honour and protect her, and, forsaking all others, be faithful to her as long as you both shall live? He answers: I will. The Archbishop says to the bride: Meghan, will you take Harry to be your husband? Will you love him, comfort him, honour and protect him, and, forsaking all others, be faithful to him as long as you both shall live? She answers: I will. The Archbishop says to the congregation: Will you, the families and friends of Harry and Meghan, support and uphold them in their marriage now and in the years to come? All answer: We will. The Archbishop invites the people to pray, silence is kept and he says: The collect God our Father, from the beginning  you have blessed creation with abundant life. Pour out your blessings upon Harry and Meghan, that they may be joined in mutual love and companionship, in holiness and commitment to each other. We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ your Son, who is alive and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. Amen. All sit. Reading From the Song of Solomon: read by The Lady Jane Fellowes from the Nave My beloved speaks and says to me: ""Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away; for now the winter is past, the rain is over and gone. The flowers appear on the earth; the time of singing has come, and the voice of the turtle-dove is heard in our land. The fig tree puts forth its figs, and the vines are in blossom; they give forth fragrance. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away."" Set me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm; for love is strong as death, passion fierce as the grave. Its flashes are flashes of fire, a raging flame. Many waters cannot quench love, neither can floods drown it. If one offered for love all the wealth of one's house, it would be utterly scorned.

Karen Gibson and The Kingdom Choir will sing 'Stand By Me' from the West End of The Chapel. The vows Harry and Meghan, I now invite you to join hands and make your vows, in the presence of God and his people. The bride and bridegroom face each other and join hands. The bridegroom says: I Harry, take you, Meghan, to be my wife, to have and to hold from, this day forward; for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death us do part; according to God's holy law. In the presence of God I make this vow. The Bride says: I Meghan, take you, Harry, to be my husband, to have and to hold, from this day forward; for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death us do part; according to God's holy law.

The giving of the rings Heavenly Father, by your blessing let these rings be to Harry and Meghan a symbol of unending love and faithfulness, to remind them of the vow and covenant which they have made this day, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. The bridegroom places the ring on the fourth finger of the bride's left hand and, holding it there, says: Meghan, I give you this ring as a sign of our marriage. With my body I honour you, all that I am I give to you, and all that I have I share with you, within the love of God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit. They loose hands and the bride places a ring on the fourth finger of the bridegroom's left hand and, holding it there, says: Harry, I give you this ring as a sign of our marriage.

Lord of life and love: hear our prayer. May the hospitality of their home bring refreshment and joy to all around them; may their love overflow to neighbours in need and embrace those in distress. Lord of life and love: hear our prayer. May they discern in your word order and purpose for their lives; and may the power of your Holy Spirit lead them in truth and defend them in adversity. Lord of life and love: hear our prayer. May they nurture their family with devotion, see their children grow in body, mind and spirit and come at last to the end of their lives with hearts content and in joyful anticipation of heaven. Lord of life and love: hear our prayer. Let us pray with confidence as our Saviour has taught us Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name; your kingdom come, your will be done; on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread.

"For some, Saturday will be spent preparing for street parties, wearing the union jack as a cape, and praying that the weather behaves itself. But for others it can be a reminder of a hatred of crowds, bunting and the pomp and ceremony that goes with a royal wedding. If you're in the latter camp, here are some different ways to spend the day. For those who want to be glued to the TV, but don't want to watch the royal wedding, the FA Cup offers a brilliant alternative. Sports lovers can revel in the grudge match between Chelsea and Man Utd. But with a 17:15 BST (10:15 ET) kick-off, it will be hard to avoid the royal wedding altogether as the nuptials commence at midday. The royal wedding has also caused havoc with the Duke of Cambridge's schedule. As president of the Football Association, Prince William usually hands out the FA Cup to the winning side. But he will miss this year's match at Wembley in favour of his brother's wedding. And for those who follow Scottish football, the Scottish Cup final between Celtic and Motherwell will kick-off at 15:00. Gough's cave in the Cheddar Gorge is a perfect place to get away from social media Wherever you go on royal wedding day, you may be unable to escape the nuptials because of news updates and photos posted to your mobile phone by friends on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. One option might be to go underground - literally. The lack of phone signal in the cave systems around Cheddar Gorge in Somerset provide the perfect location for those trying to avoid posts about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. It's also a fun and educational day out for the whole family. If you're unable to get to Somerset, White Scar Cave in North Yorkshire offers a suitable alternative. If you're in the US, Mammoth Cave in Kentucky has more than 400 miles of passageways, and no phone signal. A non-Brit's guide to the royal wedding Royal wedding: All you need to know If you don't have a set of subterranean caves to peruse, maybe the cinema is the best way to go. You can sit in the darkened room for two hours, safe in the knowledge that the audience shouldn't be following events in Windsor. In the UK and US weekend releases include Deadpool 2, the drama On Chesil Beach and a family comedy about a canine police dog called Show Dogs. News of Meghan Markle's marriage to Prince Harry has piqued America's interest in the Royal Family. Coverage of the events in Windsor on the main TV networks has even surpassed the UK's offerings, making it increasingly difficult for Royal-sceptics in the USA to avoid the nuptials. Luckily basketball offers a welcome distraction for some, as the Boston Celtics take on the Cleveland Cavaliers in the east conference play-offs. The Celtics lead in the series 2-0, but the Cavs have reached the final the last three years, and have NBA All-Star LeBron James at their disposal. The game starts at 20:30 ET. One of the best ways to avoid coverage of the royal wedding is to hunker down under your duvet, and indulge in a bit of extra sleep. For US readers this will be a piece of cake as the wedding begins at 07:00 ET, but people in the UK using this method might want to invest in an eye mask as the ceremony will start at midday. Channel 4 sitcom The Windsors will be spoofing Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's wedding If your blood boiled at the thought of the royal wedding, you might be able to take some solace in the fact that it's being mocked on national television. Channel 4 comedy The Windsors, a parody soap opera of the royal family, will return for a one-off special to commemorate Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's special day. It was already broadcast on Tuesday, but there will be a re-run of the sitcom at midnight on Saturday. This video can not be played Josh Warrington has no respect for 'cocky' IBF champion Lee Selby If matrimonial harmony is not your thing, watching two men slug it out in a boxing match might be a viable alternative. Lee Selby, otherwise known as The Barry Boy Assassin, will be defending his IBF world featherweight title against Josh Warrington. The fight is taking place on Saturday night at Elland Road in Leeds. If you want to be around others who don't want anything to do with the royal wedding, Republic, who campaign for the abolition of the monarchy, are hosting an international convention on the future of republican movements across Europe. The event in London will include MPs Tommy Sheppard and Emma Dent Coad, and speakers from Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain and Sweden. Allow Twitter content?

During coverage of royal occasions, there can sometimes be hours where nothing of any significance happens. Veteran broadcaster and BBC News presenter Simon McCoy is well versed in covering the royals and has won plaudits online for his blunt presenting patter.

Parents with an anathema for all things royal can take their children out to do chores A royal wedding might make some want to eat their teeth but it can come with its advantages. While many people crowd around TVs and revel in eating tepid finger food, others can take advantage of the lack of queues.

"This video can not be played US Bishop wows with wedding address American Bishop Michael Curry has captured the world's attention with along and powerful addressat the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. The Chicago-born bishop spoke passionately about the power of love, quoting Dr Martin Luther King Jr. ""There's power in love, don't underestimate it,"" he said. The wide-ranging and colourful speech was seen as a significant break from tradition. The Most Reverend Michael Curry became the first black presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church - like the Church of England, part of the Anglican Communion - when he was appointed in 2015. He has spoken out on social justice issues in the past, including LGBT rights and sexual abuse. The address, replete with historical references, had churchgoers, including David Beckham and the Duchess of Cornwall smiling. Others appeared transfixed. The bride and groom, who invited Bishop Curry to speak, sat near the preacher and held hands as they watched him speak. Prince Harry and Meghan married at Windsor Follow the wedding live This video can not be played Watch Bishop Curry's 14-minute sermon in full Bishop Curry addressed the audience as ""brothers and sisters"". ""When love is the way, we will let justice roll down like a mighty stream and righteousness like an ever-flowing brook,"" he said, quoting the bible and raising his arms. ""When love is the way, poverty will become history. When love is the way, the Earth will be a sanctuary."" He continued, referencing the African-American spiritual song Down by the Riverside, which was sung by slaves: ""When love is the way, we will lay down our swords and shields down by the riverside to study war no more. ""When love is the way, there's plenty good room, plenty good room for all of God's children. ""Because when love is the way, we actually treat each other, well, like we're actually family."" Royal wedding in pictures In pictures: The guests Meghan's dress in detail But Bishop Curry appeared to realise he may have gone on speaking for too long, saying towards the end of the speech that he had better wrap up, as ""we gotta get you all married!""

Bishop Curry spoke at length in the last part of his speech about fire, quoting the late French philosopher and Jesuit priest Pierre Teilhard de Chardin. The Frenchman, he said, had ""suggested that the discovery and harnessing of fire was one of the great technological discoveries of human history"". He then listed the many uses of fire, from cooking food, to aviation, to ""broadcasting this wedding around the world"". The preacher later returned to de Chardin, who he said had argued that ""if humanity ever captured the energy of love, it would be the second time in history that we have discovered fire"". When we discover the ""redemptive power of love"", he said, ""we will make of this old world, a new world"". Talking to the bride and groom, he finished his speech by saying: ""My brother, my sister, God love you, God bless you, and may God hold us all in those almighty hands of love."" He was ordained as a priest in 1978, is the presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church and has spoken on issues including social justice, immigration policy and marriage equality He most recently campaigned for the creation of family day care providers, educational centres and investment in inner-city neighbourhoods in all three of his parish ministries - North Carolina, Ohio, and Maryland In North Carolina, he helped to refocus the church's development goals to fund malaria nets to save more than 100,000 lives Bishop Curry defended the Episcopal Church's move to allow same sex couples to marry in church in 2015, which caused some churches to cut ties The US Episcopal Church is one of only two Anglican churches worldwide that allow gay marriage in church - the other being the Scottish Episcopal Church Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

"""Yes Meghan, we will go to Sussex... maybe in October?"" While Prince Harry has spent enough time in the south-east of England to know a bit about Sussex, his American-born wife Meghan can be forgiven for being more in the dark. As the Duke and Duchess of Sussex prepare for their first visit to the county since being given the titles when they married in May, the BBC has produced this invaluable guide. Not much looks lovelier than a royal duchess on her wedding day, but this oozing, calorific number is pretty stiff competition even for Meghan. British stodge at its best, the Sussex pond pudding traditionally used an obscene amount of butter to create a melted ""pond"" of dairy gold when cut open. Suet is the raw, hard fat of cows or sheep found around the loins and kidneys. In the 1675 cookery book The Queen-like Closet, author Hannah Woolley describes a suet pastry case, filled with butter, boiled in a pudding cloth and served with fruit. It later became fashionable to put a whole lemon inside this classic pud - celebrity cooks including Delia Smith and Mary Berry both plump for the tang of citrus this approach provides. And as if one pudding wasn't enough, the county is also the home of banoffee pie, which was invented at The Hungry Monk restaurant in Jevington, East Sussex. How much dessert the image-conscious couple will be shovelling down remains to be seen The duchess's first solo project as as royal was acookbook in support of families affected by the Grenfell Tower fire, featuring those families' recipes. At the launch last month caramelised plum upside-down cake was on the menu - one of the recipes featured in the book - so it looks like sweet treats featuring fruit are a hit with the Duchess of Sussex. In a 2012 interview, the duchess - then plain old Ms Markle -mentioned chicken adobo and fish tacos as among her favourite foods,external, but the nearest thing she got to a dessert option was the revelation that she likes to nibble on cinnamon-laced watermelon. ""Just poke your tongue out. They won't notice we squashed the bluebells"" Although Harry might wish to carry on his grandmother's tradition of keeping corgis if,like his brother, he has a soft spot for spaniels then Sussex has the very breed. The Sussex spaniel is the rarest of all the spaniels and for years it was close to extinction. It's short and powerful, having been bred near Hastings specifically for working in the dense local terrain. We're hopeful that dog-lover Meghan will take to this little-known breed, especially as she has a canine-shaped hole in her life at the moment. She has two rescue dogs, a labrador-shepherd mix called Bogart and a beagle named Guy. But she had to leave Bogart in Canada, reportedly because he was too old for the big move. Is Bogart still smiling now Guy is gone? Harry and Meghan will need to invest in a decent pair of walking boots to enjoy Sussex's spectacular countryside. A huge 80% of the county is rural, and it contains the South Downs National Park, which covers more than 1,600 sq km and is the UK's newest national park. The round-headed rampion is also known as the Pride of Sussex In July, the vivid Pride of Sussex flower blooms, growing almost exclusively on the chalk grassland of the South Downs. It's perhaps too far into autumn for sunbathing now but in future summers the duke and duchess might like to flaunt their beach-ready bodies beside the seaside. Mr and Mrs Invisible enjoy the view of Brighton pier The county has mile upon mile of majestic and imposing coastline for the couple to enjoy, although many of its beaches might prove a little uncomfortable for Californian Meghan who will be more familiar with the sandy stretches of the Pacific coast than the shingle of Sussex. Possibly its most famous beachfront is in Brighton, although the royal couple would presumably prefer to steer clear of its nudist zone - which was the first public naturist beach in the UK. Of course there's more to the seaside than lounging in the sun or paddling in the surf. If the duke and duchess fancy a stirring constitutional to take in a bracing sniff of sea air, then they could do worse than visit the dramatic white cliff face and picture-perfect striped lighthouse on offer at Beachy Head. Beachy Head's name has nothing to do with beaches. It's a corruption of the French ""beau chef"" (beautiful headland) And if Meghan hankers for a stretch of sand to remind her of home, then we recommend she heads to West Wittering with its colourful beach huts. Meghan and Harry go head-to-head in netball shootout Duchess of Sussex launches cookbook for Grenfell Royal Wedding 2018: In Pictures Spot the Barbie garage There's no shortage of the great and good to rub shoulders with in Sussex, from the sharp-dressing former world champion boxer Chris Eubank, to the superstar DJ Fatboy Slim (Norman Cook to his mum). The Gruffalo author Julia Donaldson also lives in the county, while daytime TV favourite Holly Willoughby grew up in Brighton and Horsham. ""Meghan, you've come a long way, baby"" ""The Forces' Sweetheart"" Dame Vera Lynn, who toured the globe during World War Two singing to the troops, was born here - and still lives in the county at the grand age of 101. And Sherlock Holmes author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle lived in Sussex from 1907 to his death in 1930, writing a number of works in the county, including The Valley of Fear and His Last Bow. This video can not be played What the Duke and Duchess of Sussex need to know about Sussex ""Harry! Mind your eye!"" The Romans, the South Saxons (from whom the name derives - Suth-Seaxe means land of the South Saxons), and the Vikings all reigned supreme here until the most famous conqueror of the lot staged his successful invasion of England. In 1066 William of Normandy landed in Sussex to seize the throne, with the Battle of Hastings marking the bloody end for the last Anglo-Saxon ruler, King Harold II. The royals are known for their understated architecture While William the Conqueror didn't hang around here, Sussex would prove popular with the royal family in later centuries. In the late 1700s Harry's great-great-great-great-great uncle, King George IV (at this point still the Prince of Wales) built a magnificent seaside pleasure palace. Brighton's luxurious Royal Pavilion is one of the most architecturally striking buildings in Britain - and the couple will be getting a tour of it on Wednesday. As the resort was disliked by Queen Victoria, in 1850 the pavilion was sold to the town, and the building would go on to serve as a military hospital during World War One. ""Don't worry Meghan, this is completely normal"" Of course Sussex has more to offer than the rakish charms of Brighton. In Lewes, what began in the early 17th Century as a celebration of the defence of the Protestant King James, and the defeat of popery, has morphed into the biggest Bonfire Night in Britain. Costumes are a must for the 5 November gathering, so if the couple fancy donning a pair of Viking horns and applying some face paint, they could even have a cheeky night on the town undetected. Meghan goes on first solo engagement Duke and Duchess attend Royal Ascot Five royal wedding moments to remember The fans of Brighton & Hove Albion always mark ""throw your litter in the air"" day Sussex by the Sea has been adopted by fans of both Brighton & Hove Albion and and Sussex County Cricket Club. Written in 1907, it was used as a marching song by the Royal Sussex Regiment during World War One - something that might strike a chord with Harry, who has served with the British army in Afghanistan. ""And when you go to Sussex, Whoever you may be, You may tell them all that we stand or fall, For Sussex by the sea"" is tweaked by the fans of Premier League outfit Brighton to: ""Oh we're going up to win the cup, For Sussex by the sea"". So maybe the royal couple will pay a visit to The Amex to see Brighton play Harry's beloved Arsenal (even princes have flaws), who theybeat in March.? Though this season's fixture is on Boxing Day, so theymay have other plans.

"This video can not be played ""It broke my heart to see what was going on"" An exchange student from Pakistan is among the first named victims of a Texas high school shooting. Ten people were killed and 10 were injured at Santa Fe High School when a student opened fire. The suspect is Dimitrios Pagourtzis, 17. The embassy of Pakistan in Washington DC confirmed that student Sabika Sheikh was among the dead. Substitute teacher Cynthia Tisdale was also killed in the attack, her family told US media outlets. Mrs Tisdale's niece and brother-in-law both confirmed the news. Writing on Facebook, John Tisdale said his sister-in-law was an ""amazing person"". Sabika Sheikh, aged 17, had been on the Kennedy-Lugar Youth Exchange & Study Abroad programme (YES). The programme is run by the US state department, and was set up in the aftermath of the 11 September 2001 attacks to bring students from Muslim-majority nations to the US on a cultural exchange. Sabika Sheikh had been at the school for several months Her parents, Abdul Aziz and Farah Sheikh, told the BBC they heard about the shooting through television news. They said they confirmed their daughter's death within an hour by speaking to school administrators. Ms Sheikh's body would be returned to her home in Karachi early next week, they said. Other victims, believed to be mostly students, are expected to be identified by Texas authorities later on Saturday. The attacker, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, was arrested and charged with murder. He allegedly used a shotgun and a revolver taken from his father, who legally owned the weapons. Santa Fe High School shooting as it happened What we know about Texas shooting suspect America's gun culture in 10 charts Students said the shooter entered an art class and opened fire shortly before 08:00 (13:00 GMT) on Friday. There were 1,400 students in the school at the time of the attack. One student, Breanna Quintanilla, told AP that Mr Pagourtzis walked into the room, pointed at someone, and announced: ""I'm going to kill you."" Ms Quintanilla was wounded in her leg as she fled. This video can not be played How the Texas school shooting unfolded Officers stationed at the school engaged Mr Pagourtzis. One of them, John Barnes, was injured. He was in a critical condition and undergoing surgery, local media reported. Police also found information in the suspect's diary, and on his computer and mobile phone, suggesting that he planned the attack and intended to kill himself afterwards. This video can not be played Student: 'I just ran as fast as I could' Texas Governor Greg Abbott said the teenager ""gave himself up"" because ""he didn't have the courage to commit the suicide"". Mr Abbott also said ""various kinds of explosive devices"" had been found at the school, 40 miles (65km) south of Houston, and off-campus. They included ""a CO2 device"" and ""a Molotov cocktail"", he said. The high school is about 40 miles south of Houston So far this year, more than 5,000 people have died in shooting incidents in the United States, according to monitoring group the Gun Violence Archive. Hundreds of people gathered at sunset on Friday on a large open lawn near the school for a vigil. The sound of preachers and politicians was intermittently drowned out by wailing and sobs from attendees, the BBC's Paul Blake said. Christian Cardenas 10, helps Jaydon Johnson, eight, light a candle during the vigil President Donald Trump, speaking at a prison reform event at the White House, described the attack as ""absolutely horrific"". ""My administration is determined to do everything in our power to protect our students, secure our schools, and to keep weapons out of the hands of those who pose a threat to themselves, and to others,"" he said.

The Texas attack is the deadliest school shooting since a student opened fire in February at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, killing 17 people. That assault spawned a nationwide youth-led campaign for gun control, and a litany of proposed changes: President Trump moved to ban so-called bump stocks, used in last year's Las Vegas shooting Congress is considering the Stop School Violence Act to provide increased security such as metal detectors in schools Mr Trump has endorsed arming teachers- a long-held position of the National Rifle Association (NRA) Gun control advocates have criticised what they see as minor changesamid continued support for the NRA from leading politicians. The worst school shooting in US history occurred at Virginia Tech university in 2007, where 33 people were killed and 25 injured. There have been more deaths in US school shootings so far in 2018 than there have been deaths in the US military,according to an analysis by the Washington Post,external. Authorities said journals kept by Mr Pagourtzis, 17, showed that he planned to carry out the attack and intended to kill himself afterwards. But Mr Abbott told reporters that, unlike several previous mass shootings, authorities had not been alerted to Mr Pagourtzis before the attack on Friday.

""We have what are often categorized as red-flag warnings, and here, the red-flag warnings were either nonexistent or very imperceptible."" Mr Pagourtzis suggested in social media posts that he was an atheist and said: ""I hate politics"". On 30 April he posted a photograph of a T-shirt bearing the slogan ""Born to Kill"".

"Tensions between the UK and Argentina over the Falkland Islands have eased since 2015 Boris Johnson is to make the first visit by a British foreign secretary to Argentina for 25 years. Mr Johnson will seek to take advantage of the improvement in relations with Buenos Aires since President Mauricio Macri came to power in 2015. Mr Macri has talked of lifting curbs on oil, fishing and shipping around the Falkland Islands as tensions eased. Mr Johnson will also visit Peru and Chile, in an effort to boost post-Brexit trade, during the five-day tour. Mr Macri has promised a ""new kind of relationship"" with the UK following a decade of tensions over the Falklands Islands, a UK overseas territory located about 530km (330 miles) off Argentina's coast, over which Buenos Aires has long claimed sovereignty and whose invasion in 1982 led to a 74-day military conflict with the UK. His predecessors Nestor and Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner sought to isolate the Falklands economically, putting pressure on British and US companies not to drill for oil in the waters around the islands and requiring all vessels travelling between Argentina and the islands to seek prior permission. UK-Argentina co-operation on Falklands UK and Argentina sign war-dead deal Since Mr Macri came to power, greater dialogue between the countries has resulted in more direct flights between the islands and Argentina and a project to help identify the remains of unknown Argentine soldiers who died during the conflict and were buried on the islands. The UK is keen on deeper economic and political co-operation with Argentina but has insisted the question of the Falklands' sovereignty is not on the table. In 2013 the islandersvoted overwhelminglyto remain a UK territory. As well as holding talks with Mr Macri, Mr Johnson will attend a meeting of G20 foreign ministers in Buenos Aires. This is a precursor to a summit of world leaders in the country in November which will mark the end of Argentina's annual presidency of the body. During his trip to Peru - the first by a British foreign secretary since the 1960s - Mr Johnson will venture into the Amazonian rain forest to visit an animal rescue centre and a school, whose electricity and drinking water are provided by a UK-funded solar heating scheme. The focus of the final leg of his trip to Chile will be on trade, with the UK keen to increase its currently low level of exports to the country. Chile has a free trade agreement with the EU which the UK wants to roll over after Brexit. ""Latin America is a vibrant and dynamic part of the world that works closely with the UK on a number of issues including trade, security, science, infrastructure and education, among others,"" Mr Johnson said ahead of the trip.

"Louie and Derek Edyvean celebrated their diamond wedding anniversary in January A 1950s love letter has been returned to the woman who wrote it to her future husband more than 60 years ago. Louie Edyvean, 79, put it in a sugar jar with her marriage certificate but gave it to a charity shop by mistake after downsizing five years ago. The china pot was bought by Cornwall resident, Cathy Davies, who gave it to her friend Lizzie Dixon. She found the love letter after accidentally smashing the jar on the ground at her home in Roche. More on this story and other Cornwall news Ms Davies put photos of the love letter and marriage certificate on a local Facebook group page, and says hundreds of people replied offering to help track the couple down. A member of their family spotted the post within five hours of it being posted and got in touch. The letter was put in a jar and accidentally given to a charity shop ""I never thought we'd find them,"" she said. ""To actually find the couple was amazing. ""A friend of mine rang me and said, 'I think I know the daughter-in-law'. She was called Michelle Edyvean, which was the same surname as the elderly couple."" Ms Davies says she was then invited around to their house and personally delivered the love letter back to Derek and Louie. ""I went up the road, found their little bungalow, knocked on their door, and they invited me in,"" she said. ""They were the cutest couple. Derek and Louie Edyvean married at Roche Parish Church on 8 January 1958 ""Louie hugged me and said, 'You're the lady who's been looking for us'. ""I gave it to them and they couldn't thank me enough. I left in tears and cried all the way home."" Louie says she made a copy of their wedding certificate in 1961 after misplacing the original, which was in their antique sugar shaker all along. She celebrates her 80th birthday next week after writing the love letter when she was a teenager.

"A group of former cabinet ministers is planning a public intervention to try to show that the Conservative parliamentary party would support a ""sensible"" Brexit. Justine Greening, Amber Rudd and Damian Green want to show the prime minister that she would have sufficient support to face down Brexit hardliners in her party. Newsnight understands that their message has been supported in private by Julian Smith, the government chief whip. In a pointed intervention, Mr Smith reportedly told members of the cabinet's Brexit cabinet sub-committee that they should, according to one witness, ""get real"" about the numbers in parliament. Reality Check: What would 'no Brexit deal' look like? What is left to agree in the Brexit Treaty? UK promises 'significant' Brexit paper The former cabinet ministers, who supported Remain in the EU referendum, have decided to act after concluding that it will not be possible to agree a Brexit deal that is accepted by all wings of the Conservative parliamentary party. Talks with the Brexit-supporting European Research Group (ERG), led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, have persuaded members of the new group that there is little chance of finding common ground. The group has won the support of some former Leave supporters, though none of these is so far willing to go public. One senior Leaver supporting the new initiative told Newsnight: ""The prime minister will have to face down the ERG... maybe she also has to sack a cabinet minister."" In their discussions the group has decided that Theresa May has crucial numbers at Westminster at two levels: In the event of a vote of confidence in her leadership, the prime minister would have the support of at least half of the 316 Tory MPs. That would be enough to survive a confidence vote which the ERG could, theoretically, trigger with the support of just 48 MPs. Parliament as a whole would reject a no deal Brexit. It is calculated that up to 300 of the opposition and independent MPs would join at least 100 Tory MPs in voting down a no deal, passing the 322 MPs needed to secure a parliamentary majority. A no deal end to the Brexit negotiations is seen as unlikely. But members of the new group believe that highlighting the prospect of such scenario - and how it would be rejected in parliament - can be used to persuade Theresa May that she would have a strong hand if she decided to challenge MPs advocating a no deal. One senior figure in the new group told Newsnight: ""The prime minister is going to have to make a decision. If she comes down on the side of the ERG to keep 60 of them happy that will be unacceptable to us and our numbers are larger. ""In the coming weeks we will be showing what the mainstream is thinking - Leavers and Remainers. This is about identifying a locus, where the mainstream lies to allow the prime minister to land this in the right place."" This video can not be played ""Those that are arguing from an ideological perspective are in the wrong place,"" argues Antoinette Sandbach MP Antoinette Sandbach, the Conservative MP for Eddisbury who supported Remain, told Newsnight: ""The decision was taken [in the referendum] that we would leave the political institutions of the EU but not how. That question of how we leave is incredibly important and why we need a pragmatic Brexit that preserves that close economic partnership whilst leaving the political institutions."" Ms Sandbach criticised Boris Johnson who recently described the so called ""customs partnership"", which has been supported by Theresa May, as ""crazy"". The MP said: ""My constituents don't like cabinet ministers openly rubbishing the plans of the prime minister in public. They want a sensible and considered compromise. Those that are arguing from an ideological perspective are in the wrong place compared to the vast majority of us at Westminster."" Daniel Hannan, the Conservative MEP who was a prominent Leave campaigner, said that the vast majority of Conservative MPs want a Brexit to restore sovereign control to the UK but which also provides for the ""closest relationship with our European neighbours"". This video can not be played ""No deal is plainly better than a bad deal,"" argues Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan But Mr Hannan warned that the UK may be forced to accept a no deal. ""No deal is plainly better than a bad deal... Imagine that you were buying a car and you said to the car dealer: 'I am definitely going to walk out of this showroom with your vehicle, now let's sit down and haggle about the price.' That would be a ridiculous position."" A source in the ERG dismissed the proposed intervention. The source pointed out that seven Brexit-leaning Conservative MPs, who are not in the ERG, would withdraw their support from Theresa May if she negotiated a deal they found unacceptable. This would cancel out her parliamentary majority which she assembled last year with support from the DUP. Reality Check: What would 'no Brexit deal' look like?

"One of the activists detained had already been detained once before after filming her friend driving in 2013 Saudi authorities have arrested seven women's rights advocates, weeks before the kingdom is due to lift its ban on women driving, rights groups say. The reasons for the arrests were not clear, but activists say authorities are attempting to silence the women. The kingdom's state news channel reported that they had been arrested for contacts with a foreign power. Saudi Arabia has strict laws requiring women to seek male permission for various decisions and actions. Seven people in total have been detained, including two male activists. They include Loujain al-Hathloul and Eman al-Nafjan, who have all publicly opposed the driving ban, which is due to be lifted on 24 June. According to Human Rights Watch, both Ms Nafjan and Ms Hathloul signed a petition in 2016 to abolish the male guardianship system, which prevents women from travelling abroad, marrying or obtaining a passport without the permission of a male guardian. Ms Hathloul has been detained twice already, once in 2014 whenshe attempted to drive across the border from the United Arab Emirates. She served 73 days at a juvenile detention centre as a result, and documented many of her experiences on Twitter. Loujain al-Hathloul (far right) attended the One Young World Summit in Ottawa in 2016 alongside the new Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle (far left) She was detained briefly again in June 2017when she arrived at Dammam airport, in the east of Saudi Arabia, but was released several days later. The Saudi activist was ranked third in 2015's list of most powerful Arab women in the world, and has appeared alongside high-profile figures, such as the Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle, at the One Young World summit in 2016 for young leaders. Ms Nafjan also hit the headlines in 2013 when she filmed another female activist driving through the Saudi capital, before she was stopped by police. Ms Nafjan was released, but refused to sign a pledge that she would not drive again. Human Rights Watch says they were all rounded up on 15 May but the authorities have not given a reason for the arrests. The rights group says the activists had received phone calls from the royal court last September warning them ""not to speak to the media"". ""The calls were made the same day the authorities announced that they would lift the driving ban on women,"" it said in a statement. ""It appears the only 'crime' these activists committed was wanting women to drive before Mohammed bin Salman did,"" Human Rights Watch's Middle East director, Sarah Leah Whitson, said. Saudi Arabia lifted the driving ban on womenin September last year, with the reform set to come into effect next month. It is one of a number of recent reforms in the country credited to 32-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has spearheaded the Vision 2030 programme to diversify the economy away from oil and open up Saudi society. His reforms will also allow women to start a business without express permission from a man. But the changes have not been uneventful. In November last year, dozens of high-profile princes, businessmen and former and serving ministers were rounded up in an anti-corruption drive seen by many as a purge by the crown prince.

"St Ann's Square became the focus for tributes People can mark the first anniversary of the Manchester Arena attack on a tree trail planted in the city. Twenty-two people were killed by a suicide bomber at an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May last year. Members of the public are invited to attach messages to 28 trees planted between Victoria Station - near the concert venue - and St Ann's Square. Sir Richard Leese, leader of Manchester City Council, said it would be a ""moving and memorable sight"". The attack also left more than 800 people with physical and psychological injuries after suicide bomber Salman Abedi detonated a home-made device. Hundreds were injured after the Ariana Grande pop concert Known as Trees of Hope, the trail is part of a programme of events, including a cathedral service and national one-minute silence, to mark the first anniversary. Members of the public can write messages on specially designed tags to be attached to the Japanese maple trees until the evening of 27 May. Bomb victim's gran to be royal plus-one Ariana Grande: Manchester attack 'the worst of humanity' Arena bomb 'injured more than 800' Sir Richard said: ""It promises to be a moving and memorable sight, which will help people to reflect on last year's events."" Every message will be kept, along with last year's tributes, in an archive of the city's response to the attack, a council spokesperson said. Thousands gathered for a vigil outside Manchester Town Hall after the attack Compost made from some of last year's floral tributes will be used to nurture the trees, which will remain in the city centre. Any other tributes left in public spaces will be taken to be displayed at Wythenshawe Park. A minute's silence is to be held at the start of the Great Manchester 10k Run on Sunday afternoon.

"Leonard Finch, who was known as Len, was still racing his bike aged into his 80s A founding member of a cycle club who kept racing his bike aged into his 80s has died in a crash. Leonard Finch was killed when he was involved in a collision while out on his bike at Great Waldingfield, Suffolk, on Thursday. The 86-year-old was one of the ""skid kids"" whocompeted in cycle speedway on World War Two bomb sitesand he helped set up Cycle Club Sudbury. His family said he was ""truly one of the greats"". Suffolk Police said officers were called just before 15:00 BST to reports that a cyclist might have collided with a stationary lorry in Lavenham Road. Mr Finch died at the scene. In a statement, Mr Finch's family said: ""Len was always a great help and inspiration to all of us. ""He was always cheerful and friendly and would do anything for anyone - provided it was to do with cycling."" Mr Finch spent more than 70 years in the saddle He was still breaking records aged in his 80s Mr Finch, who was known as Len, grew up in wartime Walthamstow, north-east London, and started cycle speedway racing at the age of 16 in 1946.

"The change would stop clinics from receiving federal funds if they also provide abortion advice The Trump administration has issued a proposal to cut federal funding for organisations that offer or mention abortion to their patients. One such organisation, Planned Parenthood, said the proposal was ""dangerous"" and ""outrageous"" and would ""have devastating consequences"". Anti-abortion activists thanked US President Donald Trump for ""delivering on a key promise"". The plan will be reviewed by the White House Office of Management and Budget. A timeline and details of the Department and Health and Human Services proposal were not immediately available. Clinics that receive federal money from a family planning programme known as Title X will be banned from referring clients for abortion, discussing abortion with patients, or sharing space with abortion providers. If they do so, their funding will be withdrawn. The policy shift mirrorsthe Mexico City Policy, one of the first actions of the Trump administration, under which organisations abroad that receive US aid for family planning may not perform abortions, even with other funding.

Critics called that policy the ""global gag law"" because organisations felt they could not offer women full advice on family planning - they are calling this the ""domestic gag law"". How US abortion debate got to this point The debate: Both sides speak What does Trump's international abortion policy mean? Politically, it plants the abortion question in the middle of debates ahead of November's midterm elections. A programme for low-income patients, it provides $260m (â¬220m; Â£192m) a year in federal money to family planning services such as contraception and health checks. The amount of money available will not be reduced. The 1970 law that brought Title X into place makes it clear that its funds are not to be used for abortions. But programmes funded by it have over the years been located in the same place as abortion clinics, and have referred patients for abortions. An official told the Weekly Standard that the proposal would ""require a bright line of physical as well as financial separation,externalbetween Title X programmes and any programme or facility where abortion is performed, supported or referred for as a method of family planning"". Senators including Elizabeth Warren signed a letter opposing the move, calling it ""part of a broader assault by Republicans on the health, safety, and economic independence of women and their families"". The executive vice president of Planned Parenthood, Dawn Laguens, said in a statement that the change was ""designed to make it impossible for millions of patients to get birth control or preventive care"" and ""would have devastating consequences across the country"". This video can not be played Jeanne Mancini organises March for Life, a major anti-abortion rally in the US Marjorie Dannenfelser from the anti-abortion Susan B Anthony List thanked Mr Trump for ""taking action to disentangle taxpayers from the abortion business"". On the battle lines over US abortion No, there are other organisations affected, but Planned Parenthood has become something of a political issue in the US. A reproductive healthcare organisation with 700 clinics around the US, it provides contraception, STI testing, cancer screenings, breast examinations and - in some clinics - abortions. This video can not be played Why one woman decided to terminate her pregnancy - and defends Planned Parenthood Federal funds - through Medicaid and other low-income healthcare programmes - are almost always blocked from paying for abortion services anyway, but it has long been a demand of many conservatives in the US that taxpayers' money not be used to fund the organisation. This came to a head when anti-abortion organisation The Center for Medical Progress secretly recordeda Planned Parenthood official discussing how to obtain aborted foetal tissue for medical research,external, discussing details like how to ""crush"" the foetus in certain ways to preserve its organs. Anti-abortion groups said this proved Planned Parenthood was selling foetal parts for profit, but the group disputed this, saying foetal tissue is donated at the discretion of the woman having an abortion. What is Planned Parenthood? An estimated four million people a year use health centres funded by Title X. The change will not be limited to Planned Parenthood clinics. The US president has changed his mind on the issue over the years. He has gone from being pro-choice in 1999 to being against abortion today, although he says he would allow exceptions such as in the case of rape or incest. This video can not be played How Trump has changed his stance on abortion over the years On the presidential campaign trail, he said he believed ""some form of punishment"" should be in place for women who have abortions, if the practice is banned. But, after strong criticism, he released a statement saying that only the doctor or practitioner should be punished, not the woman. He refused to say whether he believed abortion was murder, but he later conceded that he could not disagree with the statement. Under his administration, Iowa and Mississippi have introduced new laws restricting abortion time limits to six and 15 weeks respectively. The Mississippi law was later blocked.

"Ed Sheeran had to pull out of a number of dates of his Asian tour after ""a bit of a bicycle accident"" Two members of hospital staff were disciplined for accessing Ed Sheeran's personal details with no legitimate reason, the BBC understands. Ipswich Hospital said a medical staff member was given a written warning and a member of admin staff was sacked. It said both cases of disciplinary action happened after 16 October, the date on which the singer was admitted to the hospital. Sheeran had broken his right wrist and left elbow.

"St Ann's Square became the focus for tributes People can mark the first anniversary of the Manchester Arena attack on a tree trail planted in the city. Twenty-two people were killed by a suicide bomber at an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May last year. Members of the public are invited to attach messages to 28 trees planted between Victoria Station - near the concert venue - and St Ann's Square. Sir Richard Leese, leader of Manchester City Council, said it would be a ""moving and memorable sight"". The attack also left more than 800 people with physical and psychological injuries after suicide bomber Salman Abedi detonated a home-made device. Hundreds were injured after the Ariana Grande pop concert Known as Trees of Hope, the trail is part of a programme of events, including a cathedral service and national one-minute silence, to mark the first anniversary. Members of the public can write messages on specially designed tags to be attached to the Japanese maple trees until the evening of 27 May. Bomb victim's gran to be royal plus-one Ariana Grande: Manchester attack 'the worst of humanity' Arena bomb 'injured more than 800' Sir Richard said: ""It promises to be a moving and memorable sight, which will help people to reflect on last year's events."" Every message will be kept, along with last year's tributes, in an archive of the city's response to the attack, a council spokesperson said. Thousands gathered for a vigil outside Manchester Town Hall after the attack Compost made from some of last year's floral tributes will be used to nurture the trees, which will remain in the city centre. Any other tributes left in public spaces will be taken to be displayed at Wythenshawe Park. A minute's silence is to be held at the start of the Great Manchester 10k Run on Sunday afternoon. Singers will also perform in Albert Square on the evening of 22 May, while song lyrics will be projected around St Ann's Square between 22 and 26 May.

"Every royal wedding is different. But every royal wedding is an opportunity, in some way, to relaunch the Royal Family. Big weddings like this come along pretty rarely and they are now the object of global fascination. So it represents a great opportunity to say: ""This is who the Royal Family are these days."" But this is a very different royal wedding. It's different because of the style of the arrangements for the day itself. From small things, like the cake (not a traditional big heavy fruitcake covered with bullet-proof icing), to bigger things, like a gospel choir performing at the service. To more remarkable decisions, like the invitation to 1,200 members of the public to enjoy the occasion in the grounds of Windsor Castle. The Royal Wedding is being embraced as a people's celebration After the death in 1997 of Prince Harry's mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, she was described by the-then Prime Minister Tony Blair as ""the people's princess"". This may not be ""the people's wedding"", but it is about as close to it as any royal wedding has got. Right from the start, the couple said they wanted to make this a more inclusive event - and they have done a fair bit, by royal standards, to make that happen. It will look and feel different from the royal weddings that came before. And, of course, the wedding is also different because of the bride - very different. Royal Wedding: the final countdown Previous royal weddings Meghan Markle: profile It's not that she is a commoner. There have now been a fair few non-aristocrats marrying into the family over the years. Nor is it that she is divorced, although it was only 82 years ago that a future king abdicated so that he could marry a divorcee - and 50-odd years ago that the late Princess Margaret relinquished the love of her life because he was divorced. Meghan Markle's family is not accustomed to the royal way of doing things Nor is it that Meghan is American - marrying foreigners is par for the course for the British Royal Family. The shambles over who would walk Ms Markle down the aisle is reminder of another, stark, difference - hers is a family, who don't appear to know the rules about becoming a member of the Royal Family, or - if they do - clearly couldn't care less. But it is the fact that she is, in her own words, ""biracial"" - that her mother is African American - that is breathtaking, some might say revolutionary, for the Royal Family. And there's more. She has (or had) a job! She has (or had) a public profile! She is a very effective communicator, arguably better than any member of the Royal Family. What's more, she is a self-confessed feminist, a high-profile member of the #MeToo generation. So the arrival of Meghan Markle marks a huge change for what is still a clearly traditional and, some would say, pretty hidebound institution. There has been talk of her modernising - or even saving - the monarchy. The Royal Family continuously needs to renew itself, and it has proved pretty adept at that. Ms Markle is certainly dragging them into the Instagram age, but just how much she can change it we will have to wait and see. She has said previously: ""I never wanted to be a lady who lunches, I always wanted to be a lady who works."" Well, the royal role is lunches. And teas. And opening hospitals and attending charity functions. And looking good, and nodding a lot, and not saying much beyond asking what people do and commenting on the weather. Don't get me wrong, it is important work - hard work, at times, often boring work, I imagine. But it is not what she is used to. So we wait to see - does Meghan change the Royal Family? Or does the Royal Family change her?

"So you weren't invited. Don't despair. Royal weddings are a global phenomenon. And hundreds of millions of people are expected to witness Prince Harry marry Meghan Markle in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, whether on television or online, or by listening to proceedings on the radio. The streets of Windsor, Berkshire, will also be lined with thousands of well-wishers hoping to catch a glimpse of the happy couple in person. So whether you're watching from your sofa, a community street party or a far-flung location, here's how to ensure the perfect view. Royal wedding: All you need to know Remember the previous royal weddings Nice day for a royal white wedding? A non-Brits guide to the royal wedding All the main UK broadcasters are devoting much of Saturday to the occasion. While the ceremony doesn't begin until 12:00 BST, there will be several hours of commentary beforehand - and that's even before the guests start to arrive. Special programmes begin onBBC Oneand the BBC News Channel and onSky,external(on Sky News and Sky One), starting at 09:00 BST.  The full coverage onITV,externalkicks off at 09:25. The coverage will be streamed live on theBBC News websiteor onBBC iPlayer. It is worth noting that cameras inside the chapel will provide the same pictures to all the networks, so once the ceremony starts, the footage will be identical across the channels, although they will keep their separate commentaries. The BBC haswaived the TV licence fee, meaning street parties and other special eventscan screen the wedding livewithout buying a licence. The wedding will also be covered on the BBC NewsFacebook page,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,externalaccounts throughout the day. On radio, Claire Balding will host live commentary from Windsor Castle onBBC Radio 4from 11:30 BST andRadio 5 livefrom 10:00 BST. Outside the UK, BBC America, BBC Canada and BBC World News will be broadcasting coverage. Or you can tune in on BBC World Service radio. In Windsor, viewing areas will be created along the procession route. There will be live entertainment in the town centre, which will be decorated with bunting and banners. Big screens showing live footage of the wedding will be shown on the Long Walk and in Alexandra Gardens in Windsor. At 13:00 BST, the newlyweds will travel through the town in the Ascot Landau carriage, which is used in official and ceremonial state events. The carriage will leave Castle Hill, travel through Windsor and then proceed up the Long Walk, all the way back to St George's Hall by Windsor Castle. Rail bosses advise that trains will be ""extremely busy"". Queuing systems will be introduced at several stations - most likely London Waterloo, Slough, Staines and the two stations in Windsor - to avoid overcrowding on platforms. Services between Windsor and Slough will run every 20 minutes, with trains increased from two carriages to four - the maximum that can operate on the local line. South Western Railway will double its direct Windsor services from London Waterloo to four per hour and use 10-carriage trains. Make sure you get there early, though - Thames Valley Police may order trains not to stop at Windsor if visitor numbers become a safety issue, and the wedding route could be closed off to latecomers. Passengers are also being asked to keep baggage to a minimum as security checks on excess luggage could delay journeys. People planning to travel by car are being warned by the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead tobook parking in advance,,externalas spaces are limited. Motorists should also be aware ofroad closures,externalalong the procession route which started at 22:00 BST on Friday.

"Moqtada Sadr has ruled himself out of becoming prime minister An alliance headed by a former Shia militia chief who led two uprisings against the US-led invasion of Iraq has won the parliamentary elections. But Moqtada Sadr, who is also staunchly opposed to Iranian involvement in the country, cannot become prime minister as he did not stand as a candidate. However, he is expected to play a major role in forming the new government. The party of outgoing PM Haider al-Abadi was pushed into third place, behind a pro-Iranian alliance. Mr Sadr's win represents a remarkable comeback for the cleric after he was sidelined for years by Iranian-backed rivals. These elections were the first since Iraq declared victory over the Islamic State group in December. Some 5,000 American troops remain in Iraq supporting local forces, which were fighting IS. What are the differences between Sunni and Shia Muslims? Final results released by the election commission early on Saturday showed Mr Sadr's Saeroun bloc won 54 seats, compared to Prime Minister Abadi's 42. The pro-Iranian Fatah alliance went into second place with 47 seats. But Mr Sadr's nationalist alliance - formed of his own party and six mainly secular groups, including the Iraqi communist party - failed to win more than 55 of the 329 seats up for grabs, so he faces the complex task of drawing together a governing coalition. Mr Sadr, who made his name as a militia chief fighting US forces after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, has reinvented himself as an anti-corruption champion, and also campaigned on a platform of investing in public services. On Monday, Mr Sadr's supporters had celebrated as early results came in The defeat of Mr Abadi's alliance came as many voters expressed dissatisfaction with corruption in public life. Despite his poor showing, he may yet return as prime minister after negotiations which must now be completed within 90 days to form a new government. The war against âIslamic Stateâ in maps and charts Iraq country profile Whoever is named prime minister will have to oversee the reconstruction of Iraq following the battle against IS, which seized control of large parts of the country in 2014. International donors pledged $30bn (Â£22bn) at a conference in February but Iraqi officials have estimated that as much as $100bn is required. More than 20,000 homes and businesses were destroyed in the second city of Mosul alone. More than two million Iraqis are still displaced across the country and IS militants continue to mount deadly attacks despite having lost control of the territory they once held. Turnout at the 12 May election was only 44.5% - much lower than in previous polls. Driving the risky roads of Iraq. Video, 00:10:41Driving the risky roads of Iraq Return to Mosul after IS.

"Sean Combs, also known as Diddy, is a rapper, record producer and entrepreneur Rapper Sean ""Diddy"" Combs, also known by his stage names Puff Daddy and P Diddy, has been revealed as the buyer of a Kerry James Marshall painting that fetched $21.1m (Â£15.6m) at auction. The sum is believed to be the most ever paid for a work by a living African-American artist. The painting, Past Times, depicts black Americans picnicking, waterskiing and listening to music in a Chicago park. It measures up at an imposing four metres (13ft) wide. Jack Shainman, Marshall's gallerist and art dealer, confirmed the identity of the new owner. ""I know that this work has found a home in a collection with purpose and an eye toward preserving legacy - that of Sean Combs - and that means a lot,"" he told the New York Times. Past Times sold for more than 800 times its 1997 price of $25,000 Diddy went to Sotheby's auction house to view the picture, according to the paper. The painting had been expected to fetch around $8m. In the event, its price was four times higher than the previous record for a work by 62-year-old Marshall. Chicago's Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority (MPEA) sold Past Times for more than 800 times what it paid in 1997, the year the work was completed. The MPEA originally bought the piece for $25,000 from the Los Angeles Koplin Gallery. Marshall is known for painting scenes of African-American life. He was born in Alabama, and grew up in south central Los Angeles before moving to Chicago. The artist received a MacArthur Foundation genius grant in 1997, and previously taught at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Diddy supports The Weeknd over 'racist' ad Diddy's plan to buy Panthers called 'brilliant' Kerry James Marshall: Challenging racism in art history The MPEA is required to spend a share of its budget on art for public display, and currently owns more than 100 pieces. Past Times had hung in the McCormick Place Convention Centre in Chicago, gradually accruing value. Sotheby's said there had been four bidders for the picture. Combs' winning bid was apparently delivered by phone.

"From choosing the cake to the flowers and even the chair-covers, anyone who's ever planned a wedding knows it can be eye-wateringly expensive. But when it comes to royal weddings - with all the VIPs, security and extra extravagance - the bill runs into millions. So what do we know about the expected cost of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding, and how much will the taxpayer be paying towards it? The wedding will be held in Windsor. And crowds in excess of 100,000 people are expected to descend on the town. Invitations have been sent to 600 guests, with a further 200 invited to the couple's evening reception On top of that, 1,200 members of the public will attend the grounds of Windsor Castle. Managing these sorts of numbers requires substantial planning. And security will almost certainly be the biggest single cost. In 2011, Â£6.35m was spent on security for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding The Home Office wouldn't comment when Reality Check contacted it, saying revealing policing costs could compromise ""national security"". Likewise, when we rang Thames Valley Police, it said: ""We aren't going to give you any data I'm afraid - even though we know you love numbers."" However, we do know Â£6.35m was spent by the Metropolitan Police (ie the taxpayer) on security for Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding. That's based on aFreedom of Information request released to the Press Association.,external But it's difficult to draw a direct comparison with Prince Harry and Ms Markle's wedding - the location and guest numbers are different. Kensington Palace hasn't released any details of what it plans to spend on the wedding. That's not really a surprise given that the official cost of Prince William and Catherine's wedding has never been revealed. That leaves us with unofficial estimates and as such they need to be treated with some caution. Bridebook.co.uk, a wedding planning service, saysthe total cost of the wedding could be Â£32m,external- including the cost of security. It put the cost of the cake at Â£50,000, the florist at Â£110,000, the catering at Â£286,000, and so on and so on. Reality Check contacted the company's owner, Hamish Shephard, to ask about the methodology used to arrive at the estimate. He said the Â£32m figure had been based on the assumption that the Royal Family had paid for everything at market rate. But in the absence of any official data, this is still guesswork - however well informed. For example, we don't know if suppliers would offer a substantial discount for the privilege of providing their services for a royal wedding. Ms Markle will walk down the aisle of St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle The cost of security for the wedding will be met by the taxpayer. Initially, Thames Valley Police will have to absorb the cost itself. But the force will be eligible to apply for special grant funding from the Home Office after the event in order to claim back some of the costs. Special grant funding is a separate pool of money forces can apply for if they have to police events outside their usual remit. Royal wedding 2018: all you need to know Queen to receive Â£6m pay increase from public funds Reality Check: What does the Queen cost us? As for the rest of the total, the Royal Family has said it will be paying for the private elements of the wedding. Every year the Royal Family gets a chunk of money from theannual Sovereign Grant,external, paid directly by the Treasury. The grant is calculated on a percentage of the profits from theCrown Estate portfolio,external, which includes much of London's West End. This year it's worth Â£82m. Some members of the Royal Family benefit from additional income. For example, Prince Charles gets money from the Duchy of Cornwall estate, a portfolio of land, property and financial investments. But it's not clear which ""pots"" the palace will choose to fund the wedding from. Republic, which campaigns for an elected head of state, and claims the overall cost of the monarchyis far higher than Â£82m,external, hassubmitted a petition,externalagainst taxpayers' money being spent on the wedding.

"One of the activists detained had already been detained once before after filming her friend driving in 2013 Saudi authorities have arrested seven women's rights advocates, weeks before the kingdom is due to lift its ban on women driving, rights groups say. The reasons for the arrests were not clear, but activists say authorities are attempting to silence the women. The kingdom's state news channel reported that they had been arrested for contacts with a foreign power. Saudi Arabia has strict laws requiring women to seek male permission for various decisions and actions. Seven people in total have been detained, including two male activists. They include Loujain al-Hathloul and Eman al-Nafjan, who have all publicly opposed the driving ban, which is due to be lifted on 24 June. According to Human Rights Watch, both Ms Nafjan and Ms Hathloul signed a petition in 2016 to abolish the male guardianship system, which prevents women from travelling abroad, marrying or obtaining a passport without the permission of a male guardian. Ms Hathloul has been detained twice already, once in 2014 whenshe attempted to drive across the border from the United Arab Emirates. She served 73 days at a juvenile detention centre as a result, and documented many of her experiences on Twitter. Loujain al-Hathloul (far right) attended the One Young World Summit in Ottawa in 2016 alongside the new Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle (far left) She was detained briefly again in June 2017when she arrived at Dammam airport, in the east of Saudi Arabia, but was released several days later. The Saudi activist was ranked third in 2015's list of most powerful Arab women in the world, and has appeared alongside high-profile figures, such as the Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle, at the One Young World summit in 2016 for young leaders. Ms Nafjan also hit the headlines in 2013 when she filmed another female activist driving through the Saudi capital, before she was stopped by police. Ms Nafjan was released, but refused to sign a pledge that she would not drive again. Human Rights Watch says they were all rounded up on 15 May but the authorities have not given a reason for the arrests. The rights group says the activists had received phone calls from the royal court last September warning them ""not to speak to the media"". ""The calls were made the same day the authorities announced that they would lift the driving ban on women,"" it said in a statement. ""It appears the only 'crime' these activists committed was wanting women to drive before Mohammed bin Salman did,"" Human Rights Watch's Middle East director, Sarah Leah Whitson, said. Saudi Arabia lifted the driving ban on womenin September last year, with the reform set to come into effect next month. It is one of a number of recent reforms in the country credited to 32-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has spearheaded the Vision 2030 programme to diversify the economy away from oil and open up Saudi society. His reforms will also allow women to start a business without express permission from a man. But the changes have not been uneventful. In November last year, dozens of high-profile princes, businessmen and former and serving ministers were rounded up in an anti-corruption drive seen by many as a purge by the crown prince.
