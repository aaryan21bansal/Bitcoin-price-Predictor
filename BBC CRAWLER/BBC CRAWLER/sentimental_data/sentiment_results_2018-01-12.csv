"Republican Congresswoman Mia Love is of Haitian descent US President Donald Trump has caused widespread anger by reportedly describing immigrants as coming from ""shithole countries"" during a White House meeting. He was apparently referring to Haiti, El Salvador and African countries. Mr Trump later tweeted that ""this was not the language used"". There are many examples of people from those countries making successful lives in the US and contributing to American society. Utah Republican CongresswomanMia Loveis of Haitian descent and called on Mr Trump to apologise for his comments. ""This behaviour is unacceptable from the leader of our nation,"" she said in a statement. In her biography, Ms Love recalls her parents - who moved to the US from Haiti in the 1970s - working hard to earn a living. Mia Love said President Trump's words were ""unkind, divisive and elitist"" She quotes her father saying: ""Mia, your mother and I never took a handout. You will not be a burden to society. You will give back."" Haitians account for less than 2% of the US foreign-born population, according to the Migration Policy Institute, but the numbers have increased in recent decades. Political and economic instability and natural disasters over several decades have left Haiti as the poorest nation in the Americas. Following the devastating 2010 earthquake that killed more than 200,000 people, the US offered Haitians Temporary Protected Status (TPS), but the Trump administration has said it will end the agreement. Carlos Castro, president and CEO of Todos Supermarket, is often held up as the archetypal self-made millionaire. He fled the civil war in El Salvador in 1979 and entered the US illegally, later being deported. But he returned and worked in a series of lowly jobs before becoming a legal resident in 1986. He then opened his first grocery store which grew into a successful chain now catering to Latino shoppers around Washington DC. The Trump administration has taken a tougher line with migrants from countries including El Salvador The US National Grocers' Association describe him as ""more than just an innovate entrepreneur, he's a mentor to many in the Hispanic community and fledging business owners"". Latest figures show about 1.3m Salvadoreans living in the US, according to the Migration Policy Institute. El Salvador is plagued by gang violence and has one of the world's highest murder rates. Criminal gangs, known as maras, were formed initially in Los Angeles in the 1980s by children of migrants escaping El Salvador's civil war. When the war ended in 1992 many returned home, taking the LA gang culture with them. Bozoma Saint John is based in San Francisco Bozoma Saint John, whose parents are from Ghana, is the chief brand officer at Uber and the former head of global consumer marketing at Apple Music. In a speech she made in 2016, Ms Saint John said she had been inspired by the personal journey that her father had made from being a musician in the Ghanaian army to graduating from a US college. US politicianIlhan Omarwas born in Somalia and moved to the US with her family when she was eight. In 2016 she was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives, becoming the first Somali-American Muslim legislator elected to office in the US. Politician Ilhan Omar's family were refugees from Somalia In her biography, she tells how her family fled Somalia's civil war and spent four years in a Kenyan refugee camp before emigrating to the US in the 1990s. ""As a single parent my father chose Minnesota for the promise of welcoming neighbours, a great education and economic security. We found that here,"" she said. Elon Musk once said that ""the more voices of reason that the president [Trump ] hears, the better"" Elon Musk, a South African-born inventor and entrepreneur, is the founder of SpaceX and the CEO of electric car-maker Tesla. He was born in Pretoria and moved to California in his 20s to study, becoming a US citizen in 2002. Mr Musk once described himself as ""nauseatingly pro-American"", adding: ""I would have come here from any country. The US is where great things are possible."" South African-born comedianTrevor Noah, who hosts the popular US satirical programme The Daily Show, has previously told the BBC that he believes Donald Trump ""prefers white people over black people"".

"This video can not be played A timeline of what Trump has said about the Iran deal US President Donald Trump says he is extending sanctions relief for Iran one last time so Europe and the US can fix the nuclear deal's ""terrible flaws"". The waiver he will sign suspends US sanctions on Iran for another 120 days. The White House wants EU signatories to agree permanent restrictions on Iran's uranium enrichment. Under the current deal they are set to expire in 2025. Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said it was a ""desperate attempt"" to undermine a ""solid"" deal. Germany said it would continue to call for the deal's full implementation and would consult on a ""common way forward"" with the UK and France. Mr Trump also wants Iran's ballistic missile programme to be addressed. Is Trump going to kill Iran deal? How sanctions have hit ordinary Iranians ""This is a last chance,"" the US president said in a statement on Friday. ""In the absence of such an agreement, the United States will not again waive sanctions in order to stay in the Iran nuclear deal. ""And if at any time I judge that such an agreement is not within reach, I will withdraw from the deal immediately."" Also on Friday, the US imposed separate sanctions against 14 Iranian individuals and entities it accuses of rights abuses, censorship and support for weapons proliferators. The US still maintains sanctions on Iran - independent of the nuclear deal - on matters such as terrorism, human rights and ballistic missile development. The landmark accord was signed between six global powers and Iran in 2015. It saw Iran agree to reduce uranium enrichment activity drastically, dispose of its enriched uranium stocks and modify a heavy water facility so it could not produce material suitable for a nuclear bomb. Iran nuclear deal: Key details Voices from Iran: 'We have the right to protest' In return, decades of international and US nuclear-related sanctions were suspended, and the US president must sign a waiver suspending them every 120 days. But Mr Trump has repeatedly criticised the deal - reached under his predecessor Barack Obama - as ""the worst ever"". Senior Trump administration officials briefed reporters on Friday to say the president will work with European partners to broker an agreement limiting Iran's ballistic missiles activities. Mr Trump is prepared to back a modification to the existing deal if it was made permanent, one official said. The president also wants the US Congress to amend a law on US participation in the nuclear deal, so that Washington could reimpose all sanctions if Iran breaches certain ""trigger points"". This will involve negotiations between the US and its European allies rather than talks with Iran, the official said. BBC state department correspondent Barbara Plett Usher is sceptical that any international agreement can be negotiated in 120 days. She says Iran is not interested in brokering a new deal, so Mr Trump will have either to back down or walk away. Analysis by Jonathan Marcus, BBCdiplomaticcorrespondent Some four months ago when President Trump refused to re-certify the Iran deal he passed the baton to Congress while keeping the agreement in place. This time he has put the ball in the Europeans' court expecting Britain, France and Germany to come up with some accord that will, as he sees it, fix the deal's shortcomings. While they worry about Iran's missile programmes and its regional activities, the Europeans believe the nuclear accord itself is working well. Furthermore even if they could come up with a follow-on agreement in a ludicrously short space of time, there is simply no chance of Iran agreeing to it. So in another four months we will be back exactly where we are now. Mr Trump will have the problematic task of either re-imposing sanctions - effectively killing the nuclear accord - or of having to extricate himself from a problem of his own making. In October, President Trump refused to certify that Iran was in compliance with the accord, accusing the country of ""not living up to the spirit"" of the pact. However, UN inspectors have certified nine times that Iran has not breached the deal. European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, who helped broker the agreement, said on Thursday that the accord is ""making the world safer"". She said it was also ""preventing a potential nuclear arms race in the region"". Iran said on Friday that Mr Trump was ""maliciously violating"" the deal. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said: ""Trump's policy & today's announcement amount to desperate attempts to undermine a solid multilateral agreement."" Tehran has vowed to stick to the accord as long as the other signatories respect it, but to ""shred"" it if Washington pulls out. Iran says the missiles it has tested are not designed to carry nuclear warheads and insists its nuclear programme is a peaceful one for energy purposes. After Mr Trump's announcement, Germany said it would ""continue to campaign for the full implementation of the nuclear agreement"". French President Emmanuel Macron phoned Mr Trump on Thursday to call for ""the strict application of the deal and the importance of all the signatories to respect it"". In Russia, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the pact was ""the result of a consensus among many parties"". The accord can be seen as ""either good or bad, but it is the only one that reflects this consensus,"" Mr Peskov said on Friday, ahead of Mr Trump's announcement.

"The stones, including the Black Prince's Ruby from the Imperial State Crown, were hidden in the tin and buried underground Gemstones from the crown jewels were hidden in a biscuit tin at Windsor Castle for safekeeping during World War Two,a BBC documentary will reveal. It was buried below a secret exit on the orders of King George VI to prevent the jewels falling into Nazi hands. Details of the mystery, unknown by the Queen, were discovered in letters from Sir Owen Morshead, the royal librarian, to Queen Mary, the mother of George VI. The Queen was told the details for the first time by presenter Alastair Bruce. A trapdoor to access the secret area where the tin was kept still exists today The remarkable story was unearthed for the BBC One programme by Oliver Urquhart Irvine, the librarian, and assistant keeper of the Queen's Archives. The stones, including the Black Prince's Ruby from the Imperial State Crown, were placed in the metal box and buried under a sally port, a secured entrance. Sir Owen's documents describe how a hole was dug in chalk earth, which had to be covered to hide it from enemy bombers, and two chambers with steel doors created. A trapdoor used to access the secret area at Windsor Castle, where the Queen spent her war years for safety, still exists today. In the documentary, the Queen also talks about the amusing trials and tribulations of being head of state - from the perils of wearing a heavy crown, to her robes sticking to a thick carpet pile. The Coronation is screened on BBC One at 8pm on Sunday 14 January 2018.

"Carillion is the UK's second largest construction firm and employs 43,000 people globally Troubled construction firm Carillion has denied reports lenders rejected a proposed rescue plan for the business. The firm, which is a key government contractor for projects including schools and prisons, said crunch talks with stakeholders were still ongoing. The firm is struggling under Â£1.5bn of debt, including a pension shortfall of Â£587m, raising fears about its future. Ministers are drawing up plans to take over prisons contracts worth Â£200m from Carillion,the BBC understands. Reports that creditors had turned down a potential rescue plan sent the firm's shares down by more than 28% on Friday. Administrator firms PwC and EY were also reported to have been put on standby as talks about the firm's future carry on. In a statement, Carillion said: ""Suggestions that Carillion's business plan has been rejected by stakeholders are incorrect."" It said the firm remained in constructive dialogue about short term financing while ""longer term discussions are continuing"". Carillion also said turnaround proposals on the table were likely to cost shareholders. Simon Jack: Carillion's uncertain future Where did it go wrong for Carillion? The government, the Pensions Regulator and representatives from the firm held crunch talks to discuss the firm's options on Friday. The company is the UK's second-largest construction company and a key government contractor. It employs 43,000 people globally. But it is perhaps best known for being one the largest suppliers of services to the public sector. Notably, it holds a contract to build part of the forthcoming HS2 high speed railway line and is the second largest supplier of maintenance services to Network Rail. It also maintains 50,000 homes for the Ministry of Defence, manages nearly 900 schools and manages highways and prisons. A government spokeswoman said it has been monitoring the situation to ensure its ""contingency plans are robust"". The general secretary of the RMT rail union, Mick Cash, said Carillion's workers were ""not responsible for the crisis"". He added that workers ""should have protection and guarantees from the government, including an assurance that operations will be directly transferred over to Network Rail with all jobs, pensions and rights safeguarded if Carillion goes bust"". Carillion scrambles to stay afloat HS2 contractor's shares hit by profit alert Where did Carillion's problems come from? In addition to its rail operations, Carillion also manages nearly 900 schools, provides services to the NHS and works with National Grid. The assistant general secretary of the Unite union, Gail Cartmail, said: ""The government must consider all options while the future of Carillion hangs in the balance, including bringing contracts back in-house."" The company held talks with its lenders and advisers in London on Wednesday. However, no announcement has been made on a business plan to secure its future. The government confirmed ministers met yesterday to discuss Carillion's future and were ""monitoring the situation closely"". TheFinancial Times,externalreported that David Lidington, who was moved to the Cabinet Office as part of Prime Minister Theresa May's reshuffle this week, convened the meeting with Business Secretary Greg Clark, new Justice Minister Rory Stewart, new Transport Minister Jo Johnson and Liz Truss, Chief Secretary to the Treasury. A government spokeswoman said: ""Carillion is a major supplier to the government with a number of long-term contracts. We are committed to maintaining a healthy supplier market and work closely with our key suppliers."" Carillion was forced to ask its banks, which include Santander UK, HSBC and Barclays, for support after breaching its loan agreements last year when it issued a series of profit warnings. The firm's share price has plunged by more than 90% over the past year. The company has been working on a plan which it said ""will provide the basis for the agreement of a proposal to restore Carillion's balance sheet"". A spokeswoman for the Pension Protection Fund said it was ""aware of the discussions between the company, government and banks and, along with the trustees and the Pensions Regulator, will act as it always does to protect the interests of Carillion scheme members and levy payers"". A spokesman for the Pension Regulator said: ""We have been and remain closely involved in discussions with Carillion and the trustees of the pension schemes as this situation has unfolded. We will not comment further unless it becomes appropriate to do so."" Simon Jack: Carillion's uncertain future Carillion scrambles to stay afloat Where did it go wrong for Carillion?

"Nigel Farage has had his MEP's salary docked by Â£35,500 after claims he misspent EU funds, the BBC understands. The ex-UKIP leader was investigated by the European Parliament over claims his office assistant had not been working on EU matters. Half of his salary has been withheld to recoup the money the Parliament says it is owed. The move was condemned by a spokesman for the European Parliament group which Mr Farage heads. UKIP faces UK probe into EU funding ""There is a vindictive campaign by the European Parliament of selective persecution of Eurosceptic MEPs, parties and groups,"" said the spokesman for the European Freedom and Direct Democracy group. ""This allegation is all part of their politically motivated assault."" European Parliament auditors last year suspended the contract of Christopher Adams, who was hired to be Mr Farage's assistant in Brussels and Strasbourg. Mr Adams, a former UKIP Parliamentary candidate, was also the national nominating officer for UKIP,the Guardian, which first reported the story,externalsays. The European Parliament has declined to comment. The monthly pre-tax salary for an MEP is 8,484 euros (Â£7,530), which is the equivalent of an annual gross salary, before tax, of 101,808 euros (Â£90,235). They also receive thousands more in expenses for staff and travel costs. Mr Farage, who will lose his job as an MEP in 2019 after 20 years in the European Parliament, recently described himself as ""skint"" in an interview with Mail on Sunday. The 53-year-old will be entitled to annual EU pension of Â£73,000 when he reaches the age of 63. He denied claims of hypocrisy - after campaigning for Brexit - saying: ""Why should my family suffer?"" ""I have just voted to get rid of my job. I was the turkey that voted for Christmas. How is that hypocrisy?,""he told the BBC's Andrew Marr show. He added that he doubted the money, which would be partly funded by money from the so-called EU divorce bill, would ever be paid, saying: ""Given the arbitrary way the European Union behaves in terms of money, I would be very surprised if I get any of it. I don't think it will even occur."" A 2016 investigation by the European Parliament alleged that funds for two groupings in the Parliament - which included UKIP and other Eurosceptic parties - had been wrongly spent ""for the benefit of UKIP"". It said Â£146,696 of the funds intended for European Parliament business should be repaid. An Electoral Commission investigation into whether the party broke UK electoral law is ongoing.

"Sterling has jumped to its highest level against the US dollar since the Brexit vote. The surge to more than $1.37 came afterBloomberg reported,externalthat the Spanish and Dutch finance ministers had agreed to seek a Brexit deal that kept the UK as close to the EU as possible. Both countries denied the report but the currency continued to climb. It gained more than 1% to its highest level since 24 June 2016 and was trading at $1.3733 on Friday evening. The currency had been trading at about $1.50 before the result of the referendum became clear. Analysts said the weakness of the dollar had also boosted the currency. ""The dollar was really down in the dumps this Friday, the currency losing its way in the face of positive political updates from the Eurozone and the UK, and a disappointing afternoon of US data,"" said Connor Campbell of Spreadex. Mizuho analyst Neil Jones said the Bloomberg report, if true, was less significant than the sterling rally suggested. ""Just because two of the 27 members say this, it doesn't mean a softer Brexit will happen. I doubt it's as straightforward as that,"" he said. Neil Wilson at ETX Capital said: ""Although the comments came from just two ministers who don't necessarily speak for the Barnier team as such, there is a sense that the direction of travel for the UK with regards Brexit is a lot more positive than it was prior to December. ""We also have positive language around financial services and the prospect of Britain paying for market access."" The pound was 0.2% higher against the euro at â¬1.12810 after the single currency hit a three-year high against the dollar following hopes that chancellor Angela Merkel would be able to forma coalition government in Germany.

"This video can not be played The building has been evacuated and trains have been cancelled A huge fire that closed Nottingham railway station is being treated as arson. At its peak 10 fire crews were tackling the fire, which began at about 06:30 GMT. Flames were seen coming from the station's roof and smoke filled the foyer, prompting the building's evacuation. Supt Sandra England said: ""We now have reason to believe the fire may have been started deliberately."" She added: ""Cordons remain in place around the area and trains are not running. It is likely the station will remain closed for the rest of the day."" As it happened: Large fire at Nottingham railway station Incident commander Bryn Coleman, from Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue, said crews faced ""arduous"" conditions when they arrived to tackle the ""severe"" fire that spread across the concourse. He described the operation as ""difficult and protracted"". Nottingham Fire and Rescue tweeted a picture from inside the building He added the fire was believed to have started in a toilet.

About 4,600 passengers arrive at Nottingham station during each weekday morning between 07:00 and 10:00, according to the Department for Transport. Thestation has recently undergone a Â£50m redevelopment, incorporating a new tram bridge, including the restoration and upgrade of its Edwardian grade II listed front building. People were evacuated from Nottingham station Eyewitness Sarah McMullan said she saw smoke coming from a toilet at the station's car park. ""You don't think much of it when there's a little bit of smoke and police already there, but then we were evacuated,"" she said. ""It was pretty frightening to see how quickly a fire can grow. You can see billowing smoke and flames above the roof on the far side."" BBC Radio Nottingham's Andy Whittaker said he saw ""thick plumes of black smoke"" coming from the station. He said many people were left waiting outside the building after being told to leave. Smoke filled the foyer at the station after the fire broke out Dr Remigius Ilione, 49, said: ""I drove into the car park and I could already hear the fire alarm. ""The smoke was so thick that you could not see in front of you."" Queens Road and Carrington Street were closed in both directions, which created heavy traffic on surrounding routes, but while there have been partial reopenings, disruption remains. There have been reports of 40-minute delays on bus services. Trams into the city were also disrupted by the fire and a separate incident, but began to run past the station at about 14:30 BST. Jo Johnson hoped the station will be up and running again in ""a few days"" Visiting the station, Transport Minister Jo Johnson said: ""It has been a devastating incident, but it has been an extraordinary response from the emergency services. ""We saw an exemplary evacuation this morning. There were about 200 or 300 passengers at the start of the rush hour who were evacuated safely. ""As far as we can tell no-one has been hurt in the incident and we really do owe a huge debt of gratitude to the emergency services. East Midlands Trains has done a great job ensuring no-one was hurt and everyone was evacuated safely. "" He added that he hoped the station should be back up and running in the ""next few days"".

"British retailers have published sales figures for the trading period up to and including Christmas, and while there have been record takings for some, the festive season proved gloomy for others. Consumers are continuing to alter their buying habits to factor in that American import Black Friday as well as increasingly turning to the internet. Unusual trends are emerging. Here are five things we learnt about UK shoppers this Christmas: Another interesting trend is that although consumers are tightening their belts fiscally, that doesn't mean their waistlines are shrinking. Some supermarkets reported a strong demand for their premium ranges over the festive season. Sales of Morrison's ""The Best"" product  were up 25%, while Sainsbury's saidcustomers bought more Taste the Difference food than last yearas ""people treated themselves"". Tesco said it saw ""record sales and volumes"" in the four weeks leading up to Christmas Day, due to sales of Tesco's Finest and the upmarket Go Cook range doing well, and Waitrose sold a month's worth of stock of Heston Citrus Sherbert Lazy Gin in just one day. ""What's interesting is that instead of trading up to a premium supermarket like Waitrose or Marks & Spencer, people have been trading up within the normal retailers they shop at and just buying more premium products,"" said Bryan Roberts, an insight director at TCC Global, the consultancy. Black Friday has been both a blessing and a curse for British retailers. A US tradition, it signals the start of the Christmas shopping season and begins on the day after Thanksgiving in late November. In some cases, it has brought spending forward. People take the opportunity to shop for presents and bargains, but then when the prices return to normal in early December before Christmas, they don't want to pay the full amount. However, there has been criticism thatoften Black Friday deals are not really as good as they seem, especially since some retailers routinely have multiple sales throughout the year. For some, Black Friday has been tremendously successful, such as Dixons Carphone and John Lewis, says Mr Roberts. Instead of discounting existing products, Dixons Carphone sourced products especially for the Black Friday promotions that were only available until they sold out. ""By having products just for Black Friday, Dixons is generating incremental spending that wouldn't have happened anyway,"" explains Mr Roberts. ""One-off merchandising is the most sensible way to go, otherwise you're diluting your margins."" Christmas has traditionally been a crucial time for retailers, but this year, some began discounting in the week before. ""In early December, there was Black Friday hangover, no one wanted to pay full price, and the weather didn't help as no one wanted to go to the shops, so in the week before Christmas there was panic discounting,"" says Ms Berg. Some retailers did not participate in Black Friday, and did not have any discounts prior to Christmas. Next benefited from this approach, but M&S did not, seeing its overall like-for-like sales fall by 1.4% in the 13 weeks to 30 December. However, analysts believe that not participating in Black Friday may help M&S in the long run, as it has reduced the number of sales it has annually from nine clearances down to just four a year. ""Customers are getting so savvy and cynical about discounted products,"" Jeremy Schwartz, former chairman and chief executive of The Body Shop, tells BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Those retailers that have brought something new - a great quality, a great innovation, something new, and held their nerve on price - have been the ones who've been the winners."" Amazon might be keeping mum on its Christmas trading figures, but you have only to look around at colleagues and neighbours to see the online retail giant's impact on British retail. ""It's noticeable that, year after year, more people are choosing to do the bulk of their Christmas shopping with Amazon and other online retailers,"" said Mr Roberts. ""Fulfilment is improving every year, returns, the ability to use lockers to pick up parcels. It's becoming easier for online shopping to become a big part of people's lives."" Amazon considers itself responsible for making Black Friday a permanent fixture on the UK calendar, and retail analysts don't disagree. Not everyone wants to make all their purchases online, but with the opportunity to obtain so many everyday products under one roof, retailers like Mothercare, which saw like-for-like sales fall 7.2% in the 12 weeks to 30 December despite an online presence, have much to fear. ""Online is taking a bigger share of the spoils with every month, and Christmas magnifies that,"" warns retail consultant Richard Hyman. ""Online is adding to capacity, it isn't adding to demand. ""I think there are far too many mouths to feed, and there will be a shakeup."" Sales figures show that retailers with good online shopping operations continue to do well, such as Next, which reportedsaw a 13.6% rise in online salesin the 54 days to 24 December, and online fast fashion retailer Boohoo, whererevenues doubled to Â£228min the four months to the end of December. According to Natalie Berg, global research director of Planet Retail, retailers with a ""robust online strategy"" which includes super-fast delivery are the ones who gained the most from Christmas. John Lewis, whose like-for-like sales were up 3.1% for the six weeks to 30 December, said that two thirds of its Click-and-Collect orders were picked up by shoppers when they went grocery shopping to Waitrose stores, showing that convenience is a big factor for consumers. And it seems that delivery times have sped up dramatically. ""In retail, time wars are becoming the new price wars. A few years ago, three to four days was acceptable, but today same-day delivery is becoming the norm,"" said Ms Berg. ""For example, Argos made a big deal that shoppers could place an order as late at 1pm on Christmas Eve and have it delivered at 6pm.""

"Kezia Dugdale received a fee of Â£70,000 for her recent appearance on I'm a Celebrity, she has disclosed. The former Scottish Labour leader also declared between Â£10,000 and Â£15,000 worth of travel, accommodation and living expenses, which were paid by ITV. She has donated Â£5,100 of her appearance fee, as well as Â£2,500 of her MSP salary, to charity. Ms Dugdale was formally reprimanded by Labour last month for her absence. She has now published details in theScottish Parliament's register of interests,external. The entry includes estimates of the travel and accommodation Ms Dugdale received, as well as a daily payment of 150 Australian dollars which she was given for living expenses while not in the camp. This brought the total sum published in the entry to between Â£80,000 and Â£85,000, including her Â£70,000 fee. Dugdale reprimanded over I'm a Celebrityy Dugdale says jungle was 'political gamble' A spokesman for Ms Dugdale said she had donated a total of Â£5,100 from her fee to the charities Who Cares? Scotland, Glasgow Women's Aid, and the Archie Foundation. Prior to appearing on the show, she also donated Â£2,500 of her MSP salary to the Rock Trust, an Edinburgh-based charity which supports young people at risk of homelessness. The spokesman added: ""Ms Dugdale received a fee from ITV for appearing on the TV show of Â£70,000. ""Income Tax has been paid both in the UK and in Australia due to the nature of the earnings, which was received in instalments. After tax, this sum is around Â£45,000."" Ms Dugdale said she was pleased that a number of charities who do ""amazing work across Scotland"" would benefit for her stint in the jungle. She added: ""I'm delighted to be back in the parliament serving my constituents across the Lothians."" The Scottish Conservatives said Ms Dugdale's charity donations were a ""drop in the ocean"" compared to the fee she received, and described her appearance on the show as a ""shameful episode"". Ms Dugdale was reprimanded by Scottish Labour when she returned to the Scottish Parliament last month Her time in the Australian jungle saw Ms Dugdale crawl through a tank full of fish guts that had ""Sickola Sturgeon"" written on the side. The politician was introduced as one of two late-entry campmates on the ITV reality show in November, before becoming the second person evicted after lasting 11 days in the jungle. News that she had agreed to become a contestant broke just hours before Scottish Labour was due to unveil her successor as leader. It subsequently emerged thatshe had not asked the party for permissionto take part. Ms Dugdale said she wanted to use her time in the jungle to promote ""Labour values"", but was heavily criticised by several colleagues. There had been speculation that Ms Dugdale faced a possible suspension from Labour when she returned to Scotland in December. But she was instead given a formal reprimand following a meeting with new Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard, and was told she would face no further disciplinary action.

"Alker played more than 350 times for Salford City Reds A former rugby international who robbed a KFC restaurant and a Tesco Express store while armed with a machete has been jailed for four years. Malcolm Alker, who played for Salford City Reds, pleaded guilty at Bolton Crown Court to two counts of armed robbery and carrying a bladed weapon. The former hooker played more than 350 games for the rugby league side between 1997 and 2010 and won two England caps. Alker, of Rathern Avenue, Higher Ince in Wigan, was also a coach at the club. The Crown Prosecution Service said Alker, 39, and his co-defendant Michael Naylor had robbed the two businesses on 31 October 2017. The pair, who were wearing balaclavas, raided the fast food restaurant in Pemberton first, before moving onto the shop in Whelley, a spokesman said. She said a bundle of Â£20 notes they took from the Tesco Express contained a GPS tracker, which police tracked to Delegarte Street in Ince. Officers found Naylor ""hiding behind a car"" with the notes and tracker in his pocket and Alker ""then came out of the bushes with his hands up"". Naylor, 25, of West Street, Higher Ince, admitted the same offences as Alker and received the same sentence. Alker retired due to injury in 2010 and his 16-year association with Salford ended the following year. He captained the club for almost a decade, but courted controversy a number of times and wasstripped of the role in 2009,externalfollowing a breach of club rules during a January training camp in America. Hereturned as captain two months later,external, but eventually left the club following adispute over a training ground incident in April 2011.

"John Humphrys and Jon Sopel were preparing to go on air when the reported exchange happened The BBC is ""deeply unimpressed"" with an off-air chat in which two of its high-profile journalists discussed the gender pay gap, a BBC source has said. Radio 4's Today presenter John Humphrys and North America editor Jon Sopel were talking about Carrie Gracie, who had quit as China editor over equal pay. Before Monday's show,The Sun,externalandTimes,externalreported, they chatted about ""handing over"" pay to keep Gracie in the role. A BBC spokeswoman said the presenter regrets the ""ill-advised"" conversation. Humphrys told the Times the off-air chat was ""nothing to do"" with the campaign by Gracie. He said: ""This was what I thought was an exchange between two old friends who have known each other for 30 years and were taking the mickey out of each other."" BBC management are understood to be ""deeply unimpressed"" with the unaired discussion, which took place ahead of a pre-recorded interview for Monday morning's edition of Today. In anopen letter issued the night before, Gracie had accused the corporation of having a ""secretive and illegal pay culture"". She quit because of pay inequality with her male counterparts - including Sopel - who were earning more than her Â£135,000-a-year salary. Last year the BBC listed all the salaries of all employees earning more than Â£150,000 a year, which revealed Sopel, the US editor, earned Â£200,000-Â£249,999, while Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen earned Â£150,000-Â£199,999. It also showed that Humphrys, who has presented the Today programme since 1987, had a salary of Â£600,000-Â£649,000. This video can not be played Carrie Gracie explains why she resigned as the BBC's China editor Speaking in the Radio 4 studio, Humphrys reportedly asked Sopel about ""how much of your salary you are prepared to hand over to Carrie Gracie to keep her"". He then referred to ""other men who are earning too much"" at the BBC. Sopel is understood to have replied that ""if we are talking about the scope for the greatest redistribution I'll have to come back and say well yes Mr Humphrys"". The presenter is then reported to have uttered a profanity and said that he was ""still left with more [pay] than anybody else"". Allow Twitter content?

Miriam O'Reilly,who won an ageism case against the BBC in 2011 after being dropped from Countryfile, described the exchange as ""base, smug and condescending"". Claiming to have heard a recording of the chat, Ms O'Reilly said it represented the attitude of ""back-slapping entitled males"". She also said she had been dropped from Friday's Today programme, when she was expecting to talk about equal pay, adding that she believed it was because of concern she would mention the leaked tape on air. A BBC spokeswoman denied this, saying it was because the item on the programme had become ""a much broader discussion about social change"" and another guest was more suitable.

"Bethany Walker contracted the flu virus which developed into pneumonia An 18-year-old woman has died in hospital after catching the flu virus. Bethany Walker, from Applecross in Wester Ross, had been suffering from the virus at home before it developed into pneumonia. She was airlifted to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness where she died last Friday. Her mother Heather Teale paid tribute to her ""beautiful girl"", describing her as ""the best daughter I could have ever wished for"". Scottish flu cases double in a week Why do NHS staff not get the flu vaccine? Are you worried about the flu? Details of the teenager's death emerged as official figures confirmedthe number of flu cases in Scotland has doubled in the last week. Eight of the 53 people treated in intensive care units in Scotland in the past fortnight have died, although officials stressed they may have had underlying health issues and the mortality rate was relatively low. Hospitals in England have also beenseeing very high rates of patients with flu, with a sharp rise in cases seen by GPs in the past week - up 78% on the week before. In Wales,a large rise in flu caseshas prompted advice to stay away from some hospitals. In a Facebook post, Bethany's mother said: ""My beautiful daughter Bethany Walker was taken from me yesterday. ""She had been suffering from a flu virus, which became pneumonia, she was airlifted to Raigmore with me by her side yesterday morning, where she rapidly deteriorated, the staff in intensive care could not have done more, she was given the best possible treatment from a team of 8 people for over two hours, they tried everything possible but sadly despite their best efforts she didn't make it. ""I am broken, the bottom has fallen out of my world. I have my mum with me, and my wonderful son Danny Walker who are both feeling the same loss as I am. Life will never be the same again. ""Bethany, I love you to the moon and back, I always have and I always will, you were the best daughter I could have ever wished for and I will always be the proudest mum in the world. ""I have no more words. I'm truly devastated. Sleep tight my beautiful girl, your brother and I will love you forever, you will never be out of my thoughts as long as I live."" Bethany left Plockton High School last summer and was in the middle of a year out before planning to study midwifery in Aberdeen. The school said the former deputy head girl was a ""kind, caring and gifted"" student who had been a ""super role model"" to younger pupils. She was among students who stay in a hostel in Plockton due to distance they have to travel from their homes to attend classes. Plockton High School said: ""It was a privilege for all of us to have taught Bethany, to have known her in her years in the school and to have maintained contact with her after she left. ""It is tragic to lose someone so young and the thoughts of the whole school and the hostel are with Bethany's family at this sad time."" Judith Fish, from the Applecross Inn where Bethany worked, said her death was a double blow to a close-knit communitystill grieving the recent loss of local fisherman Alasdair Macleod. She said: ""We've known Bethany growing up from being a young girl. She was perfect in every way. Lots of dedication and devotion. She's worked very hard in her studies. ""We're still grieving as a community for the loss of Ali as well, so it's come at a very hard time for us."" Just over half of flu strains currently circulating match those in the 2017/18 vaccine NHS Highland said it was unable to comment on individual cases, but that people with flu symptoms who had a long-term medical condition, a weakened immune system, were pregnant or over the age of 65 should contact their GP. A spokeswoman said: ""There is no evidence that it (the latest flu outbreak) is particularly bad or that we have more of it in this area than we would expect. ""The flu vaccine is the best defence we have against the spread of flu and it isn't too late to get vaccinated. ""People suffering with flu-like symptoms should cough or sneeze into tissues and bin them immediately, wash their hands regularly with soap and warm water and frequently clean regularly-used surfaces to stop the spread of flu. ""Avoid having unnecessary contact with other people if you or they have symptoms of flu."" Weekly figures released by Health Protection Scotland (HPS) on Thursday showed an increase in cases of flu from 46 per 100,000 people in the last week of December to 107 per 100,000 in the first week of January. The official figures revealed: The flu status has been raised from ""normal"" seasonal activity to ""moderate"" A further 30 patients needed intensive care Mortality rates related to the virus were still ""low"", with eight out of the total of 53 intensive care cases having died The flu rate had also doubled the previous week, from just over 20 per 100,000 to 46 per 100,000 Just over half of the circulating strains of flu match those in the 2017/18 vaccine, and most are believed to be the H3N2 strain known as ""Aussie Flu"" after problems the virus caused in Australia. Questions have been asked in recent days about low flu immunisation uptake rates for NHS staff, with HPS again urging everyone who is eligible for vaccination to do so. The HPS report said: ""Vaccination of those eligible for seasonal influenza remains the most important preventative measure to reduce influenza"".

Many were in neighbouring Lakenham and Trowse, and some of the terraces were said to have had mustard-coloured front doors. The school built by Colman's in 1864 still stands on Norwich's Carrow Hill The doors of some rows of terraces, built by Colman's, were said to have been painted mustard yellow Thelma Blower, 91, was the third of four generations to work at Colman's. Her grandparents started there before the turn of the 1900s, joining a workforce of about 3,000. They were followed by both Mrs Blower's parents and later, three of her four children - including Valerie Colby, who joined straight from school, aged 15. ""I was absolutely proud of working there - most people were,"" said Mrs Blower, who joined the firm during World War Two. ""The money was not big in the wartime, but Colman's was a family."" One day she was one of six girls asked to stay on for an extra hour to prepare a shipment and in doing so, survived a German raid, sheltering in tunnels beneath the site. ""Our manager came up and thanked us for staying behind but said he had some sad news,"" she said.

"British retailers have published sales figures for the trading period up to and including Christmas, and while there have been record takings for some, the festive season proved gloomy for others. Consumers are continuing to alter their buying habits to factor in that American import Black Friday as well as increasingly turning to the internet. Unusual trends are emerging. Here are five things we learnt about UK shoppers this Christmas: Another interesting trend is that although consumers are tightening their belts fiscally, that doesn't mean their waistlines are shrinking. Some supermarkets reported a strong demand for their premium ranges over the festive season. Sales of Morrison's ""The Best"" product  were up 25%, while Sainsbury's saidcustomers bought more Taste the Difference food than last yearas ""people treated themselves"". Tesco said it saw ""record sales and volumes"" in the four weeks leading up to Christmas Day, due to sales of Tesco's Finest and the upmarket Go Cook range doing well, and Waitrose sold a month's worth of stock of Heston Citrus Sherbert Lazy Gin in just one day. ""What's interesting is that instead of trading up to a premium supermarket like Waitrose or Marks & Spencer, people have been trading up within the normal retailers they shop at and just buying more premium products,"" said Bryan Roberts, an insight director at TCC Global, the consultancy. Black Friday has been both a blessing and a curse for British retailers. A US tradition, it signals the start of the Christmas shopping season and begins on the day after Thanksgiving in late November. In some cases, it has brought spending forward. People take the opportunity to shop for presents and bargains, but then when the prices return to normal in early December before Christmas, they don't want to pay the full amount. However, there has been criticism thatoften Black Friday deals are not really as good as they seem, especially since some retailers routinely have multiple sales throughout the year. For some, Black Friday has been tremendously successful, such as Dixons Carphone and John Lewis, says Mr Roberts. Instead of discounting existing products, Dixons Carphone sourced products especially for the Black Friday promotions that were only available until they sold out. ""By having products just for Black Friday, Dixons is generating incremental spending that wouldn't have happened anyway,"" explains Mr Roberts. ""One-off merchandising is the most sensible way to go, otherwise you're diluting your margins."" Christmas has traditionally been a crucial time for retailers, but this year, some began discounting in the week before. ""In early December, there was Black Friday hangover, no one wanted to pay full price, and the weather didn't help as no one wanted to go to the shops, so in the week before Christmas there was panic discounting,"" says Ms Berg. Some retailers did not participate in Black Friday, and did not have any discounts prior to Christmas. Next benefited from this approach, but M&S did not, seeing its overall like-for-like sales fall by 1.4% in the 13 weeks to 30 December. However, analysts believe that not participating in Black Friday may help M&S in the long run, as it has reduced the number of sales it has annually from nine clearances down to just four a year. ""Customers are getting so savvy and cynical about discounted products,"" Jeremy Schwartz, former chairman and chief executive of The Body Shop, tells BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Those retailers that have brought something new - a great quality, a great innovation, something new, and held their nerve on price - have been the ones who've been the winners."" Amazon might be keeping mum on its Christmas trading figures, but you have only to look around at colleagues and neighbours to see the online retail giant's impact on British retail. ""It's noticeable that, year after year, more people are choosing to do the bulk of their Christmas shopping with Amazon and other online retailers,"" said Mr Roberts. ""Fulfilment is improving every year, returns, the ability to use lockers to pick up parcels. It's becoming easier for online shopping to become a big part of people's lives."" Amazon considers itself responsible for making Black Friday a permanent fixture on the UK calendar, and retail analysts don't disagree. Not everyone wants to make all their purchases online, but with the opportunity to obtain so many everyday products under one roof, retailers like Mothercare, which saw like-for-like sales fall 7.2% in the 12 weeks to 30 December despite an online presence, have much to fear. ""Online is taking a bigger share of the spoils with every month, and Christmas magnifies that,"" warns retail consultant Richard Hyman. ""Online is adding to capacity, it isn't adding to demand. ""I think there are far too many mouths to feed, and there will be a shakeup."" Sales figures show that retailers with good online shopping operations continue to do well, such as Next, which reportedsaw a 13.6% rise in online salesin the 54 days to 24 December, and online fast fashion retailer Boohoo, whererevenues doubled to Â£228min the four months to the end of December. According to Natalie Berg, global research director of Planet Retail, retailers with a ""robust online strategy"" which includes super-fast delivery are the ones who gained the most from Christmas. John Lewis, whose like-for-like sales were up 3.1% for the six weeks to 30 December, said that two thirds of its Click-and-Collect orders were picked up by shoppers when they went grocery shopping to Waitrose stores, showing that convenience is a big factor for consumers. And it seems that delivery times have sped up dramatically. ""In retail, time wars are becoming the new price wars. A few years ago, three to four days was acceptable, but today same-day delivery is becoming the norm,"" said Ms Berg. ""For example, Argos made a big deal that shoppers could place an order as late at 1pm on Christmas Eve and have it delivered at 6pm.""

"In 1977 Maryann Gray was a 22-year-old college graduate with her whole life ahead of her, when a little boy darted out in front of her car. For years, Maryann didn't talk about Brian, but she thought about him constantly - and his death has had a lasting influence on her life. I was in a terrific mood that day. I was moving from the little college town of Oxford in rural Ohio into a big old rambling house in Cincinnati with a bunch of other people. I was so excited. I'd been in graduate school but I'd decided I was going to leave.  I was happy not knowing what was coming next. I was going to get a job, have fun, see where my passions led me. I was at the house - we called it an urban commune - painting the room I was moving into. When I finished I thought I'd drive back to my apartment in Oxford which was all packed up and ready for the move - it was a warm day in June and I thought it would be great to take a swim. The road started out as freeway but quickly became a rural highway, one lane in each direction. The speed limit was 45 or 50mph, fairly fast for that kind of road, it was quite busy and I was in a line of cars doing the speed limit. I passed a little outpost of houses whose mailboxes were on the opposite side of the street. As I passed the houses a little blond boy darted out, moving from the mailbox to his house. I saw him at the last second. I tried to swerve. There was no way to miss him. I hit the little boy and he flew up into the air and then landed on the pavement. I pulled over and ran across the street. I was so distressed that I don't really remember those minutes. I was hiding behind a bush and screaming. I heard myself and I thought, ""What is that? Who's doing that?"" And then I realised it was me. The boy was receiving first aid in the road. There were lots of people attending to him and people gathering on the side of the road. I was very, very frightened. I knew I had done something terrible. It took 20 minutes for the police to arrive. They didn't wait for an ambulance, they just put the boy in the back of a police car and left. I'd hit the boy right in front of his house and some neighbours had gone to get his mother. She came out of her house screaming her son's name in agony. She wanted to go to him but the neighbours held her back. Then she started to collapse on her front stoop and they had to hold her up. It was loud, it was confused, it was very upsetting. I approached the police. I came forward, raised my hand and said, ""I did it, I did it."" They didn't know I was the one who hit him, I guess nobody saw it. They sat me in the back of a police car and put a rookie up front to keep an eye on me. I wrote out a statement and talked to them at some length. They looked for skid marks on the road and took some measurements. The lead officer came back and said, ""I just have to tell you the boy died."" Maryann Gray spoke toOutlookon the BBC World Service. You can listen again on theBBC iPlayer. I'd been praying that maybe it wasn't as bad as it looked, that maybe he would be OK. I remember just leaning over and crying, and then trying very hard to get hold of myself. The police agreed to let me wait in one of the neighbour's houses. She was so kind. She had a daughter just a few years younger than me and I think she knew that her daughter could just as easily have been the perpetrator, like me, or the victim - Brian was his name. The lead officer came and told me that they were not arresting me - there was no indication that I was negligent or distracted or impaired in any way - but he gave me a little lecture saying, ""This child died, that's a terrible thing, you need to make sure that you never do this again."" I was pretty angry because the idea that I would do it again was just beyond comprehension. I called my parents in New York City and I told my mother what had happened. I was crying and I said, ""It was an accident, it was an accident."" And my mom said, ""Of course it was an accident."" My father came out the next day. He made a condolence call to the family that had lost their child which must have been unbelievably painful. He stopped by the neighbour's house to thank them for being so kind to me. He dealt with the car which had to go to a body shop. He got a lawyer so that if there was going to be any legal action I would have protection. He just tried to make sure that everything that could be taken care of was taken care of. I spent the first night at a friend's house, compulsively telling the story of what happened, and then I went back to my apartment, the one that was all packed up and not a very cheerful place, and basically hid there for about a week. I'd very much been a good girl who worked hard to get good grades and fulfil the expectations of my parents and my professors, but I think I grew up feeling like I always came up a little short and so after the accident I think I was deeply worried at a very unconscious level about whether I was a good person or whether I was a bad person. There's a belief system that many people adhere to that we create the condition of our lives - so an angry person perceives an angry or hostile world, and a loving person experiences a kind, giving world. So I thought, ""What kind of a person has this experience? I must be a very dangerous person."" When I got my car back I tried to drive but I kept hallucinating. I would be driving down the road and think I saw somebody walking into the street so I'd slam on the brakes, but there would be nobody there. That's a very dangerous thing to do - I was so frightened I gave up the car for about two years. I had flashbacks that would pop into my brain unexpectedly. I could be in the middle of a conversation, washing the dishes, or doing the grocery shopping, and all of a sudden I would be visualising this child flying through the air after I hit him, or a puddle of blood on the road - horrible images. I spent several years punishing myself by really pushing people away from me. I dated men who treated me very poorly, I didn't really have friends, I was irritable a lot, and my housemates didn't particularly enjoy having me around so I moved out of the commune into an apartment where I could just be by myself. Two years after the accident I moved to California to start a different graduate programme in psychology and that really was a new beginning. I was intellectually engaged and doing work that I felt was important and helpful and that felt really good. I pretty much stopped talking about the accident, on advice from my parents, who said that if people knew I had done this they would think about me differently. I often refer to this little boy, Brian, as my ghost, because he became a part of me. His voice in my mind became this very punitive, angry voice that would say, ""Don't get too happy, remember what happened the last time you got happy? You killed a child, you killed me."" I was a neo-Nazi - then I fell in love with a black woman My brother's killer is now my friend Why I bought my daughter heroin I heard that voice many times every day, and so although I enjoyed my studies and I loved living in California, there was always that voice holding me back. I had killed a child and I could never forget that. I thought about Brian the day I got married. I thought about Brian the day my father died. I thought about Brian the day I defended my dissertation. I thought about Brian the day I started a new job. He lived with me. I married in my early 30s. I told my husband that I'd had this accident but we never talked about it. He didn't ask and I didn't want to impose my pain on him - this was my issue to deal with and I didn't really feel I had the right to ask for comfort. Before the accident I couldn't have imagined a life without children. I was the most in-demand babysitter in the neighbourhood when I was at high school. I loved doing it - I would rather babysit than go out with friends. During that first week after the accident when I was hiding inside my apartment, I heard a voice. I call it an auditory hallucination. The voice said in this very biblical, Old Testament, angry way, ""You have taken a child from his mother and as your punishment you can never have your own child"". I didn't talk about that for at least 20 years. For all that time. I was very fearful around children - all I could see were the sharp corners that they might fall against, or the pool where they might drown, the stairs that they might fall down, the knife that they might cut themselves with. I didn't want to raise a frightened child and I didn't think I would be a good mother, so I decided against having children which is a huge regret, but was the right decision for me. I think I would have had a very hard time mothering. I wanted to get through a set of life benchmarks that are pretty typical - finish my education, get a good job and find a life partner - and soon after, in the mid to late 90s, I decided it was time to go into therapy. I had carried these memories around with me and they had taken over a large part of my inner life and kept me separate from other people. My friends knew I was a nervous driver, but they didn't know why.  I might be feeling down one day and the accident would be on my mind but I couldn't talk about it. People thought they knew me but I didn't talk about probably the most significant event in my life. In 2003 there was an accident at Santa Monica Farmers Market. An elderly man had ploughed into a group of people with his car and lots of people had been killed and injured. I lived nearby and we were watching the news coverage on TV and could hear the helicopters overhead. It was just carnage, it was a terrible scene. People were on the TV screaming that this 86-year-old man was a murderer, but the idea that he meant to do it just horrified me. I was distressed by the accident and it was on my mind so much that I closed the door to my office and banged out some words about the empathy I felt for the driver as well as the victims, about my experience, and about the lack of support for people who have accidentally killed other people. At the time I was in a writing workshop, and I sent what I'd written to the woman who led my group. She called and said, ""You should send this to National Public Radio."" If I had thought there was any chance that they would actually run it I'd probably never have done it. But I sent it off and the next thing I knew NPR were calling, asking me to come in and record the piece. I was very anxious about it but I thought somebody needed to show some compassion for this guy and others who had accidentally killed. The piece was broadcast two or three days after the accident. Accidental Impacts,externalis a website run by Maryann Gray that offers information and support for people trying to cope with causing a serious accident I was told that I should be prepared for hate mail, for negative comments on the internet, for people calling to harass me. But what happened was completely positive, there was a huge outpouring of support. Close friends that I had never told heard me on the radio and were uniformly compassionate and supportive. They told me I was strong for speaking out and that they were so sorry I had suffered. Something flowered inside, I felt a great sense of relief and much more connected to the people around me, and to the world. It was like coming out. I also heard from other people who had accidentally killed people and who'd had experiences similar to mine, the post-traumatic symptoms - the flashbacks, feeling disconnected, difficulty concentrating, and, of course, guilt and shame. It was very powerful because none of us had ever talked to anybody who'd had the same experience. I had thought about contacting Brian's family for years but had held back because I wasn't sure that they would want to hear from me. I didn't have a lot of money, but I did make an anonymous donation of several thousand dollars to his brother's college to pay part of his tuition. Then about 10 years ago I went to Israel on a trip. I'm Jewish and I went with my rabbi and other people from the temple that I belonged to. While I was there I took a Hebrew name, Bracha, which means blessing. I chose it in honour of Brian. When I got home I wrote a letter to Brian's mother. I told her I had taken this name to honour the memory of her son, that Brian lived in my heart as I knew he did in hers. I sent the letter. It turned out that she had died, so her mail was being forwarded to her surviving son, Brian's older brother. One day I was sitting in my office, I picked up the phone and it was him. He'd read the letter and found me online. We spoke for about 45 minutes. It was an emotional conversation. He was very angry, he told me how much his family had suffered. They had stopped celebrating Christmas because it was too close to Brian's birthday and all the usual happy family occasions were muted for them forever. They never changed Brian's room, they kept it the same, so there was a constant reminder of their son. None of them ever really stopped grieving. As we talked he really softened. He hadn't known I'd made a condolence call and had a brief conversation with his father in the days after the accident. His father had been very kind to me and that had a big impact on him. At the end of the conversation I said, ""What do you want to ask me? You can ask me anything."" He said, ""Were you speeding?"" And I said, ""No, I wasn't speeding. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, but your brother darted out into the road."" He said, ""I know. Wrong time, wrong place."" In that moment I felt forgiven and I think perhaps he was able to feel a kind of pure grief, untinged by the anger that had coloured his mourning. When we got off the phone I certainly didn't feel like we were friends but I felt like we had this amazing bond, because we were still mourning this child, and we will always have that in common. I do forgive myself, but I'm terrified that I'll hurt somebody else. I live in Los Angeles and I drive all the time, but I'm very cautious. I have tried to honour Brian, his family and my own experience by reaching out and being a better person, but I don't think I'll ever be at peace with the fact that I killed a child. I will never cease to be horrified by that. All photographs courtesy of Maryann Gray. Join the conversation - find us onFacebook,external,Instagram,externalandTwitter,external. Â© 2025 BBC.

"British retailers have published sales figures for the trading period up to and including Christmas, and while there have been record takings for some, the festive season proved gloomy for others. Consumers are continuing to alter their buying habits to factor in that American import Black Friday as well as increasingly turning to the internet. Unusual trends are emerging. Here are five things we learnt about UK shoppers this Christmas: Another interesting trend is that although consumers are tightening their belts fiscally, that doesn't mean their waistlines are shrinking. Some supermarkets reported a strong demand for their premium ranges over the festive season. Sales of Morrison's ""The Best"" product  were up 25%, while Sainsbury's saidcustomers bought more Taste the Difference food than last yearas ""people treated themselves"". Tesco said it saw ""record sales and volumes"" in the four weeks leading up to Christmas Day, due to sales of Tesco's Finest and the upmarket Go Cook range doing well, and Waitrose sold a month's worth of stock of Heston Citrus Sherbert Lazy Gin in just one day. ""What's interesting is that instead of trading up to a premium supermarket like Waitrose or Marks & Spencer, people have been trading up within the normal retailers they shop at and just buying more premium products,"" said Bryan Roberts, an insight director at TCC Global, the consultancy. Black Friday has been both a blessing and a curse for British retailers. A US tradition, it signals the start of the Christmas shopping season and begins on the day after Thanksgiving in late November. In some cases, it has brought spending forward. People take the opportunity to shop for presents and bargains, but then when the prices return to normal in early December before Christmas, they don't want to pay the full amount. However, there has been criticism thatoften Black Friday deals are not really as good as they seem, especially since some retailers routinely have multiple sales throughout the year. For some, Black Friday has been tremendously successful, such as Dixons Carphone and John Lewis, says Mr Roberts. Instead of discounting existing products, Dixons Carphone sourced products especially for the Black Friday promotions that were only available until they sold out. ""By having products just for Black Friday, Dixons is generating incremental spending that wouldn't have happened anyway,"" explains Mr Roberts. ""One-off merchandising is the most sensible way to go, otherwise you're diluting your margins."" Christmas has traditionally been a crucial time for retailers, but this year, some began discounting in the week before. ""In early December, there was Black Friday hangover, no one wanted to pay full price, and the weather didn't help as no one wanted to go to the shops, so in the week before Christmas there was panic discounting,"" says Ms Berg. Some retailers did not participate in Black Friday, and did not have any discounts prior to Christmas. Next benefited from this approach, but M&S did not, seeing its overall like-for-like sales fall by 1.4% in the 13 weeks to 30 December. However, analysts believe that not participating in Black Friday may help M&S in the long run, as it has reduced the number of sales it has annually from nine clearances down to just four a year. ""Customers are getting so savvy and cynical about discounted products,"" Jeremy Schwartz, former chairman and chief executive of The Body Shop, tells BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Those retailers that have brought something new - a great quality, a great innovation, something new, and held their nerve on price - have been the ones who've been the winners."" Amazon might be keeping mum on its Christmas trading figures, but you have only to look around at colleagues and neighbours to see the online retail giant's impact on British retail. ""It's noticeable that, year after year, more people are choosing to do the bulk of their Christmas shopping with Amazon and other online retailers,"" said Mr Roberts. ""Fulfilment is improving every year, returns, the ability to use lockers to pick up parcels. It's becoming easier for online shopping to become a big part of people's lives."" Amazon considers itself responsible for making Black Friday a permanent fixture on the UK calendar, and retail analysts don't disagree. Not everyone wants to make all their purchases online, but with the opportunity to obtain so many everyday products under one roof, retailers like Mothercare, which saw like-for-like sales fall 7.2% in the 12 weeks to 30 December despite an online presence, have much to fear. ""Online is taking a bigger share of the spoils with every month, and Christmas magnifies that,"" warns retail consultant Richard Hyman. ""Online is adding to capacity, it isn't adding to demand. ""I think there are far too many mouths to feed, and there will be a shakeup."" Sales figures show that retailers with good online shopping operations continue to do well, such as Next, which reportedsaw a 13.6% rise in online salesin the 54 days to 24 December, and online fast fashion retailer Boohoo, whererevenues doubled to Â£228min the four months to the end of December. According to Natalie Berg, global research director of Planet Retail, retailers with a ""robust online strategy"" which includes super-fast delivery are the ones who gained the most from Christmas. John Lewis, whose like-for-like sales were up 3.1% for the six weeks to 30 December, said that two thirds of its Click-and-Collect orders were picked up by shoppers when they went grocery shopping to Waitrose stores, showing that convenience is a big factor for consumers. And it seems that delivery times have sped up dramatically. ""In retail, time wars are becoming the new price wars. A few years ago, three to four days was acceptable, but today same-day delivery is becoming the norm,"" said Ms Berg. ""For example, Argos made a big deal that shoppers could place an order as late at 1pm on Christmas Eve and have it delivered at 6pm.""

"Simon Bramhall was sentenced for two charges of assault after admitting branding his patients' livers A liver surgeon who branded his initials on the livers of two patients has been fined Â£10,000. Simon Bramhall, 53, used an argon beam machine to write his initials on the organs of the anaesthetised patients in 2013 while working at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital. Bramhall, of Tarrington, Herefordshire, admitted two counts of assault by beating at Birmingham Crown Court. He was also sentenced to a 12-month community order. Midlands Live: Man admits bowling alley siege charges; Woman's reprieve after 50-year UK stay One of the victims, referred to in court as Patient A, received a donor organ in a life-saving operation carried out by Bramhall. But the donor liver failed about a week later - for reasons unconnected to its implantation - and another surgeon spotted Bramhall's initials ""SB"" branded on the organ. A photograph of the 4cm-high branding was taken on a mobile phone and Bramhall, who now works for the NHS in Herefordshire, later admitted marking Patient A's liver. Bramhall, 53, resigned from his job at the hospital in 2014. Simon Bramhall left one of his victims feeling ""violated"" The consultant pleaded guilty to two counts of assault by beating in December after prosecutors accepted his not guilty pleas to charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The offence of assault by beating was brought against Bramhall to reflect the act of marking the liver and there is no suggestion he was responsible for physically ""beating"" either patient. Prosecutor Tony Badenoch QC said one of the two victims was left feeling ""violated"" and suffered ongoing psychological harm. The court heard the surgeon's actions were a ""naive and foolhardy"" attempt to relieve tension in the operating theatre during transplant operations in February and August 2013. Simon Bramhall was a respected surgeon known for his meticulous work in the operating theatre. But marking his initials on the livers of his patients meant he abused his position and betrayed the trust of those who were at their most vulnerable. Even though the act of branding his initials didn't cause any damage to the organs, prosecutors argued it was done with a disregard to the patients' feelings while they were under general anaesthetic. This case has been described as ""unique"" and ""without legal precedent in criminal law"".  It leaves surgeons facing further scrutiny legally - not just over medical mistakes for which they might be sued - but over what some might have regarded in the past as harmless medical pranks. It will be up to the General Medical Council to decide whether Bramhall will be struck off or allowed to continue doing the job he loves. Acknowledging that Bramhall's actions had not caused either patient's new liver to fail, Mr Badenoch said: ""This case is about his practice on two occasions, without the consent of the patient and for no clinical reason whatever, to burn his initials on to the surface of a newly-transplanted liver."" A nurse who saw the initialling questioned what had happened and Bramhall was said to have replied: ""I do this."" Judge Paul Farrer QC, who said Bramhall would carry out 120 hours of unpaid work, told the defendant: ""Both of the operations were long and difficult. ""I accept that on both occasions you were tired and stressed and I accept that this may have affected your judgment. ""This was conduct born of professional arrogance of such magnitude that it strayed into criminal behaviour. ""What you did was an abuse of power and a betrayal of trust that these patients had invested in you. ""I accept that you didn't intend or foresee anything but the most trivial of harm would be caused."" The hospital said it wanted to reassure Mr Bramhall's patients Speaking after the hearing, Frank Ferguson, head of special crime at the Crown Prosecution Service, refused to be drawn on whether Bramhall had carried out the practice on other patients but said he did not anticipate any further charges.

"This video can not be played Martyn Hett's mother Figen Murray said the families should have been given more respect and time There were ""critical"" issues with communications between emergency services after the Manchester attack, a report says. Salman Abedi detonated a bomb after a concert on 22 May, killing 22 people. Lord Kerslake's progress report also criticised intrusive media attention and said public bodies dealing with families of the bereaved should make sure they are not overlooked. ""Certainly things didn't go in the way people would have wanted to,"" he said. Lord Kerslake said the issues were between both the different services and between the services and the public following the attack, after a concert by Ariana Grande. He added the panel had a ""better understanding"" of why there was a delay in the fire service entering the arena on the night. But he said he would not comment further under the publication of the full report in March. A leaked reportrevealed fire crews were deployed to the arena one hour and 47 minutes after the bombing. Stuart Murray, whose stepson Martyn Hett died, said media intrusion was ""not the way to make an impression"". Mr Murray said: ""The media found the addresses of our children who don't live at home and also some of Martyn's friends. ""His flatmate had people knocking and this was before we even had news and confirmation of what had happened. The review is assessing the emergency services' response to the attack at Manchester Arena Martyn Hett was one of the 22 people killed in the blast ""It makes you angry and cautious how you would deal with the media thereafter. That's not the way to make an impression if you want to work with the family or be involved with them. ""Overall I think we've been looked after fantastically by everybody involved, but there's always going to be lessons to be learned."" Lord Kerslake's progress report into the bombing said public bodies in Greater Manchester should adopt a charter proposed byBishop James Jones' Hillsborough review. The Kerslake review was commissioned by Mayor Andy Burnham to assess Greater Manchester's readiness for the attack and look at the response of the city's agencies and emergency services. Emergency services, NHS staff and Victoria station staff are among those who have contributed to the review More than 170 people, including young people who were at the concert, have participated in the review via a phone line set up by the NSPCC. The panel has also spoken to members of the emergency services and public bodies involved in the attack. The progress report said more than 400 documents have been submitted and the panel is also looking into the role of both mainstream and social media. St Ann's Square in Manchester became the focus of tributes after the attack Lord Kerslake said bereaved families and those injured had been put ""at the heart"" of the report. He said: ""The panel wants to ensure that the ethos of putting families first isn't lost following this tragedy or in the future; that's why we are recommending Greater Manchester adopts the Charter for Families Bereaved through Public Tragedy introduced as part of the Right Reverend Jones report."" Analysis By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent Every trainee reporter dreads the first time they are sent to do what's grimly known in the business as the ""death knock"". And it's largely down to their personal ethics and conduct how it will go. But if a death is part of a national news story - and friends and family have posted details on social media that the whole world can read - there are inevitably going to be more journalists, from more organisations, under more pressure from editors, to get ""the interview"". TheBBC's published Editorial Guidelinesstate we will not approach a family until there has been a thorough consideration of the public interest and the right to privacy. We will often write to a family or speak to a trusted intermediary rather than camp on the doorstep. The aim is to fulfil our duty to try to get the facts right - but also give them time and space to think without feeling under pressure. But at the same time, the public rely on journalists to report sad events - and to report them accurately. So an inevitable part of the job is always going to be speaking to people who are very upset - and who may, for understandable reasons, become upset at us for approaching them. Lord Kerslake said the review had given everyone the chance to ""share their experiences of that dreadful night and the days that followed"". The charter commits public bodies to ""becoming an organisation which strives to support the bereaved and vulnerable, put the public interest above their own reputation, assist the search for truth by being open and honest under scrutiny, be held to account and not mislead the public or the media"". Lord Kerslake added: ""We really wanted in this review to tell the story from the point of view of the bereaved and the injured and clearly a lot of the media handled things respectfully, but there were some occasions where they really didn't. Lord Kerslake is the former head of the civil service ""We want to look at what can we learn from this, it's all about the way in which people behave, the respect with which they treat those caught up in these terrible events."" Mr Burnham has urged for public bodies in Greater Manchester to sign up to the charter and ""provide their fullest co-operation"" to the panel.

"Miya uses the machine, which tracks her eye movements, to communicate with her family A teenager will get her voice back after celebrities helped raise Â£6,000 to replace stolen equipment. Miya Thirlby, 16, from Plymouth, has cerebral palsy, epilepsy and is deaf. She uses an adapted computer which helps her speak. Her dad Paul Johnson made a Twitter appeal for its return after the machine was stolen from his car. A host of celebrities including Paul Gascoigne, Alan Shearer and Dawn French shared the original post. More news from Devon and Cornwall This led to a Just Giving appeal page being set up by Jamie Twite, which beat its target of Â£6,000 in less than 24 hours. Former England footballer Gascoigne donated Â£1,000 to the appeal. Other celebrities including Mark Ronson, Lorraine Kelly and comedian Adam Hills - presenter of the TV show The Last Leg, who himself has a disability - have shared the post. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played The building has been evacuated and trains have been cancelled A huge fire that closed Nottingham railway station is being treated as arson. At its peak 10 fire crews were tackling the fire, which began at about 06:30 GMT. Flames were seen coming from the station's roof and smoke filled the foyer, prompting the building's evacuation. Supt Sandra England said: ""We now have reason to believe the fire may have been started deliberately."" She added: ""Cordons remain in place around the area and trains are not running. It is likely the station will remain closed for the rest of the day."" As it happened: Large fire at Nottingham railway station Incident commander Bryn Coleman, from Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue, said crews faced ""arduous"" conditions when they arrived to tackle the ""severe"" fire that spread across the concourse. He described the operation as ""difficult and protracted"". Nottingham Fire and Rescue tweeted a picture from inside the building He added the fire was believed to have started in a toilet. The fire service confirmed in the early afternoon that a joint investigation with the British Transport Police was already under way.

Kirsty Derry, deputy managing director of Stagecoach, East Midland Train's parent company, apologised for the disruption but said they were ""really optimistic"" about services at the station on Saturday but warned there would be ""gaps"". About 4,600 passengers arrive at Nottingham station during each weekday morning between 07:00 and 10:00, according to the Department for Transport. Thestation has recently undergone a Â£50m redevelopment, incorporating a new tram bridge, including the restoration and upgrade of its Edwardian grade II listed front building. People were evacuated from Nottingham station Eyewitness Sarah McMullan said she saw smoke coming from a toilet at the station's car park. ""You don't think much of it when there's a little bit of smoke and police already there, but then we were evacuated,"" she said. ""It was pretty frightening to see how quickly a fire can grow. You can see billowing smoke and flames above the roof on the far side."" BBC Radio Nottingham's Andy Whittaker said he saw ""thick plumes of black smoke"" coming from the station. He said many people were left waiting outside the building after being told to leave. Smoke filled the foyer at the station after the fire broke out Dr Remigius Ilione, 49, said: ""I drove into the car park and I could already hear the fire alarm. ""The smoke was so thick that you could not see in front of you."" Queens Road and Carrington Street were closed in both directions, which created heavy traffic on surrounding routes, but while there have been partial reopenings, disruption remains. There have been reports of 40-minute delays on bus services. Trams into the city were also disrupted by the fire and a separate incident, but began to run past the station at about 14:30 BST. Jo Johnson hoped the station will be up and running again in ""a few days"" Visiting the station, Transport Minister Jo Johnson said: ""It has been a devastating incident, but it has been an extraordinary response from the emergency services. ""We saw an exemplary evacuation this morning. There were about 200 or 300 passengers at the start of the rush hour who were evacuated safely. ""As far as we can tell no-one has been hurt in the incident and we really do owe a huge debt of gratitude to the emergency services. East Midlands Trains has done a great job ensuring no-one was hurt and everyone was evacuated safely. "" He added that he hoped the station should be back up and running in the ""next few days"".

"Arrows point to the the two burps of gas coming from the black hole; the top arrow points to the newer burp and the bottom arrow points to the older one Astronomers have caught a massive black hole letting out a ""double burp"" after bingeing on hot gas. When cosmic gas comes near one of these sinkholes, it gets sucked in - but some of the energy is released back into space in the form of a burp. Now, the Hubble and Chandra space telescopes have detected a new belch emerging from a black hole located about 800 million light-years away. But they saw a remnant of another belch that occurred 100,000 years earlier. ""Black holes are voracious eaters, but it turns out they don't have very good table manners,"" Julie Comerford, from the University of Colorado, Boulder, told the 231st American Astronomical Society meeting in Washington DC. ""There are a lot of examples of black holes with single burps emanating out, but we discovered a galaxy with a supermassive black hole that has not one but two burps."" The burp itself consists of a stream of high-energy particles that is kicked back from the black hole. Supermassive black holes are the largest type and are found at the centres of nearly all big galaxies. X-ray emission from the galaxy in question - called SDSS J1354+1327 - was picked up by the Chandra telescope, allowing researchers to pinpoint the location of its central black hole. The Chandra space telescope was used to pinpoint the location of a black hole at the centre of the galaxy Hubble was able to show them that a cloud of blue-green gas extending away from the black hole represented the aftermath of an earlier burp. They found that electrons had been stripped from atoms in the cone of gas and surmise that this was caused by  a burst of radiation from the vicinity of the black hole. In the meantime, it had expanded 30,000 light-years away from the black hole itself. But the astronomers found a little loop in the images; the sign of a new belch emerging from the cosmic sinkhole. ""This new burp is actually moving like a shockwave that is coming out very fast,"" said Dr Comerford. ""I thought of an analogy for this and I was debating whether to use it or whether it's a little too gross... imagine someone eating dinner at their kitchen table and they're eating and burping, eating and burping. Artwork showing a black hole consuming nearby matter ""You walk in the room and you notice there's an old burp still hanging in the air from the appetiser course. Meanwhile, they're eating the main course and they let out a new burp that's rocking the kitchen table."" She said the black hole was going through a cycle of feasting, burping and napping, before starting over. The observations are important because they support previous theories - not demonstrated until now - that black holes should go through these cycles. The black holes were expected to become very bright in the process of feasting and burping and then go dark during the nap phase. ""Theory predicted that black holes should flicker on and off very quickly and this galaxy's evidence of black holes does flicker on timescales of 100,000 years - which is long in human timescales, but in cosmological timescales is very fast,"" said Julie Comerford. The researchers think the black hole erupted twice because it consumed two separate meals. The reason for this might lie with the fact that the galaxy it's in had collided with another galaxy nearby. This would provide plenty of cosmic gas on which a black hole could feast. ""There's a stream of stars and gas connecting these two galaxies. That collision led gas to stream towards the supermassive black hole and feed it two separate meals that led to these two separate burps,"" said the University of Colorado researcher. The results are published in the Astrophysical Journal.

"John Worboys, 60, is thought to have carried out more than 100 rapes and sexual assaults on women in the capital Almost 100 unprosecuted cases against sex attacker John Worboys will not be reviewed by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), it has emerged. Lawyers representing Worboys' victims asked theCPS to review the 93 cases that the 60-year-old rapist was not prosecuted over. One of his victims said it would be a ""total scandal"" if the additional cases were not reviewed. The CPS said it had no plans to review its decision-making. Worboys, who was jailed in 2009, gave his victims drug-laced champagne before attacking them in the back of his cab. Slater and Gordon, a law firm that represented 11 of Worboys' victims, sent a letter to the CPS asking it to ""undertake a thorough review of all available evidence"" against him to see if he could be convicted of more crimes. In a statement the CPS said its decision-making was on the basis of all available evidence and there are no plans to review it. ""We would consider further charging advice in the event of matters being referred to us by police"", a spokesman said. ""If cases did not pass the evidential test there would have to be new evidence available that altered that assessment before they could be prosecuted. ""No cases can be prosecuted unless they pass the test in the Code for Crown Prosecutors."" The black cab used by Worboys in his attacks Last week theParole Board decided Worboys would be released with ""stringent"" licence conditionsafter he completed his minimum term of eight years in jail. One victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said unless the cases were reopened, ""we can have no faith in the justice system"". ""These cases were not dropped at the time for lack of evidence, but rather because the CPS thought he would never be released from prison - and yet he's due to be released in just a couple of weeks,"" they said. ""The evidence is there. It would be a total scandal if it is now not properly looked at.""

"This video can not be played Sigrid gives us a tour of Bergen, where she lives in Norway Norwegian pop singer Sigrid has won BBC Music's Sound of 2018, which aims to showcase the most exciting new music for the year ahead. Aged just 21, she is one of the youngest ever artists to receive the honour - beaten only by Adele, who was 19 when she topped the 2008 list. ""It's a huge honour,"" she told the BBC. ""I don't know how to explain it."" Influenced by Lorde, Robyn and Joni Mitchell, the star has become known for catchy, quirky and literate pop songs.

For the first time, this year's panel also included former nominees, including Stormzy, Ellie Goulding, Years & Years frontman Olly Alexander and last year's winner, Ray BLK. The top five was a mixture of British and international, and unsigned and signed acts - all of whom were aged 22 or younger. Emotive singer-songwriter Rex Orange County came second, while urban jazz act IAMDDB was third. This video can not be played Sigrid performs Raw in Oygardshallen, Giske, Norway, close to where she grew up. Taught to play piano at an early age, Sigrid didn't consider writing her own music until she was 16, when her brother demanded she stopped playing Adele covers.

"This video can not be played Martyn Hett's mother Figen Murray said the families should have been given more respect and time There were ""critical"" issues with communications between emergency services after the Manchester attack, a report says. Salman Abedi detonated a bomb after a concert on 22 May, killing 22 people. Lord Kerslake's progress report also criticised intrusive media attention and said public bodies dealing with families of the bereaved should make sure they are not overlooked. ""Certainly things didn't go in the way people would have wanted to,"" he said. Lord Kerslake said the issues were between both the different services and between the services and the public following the attack, after a concert by Ariana Grande. He added the panel had a ""better understanding"" of why there was a delay in the fire service entering the arena on the night. But he said he would not comment further under the publication of the full report in March. A leaked reportrevealed fire crews were deployed to the arena one hour and 47 minutes after the bombing. Stuart Murray, whose stepson Martyn Hett died, said media intrusion was ""not the way to make an impression"". Mr Murray said: ""The media found the addresses of our children who don't live at home and also some of Martyn's friends. ""His flatmate had people knocking and this was before we even had news and confirmation of what had happened. The review is assessing the emergency services' response to the attack at Manchester Arena Martyn Hett was one of the 22 people killed in the blast ""It makes you angry and cautious how you would deal with the media thereafter. That's not the way to make an impression if you want to work with the family or be involved with them. ""Overall I think we've been looked after fantastically by everybody involved, but there's always going to be lessons to be learned."" Lord Kerslake's progress report into the bombing said public bodies in Greater Manchester should adopt a charter proposed byBishop James Jones' Hillsborough review. The Kerslake review was commissioned by Mayor Andy Burnham to assess Greater Manchester's readiness for the attack and look at the response of the city's agencies and emergency services. Emergency services, NHS staff and Victoria station staff are among those who have contributed to the review More than 170 people, including young people who were at the concert, have participated in the review via a phone line set up by the NSPCC. The panel has also spoken to members of the emergency services and public bodies involved in the attack. The progress report said more than 400 documents have been submitted and the panel is also looking into the role of both mainstream and social media. St Ann's Square in Manchester became the focus of tributes after the attack Lord Kerslake said bereaved families and those injured had been put ""at the heart"" of the report. He said: ""The panel wants to ensure that the ethos of putting families first isn't lost following this tragedy or in the future; that's why we are recommending Greater Manchester adopts the Charter for Families Bereaved through Public Tragedy introduced as part of the Right Reverend Jones report."" Analysis By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent Every trainee reporter dreads the first time they are sent to do what's grimly known in the business as the ""death knock"". And it's largely down to their personal ethics and conduct how it will go. But if a death is part of a national news story - and friends and family have posted details on social media that the whole world can read - there are inevitably going to be more journalists, from more organisations, under more pressure from editors, to get ""the interview"". TheBBC's published Editorial Guidelinesstate we will not approach a family until there has been a thorough consideration of the public interest and the right to privacy. We will often write to a family or speak to a trusted intermediary rather than camp on the doorstep. The aim is to fulfil our duty to try to get the facts right - but also give them time and space to think without feeling under pressure. But at the same time, the public rely on journalists to report sad events - and to report them accurately. So an inevitable part of the job is always going to be speaking to people who are very upset - and who may, for understandable reasons, become upset at us for approaching them. Lord Kerslake said the review had given everyone the chance to ""share their experiences of that dreadful night and the days that followed"". The charter commits public bodies to ""becoming an organisation which strives to support the bereaved and vulnerable, put the public interest above their own reputation, assist the search for truth by being open and honest under scrutiny, be held to account and not mislead the public or the media"". Lord Kerslake added: ""We really wanted in this review to tell the story from the point of view of the bereaved and the injured and clearly a lot of the media handled things respectfully, but there were some occasions where they really didn't. Lord Kerslake is the former head of the civil service ""We want to look at what can we learn from this, it's all about the way in which people behave, the respect with which they treat those caught up in these terrible events."" Mr Burnham has urged for public bodies in Greater Manchester to sign up to the charter and ""provide their fullest co-operation"" to the panel.

"Mr Trump said he would prefer to take in migrants from nations like Norway, whose prime minister he met on Wednesday US President Donald Trump has drawn widespread criticism after reportedly describing African nations as ""shithole countries"" and suggesting immigrants from Haiti should be removed from the country. According to Democratic Senator Richard Durbin, who was present at the meeting, the president asked why the US should take immigrants from such countries, instead of from countries like Norway. Mr Trump's team did not initially deny the remarks. Mr Trump issued an apparent denial on Twitter on Friday, saying the language he used ""was tough, but this was not the language"". Full story: Trump 'in crude Oval Office outburst about migrants' TheUnited Nationshuman rights office called the reported comments ""shocking and shameful"". ""I'm sorry but there is no other word for this but racist"", said a spokesman in Geneva. TheAfrican Union(AU) said it was ""frankly alarmed"" by Mr Trump's statement. ""Given the historical reality of how many Africans arrived in the United States as slaves, this statement flies in the face of all accepted behaviour and practice,"" AU spokeswoman Ebba Kalondo told the Associated Press news agency. InBotswana, the US ambassador was summoned in a letter and asked ""to clarify if Botswana is regarded as a 'shithole' country"". The US ambassador toPanamaresigned, according to Reuters news agency, telling the State Department in a letter that he could no longer serve in the Trump administration. InHaiti, Rene Civil, a left-wing activist, demanded the US president apologise ""before the entire African continent, as well as before Haiti, the country whose blood has been used by ancestors who have served with their minds and bodies to liberate the United States itself from slavery"". InNigeria,one resident in Lagos told Reuters news agency: ""Calling [every] African country shithole is really, really, very bad and I think every African country should just learn from this and probably just stay in their country and work with their resources."" InSouth Africa, ANC deputy secretary general Jessie Duarte said: ""Ours is not a shithole country and neither is Haiti or any other country in distress. And it is extremely offensive for President Trump to make statements about other countries that are really not complimentary of the US's position or policy positions on those countries."" 11 things we never said before Trump What promises has Trump kept as president? In theUK, Prime Minister Theresa May's office said Ms May did not share Mr Trump's reported characterisation of the nations. A spokesman declined to comment on ""alleged private remarks"", but asked if Ms May viewed the countries Mr Trump was referring to as ""shitholes"", the spokesman replied: ""No."" An immigration policy analyst in Washington DC made the point that immigrants fromNorwayactually did badly out of immigration to the US at the turn of the last century. Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute, said ""this shows that the 'loser immigrants' from yesterday's 'shitholes' tend to turn into excellent, rich Americans after a few generations while their countries improve substantially"".

""We always knew that President Trump doesn't like people from certain countries or people [of] certain colours,"" said Congressman Luis Gutierrez. ""We can now we say with 100% confidence that the president is a racist who does not share the values enshrined in our constitution."" Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky said: ""Just when you thought Donald Trump could not get any more racist, he digs down to an even deeper low."" SomeRepublicansspoke out about over the remarks. Republican Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who was born in Cuba and whose south Florida district includes many Haitian immigrants, said: ""Shame on him.

"Young breast cancer patients with faulty BRCA genes have the same survival chances as those without, a study has found. The researchers, who looked at almost 3,000 women, also found outcomes were the same whatever kind of treatment women had - including mastectomies. Experts say it means women can take time to decide if the radical surgery is right for them. The study did not look at preventative mastectomies. These are offered to women with faulty genes to cut their risk of developing cancer. Mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes increase a woman's risk of breast cancer by four-to-eightfold and can explain why some families have lots of relatives diagnosed with breast cancer. The study, published inThe Lancet Oncology,external, found 12% of 2,733 women aged 18 to 40 treated for breast cancer at 127 hospitals across the UK between 2000 and 2008 had a BRCA mutation. The women's medical records were tracked for up to 10 years. During this time, 651 of the women died from breast cancer, and those with the BRCA mutation were equally likely to have survived at the two-, five- and 10-year mark as those without the genetic mutation. This was not affected by the women's body mass index or ethnicity. About a third of those with the BRCA mutation had a double mastectomy to remove both breasts after being diagnosed with cancer. This surgery did not appear to improve their chances of survival at the 10-year mark. But the researchers said surgery may still be beneficial for these patients to reduce their risk of a new cancer developing in the longer term. It has been dubbed the 'Angelina Jolie gene', after the actress revealed she underwent preventative surgery on learning she had an up to 87% chance of developing breast cancer. Everyone has the BRCA genes, but when a fault occurs in one of them it can result in DNA damage and lead to cells becoming cancerous. Around 1 in 800 women in the general population are thought to carry the mutation and 5% of women with breast cancer in the UK will have a faulty form of the BRCA gene. The faulty genes are also linked to an increased risk of ovarian and prostate cancers, as well as breast cancer. Angelina Jolie had a preventative mastectomy, before she developed cancer. These types of surgery were not examined in this study. Angelina Jolie had a double mastectomy, and her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed The study's author, Professor Diana Eccles, of the University of Southampton, said: ""Women diagnosed with early breast cancer who carry a BRCA mutation are often offered double mastectomies soon after their diagnosis or chemotherapy treatment. ""However, our findings suggest that this surgery does not have to be immediately undertaken along with the other treatment."" Fiona MacNeill, of the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, who was not involved in the research, said: ""This study can reassure young women with breast cancer, particularly those with triple negative cancer or who are BRCA carriers, that breast conservation with radiotherapy is a safe option in the first decade after diagnosis and double mastectomy is not essential or mandatory at initial treatment. She added: ""In view of this, younger women with breast cancer can take time to discuss whether radical breast surgery is the right choice for them as part of a longer-term risk reducing strategy."" Katherine Woods, from charity Breast Cancer Now said the findings ""could enable many patients to make even more informed choices regarding their treatment"". ""In particular, being able to give some women with triple negative breast cancer the choice to delay a risk-reducing mastectomy would allow them to take back control of a major part of their treatment and offer them more time to recover from their initial therapy."" She said she was now keen to understand how women fared more than 10 years after their diagnosis. The authors note the findings do not apply to older women.

"Recent disagreements over US and UK policies are understood not to have played a part Donald Trump has cancelled a planned visit to the UK in February, where he had been expected to open a new $1bn (Â£738m) US embassy in London. The US president tweeted he was not a ""big fan"" of the new embassy - which is moving from Mayfair to south London. He blamed Barack Obama's administration for a ""bad deal"" despite the fact the move was agreed under George W Bush. The trip was not the controversial full state visit offered by Theresa May, for which no date has yet been set. Reality Check: Who sold the US embassy in London? Trump 'in crude outburst about migrants' President's tweet mocked on social media What is a state visit? Downing Street said no date has been confirmed for any visit by Mr Trump and that the opening of the US embassy ""is a matter for the US"". The ""strong and deep"" partnership between Britain and the US ""will endure"" despite Mr Trump's cancellation, a spokesman added. However, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan - who has clashed with the president in the past -  said the US president had ""got the message"" that many Londoners were staunchly opposed to his policies and actions. BBC North America editor Jon Sopel said he suspected the possibility of protests in London would have also weighed in the calculation. Allow Twitter content?

The US embassy move was confirmed in October 2008, when President George W Bush was still in the White House. It was moved from its Mayfair site because it was too small to put in the modern security it needed, the BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale said. However, Mr Trump blamed former president Mr Obama's administration for selling ""perhaps the best located and finest embassy in London for peanuts"". May and Trump's festive phone call What will Donald Trump's medical reveal? Mr Trump also criticised the location of the new building in Vauxhall, south London, as an ""off location"", adding: ""Wanted me to cut ribbon-NO!"" The BBC's North America editor said February's planned visit could have included meetings with Mrs May at Chequers or Downing Street and lunch with the Queen. However, no firm date for the visit had ever been agreed, nor had the White House ""nailed down the details of the trip"", James Lansdale added. By BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale Donald Trump says that he is not coming to open the new US embassy in London because he is not a fan of the building. Some diplomats suggest the president was unimpressed by the low key nature of the proposed trip, shorn of the pomp and bling he expected. Others say the White House was worried about the scale of the public protests that were threatened. But amid all this is the nagging fear that the real reason is that Mr Trump just does not see the UK as a priority. In his first year of office, he has visited most other G7 countries and several European nations, including Belgium, so the absence of Britain from his itinerary stands out. Of course, trips - like tweets - can be easily remedied, and a visit by Mr Trump later this year could in theory dispel the fears. But with the UK at odds with the US on an increasing numbers of issues, from Iran to Jerusalem, the lack of a visit carries greater symbolic weight. The ribbon-cutting ceremony may instead be hosted by US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Mr Trump accepted the Queen's invitation for an official state visit when the prime minister met him last year. A petition calling for the invitation to be withdrawn was signed by more than 1.8m people, while the issue was also debated in parliament. Reports in June suggestedMr Trump wanted to delay a potential visitamid concerns about large-scale protests. However, the BBC understands Downing Street is considering options for the visit later in the year. This video can not be played Inside the new US embassy A former British ambassador to the United States, Christopher Meyer, told BBC Radio 4's World at One he would be ""surprised"" if the US president visited the UK in his first term. Mr Meyer said: ""It would be so difficult to manage from a security point of view [and] from a public point of view if he remained as unpopular among the British people at large as he is now."" Speaking last month, US ambassador to the UK Woody Johnson told the BBC he ""absolutely""expected Mr Trump to visit Britain in 2018. During the Queen's Speech at the State Opening of Parliament last summer, there was no mention of a visit - although a Downing Street spokesman said an invitation had been ""extended and accepted"". Mrs May was thefirst foreign leader to meet Mr Trump after his inaugurationwhen she visited the Oval Office in January 2017. Typically during state visits, the government, the visiting government and the royal household agree on a detailed schedule where the Queen acts as the official host. This video can not be played Nigel Farage and Chuka Umunna fall out on the Today programme over cancelled Trump UK visit The cancellation comes after recent disagreements between the US and UK. Mr Trump clashed with Mayor of London Sadiq Khan in the aftermath of the London Bridge attack last year, when he questioned Mr Khan's statement that there was ""no reason to be alarmed"". Mr Khan, who also questioned Mr Trump's proposed US travel ban, said the US president's visit would  ""without doubt have been met by mass peaceful protests"". Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played 'Mr President, are you a racist?' US President Donald Trump has sparked outrage by reportedly using crude language to describe foreign countries in an Oval Office meeting. Mr Trump insists he did not insult Haitians and appeared to deny calling any nations ""shitholes"", as was reported, prompting a global outcry. Democratic Senator Dick Durbin said Mr Trump called African countries ""shitholes"" and used ""racist"" language. But two Republicans present said they could not remember those comments. Senators Tom Cotton and David Perdue, of Arkansas and Georgia, said they heard the president ""call out"" what they described as ""the imbalance in our current immigration system"". Amid widespread coverage of his remarks at the private meeting with lawmakers to discuss immigration legislation on Thursday, Mr Trump on Friday tweeted that his language at the meeting had been ""tough"". But he added that the words attributed to him were ""not the language used"". This video can not be played Dick Durbin: ""Trump said these hate-filled things, and he said them repeatedly"" Many US media outlets reported the comments on Thursday, quoting witnesses or people briefed on the meeting. The White House did not deny them. ""I cannot believe that in the history of the White House, in that Oval Office, any president has ever spoken the words that I personally heard our president speak yesterday,"" Mr Durbin told reporters on Friday. House Speaker Paul Ryan, a top Republican, said the reported comments were ""unfortunate"" and ""unhelpful. Two views: Are Trump's views racist or not? Hillary Clinton, who lost to Mr Trump in the 2016 presidential election, said the country had been subjected to his ""ignorant, racist views of anyone who doesn't look like him"". Mr Trump ignored press questions about the issue as he signed a proclamation declaring a holiday in honour of civil rights hero Martin Luther King Jr - as presidents do every year. He said Americans were celebrating that ""self-evident truth"" that ""no matter what the colour of our skin or the place of our birth, we are all created equal by God"". Mr Trump's reported remarks came as lawmakers visited him on Thursday to discuss a bipartisan proposal that would impose new restrictions on immigration but protect the so-called ""Dreamers"" - hundreds of thousands immigrants brought to the US illegally as children - from deportation. Mr Trump was said to have told them that instead of granting temporary residency to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway. ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?"" the Washington Post quoted him as saying, in remarks first reported to be about Haiti, El Salvador and African nations. How countries have reacted What has Trump said about your country? Democrats decry 'cruel' immigration order Mr Durbin said that when Mr Trump was told that the largest groups of immigrants with Temporary Protected Status (TPS) were from El Salvador, Honduras and Haiti, the president responded: ""Haitians? Do we need more Haitians?"" But in another tweet on Friday the president denied that he insulted Haitians. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"The two leaders wished each other a happy Christmas and said they would remain in ""close touch"" Theresa May has discussed Brexit and events in the Middle East in a pre-Christmas phone call with Donald Trump. It is the first time they have spoken since last month's diplomatic spat over the US president's re-tweeting of anti-Muslim videos by a UK far-right group. No 10 said the two agreed on the importance of a ""swift"" transatlantic trade deal after the UK leaves the EU. Mrs May also reiterated her opposition to Mr Trump's plan to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Mr Trump said last month that he intended to move the country's embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a shift in longstanding US policy which has been criticised by European allies and much of the Arab world. The two leaders, who last met in September, had earlier clashed over Mr Trump's apparent endorsement of inflammatory tweets posted by a senior member of Britain First. Trump still on May's Christmas card list When Theresa met Donald Donald Trump retweets far-right videos No 10 described his actions as wrong which prompted the US president, in return, to chastise Mrs May on Twitter and urge her to focus her attention on tackling Islamic extremism. In a summary of Tuesday's phone call, Downing Street said the two leaders had covered a range of issues, including the humanitarian situation in Yemen amid the continuing conflict in the country. No 10 said the two leaders agreed ""on the vital importance of reopening humanitarian and commercial access to prevent famine and alleviate the suffering of innocent Yemenis"". On Israel, the leaders discussed their ""different positions"" on the US recognition of Jerusalem as the Israeli capital, agreeing ""on the importance of the US bringing forward new proposals for peace and the international community supporting these efforts"". Israel regards Jerusalem as its ""eternal and undivided"" capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem - occupied by Israel in the 1967 war - as the capital of a future Palestinian state. On the UK's future relations with Europe and the US, Downing Street said the two agreed ""on the importance of a swift post-Brexit bilateral trade deal"". It added: ""The prime minister updated the president on the recent good progress of the Brexit negotiations, and the president set out the progress he had made on his economic agenda."" Mr Trump has repeatedly said he wants to strike a quick trade agreement with the UK after it leaves in March 2019 but experts have said it will take years to negotiate. Soon after he took office in January, Mr Trump was invited on a state visit to the UK but no date has been set for the trip amid criticism from MPs of the president's conduct and stance on key issues. In its summary of the leaders' conversation, the White House made no direct reference to any discussion on Israel, focusing instead on the ""next steps in forging peace"" in the Middle East as well as on Yemen and Brexit. ""President Trump congratulated the prime minister on the decision by European Union leaders to move to the second phase of the Brexit negotiations,"" its statement concluded. Labour said it had taken two weeks for the British prime minister to raise her concerns about what it said was the president's ""dangerous"" policy towards Israel. ""She seems to have failed to use the opportunity to call him out for retweeting abhorrent Islamophobic material,"" a spokesman for the opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn added. ""As prime minister, May has a responsibility to stand up against hate and for all communities in our country.""

"Donald Trump's state visit to the UK is in fresh doubt after there was no mention of it in the Queen's Speech. The US president accepted the Queen's invitation for him to travel to Britain when Prime Minister Theresa May visited Washington in January. There have been reports that Mr Trump haschanged his mind and does not want to visitwhile there is potential for protests against him. But a Trump official told the BBC: ""The two governments are discussing dates."" Number 10 said the Queen had not mentioned the visit because no date had been set. Wednesday's Queen's Speech at the State Opening of Parliament saw the monarch announce the government's legislative programme for the next two years. The Queen also uses the speech to set out her official plans for the year. She said she looked forward to welcoming King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia of Spain for their state visit in July, and hosting the Commonwealth summit in April next year. But there was no word about Mr Trump's state visit. October had been suggested as a possible date. Brexit bills at heart of Queen's Speech Bill-by-bill guide: Queen's Speech Queen's Speech reflects weaker May A Downing Street spokesman said: ""An invitation has been extended and accepted. ""The visit wasn't mentioned in the Queen's Speech because a date hasn't been fixed yet."" In his last statement on the issue, White House spokesman Sean Spicer had said: ""Her Majesty extended an invitation to the president. He's accepted that invitation. And we look forward to scheduling that trip. ""There is nothing that was scheduled and we look forward to working out a mutually acceptable date with the United Kingdom, and look forward to sharing that date."" There is a very good reason for that date not being set. That is because there are concerns within the White House that if Donald Trump came to the UK, there would be some substantial protests. There is also a concern within the British government that it would not help US-UK relations if the US president was embarrassed. It is very unlikely he will be coming this year. This government has only so much bandwidth, that trying to work out precisely when they are going to have a visit from the US president, particularly if he is having cold feet, is something I imagine they will say to put on the back burner for a bit. When the invitation was first made by Theresa May on behalf of the Queen, there was a lot of concern that she had jumped the gun and gone too fast on this - to give a new US president the offer of a full state visit was a little premature. Normally that kind of offer does not come until well into the presidency. It quite often happens in a president's second term - if re-elected - and not all US presidents get full state visits. So the fact that it is going to be delayed will not come as a huge disappointment to many people who thought it was a little bit too much, too early.

"Young breast cancer patients with faulty BRCA genes have the same survival chances as those without, a study has found. The researchers, who looked at almost 3,000 women, also found outcomes were the same whatever kind of treatment women had - including mastectomies. Experts say it means women can take time to decide if the radical surgery is right for them. The study did not look at preventative mastectomies. These are offered to women with faulty genes to cut their risk of developing cancer. Mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes increase a woman's risk of breast cancer by four-to-eightfold and can explain why some families have lots of relatives diagnosed with breast cancer. The study, published inThe Lancet Oncology,external, found 12% of 2,733 women aged 18 to 40 treated for breast cancer at 127 hospitals across the UK between 2000 and 2008 had a BRCA mutation. The women's medical records were tracked for up to 10 years. During this time, 651 of the women died from breast cancer, and those with the BRCA mutation were equally likely to have survived at the two-, five- and 10-year mark as those without the genetic mutation. This was not affected by the women's body mass index or ethnicity. About a third of those with the BRCA mutation had a double mastectomy to remove both breasts after being diagnosed with cancer. This surgery did not appear to improve their chances of survival at the 10-year mark. But the researchers said surgery may still be beneficial for these patients to reduce their risk of a new cancer developing in the longer term. It has been dubbed the 'Angelina Jolie gene', after the actress revealed she underwent preventative surgery on learning she had an up to 87% chance of developing breast cancer. Everyone has the BRCA genes, but when a fault occurs in one of them it can result in DNA damage and lead to cells becoming cancerous. Around 1 in 800 women in the general population are thought to carry the mutation and 5% of women with breast cancer in the UK will have a faulty form of the BRCA gene. The faulty genes are also linked to an increased risk of ovarian and prostate cancers, as well as breast cancer. Angelina Jolie had a preventative mastectomy, before she developed cancer. These types of surgery were not examined in this study. Angelina Jolie had a double mastectomy, and her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed The study's author, Professor Diana Eccles, of the University of Southampton, said: ""Women diagnosed with early breast cancer who carry a BRCA mutation are often offered double mastectomies soon after their diagnosis or chemotherapy treatment. ""However, our findings suggest that this surgery does not have to be immediately undertaken along with the other treatment."" Fiona MacNeill, of the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, who was not involved in the research, said: ""This study can reassure young women with breast cancer, particularly those with triple negative cancer or who are BRCA carriers, that breast conservation with radiotherapy is a safe option in the first decade after diagnosis and double mastectomy is not essential or mandatory at initial treatment. She added: ""In view of this, younger women with breast cancer can take time to discuss whether radical breast surgery is the right choice for them as part of a longer-term risk reducing strategy."" Katherine Woods, from charity Breast Cancer Now said the findings ""could enable many patients to make even more informed choices regarding their treatment"". ""In particular, being able to give some women with triple negative breast cancer the choice to delay a risk-reducing mastectomy would allow them to take back control of a major part of their treatment and offer them more time to recover from their initial therapy."" She said she was now keen to understand how women fared more than 10 years after their diagnosis. The authors note the findings do not apply to older women.

"Angela Merkel and Martin Schulz stressed the need for social cohesion German politicians have achieved a breakthrough in talks aimed at forming a new coalition government. A blueprint for formal negotiations was agreed between Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) and their former coalition partners, the Social Democrats (SPD). Politicians stayed up all night to discuss the 28-page document, with the talks lasting more than 24 hours. But they managed to reach agreement on key sticking points such as migration. They plan to limit asylum-seeker arrivals to about 200,000 annually. The blueprint also speaks of capping at 1,000 a month the number of migrants who will be allowed to join their family living in Germany. Mrs Merkel and SPD leader Martin Schulz told a news conference they were optimistic that a new ""grand coalition"" could be formed. They spoke of a ""fresh start"" for Germany, and Mr Schulz said that in Europe ""we are determined to deploy Germany's strength"". Both stressed the need to ensure Germany's ""social cohesion"", a veiled recognition of voter frustration with centrist politics, amid tensions over the influx of asylum seekers. The September election saw the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) win 94 seats in parliament - a first for post-war Germany. Both the CDU and SPD suffered their worst election results for more than 50 years. By Jenny Hill in Berlin After a gruelling all-night session - fuelled by currywurst - Angela Merkel appears to have clinched the deal. The breakthrough is no doubt a relief to the chancellor, who might have faced the prospect of fresh elections had the talks failed. But Mrs Merkel won't be cracking open the Sekt straight away. These were just exploratory talks, aimed at establishing whether there's a basis upon which a coalition can be formally negotiated. Before the next round of talks can go ahead, the SPD must give the go-ahead at a special party conference. Bear in mind that many in the SPD - which had originally refused to work with Mrs Merkel again - blame her for their disastrous election result, and are still uncomfortable about another four years in her shadow. Even if they approve the negotiations, any coalition treaty will be put to the SPD's 400,000 members in a postal ballot. Mrs Merkel is not out of the woods yet. Merkel's coalition marathon keeps Germany waiting Angela Merkel's quiet power Germany country profile German official figures show that 280,000 asylum seekers arrived in 2016, a drop of more than 600,000 on the total for 2015. Arrivals fell after EU countries and Turkey tightened border controls. However, the number of asylum applications continued to rise in 2016. The huge 2015 influx - many of them Syrians, Iraqis and Afghans fleeing war - created a major integration problem for German authorities. The centre-right CDU and its Bavarian CSU ally have been unable to form a government since the inconclusive election. The German dailyDie Zeit published the text of the CDU/CSU-SPD blueprint for formal negotiations.,externalUnder a coalition the parties would seek to: Crack down on tax avoidance in the EU, plugging tax loopholes exploited by US tech giants and other big corporations Press for ""equal pay for equal work"" across the EU, to make the labour market fairer Turn the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) - the main bailout fund - into a European Monetary Fund under parliamentary control Seek joint policies with France on all major international issues Create a centre for artificial intelligence with France Adopt measures to reduce child poverty, strengthen equal rights for women and attract more foreign skilled workers to Germany Promote renewable energy, so that it achieves a 65% share of power generation by 2030. Initially the SPD ruled out governing with Mrs Merkel in charge again. But Mr Schulz changed his mind after CDU coalition talks with the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) and Greens broke down. It is Germany's longest ever post-war period of coalition-building and there is still a long way to go before a coalition deal can be clinched. The SPD will hold a special congress in Bonn on 21 January to decide how to proceed. Merkel's coalition marathon keeps Germany waiting Germany crisis: What are the options?

"This video can not be played Martyn Hett's mother Figen Murray said the families should have been given more respect and time There were ""critical"" issues with communications between emergency services after the Manchester attack, a report says. Salman Abedi detonated a bomb after a concert on 22 May, killing 22 people. Lord Kerslake's progress report also criticised intrusive media attention and said public bodies dealing with families of the bereaved should make sure they are not overlooked. ""Certainly things didn't go in the way people would have wanted to,"" he said. Lord Kerslake said the issues were between both the different services and between the services and the public following the attack, after a concert by Ariana Grande. He added the panel had a ""better understanding"" of why there was a delay in the fire service entering the arena on the night. But he said he would not comment further under the publication of the full report in March. A leaked reportrevealed fire crews were deployed to the arena one hour and 47 minutes after the bombing. Stuart Murray, whose stepson Martyn Hett died, said media intrusion was ""not the way to make an impression"". Mr Murray said: ""The media found the addresses of our children who don't live at home and also some of Martyn's friends. ""His flatmate had people knocking and this was before we even had news and confirmation of what had happened. The review is assessing the emergency services' response to the attack at Manchester Arena Martyn Hett was one of the 22 people killed in the blast ""It makes you angry and cautious how you would deal with the media thereafter. That's not the way to make an impression if you want to work with the family or be involved with them. ""Overall I think we've been looked after fantastically by everybody involved, but there's always going to be lessons to be learned."" Lord Kerslake's progress report into the bombing said public bodies in Greater Manchester should adopt a charter proposed byBishop James Jones' Hillsborough review. The Kerslake review was commissioned by Mayor Andy Burnham to assess Greater Manchester's readiness for the attack and look at the response of the city's agencies and emergency services. Emergency services, NHS staff and Victoria station staff are among those who have contributed to the review More than 170 people, including young people who were at the concert, have participated in the review via a phone line set up by the NSPCC. The panel has also spoken to members of the emergency services and public bodies involved in the attack. The progress report said more than 400 documents have been submitted and the panel is also looking into the role of both mainstream and social media. St Ann's Square in Manchester became the focus of tributes after the attack Lord Kerslake said bereaved families and those injured had been put ""at the heart"" of the report. He said: ""The panel wants to ensure that the ethos of putting families first isn't lost following this tragedy or in the future; that's why we are recommending Greater Manchester adopts the Charter for Families Bereaved through Public Tragedy introduced as part of the Right Reverend Jones report."" Analysis By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent Every trainee reporter dreads the first time they are sent to do what's grimly known in the business as the ""death knock"". And it's largely down to their personal ethics and conduct how it will go. But if a death is part of a national news story - and friends and family have posted details on social media that the whole world can read - there are inevitably going to be more journalists, from more organisations, under more pressure from editors, to get ""the interview"". TheBBC's published Editorial Guidelinesstate we will not approach a family until there has been a thorough consideration of the public interest and the right to privacy. We will often write to a family or speak to a trusted intermediary rather than camp on the doorstep. The aim is to fulfil our duty to try to get the facts right - but also give them time and space to think without feeling under pressure. But at the same time, the public rely on journalists to report sad events - and to report them accurately. So an inevitable part of the job is always going to be speaking to people who are very upset - and who may, for understandable reasons, become upset at us for approaching them. Lord Kerslake said the review had given everyone the chance to ""share their experiences of that dreadful night and the days that followed"". The charter commits public bodies to ""becoming an organisation which strives to support the bereaved and vulnerable, put the public interest above their own reputation, assist the search for truth by being open and honest under scrutiny, be held to account and not mislead the public or the media"". Lord Kerslake added: ""We really wanted in this review to tell the story from the point of view of the bereaved and the injured and clearly a lot of the media handled things respectfully, but there were some occasions where they really didn't. Lord Kerslake is the former head of the civil service ""We want to look at what can we learn from this, it's all about the way in which people behave, the respect with which they treat those caught up in these terrible events."" Mr Burnham has urged for public bodies in Greater Manchester to sign up to the charter and ""provide their fullest co-operation"" to the panel.

"Young breast cancer patients with faulty BRCA genes have the same survival chances as those without, a study has found. The researchers, who looked at almost 3,000 women, also found outcomes were the same whatever kind of treatment women had - including mastectomies. Experts say it means women can take time to decide if the radical surgery is right for them. The study did not look at preventative mastectomies. These are offered to women with faulty genes to cut their risk of developing cancer. Mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes increase a woman's risk of breast cancer by four-to-eightfold and can explain why some families have lots of relatives diagnosed with breast cancer. The study, published inThe Lancet Oncology,external, found 12% of 2,733 women aged 18 to 40 treated for breast cancer at 127 hospitals across the UK between 2000 and 2008 had a BRCA mutation. The women's medical records were tracked for up to 10 years. During this time, 651 of the women died from breast cancer, and those with the BRCA mutation were equally likely to have survived at the two-, five- and 10-year mark as those without the genetic mutation. This was not affected by the women's body mass index or ethnicity. About a third of those with the BRCA mutation had a double mastectomy to remove both breasts after being diagnosed with cancer. This surgery did not appear to improve their chances of survival at the 10-year mark. But the researchers said surgery may still be beneficial for these patients to reduce their risk of a new cancer developing in the longer term. It has been dubbed the 'Angelina Jolie gene', after the actress revealed she underwent preventative surgery on learning she had an up to 87% chance of developing breast cancer. Everyone has the BRCA genes, but when a fault occurs in one of them it can result in DNA damage and lead to cells becoming cancerous. Around 1 in 800 women in the general population are thought to carry the mutation and 5% of women with breast cancer in the UK will have a faulty form of the BRCA gene. The faulty genes are also linked to an increased risk of ovarian and prostate cancers, as well as breast cancer. Angelina Jolie had a preventative mastectomy, before she developed cancer. These types of surgery were not examined in this study. Angelina Jolie had a double mastectomy, and her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed The study's author, Professor Diana Eccles, of the University of Southampton, said: ""Women diagnosed with early breast cancer who carry a BRCA mutation are often offered double mastectomies soon after their diagnosis or chemotherapy treatment.

About 4,600 passengers arrive at Nottingham station during each weekday morning between 07:00 and 10:00, according to the Department for Transport. Thestation has recently undergone a Â£50m redevelopment, incorporating a new tram bridge, including the restoration and upgrade of its Edwardian grade II listed front building. People were evacuated from Nottingham station Eyewitness Sarah McMullan said she saw smoke coming from a toilet at the station's car park. ""You don't think much of it when there's a little bit of smoke and police already there, but then we were evacuated,"" she said. ""It was pretty frightening to see how quickly a fire can grow. You can see billowing smoke and flames above the roof on the far side."" BBC Radio Nottingham's Andy Whittaker said he saw ""thick plumes of black smoke"" coming from the station. He said many people were left waiting outside the building after being told to leave. Smoke filled the foyer at the station after the fire broke out Dr Remigius Ilione, 49, said: ""I drove into the car park and I could already hear the fire alarm. ""The smoke was so thick that you could not see in front of you."" Queens Road and Carrington Street were closed in both directions, which created heavy traffic on surrounding routes, but while there have been partial reopenings, disruption remains.

Jo Johnson hoped the station will be up and running again in ""a few days"" Visiting the station, Transport Minister Jo Johnson said: ""It has been a devastating incident, but it has been an extraordinary response from the emergency services. ""We saw an exemplary evacuation this morning. There were about 200 or 300 passengers at the start of the rush hour who were evacuated safely. ""As far as we can tell no-one has been hurt in the incident and we really do owe a huge debt of gratitude to the emergency services.

"The changes have been described as ""significant"" by industry watchers Facebook is to change how its news feed works, making posts from businesses, brands and media less prominent. Instead, content that sparks conversations among family and friends who use the site will be emphasised, explained chief executiveMark Zuckerberg on his page,external. Organisations on Facebook may see the popularity of their posts decrease as a result, the firm acknowledged. The changes will take effect over the coming weeks. ""We've gotten feedback from our community that public content - posts from businesses, brands and media - is crowding out the personal moments that lead us to connect more with each other,"" wrote Mr Zuckerberg. He said that he and his team felt a responsibility to make sure Facebook was good for people's wellbeing. If public content is to be promoted, it will now have to be seen to encourage community interaction - as happens within the tight-knit groups that discuss TV programmes and sports, he said. Another example given by Facebookin a separate post,externalwas live video feeds, which tend to generate much discussion. ""By making these changes, I expect the time people spend on Facebook and some measures of engagement will go down,"" added Mr Zuckerberg. ""But I also expect the time you do spend on Facebook will be more valuable."" Representatives from Facebook, Twitter and Google were grilled on the issue of online disinformation at a US Senate hearing last October In a previous post, Mr Zuckerberg had vowed to ""fix"" Facebook in 2018, saying he wanted to ensure that users were protected from abuse and that time spent on the site would be time well spent. He also pledged to defend Facebook from nation states. Analysis has recently suggested that some actors,including Russia, have tried to manipulate content on the social network. Mark Zuckerberg vows to 'fix' Facebook Facebook - the secret election weapon ""It's definitely a significant change,"" said Laura Hazard Owen at Harvard University's Nieman Journalism Lab. ""It's going to affect publishers a lot, we're going to be seeing a lot less news organically pop up in our news feeds."" Ms Owen added, however, that Facebook had not been very clear about what sort of discussions the site's revamped algorithms would prioritise. It might end up being ""the most controversial stuff"" that generates heated conversations, she suggested, or simply content pulled in from group pages where users engage with others on specific topics. Given recent public scrutiny, the social network was currently ""in the hot seat"", said Gabriel Kahn from the University of Southern California Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. ""Facebook is in the midst of all of these fires it's trying to put out, it's trying to reassert its warm and fuzzy brand value that it has always tried to put forth,"" he told the BBC. Mr Kahn added the update from Mr Zuckerberg was a ""clear admission"" that Facebook wielded significant power over the health of society. However, he argued that the new priorities could further distort views and the nature of conversations. ""There should be public debate about the values they're applying to that algorithm,"" he said. In many ways this is Facebook getting back to its roots, making your news feed more about what your friends are creating and thinking, rather than articles they have shared. For the first time, Mark Zuckerberg is making a major decision that goes against one of his long-held beliefs: any change to the network must have the goal of improving engagement. This move, he concedes, will likely lead to people spending less time on the site. But after a tough 2017, Mr Zuckerberg is perhaps learning now that in the wake of the fake news scandal, and a platform brimming with tedious clickbait, not all engagement is good engagement. Faced with the enormous task of having to do more to moderate what's happening on his network, Mr Zuckerberg may have come to the conclusion that having a news free-for-all is becoming more trouble than it's worth. For news organisations and publications, this might spell bad news: a lot of traffic comes from Facebook. With less prominence, expect some viral sites to very quickly go out of business. The new change of course will cost Facebook money. Mr Zuckerberg warned investors at the end of last year that combating fake news would hurt the firm's bottom line. The question now is: by how much?

Kirsty Derry, deputy managing director of Stagecoach, East Midland Train's parent company, apologised for the disruption but said they were ""really optimistic"" about services at the station on Saturday but warned there would be ""gaps"". About 4,600 passengers arrive at Nottingham station during each weekday morning between 07:00 and 10:00, according to the Department for Transport. Thestation has recently undergone a Â£50m redevelopment, incorporating a new tram bridge, including the restoration and upgrade of its Edwardian grade II listed front building. People were evacuated from Nottingham station Eyewitness Sarah McMullan said she saw smoke coming from a toilet at the station's car park. ""You don't think much of it when there's a little bit of smoke and police already there, but then we were evacuated,"" she said. ""It was pretty frightening to see how quickly a fire can grow. You can see billowing smoke and flames above the roof on the far side."" BBC Radio Nottingham's Andy Whittaker said he saw ""thick plumes of black smoke"" coming from the station. He said many people were left waiting outside the building after being told to leave. Smoke filled the foyer at the station after the fire broke out Dr Remigius Ilione, 49, said: ""I drove into the car park and I could already hear the fire alarm. ""The smoke was so thick that you could not see in front of you."" Queens Road and Carrington Street were closed in both directions, which created heavy traffic on surrounding routes, but while there have been partial reopenings, disruption remains. There have been reports of 40-minute delays on bus services. Trams into the city were also disrupted by the fire and a separate incident, but began to run past the station at about 14:30 BST. Jo Johnson hoped the station will be up and running again in ""a few days"" Visiting the station, Transport Minister Jo Johnson said: ""It has been a devastating incident, but it has been an extraordinary response from the emergency services. ""We saw an exemplary evacuation this morning. There were about 200 or 300 passengers at the start of the rush hour who were evacuated safely. ""As far as we can tell no-one has been hurt in the incident and we really do owe a huge debt of gratitude to the emergency services. East Midlands Trains has done a great job ensuring no-one was hurt and everyone was evacuated safely. "" He added that he hoped the station should be back up and running in the ""next few days"".

"The Crosthwaites' home is dwarfed by what will be Europe's most expensive stadium at Â£1bn Little has ever stood between Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich and realising his ambitions for the club. But plans for areported Â£1bn new stadium,externalare being held up by one family over their right to light - and the lack of it shining into their home when the new Stamford Bridge is built. The Crosthwaites have lived in their west London cottage for 50 years and it is so close to the Premier League club's ground that you could almost kick a football from their doorstep onto the pitch. The family - made up of parents Lucinda and Nicolas, plus children Louis and Rose - took out an injunction in May over their belief the towering new 60,000-capacity stadium will cast a permanent shadow over parts of their home. The new stadium was granted planning permission one year ago and has beensigned off by the Mayor of London,but Chelsea have called on the local council to intervene and take advantage of planning laws to stop the injunction effectively ending the planned development. Hammersmith and Fulham councillors are meeting on Monday to decide what happens next. Billionaire Abramovich is a man who usually gets what he wants, but the dispute has already put the brakes on the project's investment and there is a risk that Europe's most expensive stadium may not even get built. The club have told the local council that work cannot go ahead while there remains a risk the injunction could successfully stop the development. And the council says if it does not act to help Chelsea the ""development would not proceed as proposed"". Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich has invested more than Â£1bn in the club since 2003 The Crosthwaites own a large house in an expensive part of west London - a three-bedroom property on the same street sold for Â£1.18m last year. Chelsea's offer of legal advice worth Â£50,000, and further compensation understood to be in the region of a six-figure sum could not persuade them to waive their 'right to light' in their home. Daughter Rose says their home is the nearest property to the new stadium. And even though it's on the other side of a railway from Stamford Bridge - and in a different borough - she says that ""sunlight and daylight will be seriously affected"". ""It is deemed as having an unacceptable and harmful impact by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea,"" she added in a recent letter as part of the case. The family have said via their lawyers they are not opposed to the redevelopment of the stadium, but have suggested the east stand in question could be ""cut-back or re-designed so as not to cause interference"". And they have highlighted a ""disproportionate amount of hospitality seating"" which takes up more space than normal seating. They say there will be almost 17,000 hospitality seats, 28% of the total, and compare that to Arsenal's Emirates Stadium where hospitality comprises 16% of the capacity. The family also believe Chelsea's attempt to effectively sidestep the injunction with the help of Hammersmith and Fulham council is not in the public interest and possibly illegal. Their house sits in the neighbouring Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, which they say has been firmly opposed to the development. The back of Stamford Bridge (left) is only a drop-kick from the front of the Crosthwaites' home (right) Premier League champions Chelsea have outlined that the planning and development of their new stadium has been above board on every aspect. A public consultation of 13,000 local residents earned 97.5% support, and they have paid compensation to other homeowners who have been affected by losing their 'right to light'. Chelsea also claim that the new stadium will ""further enhance the economic, cultural and social services they provide"", including Â£6m worth of educational programmes, a Â£7m improvement to local infrastructure and an additional Â£16.3m spent in local businesses as 2.4 million people visit the area annually. That forms the key argument in the part of the law being disputed -section 203 of the Housing and Planning Act 2016.,external Chelsea say the land can be compulsorily acquired by the council - and override the injunction - if Hammersmith and Fulham think it would contribute to the economic, environmental or social wellbeing of the area. The club also says it will lease the land off the council and cover any liabilities or costs. The family's lawyers say the council can purchase land ""which they require"" but ask whether it is ""convenient"" rather than ""indispensable"". From the scene - BBC Sport's Simon Stone There is no doubt the Crosthwaites live in a very desirable part of London. The trees which shield them from the railway line are part of a conservation area. However, their home is not an enormous property. Chelsea players who perform at Stamford Bridge will doubtless live in far bigger homes. The thing that makes this particular house unique is that, unlike all the other properties on the street, it is directly opposite the stadium. All the rest look straight at an adjacent hotel, which is to be pulled down to allow Stamford Bridge to be rebuilt. Those houses could get marginally more light because the stadium will be further away. For the Crosthwaites, no such consolation exists. And, as the family have occupied the same house for half a century, they are committed to fighting Roman Abramovich, no matter how much the odds are stacked against them. The new stadium has been designed by architects Herzog and De Meuron, who were also responsible for the ""Bird's Nest"" Olympic stadium in Beijing Hammersmith and Fulham council accepts that acquiring the land should only be done where necessary to allow beneficial regeneration to take place and be sure that it justifies interfering with the human rights of those affected. A report for councillors, drawn up by head of planning and regeneration John Finlayson and to be discussed on Monday, recommends that the council buys the land (owned by Chelsea and Network Rail) and leases it back to the club so that development can go ahead. As it stands, the club ""will not be able to implement the development or secure any necessary development financing whilst there remains a risk that the existing injunctive proceedings might succeed"", the report warns. Finlayson's report adds: ""There is a compelling case in the public interest for the council to acquire the land for planning purposes and enable the development to proceed and the public benefits to be realised."" Without the council exercising its statutory powers, though, the ""development would not proceed as proposed"" it warns. It is understood that should the council decide to pursue the purchase, the Crosthwaite family will seek further legal advice - so the case may yet still run. Chelsea's Stamford Bridge holds 41,663 fans - some way behind their main London rivals Abramovich has wanted to increase Chelsea's stadium capacity for several years but was thwarted in his previous attempts to buy Battersea Power Station, ultimately losing out to property developers. If successful, the Blues would not be able to move into their new home until the 2024-25 season, yet it would at last put them in line with their main London rivals. Eleven years ago, Arsenal built the 60,000-seat Emirates Stadium, in 2016 West Ham moved to the 57,000-capacity Olympic Stadium, and Tottenham are redeveloping their White Hart Lane ground at the moment. The 41,000-capacity Stamford Bridge is the seventh biggest stadium used by a Premier League team, well behind Manchester United's 75,500-seater Old Trafford. Chelsea are yet to find a temporary home for the four years it might take to build the new stadium, but Wembley Stadium is being considered as a possible option.

"Police guard the hotel's rear entrance on Cambon Street French police have recovered all the jewellery stolen by armed robbers from a shop at the famous Ritz Hotel in Paris on Wednesday, sources say. They say the loot worth some â¬4.5m (Â£4m; $5.4m) was in a bag dropped by one member of the five-strong gang during the brazen raid. Three men have been arrested, police said, while others remain on the run. The five-star Ritz is in Place VendÃ´me, in Paris' historical first district on the right bank of the river Seine. ""I can confirm that all the stolen jewels were found in the bag recovered by police officers,"" a source close to the investigation was quoted as saying by Reuters. The gang used axes to smash the shop's windows on the ground floor of the hotel at about 18:00 local time (17:00 GMT). Le Parisien newspaper, citing a police source, reported that the robbery was interrupted by an officer on patrol. Three robbers were later arrested after being blocked in the building. But another two thieves, who waited outside, managed to escape by car and scooter. The stolen jewels were found in the bag dropped by the thief on the scooter, the sources say, as he collided with a pedestrian. Meanwhile, the getaway car used by his accomplice was later found in Sannois, just north of the French capital. The luxurious hotel is located next door to the French justice ministry.

"This video can not be played A timeline of what Trump has said about the Iran deal US President Donald Trump will continue to suspend key sanctions on Iran, and so avoiding jeopardising the 2015 nuclear agreement, US officials say. But Mr Trump is expected to set a deadline for Congress and European allies to improve the deal or the US will abandon it, the officials say. He is also likely to impose a new set of sanctions targeting Iranian firms and individuals, a top aide has said. Mr Trump has strongly criticised the deal, which helped end a long crisis. European powers say that the accord is vital for international security. The agreement between six global powers and Iran saw decades of international and US nuclear-related sanctions suspended when Iran agreed to limit its nuclear programme. The US still maintains separate sanctions on Iran related to matters such as terrorism, human rights and ballistic missile development. The White House is due to make an official announcement on Friday. The US president declared in October that the agreement was ""one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into"",external, and warned that within a few years Iran would be able to ""sprint towards a rapid nuclear weapons breakout"". He accused Iran of committing ""multiple violations"" and promised to work with Congress to ""address the deal's many serious flaws"". Mr Trump said they included the deal's ""sunset clauses"", one of which allows for the lifting of restrictions on Iran's uranium enrichment programme after 2025. He also wants to give the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) access to Iranian military sites, and for the deal to cover Iran's ballistic missile programme. In its most recent quarterly review, the IAEA, the global nuclear body, said Iran was complying with treaty. This video can not be played Boris Johnson on Iran nuclear deal: 'I don't think anybody has come up with a better idea' Critics of the deal in the US Congress have also proposed amending legislation to ensure that sanctions would ""snap back"" automatically if Iran carried out certain actions. The sanctions, which were suspended in 2016, had cut Iran's central bank out of the international financial system and imposed penalties for buying Iranian oil. The foreign ministers of Britain, France, Germany and the European Union met their Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif in Brussels on Thursday to reaffirm their commitment to the accord, which was also backed by China and Russia.

"This video can not be played A timeline of what Trump has said about the Iran deal US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin has said he expects President Donald Trump to impose new sanctions on Iran. The news comes as Mr Trump faces a Friday deadline to decide whether to waive other major sanctions on Iran lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal. Earlier, European powers urged Mr Trump to uphold that agreement, saying it was vital for international security. Mr Trump has criticised the deal, which saw sanctions lifted when Iran agreed to limit its nuclear fuel production. Mr Mnuchin told reporters he was expecting new sanctions on Iran to be announced - which previous reports have suggested could be targeted measures against Iranian individuals and businesses. ""We continue to look at them. We've rolled them out and I think you can expect there will be more sanctions coming."" The US president says he wants to amend the deal - or withdraw from it completely. In October, he refused to recertify for Congress that Iran was complying with the deal, accusing it of ""not living up to the spirit"" of the agreement. The BBC's Gary O'Donoghue, in Washington, says that while the future of the major sanctions is an open question, the new measures could help the president fend off criticisms from his supporters that he's not fulfilling a key campaign promise  to ""rip up"" the nuclear deal with Iran.

"US President Donald Trump has reportedly lashed out at immigrants in a foul-mouthed Oval Office outburst that a UN spokesman later condemned as ""shocking"", ""shameful"" and ""racist"". ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?"" Mr Trump reportedly asked lawmakers during talks on an immigration deal. He was apparently referring to Haiti, El Salvador and African countries. The White House made no attempt to deny the comment. In recent weeks, the Trump administration has been trying to limit the number of family members of immigrants who can enter the US, and has moved to end the protected status of thousands of immigrants already in the US. Mr Trump's reported remark came as lawmakers from both parties visited him on Thursday to propose a bipartisan immigration deal. Shock over Trump migrants remarks Migrant success stories from maligned countries Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, according to US media. This video can not be played The countries with Temporary Protected Status that Trump could be talking about According to the Washington Post, Mr Trump told lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, whose prime minister visited him a day earlier. The paper quoted him as saying: ""Why do we need more Haitians? Take them out."" Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, was in Thursday's meeting at the White House, but would not comment on the president's reported slur. ""Certain Washington politicians choose to fight for foreign countries, but President Trump will always fight for the American people,"" a statement from White House spokesman Raj Shah said. ""Like other countries that have merit-based immigration, President Trump is fighting for permanent solutions that make our country stronger by welcoming those who can contribute to our society, grow our economy and assimilate into our great nation. ""He will always reject temporary, weak and dangerous stopgap measures that threaten the lives of hardworking Americans, and undercut immigrants who seek a better life in the United States through a legal pathway."" What has actually changed under Trump? Spy bill passed after Trump 'abuse' tweet Donald Trump scraps UK February visit UN human rights spokesman Rupert Colville said: ""If confirmed these are shocking and shameful comments from the president of the United States, I'm sorry but there is no other word for this but racist."" Mr Colville spoke of a 2016 presidential campaign speech in which Mr Trump called Mexican immigrants criminals and rapists, and his response last year to a white supremacist march that ended in violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, when the president said ""both sides"" were to blame. The UN official said such comments went against ""universal values the world has been striving for"" since the end of World War Two, and opened ""the door to humanity's worst side"". Trump condemned for response to far-right What made Trump's Charlottesville remarks so offensive? This video can not be played A look back at some of the things Donald Trump has said about Mexicans What has Trump said about your country? In the US, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) accused the president of falling ""deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole of racism and xenophobia"". Mia Love, a Utah Republican and the only Haitian-American in Congress, demanded Mr Trump apologise for the ""unkind, divisive, elitist"" comments. Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democratic lawmaker,tweeted,external: ""I condemn this unforgivable statement and this demeaning of the office of the Presidency."" Another black Democratic lawmaker, Cedric Richmond, said Mr Trump's comments ""are further proof that his Make America Great Again agenda is really a Make America White Again agenda"". But one Trump official was quoted by CNN as saying: ""Though this might enrage Washington, staffers predict the comment will resonate with his base, much like his attacks on NFL players who kneel during the National Anthem did not alienate it."" The Washington Post broke the story with the word ""shithole"" in its headline and in the alert that the paper sent out to followers' smartphones. On US TV, some broadcasters gave content warnings or avoided saying the word altogether. Fox News used asterisks to obscure the offensive word along the bottom of the screen, but CNN and MSNBC carried it in full. Around the world, journalists reporting in other languages faced the question of how to translate what Mr Trump had said. In French, headlines featured ""pays de merde"", using the expletive to refer to the countries but without the word ""hole"" In Spanish, ""paÃ­ses de mierda"" was used, similar to the French, as well as ""paÃ­ses de porquerÃ­a"", which means ""trash countries"" In German, ""Drecksloch"" , which literally means dirt hole but like the word used by Mr Trump is considered vulgar In Dutch, one newspaper used ""achterlijk"" (backward) as its headline In Japanese, a word that translates as ""outdoor toilet"" was used In Portuguese, one outlet used a word that translates as 'pigsty', while others translated the quote literally Allow Twitter content?

Lawmakers reportedly proposed restoring so-called Temporary Protected Status (TPS) permits for certain countries, allowing their residents leave to remain in the US because their home countries are temporarily unsafe for them. In return, they were said to have offered $1.5bn (Â£1.1bn) for a wall that Mr Trump wants built on the US border with Mexico. This week the Trump administrationannounced it was withdrawing TPSfor more than 200,000 people from El Salvador. The decision gives Salvadoreans who have been living in the US for nearly three decades until next year to leave, seek lawful residency or face possible deportation. They were granted provisional US residency after an earthquake devastated the Central American country in 2001. This video can not be played TPS recipients from El Salvador worried about their future in the US But the State Department said on Monday that much infrastructure damaged by the quake has since been repaired.

But she stressed the ""special relationship"" between Britain and the US was ""in both our nations' interests"" and should continue. And she rejected calls to cancel a state visit by the US president. Speaking on a visit to Jordan, she said: ""An invitation for a state visit has been extended and has been accepted.

""And I'm very clear that retweeting from Britain First was the wrong thing to do."" The BBC's deputy political editor John Pienaarsaid in his blogthat ""managing a calm and stable relationship with a president like Donald Trump looks like a task that's well beyond Theresa May - and arguably - anyone else"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she agreed with Theresa May's criticism of Mr Trump, but thought she should go further and halt plans for a state visit next year.

Theresa May and Donald Trump meeting at the UN General Assembly By Anthony Zurcher, North America reporter It's clear at this point that Donald Trump won't let a perceived slight or criticism go unanswered - even if it's from a supposed friend. Even if it's from the leader of the president's closest international ally. So shock isn't exactly the right word to describe the reaction to Mr Trump's initially botched attempt to tell Theresa May to, in effect, mind her own business. This is just another example of the US president's self-described ""modern-day presidential"" use of social media, where Twitter is a cudgel for score-settling no matter the diplomatic cost. When Mr Trump assumed the presidency, one of the first foreign dignitaries he received was Mrs May, and it appeared they formed a quick bond -briefly holding hands as they walked past the White House Rose Garden. Those bonds will now be tested in a spat over a few morning retweets of inflammatory videos. It's a wholly unnecessary controversy, but the international consequences could be all too real. Read more from Anthony The US and the UK are close allies and often described as having a ""special relationship"". Theresa May was the first foreign leader to visit the Trump White House. The row was raised in the House of Commons on Thursday morning with Home Secretary Amber Rudd saying she hoped Mrs May's criticism ""would have some impact on the president"". Responding to a call by MP Peter Bone for the president to delete his Twitter account, she said: ""It's interesting to note [Mr Bone's] advice regarding Twitter accounts - I'm sure many of us might share his view."" Former Conservative minister Tim Loughton said if Twitter was ""genuine in its commitment to fight hate crime online"" it would delete the US president's account. Veteran Labour MP Paul Flynn asked whether Mr Trump should be ""charged with inciting racial hatred"" if he comes to the UK, a view echoed by fellow Labour MP Naz Shah. This video can not be played Should Donald Trump get a state visit to the UK? The UK's opposition party is Labour - their foreign affairs spokeswoman Emily Thornberry told BBC Radio 5 live that Donald Trump was ""not America"" and the government should ""ignore"" and ""work round him"". The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, the senior bishop in the Church of England, said it was ""deeply disturbing"" that Mr Trump had ""chosen to amplify the voice of far-right extremists"". The videos shared by Mr Trump, who has more than 40 million followers, were initially posted by Jayda Fransen, the deputy leader of Britain First, a group founded by former members of the far-right British National Party. Ms Fransen, 31, has been charged in the UK with using ""threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour"" over speeches she made at a rally in Belfast. At a White House briefing on Thursday, spokeswoman Sarah Sanders was asked if the president knew who Ms Fransen was when he retweeted. She said: ""No, I don't believe so. But I think he knew what the issues are and that is that we have a real threat of extreme violence and terrorism."" This video can not be played Ann Coulter defends the US president on Today after he hit out at Theresa May over far-right tweets On Wednesday, communities Secretary Sajid Javid said Mr Trump had ""endorsed the views of a vile, hate-filled racist organisation that hates me and people like me"", adding: ""He is wrong and I refuse to let it go and say nothing."" London Mayor Sadiq Khan repeated his call the state visit to be cancelled, saying:  ""It beggars belief that the president of our closest ally doesn't see that his support of this extremist group actively undermines the values of tolerance and diversity that makes Britain so great."" After already condemning Mr Trump's actions on Wednesday, Brendan Cox - whose wife, MP Jo Cox, was murdered by a right-wing extremist who shouted ""Britain first"" before committing the act - told the US president to focus on problems in his own country.

"Greater Anglia, Merseyrail, Northern and South Western Railway services are affected Fresh strikes are causing more disruption for rail passengers in the latest 24-hour walkout over safety. RMT union members at Northern, South Western Railway, Merseyrail and Great Anglia are taking action for the third time in less than a week. The union says scrapping guards and introducing driver-only operated trains risks passenger safety. But the rail companies have insisted the move is safe and already widely used. Picket lines have appeared at some railway stations affected by the strike, and passengers are facing delays, cancellations and replacement buses in some parts of the country. RMT members protested outside Waterloo Station in London as part of the latest strike South Western services travelling through Waterloo were among those affected All four operators said some services would still be running: Northern,externalsaid more than 1,300 trains would run between 07:00 and 19:00 GMT, representing about 50% of its weekday timetable Greater Anglia,externalsaid it planned to keep conductors on trains and would be operating a normal service Merseyrail,externalsaid no trains would run on the Kirkby, Ellesmere Port or Hunts Cross lines, but most others would operate between 07:00 and 19:00 South Western Railway,external, which operates in areas including London Waterloo, Reading, Exeter and Southampton, said it expected to run more than 70% of its weekday timetable and would use longer trains to provide extra seats. The Island Line will operate as normal RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: ""It is frankly ludicrous that we have been able to negotiate long-term arrangements in Scotland and Wales that protect the guards and passenger safety, but we are being denied the same opportunities with rail companies in England. ""This suspension of normal industrial relations by the employers has to end if we are to make progress towards a solution that guarantees safe rail travel for all. ""RMT stands ready for talks in each of these separate disputes."" Earlier strikes led to cramped journeys for commuters A Department for Transport spokesman said: ""This is a dispute between a private company and the RMT. ""However, the transport secretary recognises the disruption caused to passengers and has met with union leaders on several occasions, including as recently as December, to help bring an end to the strikes. ""Nobody is losing their job as a result of driver-controlled operation trains, employees have been guaranteed jobs and salaries for several years.""

"Recent disagreements over US and UK policies are understood not to have played a part Donald Trump has cancelled a planned visit to the UK in February, where he had been expected to open a new $1bn (Â£738m) US embassy in London. The US president tweeted he was not a ""big fan"" of the new embassy - which is moving from Mayfair to south London. He blamed Barack Obama's administration for a ""bad deal"" despite the fact the move was agreed under George W Bush. The trip was not the controversial full state visit offered by Theresa May, for which no date has yet been set. Reality Check: Who sold the US embassy in London? Trump 'in crude outburst about migrants' President's tweet mocked on social media What is a state visit? Downing Street said no date has been confirmed for any visit by Mr Trump and that the opening of the US embassy ""is a matter for the US"". The ""strong and deep"" partnership between Britain and the US ""will endure"" despite Mr Trump's cancellation, a spokesman added. However, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan - who has clashed with the president in the past -  said the US president had ""got the message"" that many Londoners were staunchly opposed to his policies and actions. BBC North America editor Jon Sopel said he suspected the possibility of protests in London would have also weighed in the calculation. Allow Twitter content?

The US embassy move was confirmed in October 2008, when President George W Bush was still in the White House. It was moved from its Mayfair site because it was too small to put in the modern security it needed, the BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale said. However, Mr Trump blamed former president Mr Obama's administration for selling ""perhaps the best located and finest embassy in London for peanuts"". May and Trump's festive phone call What will Donald Trump's medical reveal? Mr Trump also criticised the location of the new building in Vauxhall, south London, as an ""off location"", adding: ""Wanted me to cut ribbon-NO!"" The BBC's North America editor said February's planned visit could have included meetings with Mrs May at Chequers or Downing Street and lunch with the Queen. However, no firm date for the visit had ever been agreed, nor had the White House ""nailed down the details of the trip"", James Lansdale added. By BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale Donald Trump says that he is not coming to open the new US embassy in London because he is not a fan of the building. Some diplomats suggest the president was unimpressed by the low key nature of the proposed trip, shorn of the pomp and bling he expected. Others say the White House was worried about the scale of the public protests that were threatened. But amid all this is the nagging fear that the real reason is that Mr Trump just does not see the UK as a priority. In his first year of office, he has visited most other G7 countries and several European nations, including Belgium, so the absence of Britain from his itinerary stands out. Of course, trips - like tweets - can be easily remedied, and a visit by Mr Trump later this year could in theory dispel the fears. But with the UK at odds with the US on an increasing numbers of issues, from Iran to Jerusalem, the lack of a visit carries greater symbolic weight. The ribbon-cutting ceremony may instead be hosted by US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Mr Trump accepted the Queen's invitation for an official state visit when the prime minister met him last year. A petition calling for the invitation to be withdrawn was signed by more than 1.8m people, while the issue was also debated in parliament. Reports in June suggestedMr Trump wanted to delay a potential visitamid concerns about large-scale protests. However, the BBC understands Downing Street is considering options for the visit later in the year. This video can not be played Inside the new US embassy A former British ambassador to the United States, Christopher Meyer, told BBC Radio 4's World at One he would be ""surprised"" if the US president visited the UK in his first term. Mr Meyer said: ""It would be so difficult to manage from a security point of view [and] from a public point of view if he remained as unpopular among the British people at large as he is now."" Speaking last month, US ambassador to the UK Woody Johnson told the BBC he ""absolutely""expected Mr Trump to visit Britain in 2018. During the Queen's Speech at the State Opening of Parliament last summer, there was no mention of a visit - although a Downing Street spokesman said an invitation had been ""extended and accepted"". Mrs May was thefirst foreign leader to meet Mr Trump after his inaugurationwhen she visited the Oval Office in January 2017. Typically during state visits, the government, the visiting government and the royal household agree on a detailed schedule where the Queen acts as the official host. This video can not be played Nigel Farage and Chuka Umunna fall out on the Today programme over cancelled Trump UK visit The cancellation comes after recent disagreements between the US and UK. Mr Trump clashed with Mayor of London Sadiq Khan in the aftermath of the London Bridge attack last year, when he questioned Mr Khan's statement that there was ""no reason to be alarmed"". Mr Khan, who also questioned Mr Trump's proposed US travel ban, said the US president's visit would  ""without doubt have been met by mass peaceful protests"". Allow Twitter content?

The Trump administration tackled the immigration issue pretty much right out of the gate, with its ill-fated executive order closing the US border to entrants from a handful of majority-Muslim nations. Implementation of that effort led to chaos at US airports and a quick suspension at the hands of US courts. Since then, the White House has rolled out two new border orders, adding a few countries to the banned list and removing one (Sudan). The latest measures have, at least so far, largely withstood legal challenge. Immigration enforcement has also been ramped up - 143,470 arrests for violations for the year ending in October - a 30% increase. Mr Trump also announced an end to the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) programme, which granted normalised residency status to roughly 700,000 undocumented immigrants who entered the US when they were young. The order has been temporarily suspended by the court, and is the subject of ongoing negotiations in Congress. About 200,000 Salvadoreans face an uncertain future because the White House has brought their temporary protected status (TPS) to an end. Mr Trump is pushing for sweeping changes to the US immigration system, including reductions in the total number of entrants, the termination of the visa lottery system and greatly reducing the ability of current US residents to bring relatives into the country. Those measures will be strongly opposed by Democrats, however. As for the Mexican border wall, perhaps the most memorable of Mr Trump's campaign promises, funding is still in doubt and - and the money to pay for it will almost certainly come from US taxpayers, not Mexico. Making waves?The president has sweeping authority on immigration and border issues - and he's used it, even if some lower courts have tried to clip his wings. Still, there's nothing Mr Trump would like more than to stand in front of a shiny, new border wall. Because of the controversial move by Senate Republicans to block consideration of Barack Obama's nominee for a vacant Supreme Court seat in 2016, Mr Trump had the opportunity to put his mark on the high court just months after taking office. The president's judicial accomplishments stretch well beyond one Supreme Court pick, however. Senate Republicans also largely refused to confirm Mr Obama's lower court nominees for the last two years of his term, leaving a record number of open slots for Mr Trump to fill. He's had 12 circuit court and six district court judges confirmed so far. There are currently 149 vacancies left - with 47 presidential nominees awaiting Senate approval. All these judges will hold lifetime appointments, guaranteeing that after one year in office Mr Trump has already cemented a lasting conservative legacy on the US judicial branch. It's also a reason Republicans are eager to maintain control of the Senate in the upcoming mid-term elections. If Democrats take control, expect Mr Trump's ability to get his people on the federal bench to be sharply curtailed. Making waves?Through fortune and political force of will, the stars have aligned for conservatives eager to make their mark on the judiciary. Some were concerned that Mr Trump may be unreliable when it comes to picking nominees, but he's more than exceeded their expectations. In his inaugural address, Mr Trump outlined an ambitious new programme of US infrastructure investment. ""We will build new roads and highways and bridges and airports and tunnels, and railways, all across our wonderful nation,"" he said. ""We will get our people off of welfare and back to work, rebuilding our country with American hands and American labour."" Since then, Mr Trump's big infrastructure plan has always been just around the next bend of the road. Instead, Congress and the administration first focused on healthcare reform, an effort that ended in a string of disappointments. Then they turned their gaze on tax reform, which had a much happier ending. Aside from a few press events, such as a June announcement of an air traffic control initiative that has since gone nowhere, infrastructure talk has been little more than empty words. ""It's infrastructure week"", in fact, has become a running joke among Washington insiders grown used to seeing the White House's intended talking points and objectives derailed by controversies big and small. Making waves?Where would Mr Trump be today if he had led with a bipartisan infrastructure programme that was met with overwhelming public approval, instead of travel bans and an extended, acrimonious fight over healthcare? For much of the year, it looked as though Mr Trump's efforts to repeal Obamacare and replace it with a conservative plan would fall flat. It took two tries for the House of Representatives to pass a bill - which was unceremoniously abandoned by the Senate. The upper chamber's efforts to craft their own version were dramatically derailed by Senator McCain's late-night ""no vote"", and a subsequent, bare bones effort met with defeat as well. Beneath those dramatic legislative failures, however, the administration has taken significant steps to chip away at the foundations of the Democrat's signature law. The president suspended payments to insurance companies to help them control the costs of insuring poorer, sicker Americans. The administration greatly curtailed efforts to encourage Americans to sign up on the government-run health insurance exchanges - although enrolment numbers held firm in 2017. Congressional Republicans also placed a stick of Obamacare dynamite in the tax bill the passed in December, repealing the requirement that all Americans buy health insurance as of January 2019. The move could lead healthier Americans to forego insurance until they get sick, driving up premiums. Meanwhile, under Mr Trump's watch, Congress has yet to renew a health-insurance programme for children from less-affluent families, causing concern among states that manage the system. In October Mr Trump declared opioid addiction to be a public-health emergency, although no new resources have been allotted to deal with the situation and the order will expire later in January. Making waves?It's taken a year, but Mr Trump is making strides toward repealing Obamacare. The ""replace"" portion of the task, however, is still far out of reach. In meetings with foreign leaders, the president has repeatedly emphasised ""reciprocal"" trade and encouraged friendly nations to buy US-made products. The president quickly ended US participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership and initiated talks with Canada and Mexico to restructure the North American Free Trade Agreement - negotiations that presently seem to be severely strained. The US and Canada have also been mired in a dispute over softwood lumber, dairy products and aircraft sales, leading to US ""duty investigations"" that could lead to new tariffs. In January, Canada filed a formal complaint against the US with the World Trade Organisation, alleging violations of international rules. What will Trump impact be on world trade? Although Mr Trump talked up confrontation with China on the campaign stump, action toward the US's largest trading partner has been muted. Meanwhile, the US trade deficit with China grew to $35.4bn in November, the largest gap over two years. The overall US trade deficit in November was $50.5bn, the largest in five years, indicating that the total mark for 2017 could reach five-year highs as well. While Mr Trump campaigned on closing the US trade gap, the widening deficit can be attributed largely to continued US economic growth. Making waves?Mr Trump has hinted at big trade moves to come, but in the first year the primary change is that US support for expanding free trade across the world has ground to a halt. This video can not be played What the world thinks of Trump What promises has Trump kept as president? 11 things we never said before Trump Trump defeat still haunts Democratic voters At the end of 2017, Mr Trump boasted that he had signed more legislation than any previous president. While that claim was clearly not true - the 94 bills that reached his desk rank well behind John F Kennedy's 684 and trail all modern presidents - he did close out the year with one major legislative accomplishment. Mr Trump promised voters he would enact major tax reform on individuals and businesses, and in the waning days of 2017 Republicans - with no Democratic support - enacted sweeping tax cuts for businesses and many Americans. Top personal rates were slashed, a tax credit for families with children was doubled and the standard deduction for individuals who do not itemise their tax returns was increased. The total cost of the changes to the tax code has been estimated at $1.5tn over 10 years - and it would be more, except the individual tax reductions are set to expire after eight years. Some of Mr Trump's more ambitious reform goals were left on the cutting room floor, however. While there are provisions to allow corporations to repatriate overseas earnings and changes to a more territorial-based business tax system to discourage outsourcing, there's little to encourage existing overseas factories to relocate back to the US. Another survivor was the carried-interest loophole used by hedge-fund managers and other powerful Wall Street investors to pay greatly reduced taxes - which was condemned repeatedly by Mr Trump during the campaign. There were also some prominent losers in the president's tax reforms, namely individuals in high-tax, largely Democratic states, who will lose the ability to deduct state and local taxes over a $10,000 cap. Mr Trump is revelling in the recent announcements by major corporations that they are passing some of their tax savings along to employees and customers - although polls continue to show that many Americans think the new law won't help their bottom line. Making waves?Mr Trump can lay claim to the most substantive change to US tax law in 16 years, enacting the kind of massive corporate tax cut that Republicans have been after for decades. In a mid-December press event, Mr Trump stood in a White House room next to a towering mound of white papers. ""For many decades, an ever-growing maze of regulations, rules, restrictions has cost our country trillions and trillions of dollars, millions of jobs, countless American factories, and devastated many industries,"" the president said. ""But all that changed the day I took the oath of office."" While it may not have happened quite so instantly, the first year of the Trump administration has seen a significant reduction in the amount of federal regulation, and no place has that been more marked than in the way the government deals with environmental issues. Shortly after his inauguration, Mr Trump gave final approval to several long-delayed oil pipelines. The recently completed tax bill opened vast swaths of Alaskan wilderness up to new oil and gas drilling. Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt recently announced energy exploration would be permitted off much of the rest of the US coastline (although Florida, with its Republican governor, became a notable exception). The government's environmental department, the EPA, also rescinded Obama-era regulations on carbon emissions from coal-based power plants, although those changes will likely be bogged down in legal challenges for years. According to a New York Times tracker, the administration has sought to reverse at least 60 federal environmental regulations and has succeeded in 29 instances. Mr Trump also greatly reduced the amount of federal protected land in Utah, opening the door for increased development in the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments. It was the largest such rollback in US history. On 1 June the president also announced the US was withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement, although the benchmarks the US agreed to were not mandatory. Making waves?President Obama had taken significant administrative steps to increase environmental regulation and enforcement over the objection of Republicans in Congress. Now the Trump administration is using that same authority to tear it all down. Mr Trump's first year in office has been filled with economic good news. The stock market, as the president frequently points out, is driving to new highs, with the Dow Jones index recently passing the 25,000 mark. Unemployment, which was at 4.8% when the president took office, has reached a 17-year low of 4.1%. In the third quarter of 2017, gross domestic product growth hit 3.2%, the highest level since the first quarter of 2015. The hard numbers indicating robust growth are translating into new levels of economic optimism. The US Consumer Confidence Index hit a 17-year high in November, before dropping slightly in December. Also in November, asmall-business confidence,externalindex hit the highest level in its 45-year history. Of course all these glowing numbers represent the continuation of trend-lines that began during the Obama administration - a fact that a majority of the nation seems to acknowledge. In a recentQuinnipiac survey,externalthat showed 66% of the public believes the economy is ""excellent or good"",  49% think it is because of Mr Obama while only 40% credit Mr Trump. Making waves?The rising economic tide is buoying Mr Trump's hopes that a public presently divided about his presidency will eventually give him his due. He has three more years to make his case. During his presidential campaign, Mr Trump promised an ""America First"" foreign policy that asked allies to carry more of the financial and military burden. He's now had a year to show what that looks like in action. The president delivered a blunt speech to Nato allies in Belgium, surprising many observers by declining to reiterate US support for the pact's mutual-defence arrangements Mr Trump engaged in a very public exchange of insults with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, calling him ""little rocket man"" and saying his nation would be met with ""fire and fury"" if they continued their bellicose rhetoric. The most notable use of US military force during Mr Trump's first year was his missile strike on a Syrian air base in response to that nation's use of chemical weapons. The highest-profile incident of US combat casualties, on the other hand, came when a group of special forces were ambushed in Niger leading to four deaths - drawing attention to the increased US military presence in Africa. In Syria and Afghanistan, Mr Trump has given his generals a free hand to prosecute the ongoing military engagements. Over the course of the year, the so-called Islamic State has been largely defeated on the battlefield and its influence curtailed. The conflict in Afghanistan drags on, however, as the president increased the number of US troops there to 14,000. He also recently threatened to cut off aid to Pakistan if it does not do more to support the US fight against Islamic militants. Mr Trump put his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, in charge of the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations, although the most dramatic development in that area was the president's move to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital - thrilling the Israeli government but prompting stern condemnations from Palestinian officials and much of the global community. With great fanfare, he declined to recertify Iranian compliance with multinational nuclear deal, although that is largely a symbolic act unless sanctions that have been suspended are reimposed. Making waves?Mr Trump talks about foreign policy like no other modern American president. Critics will say he's undermining US standing on the world stage, but when it comes to actual policy this isn't the paradigm shift feared - or hoped for - by some There's never been an American president quite like Donald Trump. No one has ever held the office with no prior elective or military leadership experience. No one, in modern times at least, has been as blunt or as disruptive a force on the national and international stage. For many of the president's supporters, this is exactly what they wanted. They supported the candidate who told them the system was broken, the other politicians on the stage with him were phony and the process was a joke. They asked for different, and different is what they got. Mr Trump has said he is defining ""modern day presidential"" with his free-form use of social media, his continued practice of giving unscripted campaign-style rally speeches and his willingness to disregard many of the time-honoured traditions of politics. In some ways his has been a conventional presidency. His court appointments are largely in keeping with conservative desires, his tax package was a longtime Republican wish-list and his efforts at deregulation are out of the party's anti-big-government playbook. But the way Mr Trump has operated, and the way he has talked about how he is going about running the nation, has been one-of-a-kind. Making waves?It remains to be seen whether Donald Trump is permanently changing the way politics is conducted in the US. A quarter of the way through his term in office, however, it should be quite clear that US politics isn't changing Donald Trump.

Cyclone Joyce, currently a category one system, is due to make landfall near Broome in Western Australia on Friday. Authorities have told local residents to secure their homes and take shelter. The cyclone is tracking south and is predicted to bring winds of up to 100km/h (62mph), according to the Bureau of Meteorology. Higher tides, heavy rainfall and flash flooding are also expected over the coastal region, about 2,000km north of the state's capital, Perth. Allow Twitter content?

"The changes have been described as ""significant"" by industry watchers Facebook is to change how its news feed works, making posts from businesses, brands and media less prominent. Instead, content that sparks conversations among family and friends who use the site will be emphasised, explained chief executiveMark Zuckerberg on his page,external. Organisations on Facebook may see the popularity of their posts decrease as a result, the firm acknowledged. The changes will take effect over the coming weeks. ""We've gotten feedback from our community that public content - posts from businesses, brands and media - is crowding out the personal moments that lead us to connect more with each other,"" wrote Mr Zuckerberg. He said that he and his team felt a responsibility to make sure Facebook was good for people's wellbeing. If public content is to be promoted, it will now have to be seen to encourage community interaction - as happens within the tight-knit groups that discuss TV programmes and sports, he said. Another example given by Facebookin a separate post,externalwas live video feeds, which tend to generate much discussion. ""By making these changes, I expect the time people spend on Facebook and some measures of engagement will go down,"" added Mr Zuckerberg. ""But I also expect the time you do spend on Facebook will be more valuable."" Representatives from Facebook, Twitter and Google were grilled on the issue of online disinformation at a US Senate hearing last October In a previous post, Mr Zuckerberg had vowed to ""fix"" Facebook in 2018, saying he wanted to ensure that users were protected from abuse and that time spent on the site would be time well spent. He also pledged to defend Facebook from nation states. Analysis has recently suggested that some actors,including Russia, have tried to manipulate content on the social network. Mark Zuckerberg vows to 'fix' Facebook Facebook - the secret election weapon ""It's definitely a significant change,"" said Laura Hazard Owen at Harvard University's Nieman Journalism Lab. ""It's going to affect publishers a lot, we're going to be seeing a lot less news organically pop up in our news feeds."" Ms Owen added, however, that Facebook had not been very clear about what sort of discussions the site's revamped algorithms would prioritise. It might end up being ""the most controversial stuff"" that generates heated conversations, she suggested, or simply content pulled in from group pages where users engage with others on specific topics. Given recent public scrutiny, the social network was currently ""in the hot seat"", said Gabriel Kahn from the University of Southern California Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. ""Facebook is in the midst of all of these fires it's trying to put out, it's trying to reassert its warm and fuzzy brand value that it has always tried to put forth,"" he told the BBC. Mr Kahn added the update from Mr Zuckerberg was a ""clear admission"" that Facebook wielded significant power over the health of society. However, he argued that the new priorities could further distort views and the nature of conversations. ""There should be public debate about the values they're applying to that algorithm,"" he said. In many ways this is Facebook getting back to its roots, making your news feed more about what your friends are creating and thinking, rather than articles they have shared. For the first time, Mark Zuckerberg is making a major decision that goes against one of his long-held beliefs: any change to the network must have the goal of improving engagement. This move, he concedes, will likely lead to people spending less time on the site. But after a tough 2017, Mr Zuckerberg is perhaps learning now that in the wake of the fake news scandal, and a platform brimming with tedious clickbait, not all engagement is good engagement. Faced with the enormous task of having to do more to moderate what's happening on his network, Mr Zuckerberg may have come to the conclusion that having a news free-for-all is becoming more trouble than it's worth. For news organisations and publications, this might spell bad news: a lot of traffic comes from Facebook. With less prominence, expect some viral sites to very quickly go out of business. The new change of course will cost Facebook money. Mr Zuckerberg warned investors at the end of last year that combating fake news would hurt the firm's bottom line. The question now is: by how much?

"This video can not be played The rape and murder of six-year-old Zainab sparked outrage in Pakistan Protesters have set a government office on fire in the Pakistani city of Kasur, in a second day of riots after the rape and murder of a six-year-old girl. Zainab Ansari's body was found in a rubbish dump on Tuesday, several days after she went missing. She had been raped and strangled. Describing his grief, her father told the BBC: ""It's like the world has ended... I have no words."" Police in Kasur say there have been 12 similar murders in the past two years. They say five of them are linked to one suspect who is being hunted by hundreds of officers. DNA samples have also been taken from 90 possible suspects. A post-mortem report suggested that Zainab had been brutally assaulted. The report found injuries on her body and face, and a bone in her neck fractured. Zainab's father, Ameen Ansari, told the BBC that he did not agree with the violence of protesters, but understood the anger at police. ""If the police had done their jobs properly then they would have found her as soon as they got hold of the CCTV,"" he said. Zainab's father, Ameen Ansari, said: ""It's like the world has ended"" Local politicians have met the family and promised the killer would be caught. #JusticeForZainab: Anger and anguish On Thursday, protesters threw stones at government buildings and set cars and a local politician's office alight, complaining that police had not done more to stop violence against children. Riots continued in Kasur on Thursday A local police spokesman told AFP news agency ""up to 1,000"" people had taken to the streets. ""They had thrown stones on the buildings of the government hospital, police and deputy commissioner's office... security is being deployed and trying to control the situation,"" he said. Two protesters were killed on Wednesday after an angry crowd tried to storm the local police headquarters, and police opened fire. The Punjab government is offering a 10m rupee ($90,000; Â£67,000) reward for anyone who helps police find and arrest Zainab's killer, and has offered 3m rupees each to the families of those killed by police on Wednesday, the BBC was told. Kiran Naz, a news anchor on Pakistan's Samaa TV, hosted Thursday's bulletin with her young daughter on her lap as an act of protest. Opening her segment, she said: ""Today I am not Kiran Naz, rather I am a mother today and that is why I am sitting with my daughter."" Referring to Zainab, she said ""the smallest coffins are the heaviest, and the entire society is burdened by the weight of her coffin"". Allow Twitter content?

"Hospitals in England are now seeing very high rates of patients with flu, according to Public Health England figures. A sharp rise in cases seen by GPs in the past week - up 78% on the week before - suggests it could be the worst flu season for seven years. But PHE said the current levels of flu were ""not unprecedented"". Deaths from flu remained static with 27 in the past seven days. Around 5,000 people were admitted to hospital with flu in the first week of January, based on PHE figures for 22 out of 137 trusts. Prof Paul Cosford, medical director from Public Health England, said: ""The levels of flu being seen are high and of course that is contributing to the pressures in the NHS, but they are not unprecedented levels."" He also suggested the coverage of the so-called Aussie flu outbreak was a little misleading, saying that while it was circulating at ""significant"" levels there were two other strains that were also causing problems. Should we be worried about 'Aussie' flu? These strains are an unknown type of influenza A and influenza B - which is normally a milder strain - but appears to be affecting older people in care homes. The H3N2 strain - an influenza A virus - has been dubbed 'Aussie flu' because it is the same strain that recently caused big problems for Australia during their winter. 18-year-old Bethany Walker died after contracting the flu and developing pneumonia This year's flu vaccine is designed to protect against this strain and some other ones. Figures in Scotland show a doubling of flu casesin the past week but mortality rates related to the virus were still said to be low. However,an 18-year-old student from Wester Ross died after her flu developed into pneumonia. In Wales,a large rise in flu caseshas prompted advice to stay away from some hospitals. The rate of hospital admissions in England rose by over 50% in the first week of January to 7.38 per 100,000. In the same week, the GP consultation rate was 37.3 per 100,000 compared to 21 per 100,000 the week before. Nearly 22,000 patients went to see their GP with flu in the first week of 2018, the Royal College of GPs said, and there was also a rise in people seen with the common cold, acute bronchitis, respiratory system diseases and asthma. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Map produced by Carto Flu symptoms can come on very quickly and can last for a week or more. Symptoms include a fever (temperature above 38C), aches, headache, tiredness, a chesty cough, tummy pain and loss of appetite. Children can also get pain in their ears and appear lacking in energy. Flu can be particularly unpleasant for certain people, such as the over-65s, pregnant women and those with other serious health conditions. Health officials say getting the vaccine every year is the best way to protect against flu.

"Greater Anglia, Merseyrail, Northern and South Western Railway services are affected Fresh strikes are causing more disruption for rail passengers in the latest 24-hour walkout over safety. RMT union members at Northern, South Western Railway, Merseyrail and Great Anglia are taking action for the third time in less than a week. The union says scrapping guards and introducing driver-only operated trains risks passenger safety. But the rail companies have insisted the move is safe and already widely used. Picket lines have appeared at some railway stations affected by the strike, and passengers are facing delays, cancellations and replacement buses in some parts of the country. RMT members protested outside Waterloo Station in London as part of the latest strike South Western services travelling through Waterloo were among those affected All four operators said some services would still be running: Northern,externalsaid more than 1,300 trains would run between 07:00 and 19:00 GMT, representing about 50% of its weekday timetable Greater Anglia,externalsaid it planned to keep conductors on trains and would be operating a normal service Merseyrail,externalsaid no trains would run on the Kirkby, Ellesmere Port or Hunts Cross lines, but most others would operate between 07:00 and 19:00 South Western Railway,external, which operates in areas including London Waterloo, Reading, Exeter and Southampton, said it expected to run more than 70% of its weekday timetable and would use longer trains to provide extra seats. The Island Line will operate as normal RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: ""It is frankly ludicrous that we have been able to negotiate long-term arrangements in Scotland and Wales that protect the guards and passenger safety, but we are being denied the same opportunities with rail companies in England. ""This suspension of normal industrial relations by the employers has to end if we are to make progress towards a solution that guarantees safe rail travel for all. ""RMT stands ready for talks in each of these separate disputes."" Earlier strikes led to cramped journeys for commuters A Department for Transport spokesman said: ""This is a dispute between a private company and the RMT. ""However, the transport secretary recognises the disruption caused to passengers and has met with union leaders on several occasions, including as recently as December, to help bring an end to the strikes. ""Nobody is losing their job as a result of driver-controlled operation trains, employees have been guaranteed jobs and salaries for several years.""

" This story contains details some readers may find distressing. On the warm afternoon of 30 August 1980, 26-year-old Teresa Thorling had one thing on her mind - to make money to buy drugs. Teresa was young, blonde and pretty. She wouldn’t have described herself as a prostitute but often spent Saturday nights selling sex to fund her own drug habit, and that of her boyfriend as well. He was 20 years older and they lived together in the southern Swedish city of Malmo. It was her job to find the money for the heroin they shared. Forty years ago, Malmo, like nearby Copenhagen, was a busy commercial hub with ferries coming in and out of the port of Limhamn on the outskirts of the city. But unlike its famous neighbour across the Oresund - the stretch of water that separates Denmark from Sweden - it was never home to an established red-light district. Instead, sex workers would stand in the wide, tree-lined streets of Kungsgatan and Exercisegatan, where there was space for cars to stop and deals to be struck. In the 1970s and 80s, when prostitution was still legal, these street corners attracted custom from all over southern Sweden. It was here that Teresa headed, catching a bus from her apartment into the city centre. Later, police investigators found a bus ticket in one of her pockets stamped with the time 16.45. Other sex workers reported seeing Teresa around Exercisegatan in the early evening. One woman saw her walking off with a client, another saw her talking to a man in a car. But no-one remembered seeing her later that night. Two days later, on Monday afternoon, an old man collecting bottles for cash stumbled across Teresa’s body in the stairwell of a derelict building that was scheduled for demolition. She had been covered by a piece of carpet. Underneath, she was lying on her front, naked. A long, square-cut stick of wood had been forced into her rectum. A post-mortem showed that Teresa had been killed on Saturday evening and the cause of death was most likely strangulation, though the doctor also noted high-level of narcotics in her blood. Before being killed, the young woman had been hit on the back of the head with a blunt object. She had bruising on the front of her neck that could have been caused by hands, or by a thin object being pressed against her tongue bone, which had been broken. There was no evidence that she had been raped, but there was a substance found on her back that could have been semen. Teresa’s killing made headlines in the local newspapers, which for days ran stories about the murder in Malmo. This type of sex crime was extremely rare in Sweden and it wasn’t long before detectives in the city connected it to another murder that had taken place in Gothenburg a few weeks earlier. Like Teresa, 31-year-old Gertie Jensen was also a drug user and part-time sex worker. And like Teresa, she had also been found stripped naked on a demolition site, her head smashed in from behind with a brick. Malmo police made contact with the Gothenburg police to compare notes about the killings, while continuing its own investigation into Teresa’s murder, interviewing her boyfriend and the sex workers who were the last to see her alive. There were some promising early leads. One sex worker mentioned a metallic-green Saab 900 that officers tried to trace. Another mentioned an aggressive client who used to hang around Exercisegatan and who seemed to have taken an interest in Teresa. Police found she owed money for drugs. There was speculation that a yellow Mercedes taxi that was seen near the place she was found might be involved. But none of these inquiries led anywhere and, as the months passed, the press stopped running stories, the police moved on to other crimes and the killing of the two young women faded from view. In August 2016, the Detective Superintendent in southern region of Sweden, Bo Lundqvist, received an intriguing email. The subject title, in capitals, was “OP PAINTHALL”, and the sender, a detective constable from West Yorkshire Police in the north of England. Operation Painthall, Lundqvist discovered, was a little-publicised cold-case investigation into a number of unsolved murders and assaults that may have been committed by Peter Sutcliffe, the Yorkshire Ripper. Two of these offences, said the email, had occurred in Sweden. This was the first that Lundqvist had heard about a link between his country and the notorious British serial killer. British serial killer Peter Sutcliffe, 'The Yorkshire Ripper', on his wedding day The 53-year-old detective had studied the Yorkshire Ripper when he joined the Swedish police force in 1990, learning how the lorry driver from the city of Bradford had violently attacked women in the north of England from the mid-1970s to 1981. Sutcliffe had only been caught when officers stopped his car for using false licence plates. He was subsequently found guilty of 13 murders and seven assaults and sentenced to life in prison. What Lundqvist didn’t know was that ever since Sutcliffe’s trial in 1981 there had been calls, both from officials and relatives, to investigate him for a number of other unsolved attacks. Now, asked the email, could Lundqvist help West Yorkshire Police with their inquiries into two murders? His head covered with a blanket, Peter Sutcliffe, is escorted into Dewsbury Magistrates Court to be charged with murder, 6 January 1981 The email gave details of the murder of Gertie Jensen on 12 August and of Teresa Thorling on 30 August 1980. It went on to explain that the West Yorkshire Police had found a telex which had been sent to its office by the international crime organisation, Interpol, in the 1980s. This indicated that Sutcliffe may have travelled with a lorry on board a car ferry between the port of Limhawn (which Lundqvist understood to be a mis-spelling of Limhamn) in Sweden and Dradoer (a mis-spelling of Dragor) in Denmark. The email then quoted two dates: 30 August 1980 and 1 September 1980 – coinciding with the date Teresa was killed. Back in the 1980s, this one-hour ferry journey across the waters of the Oresund was a busy route with dozens of crossings a day. Now the ships have been replaced by the Oresund Bridge - made famous by the Scandinavian detective drama, The Bridge, for which, coincidentally, Lundqvist acts as a consultant. “The only thing that tops fiction is real life,” he says, comparing the scripts he checks for accuracy with real homicide cases. “I see it every day, every year, year in, year out.” Here, he thought, was another example of how the truth could be more astonishing than fiction. Why was this the first he had heard of these two brutal murders and why had they not been solved? The murder of Gertie Jensen fell outside his jurisdiction, but Teresa Thorling had been killed in his city. “We haven't investigated cold cases for very long - less than 10 years. But they are so important in society,” he says. If we don’t stand up for people who've been killed, who will?” The email from West Yorkshire Police concluded with a series of questions. Was there still paperwork? Had Peter Sutcliffe ever been considered a suspect? Had there been a cold case review and was there any forensic evidence that could be tested? Lundqvist found he could answer yes to all of the questions. There was paperwork, Peter Sutcliffe had been named, there had been a cold case review in 2005 and there was forensic evidence - most notably a hair that he described as being found in such a way that would make it very interesting to test for DNA. Ideally, the detective would test this evidence himself, but he faced a problem. Swedish law has a statute of limitations, which stipulates that any unsolved crimes that took place before 1 July 1985 can no longer be investigated. Lundqvist was legally barred from re-opening the case. Now, reading through the email, he felt a glimmer of hope. Perhaps the British police could help find a way back into it? Perhaps they could test for DNA? And then there was the bigger question. Could it be that the British serial killer was actually responsible for the deaths? And if not, who was and could Lundqvist catch him? We must show that if you kill a person, we will never stop coming after you. Never,” he says. In the late 1970s, stumped by their inability to catch the killer, police in West Yorkshire were seriously considering the idea that, in between attacks in England, the Yorkshire Ripper was working or travelling abroad. Joan Smith, who covered the murders as a reporter, remembers this theory. In 1979, as part of the Sunday Times’s investigative Insight team, Smith lodged a Freedom of Information request with the FBI in the US to ask if they had been briefed by the British police about the Ripper killings. A year later, a brown envelope from the FBI arrived at the Sunday Times office in London. In it was a dossier compiled by West Yorkshire Police which they had sent to police forces around the world. It detailed the attacks and asked if other countries had recorded anything similar. West Yorkshire Chief Constable Ronald Gregory (right), who led the investigation and Detective Chief Superintendent Jim Hobson, appeal to the public for help At the time, Smith used this information to expose what she regarded as an incompetent and sexist police investigation - one that failed to take the murder of women, especially sex workers, seriously. “The police would say, the day we have him sitting across the table, we will know it's him,” she says. “And I was thinking: ‘How will you know? Because you make awful jokes about women as well.’ This was a kind of macho culture where contempt for women was pretty normal.” Smith remembers an occasion when she entered a press conference just as a group of prostitutes, who had been brought in to discuss the danger they were in with the police, were leaving the room. “One of the reporters shouted to the cops, ‘I hope we’re not going to catch anything sitting on these chairs,’” she says. “And the cop said, ‘Well, I kept well out of their way just in case.’ And then the press conference started and the atmosphere switched and suddenly it was all, ‘We take this very seriously, we care about every woman.’” Asst Chief Constable George Oldfield holds a Press Conference in November 1980 The police were working on the assumption that the Ripper was killing out of a hatred of prostitutes. The dossier made it clear that the police thought the victims who weren’t sex workers had probably made themselves targets because of their behaviour - by going out late at night, by drinking alone, or by dating Jamaican men. The theory led the police to overlook a number of victims who didn’t fit this pattern - like the 14-year-old school girl, Tracy Browne, whose attack by a man wielding a hammer was later admitted to by Sutcliffe from jail. Browne had given an accurate photofit description of Sutcliffe to the police, but this was ignored at the time because she didn’t fit their victim profile. As more and more victims were killed, the West Yorkshire investigation came under increasing criticism. Even the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, is reported to have been so frustrated with its ineptitude that she threatened to go up to Yorkshire and take control herself. Joan Smith's copy of the dossier compiled by West Yorkshire Police After Sutcliffe’s trial, two inquiries were set up to examine police failings - the government-commissioned Byford inquiry and the internal police Sampson inquiry. They both made sweeping recommendations for change, with the Byford inquiry identifying a further potential 13 surviving Ripper victims. Retired police officer Chris Clark believes that as well as these 13 survivors, Pete Sutcliffe killed another 23 women and one man, and attacked, but didn’t kill, another man. He believes some of these attacks are under investigation by Operation Painthall, though West Yorkshire Police have said little about their operation. In an email to the BBC, they would only confirm that the operation was an ongoing process. “There's been cover-up after cover-up and survivors have no closure,” says Clark, who has spent the past five years investigating the attacks and wants West Yorkshire Police to make a public statement about their findings. Joan Smith, who now advises the Mayor of London on strategies to combat violence against women, also believes the police have a moral duty to publicise the results of their inquiry. “Cold cases are so important because people have to live with a terrible lack of knowledge about their lost relatives,” she says. The original investigation was so utterly incompetent and women were so let down by it, that I think it’s really important to establish the truth.” At the same time as Smith was reporting on the Yorkshire Ripper in Britain, Goran Svedberg was working as a crime reporter in Malmo for the local newspaper, Kvallsposten. In the early 1980s, Svedberg remembers an equally cosy relationship between Malmo’s crime reporters and the police as Smith described in Britain. At that time, journalists were allowed to wander through the police headquarters as they wished. The detectives and reporters were all men, they were friends and they spoke freely about cases. Svedberg was there when news came in that Teresa Thorling’s body had been found in a derelict house. He says her murder made headlines for a few days but was soon dropped. Although this type of killing was rare, it wasn’t a surprise that it happened to a girl like Teresa. “It was a big thing, but not a major thing because she was a drug addict and prostitute,” he says. But a few months later in January 1981, Sutcliffe’s arrest sparked a renewed interest in the case. Reporters noted similarities between Teresa’s murder and the Ripper killings. Like many of his victims, she had been stripped of her clothes and hit on the back of the head, although Sutcliffe often used a distinctive ball-peen hammer and this hadn't been used here. But he was also known to strangle his victims using a knotted-rope, the kind of implement that matched Teresa Thorling’s strangulation injuries. On 12 January, the Malmo police sent a telex to Interpol to ask the British police to confirm whether Sutcliffe had ever travelled to Sweden, citing press reports placing him on the ferry between Dragor and Limhamn at the same time that Teresa was killed. It was the telex that is referred to in the email sent by Operation Painthall. It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly where the rumours that Sutcliffe was in Sweden originated. The Malmo police telex says they came from the press. But there were no local newspaper reports mentioning the possibility of Sutcliffe being in Sweden, before 12 January. It’s only on that date, and a few days afterwards, that there are a handful of articles referring to a possible link between the lorry driver and the Swedish murders. One mentions the police telex and another speculates that Sutcliffe had an accomplice who worked for the same transport company and travelled to the continent on business. Svedberg thinks he has the answer. In January 1981, he learnt that a British journalist living in Malmo, Roy S Carson, was planning to write a piece for the British newspaper, the Daily Star, linking Teresa’s murder with the recently arrested Peter Sutcliffe. “Roy said the British police were interested in the case and he wanted to know more about it,” says Svedberg. “Roy was an extremely creative journalist so maybe this was true, or maybe he made it up.” Later that day, Svedberg found out that the Daily Star was planning to buy photos of Teresa from his news desk. At the time, Svedberg was freelancing as a correspondent for The Sun newspaper in the UK, which was a competitor to the Daily Star. This spurred him to ring his Sun bosses in London and offer them an article on the same story. “I told them it was nothing, I didn’t believe in the story,” he says. “But they asked me if I could still do something saying it wasn't true.” The next day, according to Svedberg, The Sun ran his story, but the Daily Star decided not to run Carson’s piece. The Sun expose sparked even more press interest. Svedberg remembers reporters from London calling the police in Malmo. Even the correspondent for the International Herald Tribune rang from his European base in Paris. It is impossible to verify this story with Carson, who has since died. Curiously, The Sun’s archive in the months following January 1981 does not reveal any articles about the Swedish murders. There is no mention in any of the British papers of the police investigating a link between the Swedish murders and the Yorkshire Ripper. Two weeks after the Malmo police sent their telex to Interpol they received a reply from West Yorkshire Police in Britain. Sutcliffe had not been in Sweden - the only time he had travelled abroad was to visit his wife’s relatives in Czechoslovakia in 1971 and to go on honeymoon to Paris in 1974. That was the end of the matter - until Lundqvist was contacted by Operational Painthall. For months after he replied to Operation Painthall’s email, Lundqvist heard nothing back from the British detectives. Then in May 2017, the Swedish newspaper Kvallsposten published a story on Operation Painthall’s inquiry. A few days later, Lundqvist received a reply - this time from the man leading the cold case review, Detective Chief Inspector James Dunkerley. DCI Dunkerley wrote that it was absolutely certain that Sutcliffe had never been in Sweden.The telex that Operation Painthall had originally written about described nothing more than a rumour. As far as he was concerned, the case was closed. Except that for Lundqvist, the journey had just started. If it hadn’t been for Operation Painthall, he wouldn’t have known about the unsolved murders of Teresa Thorling and Gertie Jensen. Now he did, he was determined to see the investigation through to the end. His next hurdle was negotiating the Swedish statute of limitations. Until recently, Swedish law had ruled that any crime committed more than 25 years ago was barred from being prosecuted. In 2010, the Swedish parliament changed the cut-off date for prosecutions to 1 July 1985. Lundqvist suspects this date was chosen to make sure the still-unsolved murder of the Swedish Prime Minister, Olof Palme, in 1986 would never fall beyond the statute. “In a matter of years, this date won’t matter anymore because all those involved in the crimes will have passed on,” he says. “But for now we should only care whether we can prosecute or not. Modern techniques to solve old crimes are so much better, and they’ll keep improving, so the statute shouldn’t stop us looking for justice.” To get past the statute, Lundqvist has turned to criminal psychiatrists and profilers to help build a case for testing the forensic evidence saved from the 1980s murders. “We're now of the opinion that the Gothenburg and Malmo murders were carried out by the same perpetrator,” he says. This is significant, he says, because if the perpetrator killed twice, it is likely he went on to kill again and it’s possible that one of these crimes occurred after the 1985 cut-off date for prosecution. Lundqvist has used this argument to justify testing the hair found on Teresa’s body for DNA. In December, he sent the evidence from her murder to the Swedish National Forensics Laboratory in Linköping. He expects the results anytime soon. “It’s important to speak for the dead, whether they are a prostitute or whether they have a profession of any sort,” he says. “And it’s very, very important to solve homicides. It has a calming effect. “The more [killings] that are done, and the fewer we solve, the more there will be."" Built with Shorthand",Positive,1.0
"Dominic Chappell, who was in charge of BHS when it went bust in 2016, has been found guilty on three charges of failing to provide information demanded by The Pensions Regulator. The watchdog accused him of neglecting or refusing to hand over information about BHS's pension schemes. The schemes had 19,000 members and a shortfall of Â£571m when BHS collapsed. Mr Chappell, a former bankrupt, bought the department store chain from Sir Philip Green for Â£1. The Pensions Regulator (TPR) alleged that Mr Chappell failed to provide information three times about the company's pension schemes. Appearing at Brighton Magistrates Court, Mr Chappell argued that he didn't have the information available because he had been shut out of his office at BHS after administrators took over. He also said tax officers had raided his home, removing computers and files. However the judge, Mr William Ashworth, said that he was not a credible witness, that parts of his explanation made no sense and that other evidence he offered was simply not credible. Nicola Parish, TPR's executive director of frontline regulation, said: ""Dominic Chappell failed to provide us with information we had requested in connection with our investigation into the sale and ultimate collapse of BHS, despite numerous requests. ""The power to demand specific information is a key investigative tool in our work to protect people's pensions. This conviction shows that the courts recognise its importance and that anyone who fails to co-operate with our information notices risks getting a criminal record."" Speaking outside court, Mr Chappell said he would appeal against the verdict. He said: ""As you can imagine, I'm extremely disappointed and annoyed about the outcome. It's not the one we were looking for. ""I've instructed my legal team to put in an immediate application for an appeal on this case, which we will be doing tomorrow."" He added: ""We feel that this case has not been treated fairly and we will look deeply into this."" The offences he has been found guilty of carry unlimited fines for each count. The judge has adjourned to a later date, 19 January in Winchester, to consider the financial aspects. The highest previous fine in a case such as this was Â£5,000. Administrators were called in to BHS after only a year under Mr Chappell's ownership, leaving 11,000 people out of work and endangering the pensions of 19,000. The Pensions Regulator is said to be seeking Â£10m from Mr Chappell to shore up BHS's stricken pension fund, to add to the Â£363m already obtained from Sir Philip. A spokesman for the regulator said: ""Our separate anti-avoidance action against Dominic Chappell continues. ""TPR's determinations panel is considering evidence submitted by various parties and is expected to be in a position to issue its written determination notice to affected parties in the coming weeks.""

"Patients are dying in hospital corridors as safety is compromised by ""intolerable"" conditions, doctors say. The warning has been issued in a letter to the prime minister signed by 68 senior A&E doctors, spelling out the danger patients are facing this winter. It comes as reports have emerged of people being left for hours on trolleys in corridors and stuck in ambulances. Hospital bosses said they had run out of beds as they battle with""very high"" rates of flu. Official figures show the number of hospital admissions from flu has risen by more than 50% in the past week in England, although Public Health England officials said the levels were certainly not ""unprecedented"". Instead, hospital bosses have blamed the bed shortages on a lack of money and staff. Last week, there was a point when 133 out of 137 hospital trusts in England had an unsafe number of patients on their wards, NHS records show.

The letter from doctors in England and Wales sets out some of the impact of this pressure. It says: Patients are having to sleep in makeshift wards set up in side rooms Trolley waits of up to 12 hours are being routinely seen as staff struggle to find free beds Thousands of patients are left stuck in the back of ambulances waiting for A&E staff to take them in More than 120 patients a day are being managed in corridors in some places, some dying prematurely The letter has been sent on the day it has been revealed that England's A&Es missed their four-hour waiting time target by a record margin in December - more than 300,000 patients waited longer than they should. Just over 85% of patients were seen in four hours - well below the 95% target - and marginally worse than the previous low in January 2017. Chris Hopson, of NHS Providers, said hospitals were unsafe and overcrowded, and the NHS was at a ""watershed moment"", requiring long-term funding. 10 charts that show why the NHS is in trouble Kuenssberg: Time for an answer on the NHS? The rest of the UK is also struggling. Waits in Scotland's major A&E unitshit their worst levels at the end of December.

She was taken to Torbay General A&E on 3 January with a gynaecological problem which had left her with severe pain and bleeding. She said it was chaos, with trolleys everywhere, staff running up and down corridors and queues of ambulances outside. Staff could not find a private area for her in which to assess her, so she ended up being examined in front of other patients. ""There was no dignity. It was degrading,"" she said. ""I couldn't fault the staff, there was nothing they could do. It was chaos."" Speaking to the BBC, Mr Hopson said last year was ""the first time ever"" in NHS history that all of its key targets for A&E, cancer and planned operations across the UK had been missed. He said hospitals were short of 10,000 to 15,000 beds and it was time for the government to decide how to fund the NHS in the long term. Since 2010 the budget has been rising at about 1% a year on average whereas traditionally the NHS received more than 4%. ""We have reached a watershed moment where either we fund the NHS to the extent that is needed to meet those standards or, and this is absolutely not what we want, we abandon those standards. ""But it is a watershed moment. We are now at the point where we cannot deliver the NHS constitutional standards without a long-term funding settlement."" Mr Hopson said mild weather and low flu rates had helped hospitals ""scrape by"" during previous winters. ""Maybe if we had been lucky again this year we could, just about, have coped,"" he added. ""But it has not turned out that way. Flu is rising, there is more respiratory illness and the cold weather is taking its toll."" This video can not be played Chief executive of NHS providers tells Today the NHS can no longer cope Figures from Public Health England show ""medium"" levels of flu are circulating across the community, but they are causing ""very high"" rates of admission to hospital. On both measures, flu rates are the highest since 2011, the year after the pandemic when there was a lot of swine flu circulating. Prime Minister Theresa May insisted the government was still doing enough to support the health service, but blamed flu for the pressures on hospitals. A spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care in England added: ""We know there is a great deal of pressure in A&E departments. We are grateful to all NHS staff for their incredible work in challenging circumstances."" But he added that plans were in place to help, including extra money for council-run care services so people could be moved out of hospital more quickly and the single biggest expansion in doctoring training places in the history of the NHS - 25% in the coming years.

"US President Donald Trump has reportedly lashed out at immigrants in a foul-mouthed Oval Office outburst that a UN spokesman later condemned as ""shocking"", ""shameful"" and ""racist"".

"The Crosthwaites' home is dwarfed by what will be Europe's most expensive stadium at Â£1bn Little has ever stood between Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich and realising his ambitions for the club. But plans for areported Â£1bn new stadium,externalare being held up by one family over their right to light - and the lack of it shining into their home when the new Stamford Bridge is built. The Crosthwaites have lived in their west London cottage for 50 years and it is so close to the Premier League club's ground that you could almost kick a football from their doorstep onto the pitch. The family - made up of parents Lucinda and Nicolas, plus children Louis and Rose - took out an injunction in May over their belief the towering new 60,000-capacity stadium will cast a permanent shadow over parts of their home. The new stadium was granted planning permission one year ago and has beensigned off by the Mayor of London,but Chelsea have called on the local council to intervene and take advantage of planning laws to stop the injunction effectively ending the planned development. Hammersmith and Fulham councillors are meeting on Monday to decide what happens next. Billionaire Abramovich is a man who usually gets what he wants, but the dispute has already put the brakes on the project's investment and there is a risk that Europe's most expensive stadium may not even get built. The club have told the local council that work cannot go ahead while there remains a risk the injunction could successfully stop the development. And the council says if it does not act to help Chelsea the ""development would not proceed as proposed"". Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich has invested more than Â£1bn in the club since 2003 The Crosthwaites own a large house in an expensive part of west London - a three-bedroom property on the same street sold for Â£1.18m last year. Chelsea's offer of legal advice worth Â£50,000, and further compensation understood to be in the region of a six-figure sum could not persuade them to waive their 'right to light' in their home. Daughter Rose says their home is the nearest property to the new stadium. And even though it's on the other side of a railway from Stamford Bridge - and in a different borough - she says that ""sunlight and daylight will be seriously affected"". ""It is deemed as having an unacceptable and harmful impact by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea,"" she added in a recent letter as part of the case. The family have said via their lawyers they are not opposed to the redevelopment of the stadium, but have suggested the east stand in question could be ""cut-back or re-designed so as not to cause interference"". And they have highlighted a ""disproportionate amount of hospitality seating"" which takes up more space than normal seating. They say there will be almost 17,000 hospitality seats, 28% of the total, and compare that to Arsenal's Emirates Stadium where hospitality comprises 16% of the capacity. The family also believe Chelsea's attempt to effectively sidestep the injunction with the help of Hammersmith and Fulham council is not in the public interest and possibly illegal. Their house sits in the neighbouring Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, which they say has been firmly opposed to the development. The back of Stamford Bridge (left) is only a drop-kick from the front of the Crosthwaites' home (right) Premier League champions Chelsea have outlined that the planning and development of their new stadium has been above board on every aspect. A public consultation of 13,000 local residents earned 97.5% support, and they have paid compensation to other homeowners who have been affected by losing their 'right to light'. Chelsea also claim that the new stadium will ""further enhance the economic, cultural and social services they provide"", including Â£6m worth of educational programmes, a Â£7m improvement to local infrastructure and an additional Â£16.3m spent in local businesses as 2.4 million people visit the area annually. That forms the key argument in the part of the law being disputed -section 203 of the Housing and Planning Act 2016.,external Chelsea say the land can be compulsorily acquired by the council - and override the injunction - if Hammersmith and Fulham think it would contribute to the economic, environmental or social wellbeing of the area. The club also says it will lease the land off the council and cover any liabilities or costs. The family's lawyers say the council can purchase land ""which they require"" but ask whether it is ""convenient"" rather than ""indispensable"". From the scene - BBC Sport's Simon Stone There is no doubt the Crosthwaites live in a very desirable part of London. The trees which shield them from the railway line are part of a conservation area. However, their home is not an enormous property. Chelsea players who perform at Stamford Bridge will doubtless live in far bigger homes. The thing that makes this particular house unique is that, unlike all the other properties on the street, it is directly opposite the stadium. All the rest look straight at an adjacent hotel, which is to be pulled down to allow Stamford Bridge to be rebuilt. Those houses could get marginally more light because the stadium will be further away. For the Crosthwaites, no such consolation exists. And, as the family have occupied the same house for half a century, they are committed to fighting Roman Abramovich, no matter how much the odds are stacked against them. The new stadium has been designed by architects Herzog and De Meuron, who were also responsible for the ""Bird's Nest"" Olympic stadium in Beijing Hammersmith and Fulham council accepts that acquiring the land should only be done where necessary to allow beneficial regeneration to take place and be sure that it justifies interfering with the human rights of those affected. A report for councillors, drawn up by head of planning and regeneration John Finlayson and to be discussed on Monday, recommends that the council buys the land (owned by Chelsea and Network Rail) and leases it back to the club so that development can go ahead. As it stands, the club ""will not be able to implement the development or secure any necessary development financing whilst there remains a risk that the existing injunctive proceedings might succeed"", the report warns. Finlayson's report adds: ""There is a compelling case in the public interest for the council to acquire the land for planning purposes and enable the development to proceed and the public benefits to be realised."" Without the council exercising its statutory powers, though, the ""development would not proceed as proposed"" it warns. It is understood that should the council decide to pursue the purchase, the Crosthwaite family will seek further legal advice - so the case may yet still run. Chelsea's Stamford Bridge holds 41,663 fans - some way behind their main London rivals Abramovich has wanted to increase Chelsea's stadium capacity for several years but was thwarted in his previous attempts to buy Battersea Power Station, ultimately losing out to property developers. If successful, the Blues would not be able to move into their new home until the 2024-25 season, yet it would at last put them in line with their main London rivals. Eleven years ago, Arsenal built the 60,000-seat Emirates Stadium, in 2016 West Ham moved to the 57,000-capacity Olympic Stadium, and Tottenham are redeveloping their White Hart Lane ground at the moment. The 41,000-capacity Stamford Bridge is the seventh biggest stadium used by a Premier League team, well behind Manchester United's 75,500-seater Old Trafford. Chelsea are yet to find a temporary home for the four years it might take to build the new stadium, but Wembley Stadium is being considered as a possible option.

"Police guard the hotel's rear entrance on Cambon Street French police have recovered all the jewellery stolen by armed robbers from a shop at the famous Ritz Hotel in Paris on Wednesday, sources say. They say the loot worth some â¬4.5m (Â£4m; $5.4m) was in a bag dropped by one member of the five-strong gang during the brazen raid. Three men have been arrested, police said, while others remain on the run. The five-star Ritz is in Place VendÃ´me, in Paris' historical first district on the right bank of the river Seine. ""I can confirm that all the stolen jewels were found in the bag recovered by police officers,"" a source close to the investigation was quoted as saying by Reuters. The gang used axes to smash the shop's windows on the ground floor of the hotel at about 18:00 local time (17:00 GMT). Le Parisien newspaper, citing a police source, reported that the robbery was interrupted by an officer on patrol. Three robbers were later arrested after being blocked in the building. But another two thieves, who waited outside, managed to escape by car and scooter. The stolen jewels were found in the bag dropped by the thief on the scooter, the sources say, as he collided with a pedestrian. Meanwhile, the getaway car used by his accomplice was later found in Sannois, just north of the French capital. The luxurious hotel is located next door to the French justice ministry.

"Banks and financial firms are prepared to consider helping the government pay for access to the single market. They will lose the ability to sell financial services across the EU from the UK after Brexit. Several sources told the BBC that if the government decided to pay into the EU budget in return for barrier-free access, they would reluctantly consider making a contribution. The so-called ""pay to play option"" has been ruled out by ministers. It would be politically unpalatable to continue making payments to the EU and would add extra expense for business. The finance sector has also downplayed the option. But industry sources said that while any extra cost would make the UK less competitive, losing frictionless market access to the world's largest trading block - or having to fragment their operations throughout Europe - could be worse. ""We'd have to look at the detail, but it's possible,"" said one insider. ""We would look to support the UK government in negotiations and if part of that meant some sort of financial contribution we'd consider it,"" said another. Publicly, finance industry groups have been loathe to raise this option for three reasons. First, they think it effectively penalises successful exporters - the opposite of what the government purports to want. UK plans to soften impact on European banks Brexit 'affecting London's talent pool' Second, they believe agreeing to pay for admission sets a dangerous precedent for trade deals with new partners. Third, they think other industries such as car manufacturing and pharmaceuticals should be asked to do the same and suspect the complexity of divvying up any bill would be mind-bogglingly complex. The government is clear the UK should not have to pay to get what we already have for free - and for something the EU also values. A Downing Street spokesman told the BBC: ""The position hasn't changed - we are not going to pay for market access. There is a lot of mutual self-interest at stake here. If you listened to EU briefings last summer then the breakthrough we achieved in December was impossible. This is a negotiation."" Nevertheless, financial services chiefs have made clear there is a big potential cost to losing access to the EU. If the price for keeping it is right, some think it might be worth paying.

"This video can not be played A timeline of what Trump has said about the Iran deal US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin has said he expects President Donald Trump to impose new sanctions on Iran. The news comes as Mr Trump faces a Friday deadline to decide whether to waive other major sanctions on Iran lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal. Earlier, European powers urged Mr Trump to uphold that agreement, saying it was vital for international security. Mr Trump has criticised the deal, which saw sanctions lifted when Iran agreed to limit its nuclear fuel production. Mr Mnuchin told reporters he was expecting new sanctions on Iran to be announced - which previous reports have suggested could be targeted measures against Iranian individuals and businesses. ""We continue to look at them. We've rolled them out and I think you can expect there will be more sanctions coming."" The US president says he wants to amend the deal - or withdraw from it completely. In October, he refused to recertify for Congress that Iran was complying with the deal, accusing it of ""not living up to the spirit"" of the agreement. The BBC's Gary O'Donoghue, in Washington, says that while the future of the major sanctions is an open question, the new measures could help the president fend off criticisms from his supporters that he's not fulfilling a key campaign promise  to ""rip up"" the nuclear deal with Iran. The foreign ministers of Britain, France, Germany and the European Union met their Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif in Brussels on Thursday to reaffirm their commitment to the accord, which was also backed by China and Russia. At a news conference afterwards,representatives of the EU, the UK, France and Germany reiterated their support for the nuclear deal they helped negotiate,external. ""The deal is working; it is delivering on its main goal, which means keeping the Iranian nuclear programme in check and under close surveillance,"" EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said. ""The unity of the international community is essential to preserve a deal that is working, that is making the world safer and that is preventing a potential nuclear arms race in the region. And we expect all parties to continue to fully implement this agreement."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson insisted the deal was preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, and challenged Washington to come up with a better alternative. He described the deal, which is known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), as a ""considerable diplomatic accomplishment"". Iran nuclear deal: Key details How sanctions have hit ordinary Iranians Johnson raises Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe case at summit Mr Zarif warned that Iran's continued compliance depended on Washington honouring the deal. He said the Brussels meeting had shown a ""strong consensus"" that Iran was complying with the pact, had the right to enjoy its economic benefits and that any move that undermined it was ""unacceptable"". The US president declared in October that the agreement was ""one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into"",external, and warned that within a few years Iran would be able to ""sprint towards a rapid nuclear weapons breakout"". He accused Iran of committing ""multiple violations"" and promised to work with Congress to ""address the deal's many serious flaws"". Mr Trump said they included the deal's ""sunset clauses"", one of which allows for the lifting of restrictions on Iran's uranium enrichment programme after 2025. He also wants to give the International Atomic Energy Agency access to Iranian military sites, and for the deal to cover Iran's ballistic missile programme. This video can not be played Boris Johnson on Iran nuclear deal: 'I don't think anybody has come up with a better idea' Critics of the deal in Congress have also proposed amending legislation to ensure that US sanctions would ""snap back"" automatically if Iran carried out certain actions. On Friday, Mr Trump is set to decide whether to extend relief for Iran from some US economic sanctions. The sanctions, which were suspended in 2016, had cut Iran's central bank out of the international financial system and imposed penalties for buying Iranian oil. US officials told the Associated Press on Wednesday that Mr Trump was expected to extend the sanctions relief for another 120 days,external. But they said he might also impose new, targeted sanctions on Iranian businesses and people allegedly involved in missile tests, supporting terrorism, and human rights abuses. The US and EU say Iranian ballistic missile tests conducted in the past year have violated UN Security Council resolution 2231, which endorsed the nuclear deal. The resolution calls upon Iran not to ""undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic missile technology"". Iran rejects US assertions that its ballistic missiles are designed to carry nuclear warheads Iran says the missiles it has tested are not designed to carry nuclear warheads and insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful. The European ministers expressed serious concern about Iran's ballistic missile programme,external, as well as its alleged transfer of missiles and assistance to non-state entities in the Middle East. But they said the issue should be kept separate from the nuclear deal.

"Labour MP Chris Williamson has stood down as shadow fire minister. It comes the day after he suggested council tax bills for the highest value homes in England should be doubled. He said that as a backbencher ""I will be campaigning on a broader range of issues"" and will ""continue to loyally support"" leader Jeremy Corbyn. Mr Corbyn said: ""I am grateful for Chris' work on the frontbench, particularly on fire safety following the appalling Grenfell Tower Fire."" He added: ""I know that on the backbenches, Chris will be a strong campaigner on a range of crucial issues as well as serving his constituents with dedication."" Labour MP: Hike council tax to offset cuts Labour's announcement did not confirm the reasons for Mr Williamson's departure. He had stressed that his council tax proposal was not party policy. But Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis claimed he had been ""forced out"" because he had ""exposed Labour's plans for soaring increases in council tax, and his plans have been endorsed by Labour activists across the country"". Some Labour colleagues backed Mr Williamson's resignation - which was reportedly a ""mutual decision"" reached with Mr Corbyn. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Williamson, 61, is the MP for Derby North - a role he held from 2010 before losing his seat in 2015 and then winning it back again in 2017. He said resigning from the front bench ""was not an easy decision to reach"" and he had ""every confidence that Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is going in the right direction"". ""I've taken this decision to bring me closer to the membership of our party and to allow me to work on a broader range of issues, from environmental policy, to animal rights and local government,"" he said in a statement. ""I intend to continue to champion the membership, fight for my constituents and make Derby North a shining example of how Labour can win broad support in marginal constituencies whilst maintaining socialist principles at our core.""
