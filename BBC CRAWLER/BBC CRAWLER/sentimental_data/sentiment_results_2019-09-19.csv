"Edward Putman denies fraud by false representation A man accused of claiming a Â£2.5m jackpot with a fake lottery ticket was helped by a National Lottery operator employee, a court heard. Edward Putman, 54, from Hertfordshire, denies committing fraud by false representation by allegedly claiming Â£2,525,485 with a faked ticket in 2009. St Albans Crown Court heard he was helped by Camelot insider Giles Knibbs, who knew how to cheat the system. The alleged fraud came to light after Mr Knibbs took his own life. Prosecutor James Keeley told the court Mr Knibbs worked for Camelot in Watford between 2004 and 2010 and his role in the fraud detection department allowed him the opportunity to create the false ticket, which he gave to the defendant to cash in. The court was told Mr Knibbs had seen a document containing details of big wins which had not yet been claimed. Mr Putman, of Station Road, Kings Langley, claimed the prize from the 11 March 2009 draw on 28 August, just before the six-month deadline passed to claim the win. ""He did not hold the winning ticket, but a forgery created by Mr Knibbs,"" the prosecutor said. The genuine winning ticket has never been found, the court heard. Camelot verified the ticket was genuine and paid out Mr Keeley told the jury the fraud came to light after Mr Knibbs, from Bricket Wood in Hertfordshire, died at Ivinghoe Beacon in Buckinghamshire on 5 October 2015. Mr Knibbs had allegedly told friends he had ""conned"" the lottery, as well as telling them about technical inaccuracies about the way the ticket was created, the court was told. Mr Keeley said: ""The veracity of his [Mr Knibbs'] narrative and thus credibility is strongly supported by the forged ticket which the defendant could not have acquired by legitimate means."" The court was told Mr Knibbs did not feel he had received his fair share of the jackpot and they had a bitter argument in June 2015. Evidence suggested Mr Knibbs was paid an initial Â£280,000 from Putman for his part in the ruse, followed by smaller increments totalling Â£50,000, Mr Keeley said. The argument led Mr Putman to make allegations of burglary, blackmail and criminal damage against Mr Knibbs, who was arrested, Mr Keeley said. Mr Keeley said the ticket submitted by the defendant was badly damaged, ""lacking the entire bottom section"" but on 8 September, Camelot decided he was the genuine winner and paid out. ""They had been conned,"" the prosecutor said. The trial, which is expected to last two weeks, continues.

"North America has lost more than a quarter of its birds since 1970 Bird populations in Asia and the US are ""in crisis"", according to two major studies. The first concludes there are three billion fewer birds in the US and Canada today compared to 1970,external- a loss of 29% of North America's birds. The second outlines a tipping point in ""the Asian songbird crisis"",external: on the island of Java, Indonesia, more birds may now live in cages than in the wild. Scientists hope the findings will serve as a wake-up call. The two studies are published in the journals Science and Biological Conservation. The caged bird trade could be worth tens of millions of dollars to the Indonesian economy How a national obsession with songbirds became an extinction crisis Global insect decline may lead to a 'plague of pests' Clever crows reveal a window into the mind Birds are declining in every type of habitat, from grasslands to deserts The North America study revealed how many birds were being lost across every type of habitat - from grasslands to coasts to deserts. While it did not directly assess what was driving this, the scientists concluded that, among multiple causes, the major factor was habitat loss driven by human activity. This study, explained lead researcher Dr Ken Rosenberg from the Cornell lab of Ornithology and the American Bird Conservancy, was the first to ""run the numbers"" on bird populations. ""We knew some species were declining,"" he told BBC News, ""but we thought that, while rare birds were disappearing, the more generalist birds - and those better adapted to human landscapes - would be filling in the gaps."" The team's calculations were based on bringing together all the bird monitoring in North America for the past 50 years - every major survey carried out across the continent since 1970. ""What we saw was this pervasive net loss,"" Dr Rosenberg said. ""And we were pretty startled to see that the more common birds, the everyday backyard birds and generalist species, are suffering some of the biggest losses."" That same pattern, he added, is likely to be mirrored in other parts of the world. And the situation in Asia, as the other study has shown, is a particularly striking case of a human-driven extinction crisis. Bird singing competitions are hugely popular in Indonesia The buying and selling of songbirds - many of which are caught from the wild - is huge business in parts of Asia, particularly on the island of Java in Indonesia. Back in 2017, we investigatedhow the trade pushed more than a dozen species to the brink of extinction. Around 75 million birds are kept as pets on Java. Many are sought after for bird singing competitions - often referred to as ""Kicau-mania"". At these events, caged birds' songs are judged on melody, duration and volume. Top prizes for the best singers can earn owners as much as Â£40,000 in the biggest contests. This culture, however, drives the capture of birds from the wild to satisfy demand. And that, researchers say, threatens the survival of numerous species. Harry Marshall, lead researcher on this study, explained: ""The trade is estimated to be worth tens of millions of dollars to the Indonesian economy, so it is no surprise that it is a key regional source of both supply and demand for songbirds, with hundreds of markets running across the archipelago, selling more than 200 different species."" Lovebirds are popular in the Asian songbird trade Mr Marshall, who is a PhD student at Manchester Metropolitan University and Chester Zoo, led a survey of 3,000 households across Java, which is Indonesia's most densely populated island. From this, he and his colleagues were able to estimate that there were as many as 75 million caged birds living in Javanese households. There may now be more songbirds living in cages on the island than there are now living in the wild. Conservationists hope these results will be a wake-up call for those who want to protect birds Both teams of scientists were keen to highlight the optimism among the obvious ""doom and gloom"" in these new findings. Prof Stuart Marsden, from Manchester Metropolitan University - an authority on the Asian songbird trade - pointed out that the national obsession with keeping caged birds in Indonesia was driven by a love of birds. ""I think that passion can be channelled into conservation,"" he said. Dr Rosenberg pointed to a striking example of bird conservation success as a reason for what he called his ""weirdly optimistic"" view about the dramatic decline in North America's bird population. ""In US and Canada, it was the duck hunters who noticed a decline in waterfowl and did some thing about it. Millions of dollars have been put into wetland protection and restoration - in order to have healthy populations for duck hunters. ""That's a model - if we can replicate it for birds that are not hunted and birds that people love in other habitats, we know that bird populations can be resilient and will come back.""

"This video can not be played Former PM David Cameron explains how he sought the Queen's help in Scottish independence vote Former PM David Cameron has revealed he asked whether the Queen could ""raise an eyebrow"" about the prospect of Scotland voting for independence. He told the BBC he sought help from royal officials days before the 2014 vote amid ""mounting panic"" he may lose. What was discussed was not ""anything that would be in any way improper... but just a raising of the eyebrow even... a quarter of an inch"", he said. The Queen laterurged people to ""think very carefully about the future"". The comments - made to a well-wisher outside a church on the Balmoral estate - were one of the main talking points of the referendum campaign. Reflecting on his rise to power and six years in Downing Street in a two-part BBC documentary, Mr Cameron said the Queen's words on the issue were ""very limited but helped to put a slightly different perception on things"". Forget Brexit - what else does Cameron's book tell us? Cameron: Johnson and Gove behaved 'appallingly' PM apology to Queen for 'purr' claim Scotland went on to reject independence by a margin of 55.3% to 44.7%, a result which Mr Cameron said left him ""blissfully happy"". In a statement, Alex Salmond, who resigned as Scotland's first minister in the wake of the result, said Mr Cameron's actions were not only improper, but showed how desperate the No side was during the final stages of the independence campaign. This video can not be played Former PM David Cameron criticises Boris Johnson's motives for supporting Leave campaign The Cameron Years, which begins on Thursday, examines Mr Cameron's modernisation of the party, his decision to enter a coalition with the Liberal Democrats after the 2010 election and the fallout from 2016 Brexit referendum, which led to his resignation. In it, he says: He ""broods"" every day about the Brexit referendum and its consequences He ignored George Osborne's advice against the poll and Michael Gove's reservations Boris Johnson ""agonised"" over his position and ""did not really want to leave"" the EU He still believes Brexit can ""be delivered and made to work"" His government's austerity programme was ""painful"" but necessary Legalising gay marriage was perhaps his ""proudest"" achievement in office On the EU referendum, Mr Cameron told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he ""wasn't the slightest bit complacent"" during the campaign, saying that he fought ""with every fibre of my being"". But he said the Labour leadership during the campaign ""simply wasn't there, wasn't committed"" and it was ""very hard to fight these things on your own"". He added that the result would ""probably have been even worse"" if people knew he would quit if Leave won the vote. Just as the first rule of Fight Club is that you do not talk about Fight Club, the first rule of the relationship between the prime minister and the Queen is that you never, ever talk about the relationship between the PM and the Queen. It is difficult to imagine anything other than horror in the Palace at David Cameron's revelations. Not just because he has broken the first rule. But because he has made it painfully clear that in 2014 he used the Queen for his own political purposes. And that she and her advisors thought that was OK. The revelation comes as her suspension of Parliament - a suspension made on the effective instruction of Boris Johnson - comes under unprecedented scrutiny in the Supreme Court. The two cases are very different; but they both highlight the dark greys of the Queen's constitutional position, the discretion she has or lacks, under extraordinary circumstances, to speak out and act. In the run-up to the 18 September poll on Scottish independence, it was reported that the Queen was concerned about the possibility of Scotland opting to sever the 300-year union with England and Wales. A Sunday Times poll on 7 September putting the Yes campaign ahead contributed to a ""mounting sense of panic"" in Downing Street, Mr Cameron recalls. The poll, which was published while he and his wife, Samantha, were staying at Balmoral, ""hit me like a blow to the solar plexus"". A poll finding the Yes campaign in front contributed to a ""mounting sense of panic"" in Downing Street Mr Cameron - who agreed to hold the independence referendum in the face of opposition within his party - said there followed urgent conversations between advisers in Downing Street and Buckingham Palace to figure out how the Queen could comment while still remaining within the constitutional boundaries of neutrality. ""I remember conversations I had with my private secretary and he had with the Queen's private secretary and I had with the Queen's private secretary, not asking for anything that would be in any way improper or unconstitutional but just a raising of the eyebrow even, you know, a quarter of an inch. We thought would make a difference."" Buckingham Palace insisted that the Queen was above politics When asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme for more detail about what had happened, Mr Cameron said he ""didn't want to say anything more about this"". ""I'm sure that some people would think, possibly even me, that I've already said perhaps a little bit too much,"" he said. At the time, the BBC's royal correspondent said the Queen's words were ""more of an observation than an intervention"", while Buckingham Palace said any suggestion the Queen was seeking to influence the outcome of the referendum was ""categorically wrong"". Officials insisted the monarch was above politics, and the issue of Scotland's future was a matter for the people. Two weeks after the Scottish referendum, Mr Cameron was forced to apologise after suggesting the Queen ""purred down the phone"" when she was told about the No result. While he feels ""sorry"" about events since the 2016 Brexit vote, Mr Cameron said he did not regret the decision to hold the EU referendum. While some people would ""never forgive"" him, he maintained the UK's 40-year membership was becoming ""unstable"" and the duty of leaders was to ""see difficulties coming and try to resolve them and shape the country's response to them"". He accepted he ""totally underestimated the latent Leave gene"" in his party and that during the campaign while ""he had a winning hand, he could not seem to play it"". After losing the vote, Mr Cameron said he knew he had to quit because he did not have the ""credibility to deliver Brexit"", but was ""desperately sad"" his time in office was cut short. Mr Cameron said the coalition government staved off a financial crisis ""I think of all the things we could and should have done if we had been able... to win the referendum,"" he recalls. ""A whole lot of what we could have done effectively ran into the sand of the European issue."" On his economic and social record, he rejects as ""total nonsense"" opponents' claims that he embraced deep spending cuts as a political choice to reduce the size of the state. He says the multi-billion pound budget deficit inherited by his government in 2010 was a ""clear and present danger to the British economy"" requiring immediate action. ""In the end there were difficult and painful decisions, but inequality fell and the share of income tax paid by the richest went up, not down,"" he argued. ""We protected pensioners, we protected the NHS, we protected help for the poorest."" Mr Cameron's long-awaited memoirs, entitled For The Record, was published on Thursday. In excerpts published by the Times last week, he accused Boris Johnson and Michael Gove of behaving ""appallingly"" during the Brexit referendum.

"Network Rail has submitted a planning application to install a bridge walk and visitor hub on the rail bridge Visitors will be able to walk at the top of the Forth Bridge rail crossing if proposals from Network Rail are approved. The operator has submitted a planning application to install a bridge walk and visitor hub. It is hoped the plan could attract 85,000 visitors a year to one of the world's most famous railway bridges. Network Rail wants to construct a walkway and a viewing platform on the south cantilever. A visitor reception hub would be created at South Queensferry. There are longer-term plans to build similar facilities on the Fife side of the bridge. The Forth Bridge was awardedUnesco World Heritage sitestatus in 2015. The landmark, which was designed by Sir John Fowler and Benjamin Baker, took eight years to build at a cost of Â£3.2m. When it was opened in March 1890, it was the longest cantilever bridge in the world and the first major crossing made entirely of steel. Spanning 1.5 miles, weighing 53,000 tonnes and containing 6.5m rivets, the bridge carries 200 trains per day over the Firth of Forth, linking Fife with the Lothians. Its tallest point is 110 metres above high water, and 137 metres above its foundations. The new planning application has been lodged with City of Edinburgh Council. Alan Ross, Network Rail Scotland's director of engineering and asset management, said: ""The Forth Bridge is an engineering icon and the plans we have submitted to deliver a bridge walk experience will offer a unique and memorable visit to one of Scotland's most loved structures. ""From the engineering genius behind its design, to the historical accounts of its construction and its crucial role in Scotland's operational railway, the bridge really is a national treasure and there is real appetite to take these plans forward.""

"This video can not be played Gary Lineker: ""I'm kind of the whipping boy for the BBC"" Match of the Day host Gary Lineker, the BBC's best-paid presenter, has said he's ""in negotiations"" over pay after reports that he will take a pay cut. He did not deny the reports, but said he would make an announcement ""when there is the time and place"". He waspaid Â£1.75m last year, and said footballers and broadcasters ""can't really justify our salary compared with people who do a real job"". ""But you know, that's the market rate,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. The BBC has pledged to close the gender pay gap across the corporation by 2020, and men outnumbered women on the latest star salaries list in July. Asked by 5 Live host Nihal Arthanayake how he felt about the reports earlier this week saying he would take a pay cut, the former footballer said he had become ""a bit of a whipping boy"" for critics of the corporation. Asked if the reports were wrong, he replied: ""I didn't say it was not true. We are in negotiations at the moment. When there is the time and place to say what's happening, we'll all make it clear. And if not, you'll read it every July [whenthe BBC lists its highest-paid stars' salaries as part of its annual report]. ""But I love working for the BBC. There are problems working for the BBC obviously because of what it is and what it entails, but it's a great place, and I'd hope to be here working with the BBC for many years to come."" Lineker also fronts BT Sport's Champions League coverage He also discussed how lucrative it can be covering football on television. ""I get paid a lot of money because it's a business, particularly around football and TV, that is very competitive, and it's very well paid,"" he said. ""There are pundits on Sky that in recent times are paid double what I'm on, and I'm not complaining about that. I wouldn't complain for one single minute."" He said he understood why some viewers feel his salary is very high. ""Of course I get that. I've always felt like that. I've felt incredibly fortunate. I felt like that when I was a footballer. And I feel like that as a broadcaster now. ""But you know, that's the market rate. That's what it's worth. And obviously, you could get bit more somewhere else. ""It is what it is, and it's the same whether you're a footballer or whether you're at the top of the entertainment world, or whether you're a singer, whether you're a top actor. ""You're paid money that is way beyond really what you deserve, but nobody's going to go, 'Actually, no, I'll for work for a pittance'. They're not going to do that. I always feel uncomfortable talking about it, but at the same time, I'm not complaining."" He was talking to promote a new book, and his comments follow a report in The Daily Mirror, which quoted him as saying: ""I'm currently negotiating a new contract with them and I'm Â­volunteering to take less."" Lineker also works for BT Sport, fronting their Champions League football coverage. Gary Lineker with the FA Cup Speaking about Lineker's pay earlier this year, BBC director general Tony Hall said the success of BBC Sport, which reaches 40% of the UK population, has ""much to do with Gary"", adding that he ""does an excellent job"". BBC chairman Sir David Clementi said he had ""seen no evidence we are paying anyone above the market rate"", adding: ""What I've seen suggests the opposite."" Last year, six male BBC presenters, including Huw Edwards, John Humphrys and Jeremy Vine, agreed to take pay cuts. Aside from Match of the Day, Lineker's other BBC work includes World Cup and European Championships coverage, and he has presented golf programmes. He also discussed the outcry over press stories about cricketer Ben Stokes and former rugby player Gareth Thomas this week. Lineker told 5 Live: ""I thought after the hacking scandals it was almost like they [the papers] deliberately laid back a little bit or perhaps they couldn't find the information off someone's phone. This week, newspapers faced a backlash after former rugby playerGareth Thomas revealed that journalists had forced him to go public with his HIV diagnosis. Then cricketerBen Stokes condemned a front page story in the Sun about a tragedy in his family31 years ago as ""immoral and heartless"". Are celebrity private lives no longer fair game? ""All of a sudden that reared its ugly head again this week. I just find it a bit sickening,"" Lineker said. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""I don't want to exaggerate Brexit progress"" Confidential documents that ""reflect the ideas the UK has put forward"" on Brexit have been shared with the EU, the UK government has said. Ministers will table ""formal written solutions when we are ready"" and not to an ""artificial deadline"", it added. Boris Johnson said he did not want to ""exaggerate progress"" of negotiations, but some was being made. It comes after Finland's prime minister said that Mr Johnson had 12 days to set out his Brexit plans to the EU. But a government source said the development was not in response to the remarks. Meanwhile, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has told Sky News that talks earlier this week with Mr Johnson were ""rather positive"" and that a deal could be reached in the next few weeks. Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said he will try to get a deal with Mr Johnson when they meet at a UN summit in New York next week. But his deputy, Simon Coveney, said there was ""still a big gap"" between what the UK government wanted and what Ireland and the EU needed, in terms of getting a deal. Kuenssberg: What happens next if the PM gets a Brexit deal? UK 'has 12 days to set out Brexit plans' Brexit talks 'should not be a pretence' - Barnier The commission said it had received documents from the UK government and technical talks were taking place. Chief spokesperson Mina Andreeva also confirmed there would be talks at a political level at a meeting on Friday between the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, and Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay. The technical discussions were on some aspects of rules relating to customs and manufactured goods, as well as sanitary rules and phytosanitary rules - which relate to the health of plants - she said. The BBC also understands ""live discussions"" are taking place between the EU and UK about ruling out another delay to Brexit if a deal is agreed. Sources told BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg that, if a plan is signed off by both sides, the EU could then announce it would not grant an extension to 31 October deadline if MPs voted the deal down - essentially giving them a choice between the negotiated deal or a no-deal Brexit. Other sources on the EU and UK sides played down the possibility, denying there had been any formal consideration of the proposal and saying the current focus was on getting a deal. But Laura Kuenssberg said: ""It's clear that government officials are considering ways of sticking to the prime minister's October deadline, with, or without a deal being reached."" Mr Johnson has said he wants to leave the EU, preferably with a deal, on 31 October and has urged the EU to scrap the backstop in the withdrawal agreement reached by predecessor Theresa May. The backstop is the controversial policy aimed at preventing the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland and it was a key sticking point in Mrs May's attempts to get Parliament to back her plan. The EU has asked for alternative suggestions and had criticised the UK for not putting any plans in writing. Mr Juncker told Sky News that the EU did not ""need the backstop"" if all its objectives for the Irish border were met. He added that ""if the results are there, I don't care about the instruments"". Finnish PM Antti Rinne (left) says he and French President Emmanuel Macron (right) agreed the new deadline for Boris Johnson Mr Johnson said: ""I don't want to exaggerate the progress that we are making, but we are making progress."" He said the UK needed to leave in a way that allowed it to ""do things differently"" and ""not remain under the control of the EU in terms of laws and trade policy"". But he also reiterated the need to ensure no hard border returned to Northern Ireland, and the Good Friday Agreement was protected. ""We think we can do that,"" said the PM. ""We think we can solve that problem and I think we are making some progress."" He added: ""Let's see where we get. It is vital whatever happens that we prepare for no-deal and we will be ready for no-deal on 31 October. We have got to do both things at once."" Could the Supreme Court overrule the government? Could MPs return to Parliament? Parliament suspended 'to stop MPs interfering' Earlier, Mr Rinne said he and French President Emmanuel Macron agreed the UK needed to produce the proposals in writing by the end of September, adding if not, ""then it's over"". Finland currently holds the EU's rotating presidency. A French government official said the deadline was ""not at all a new proposal"" and added: ""If we don't get the proposals before the end of September, we will not have enough time to discuss them before the summit in October."" The sending of the documents to the EU comes as the legal battle over the suspension of the UK Parliament is in its third day at the UK's Supreme Court. The UK government is arguing the decision to prorogue Parliament was a political matter and not for the courts to ""design a set of rules"" around it.

"Tour operator Thomas Cook has approached the government in an attempt to plug a gap in its funding. The travel company could fall into administration this weekend unless it finds Â£200m in extra funds needed to secure its future. ButBBC business editor Simon Jack saysif holidaymakers are hoping the government will save the day, they may be disappointed. A collapse would leave 150,000 UK holidaymakers stranded. The BBC's business editor said that while a private sector deal may still be possible, the noises coming out of the government at the moment suggested the UK taxpayer was unlikely to become Thomas Cook's saviour. The troubled operator hoped to seal a rescue led by China's Fosun this week. But the creditor banks issued a last-minute demand that the travel company find an extra Â£200m. The Civil Aviation Authority is on standby with a repatriation contingency plan called Operation Matterhorn. The potential cost of bringing home passengers is put at about Â£600m. In his blog,Simon Jack says the government does not recognise the choice being presented as between spending Â£200m on a cash injection to save the company versus a Â£600m bill to repatriate UK holidaymakers. He writes that the government's understanding is that most Thomas Cook customers will be covered by travel insurance or Atol protection - a fund paid for through industry levies. He also says the government's previous refusal to offer assistance to companieslike Carillionwould make helping Thomas Cook very difficult in principle and in practice. Furthermore, the matter is being handled by the Department for Transport - which organised the repatriation of customers of the failed airline Monarch - rather than the Department for Business, he adds. There has been a shift in tone from Thomas Cook on Twitter, with worried customers being told to ignore media speculation on Friday. Now they are being reminded they do have Atol protection ""in the event that Thomas Cook goes into administration"". Thomas Cook: Your questions answered What's gone wrong at Thomas Cook? Customers fear ruined weddings and trips Thomas Cook: MP calls for 'leadership' Travel expert Simon Calder said all Thomas Cook flights in and out of the UK were running normally on Saturday morning, and travel agencies would be opening at the usual times. He said that while Thomas Cook remains a going concern - albeit in terrible trouble - there was very little anyone who was on a Thomas Cook holiday or has one booked in the coming days or weeks could do. Anyone trying to cancel holidays could expect to be given short shrift and end up losing some or all of their money, he added. Currently there are 600,000 Thomas Cook customers on holiday, of which 150,000 to 160,000 are British Thomas Cook, one of the world's largest travel companies, was founded in 1841 to operate temperance day trips, and now has annual sales of Â£9bn. It employs 22,000 staff, 9,000 of those in the UK and serves 19 million customers a year in 16 different countries. The TSSA union's general secretary Manuel Cortes told the BBC that his members' ""main concern was if they had a job on Monday morning"". Jacqui Cunningham and her partner Angus McNair are unsure whether they should pay the outstanding balance on their holiday Teacher Jacqui Cunningham and her partner, train driver Angus McNair, from Brentwood, Essex, have booked a holiday to the Maldives with Thomas Cook for December. The luxury trip is to celebrate Ms Cunningham's recovery from cancer. They have paid a deposit of Â£500 and the balance of Â£8,000 is due by midnight on Friday. Thomas Cook is, of course, still operating. But their predicament underlines the anxiety many customers are feeling. Ms Cunningham and Mr McNair called the customer service helpline and asked if they could delay paying the Â£8,000 until they know that the tour operator is not going to fall into administration. But they were told the deadline remains, or they would lose their Â£500 deposit. ""We were going to pay on debit card, but now I think we'll put it on the credit card if we go forward,"" she said. Thomas Cook's financial difficulties have mounted over the past year, culminating with the agreement in August of a rescue deal led by its biggest shareholder Fosun. Thomas Cook 'racing to finalise rescue deal' Weak pound boosting UK tourism industry In July, Thomas Cook produced a business plan saying that it needed Â£900m in refinancing, up from a previous estimate of Â£150m. The Â£900m would come from Fosun, the group of creditors and some other investors. The group of lenders then commissioned an independent investigation. Its financial advisers said Thomas Cook would require an additional Â£200m on top of the Â£900m already required, which would bring the total refinancing needed up to Â£1.1bn. Thomas Cook succeeded in finding a backer to provide the additional Â£200m, but the BBC understands it has since pulled out and the group of creditors will not come back to the table unless that additional funding is found. A final vote on that deal was due to take place this week, but it has been delayed until next Friday in the face of the latest demand for extra standby funding. Earlier this week, Thomas Cook said it was ""focused on completing"" the deal. It is believed to be negotiating with its banks, bondholders and Fosun in an attempt to keep the rescue on track. In May, the operator reported a Â£1.5bn loss for the first half of the year. It has also recently issued three profit warnings and is struggling to reduce its debts. It has blamed a series of problems for its profit warnings, including political unrest in holiday destinations such as Turkey, last summer's prolonged heatwave and customers delaying booking holidays because of Brexit. If you are on a package holiday you are covered by the Air Travel Organiser's Licence scheme (Atol). The scheme will pay for your accommodation abroad, although you may have to move to a different hotel or apartment. Atol will also pay to have you brought home if the airline is no longer operating. If you have holiday booked in the future you will also be refunded by the scheme. If you have booked a flight-only deal you will need to apply to your travel insurance company or credit card and debit card provider to seek a refund. When Monarch Airlines collapsed in 2017, the government organised to bring home all the stranded passengers, whether they were covered by Atol or not.

"Mr Trump says he would only do what's ""good for the USA"" Donald Trump has denied a report alleging he made a promise to a foreign leader, which sparked a whistleblower's formal complaint. The complaint is reported to relate to a July phone call with Ukraine's new president, Volodymyr Zelensky. The Washington Post said an intelligence official found the comment ""so troubling"" they went to the department's inspector general. In a tweet, Mr Trump dismissed the claims as ""fake news"". Democrats are trying to get the complaint turned over to Congress, with the details still unknown. However, some reports allege that Mr Trump asked Mr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter - who previously served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company - in return for continued US military support. Joe Biden is currently the frontrunner to be the Democratic candidate competing against Mr Trump in the 2020 presidential election. It was filed on 12 August and only a few details have been made public. Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson saidthe complaint consists of a ""serious or flagrant problem, abuse or violation of the law"",externalthat involves classified information, a letter to lawmakers revealed. It is not yet known who made the complaint, which foreign leader Mr Trump was speaking to, what promise - if any - was made and whether Mr Trump took any action as a result. However,the Washington Post,externalandthe New York Times,externalboth said at least part of the complaint related to Ukraine, citing officials with knowledge of the matter. The acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, has so far refused to share any details of the complaint with lawmakers, leading to an outcry among Democrats. Under US law,external, if the complaint is considered to be of ""urgent concern"", and if the inspector general considers the complaint to be ""credible"", then the department head is expected to share the information with Congress within seven days. Earlier this month, before the whistleblower's complaint came to light, House Democrats launched an investigation into Mr Trump and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani's interactions with Ukraine. Three Democratic panel heads - Eliot Engel (foreign affairs), Adam Schiff (intelligence) and Elijah Cummings (oversight) - said Mr Trump and Mr Giuliani had attempted ""to manipulate the Ukrainian justice system to benefit the president's re-election campaign and target a possible political opponent"".

"North America has lost more than a quarter of its birds since 1970 Bird populations in Asia and the US are ""in crisis"", according to two major studies. The first concludes there are three billion fewer birds in the US and Canada today compared to 1970,external- a loss of 29% of North America's birds. The second outlines a tipping point in ""the Asian songbird crisis"",external: on the island of Java, Indonesia, more birds may now live in cages than in the wild. Scientists hope the findings will serve as a wake-up call. The two studies are published in the journals Science and Biological Conservation. The caged bird trade could be worth tens of millions of dollars to the Indonesian economy How a national obsession with songbirds became an extinction crisis Global insect decline may lead to a 'plague of pests' Clever crows reveal a window into the mind Birds are declining in every type of habitat, from grasslands to deserts The North America study revealed how many birds were being lost across every type of habitat - from grasslands to coasts to deserts. While it did not directly assess what was driving this, the scientists concluded that, among multiple causes, the major factor was habitat loss driven by human activity. This study, explained lead researcher Dr Ken Rosenberg from the Cornell lab of Ornithology and the American Bird Conservancy, was the first to ""run the numbers"" on bird populations. ""We knew some species were declining,"" he told BBC News, ""but we thought that, while rare birds were disappearing, the more generalist birds - and those better adapted to human landscapes - would be filling in the gaps."" The team's calculations were based on bringing together all the bird monitoring in North America for the past 50 years - every major survey carried out across the continent since 1970. ""What we saw was this pervasive net loss,"" Dr Rosenberg said. ""And we were pretty startled to see that the more common birds, the everyday backyard birds and generalist species, are suffering some of the biggest losses."" That same pattern, he added, is likely to be mirrored in other parts of the world. And the situation in Asia, as the other study has shown, is a particularly striking case of a human-driven extinction crisis. Bird singing competitions are hugely popular in Indonesia The buying and selling of songbirds - many of which are caught from the wild - is huge business in parts of Asia, particularly on the island of Java in Indonesia. Back in 2017, we investigatedhow the trade pushed more than a dozen species to the brink of extinction. Around 75 million birds are kept as pets on Java. Many are sought after for bird singing competitions - often referred to as ""Kicau-mania"". At these events, caged birds' songs are judged on melody, duration and volume. Top prizes for the best singers can earn owners as much as Â£40,000 in the biggest contests. This culture, however, drives the capture of birds from the wild to satisfy demand. And that, researchers say, threatens the survival of numerous species. Harry Marshall, lead researcher on this study, explained: ""The trade is estimated to be worth tens of millions of dollars to the Indonesian economy, so it is no surprise that it is a key regional source of both supply and demand for songbirds, with hundreds of markets running across the archipelago, selling more than 200 different species."" Lovebirds are popular in the Asian songbird trade Mr Marshall, who is a PhD student at Manchester Metropolitan University and Chester Zoo, led a survey of 3,000 households across Java, which is Indonesia's most densely populated island. From this, he and his colleagues were able to estimate that there were as many as 75 million caged birds living in Javanese households. There may now be more songbirds living in cages on the island than there are now living in the wild. Conservationists hope these results will be a wake-up call for those who want to protect birds Both teams of scientists were keen to highlight the optimism among the obvious ""doom and gloom"" in these new findings. Prof Stuart Marsden, from Manchester Metropolitan University - an authority on the Asian songbird trade - pointed out that the national obsession with keeping caged birds in Indonesia was driven by a love of birds. ""I think that passion can be channelled into conservation,"" he said. Dr Rosenberg pointed to a striking example of bird conservation success as a reason for what he called his ""weirdly optimistic"" view about the dramatic decline in North America's bird population. ""In US and Canada, it was the duck hunters who noticed a decline in waterfowl and did some thing about it. Millions of dollars have been put into wetland protection and restoration - in order to have healthy populations for duck hunters. ""That's a model - if we can replicate it for birds that are not hunted and birds that people love in other habitats, we know that bird populations can be resilient and will come back.""

"Edward Putman denies fraud by false representation A man accused of claiming a Â£2.5m jackpot with a fake lottery ticket was helped by a National Lottery operator employee, a court heard. Edward Putman, 54, from Hertfordshire, denies committing fraud by false representation by allegedly claiming Â£2,525,485 with a faked ticket in 2009. St Albans Crown Court heard he was helped by Camelot insider Giles Knibbs, who knew how to cheat the system. The alleged fraud came to light after Mr Knibbs took his own life. Prosecutor James Keeley told the court Mr Knibbs worked for Camelot in Watford between 2004 and 2010 and his role in the fraud detection department allowed him the opportunity to create the false ticket, which he gave to the defendant to cash in. The court was told Mr Knibbs had seen a document containing details of big wins which had not yet been claimed. Mr Putman, of Station Road, Kings Langley, claimed the prize from the 11 March 2009 draw on 28 August, just before the six-month deadline passed to claim the win. ""He did not hold the winning ticket, but a forgery created by Mr Knibbs,"" the prosecutor said. The genuine winning ticket has never been found, the court heard. Camelot verified the ticket was genuine and paid out Mr Keeley told the jury the fraud came to light after Mr Knibbs, from Bricket Wood in Hertfordshire, died at Ivinghoe Beacon in Buckinghamshire on 5 October 2015. Mr Knibbs had allegedly told friends he had ""conned"" the lottery, as well as telling them about technical inaccuracies about the way the ticket was created, the court was told. Mr Keeley said: ""The veracity of his [Mr Knibbs'] narrative and thus credibility is strongly supported by the forged ticket which the defendant could not have acquired by legitimate means."" The court was told Mr Knibbs did not feel he had received his fair share of the jackpot and they had a bitter argument in June 2015. Evidence suggested Mr Knibbs was paid an initial Â£280,000 from Putman for his part in the ruse, followed by smaller increments totalling Â£50,000, Mr Keeley said. The argument led Mr Putman to make allegations of burglary, blackmail and criminal damage against Mr Knibbs, who was arrested, Mr Keeley said. Mr Keeley said the ticket submitted by the defendant was badly damaged, ""lacking the entire bottom section"" but on 8 September, Camelot decided he was the genuine winner and paid out. ""They had been conned,"" the prosecutor said. The trial, which is expected to last two weeks, continues.

"The report also stated there has been a decrease in the number of on-street sex workers Publicity around a change to Northern Ireland's prostitution laws caused a spike in business, a new report has claimed. Academics carried out a three-year review of the impact of the Human Trafficking and Exploitation Act 2015. The law introduced the ""Nordic model"",which criminalised paying for sexual services in Northern Ireland. Sex workers, consulted for the review, said media discussion at the time publicised the idea of prostitution. First arrest in NI under new sex law 'No prosecutions' for paying for sex in NI Paying for sex to become crime in NI The report said sex workers noted ""a surge in business in the run-up to the legislation and its immediate aftermath and it was suggested that the public debate around Article 64A publicised prostitution to those who had never previously considered it"". Article 64A in the 2015 act related to paying for sex. The Northern Ireland Assembly passed the Human Trafficking and Exploitation Bill in December 2014. The private member's bill was brought before the house by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) peer Lord Morrow. DUP peer Lord Morrow criticised the methodology of the report He criticised the methodology of the report and claimed on Good Morning Ulster that those who compiled it had a ""clear track record on this issue in favour of decriminalisation"". Lord Morrow added that he was ""disappointed in some regard with how the legislation has been implemented"" but that it had led to arrests and convictions ""so the PSNI and PPS (Public Prosecution Service) can build on this in the future"". One of the academics involved in the report, Dr Caoimhe NÃ­ DhÃ³naill, rejected Lord Morrow's criticism, tweeting that his claims were ""unfounded and untrue"" and that they ""simply reported what was found"".

Earlier, she told Good Morning Ulster that ""the demand for sex work is as strong as ever"". ""Now because clients have been criminalised, the clients are putting a lot more pressure on sex workers to put themselves in more risky situations and to move into sexual practices that they wouldn't have done before,"" she said. The report, based on research which examined a period between June 2015 and December 2018, also found an increase in online advertising for prostitution. Looking at a total of 173,460 advertisements, there was a 5% increase in the total number over that period. The report said that worked out at about 308 sex workers advertising each day. The estimated number of sex workers in Northern Ireland increased from 3,351 up to 3,973. The number of sex workers in Northern Ireland increased from 3,351 up to 3,973 The report also examined issues around the safety of sex workers and human trafficking for exploitation. On the basis of the findings, it concluded there was ""no evidence that the offence of purchasing sexual services has produced a downward pressure on the demand for, or supply of, sexual services"". Responding to the report, the Sex Workers Alliance Ireland (SWAI) said it showed current legislation is ""not fit for purpose"". ""Sex workers in Ireland tend to work both jurisdictions so a lot of the findings in this report will be applicable to the Republic of Ireland,"" said Kate McGrew, current sex worker and spokesperson for the SWAI. ""If the purpose of the law was to decrease demand it has failed. ""If the purpose of the law was to help sex workers it has failed."" The report said the legislation had little effect on the supply or demand for sexual services The report said the ""tailing off"" in demand, which had been expected, has not happened. Rather, the legislation ""has had little effect on the supply or demand for sexual services"". On the issue of safety, the report states serious crimes against sex workers are ""comparatively rare"". However, information gathered from a website used by sex workers to report instances of abuse showed increases in the number of reports it had received of assaults, sexual assaults, and threatening behaviour. The report also stated there has been a decrease in the number of on-street sex workers, falling from about 20 operating in Northern Ireland in 2014, down to less than 10 currently. In 2014, ahead of the law change, baseline research was carried out by the Department of Justice to give a point of comparison. A requirement was built into it at the time for a review to be carried out after three years. ""The evidence from Northern Ireland based on a comparison of the before and after data suggests very strongly that Article 64A has had minimal to no effect on the demand for prostitution, the number of active sex workers in the jurisdiction and on levels of human trafficking for sexual exploitation,"" the report concluded.

"North America has lost more than a quarter of its birds since 1970 Bird populations in Asia and the US are ""in crisis"", according to two major studies. The first concludes there are three billion fewer birds in the US and Canada today compared to 1970,external- a loss of 29% of North America's birds. The second outlines a tipping point in ""the Asian songbird crisis"",external: on the island of Java, Indonesia, more birds may now live in cages than in the wild. Scientists hope the findings will serve as a wake-up call. The two studies are published in the journals Science and Biological Conservation. The caged bird trade could be worth tens of millions of dollars to the Indonesian economy How a national obsession with songbirds became an extinction crisis Global insect decline may lead to a 'plague of pests' Clever crows reveal a window into the mind Birds are declining in every type of habitat, from grasslands to deserts The North America study revealed how many birds were being lost across every type of habitat - from grasslands to coasts to deserts. While it did not directly assess what was driving this, the scientists concluded that, among multiple causes, the major factor was habitat loss driven by human activity. This study, explained lead researcher Dr Ken Rosenberg from the Cornell lab of Ornithology and the American Bird Conservancy, was the first to ""run the numbers"" on bird populations. ""We knew some species were declining,"" he told BBC News, ""but we thought that, while rare birds were disappearing, the more generalist birds - and those better adapted to human landscapes - would be filling in the gaps."" The team's calculations were based on bringing together all the bird monitoring in North America for the past 50 years - every major survey carried out across the continent since 1970. ""What we saw was this pervasive net loss,"" Dr Rosenberg said. ""And we were pretty startled to see that the more common birds, the everyday backyard birds and generalist species, are suffering some of the biggest losses."" That same pattern, he added, is likely to be mirrored in other parts of the world. And the situation in Asia, as the other study has shown, is a particularly striking case of a human-driven extinction crisis. Bird singing competitions are hugely popular in Indonesia The buying and selling of songbirds - many of which are caught from the wild - is huge business in parts of Asia, particularly on the island of Java in Indonesia. Back in 2017, we investigatedhow the trade pushed more than a dozen species to the brink of extinction. Around 75 million birds are kept as pets on Java. Many are sought after for bird singing competitions - often referred to as ""Kicau-mania"". At these events, caged birds' songs are judged on melody, duration and volume. Top prizes for the best singers can earn owners as much as Â£40,000 in the biggest contests. This culture, however, drives the capture of birds from the wild to satisfy demand. And that, researchers say, threatens the survival of numerous species. Harry Marshall, lead researcher on this study, explained: ""The trade is estimated to be worth tens of millions of dollars to the Indonesian economy, so it is no surprise that it is a key regional source of both supply and demand for songbirds, with hundreds of markets running across the archipelago, selling more than 200 different species."" Lovebirds are popular in the Asian songbird trade Mr Marshall, who is a PhD student at Manchester Metropolitan University and Chester Zoo, led a survey of 3,000 households across Java, which is Indonesia's most densely populated island. From this, he and his colleagues were able to estimate that there were as many as 75 million caged birds living in Javanese households. There may now be more songbirds living in cages on the island than there are now living in the wild. Conservationists hope these results will be a wake-up call for those who want to protect birds Both teams of scientists were keen to highlight the optimism among the obvious ""doom and gloom"" in these new findings. Prof Stuart Marsden, from Manchester Metropolitan University - an authority on the Asian songbird trade - pointed out that the national obsession with keeping caged birds in Indonesia was driven by a love of birds. ""I think that passion can be channelled into conservation,"" he said. Dr Rosenberg pointed to a striking example of bird conservation success as a reason for what he called his ""weirdly optimistic"" view about the dramatic decline in North America's bird population. ""In US and Canada, it was the duck hunters who noticed a decline in waterfowl and did some thing about it. Millions of dollars have been put into wetland protection and restoration - in order to have healthy populations for duck hunters. ""That's a model - if we can replicate it for birds that are not hunted and birds that people love in other habitats, we know that bird populations can be resilient and will come back.""

"Peter Beardsley made 326 appearances for Newcastle as a forward Former Newcastle United forward Peter Beardsley has been suspended from all football-related activity for 32 weeks for making racist comments to players. Ex-England man Beardsley called one black player ""a monkey"" while Newcastle's Under-23s coach and joked about climbing trees, an independent Football Association panel said. It added his remarks ""were obviously racist and wholly unacceptable"". Beardsley said he was ""surprised and disappointed"" by the panel's findings. He was charged by the Football Association with three counts of using racist language to playersin Marchand had ""categorically denied"" the claims. He left Newcastle after a 14-month club investigation earlier this year. The FA panel said in its written reasons: ""Even if he did not intend to do so, he plainly did cause offence."" Beardsley, who was capped 59 times by England, has been ordered to complete a face-to-face education course. However, the panel said it did not believe Beardsley was racist. ""We are satisfied that Mr Beardsley is not a racist in the sense of being ill-disposed to persons on grounds of their race or ethnicity,"" it said. ""He is now 58 years of age. It is also relevant that he has not had the benefit of training and education about offensive racist remarks and the importance of not making them."" One of the witnesses to the ""monkey"" comment"" said: ""I don't think Peter meant it as racist, but it came out looking bad as he is a black player."" The panel did, though, say it had ""serious reservations about Mr Beardsley's credibility"". One of the aggravating factors in deciding its punishment was that Beardsley had contended that ""three of the black players had made up the allegations motivated by financial greed, for which he did not have a shred of evidence"". As a player, Newcastle-born Beardsley enjoyed two spells at his hometown club, making more than 300 appearances, and also played for Liverpool, Everton, Manchester City, Fulham, Bolton, Hartlepool, Doncaster, Carlisle and Vancouver Whitecaps. All three charges wereproven by the panel,,externalwhich found: Beardsley said: ""You should be used to that"" to one or more black players of African origin at a team-building event at Go Ape He questioned the legitimacy of the age of black players - ""a negative stereotype that players of black African origin commit fraud as to their true age"", the FA panel said, and He called a player of black African origin a monkey during a game of head tennis. Football's anti-discrimination group Kick It Out called on Newcastle to publish its own findings from its internal investigation in the wake of the FA panel's punishment, ""and clarify whether he was sacked for racist abuse"". It added: ""Beardsley's career in football has no relevance to this case - calling black players monkeys, comparing black players to apes and questioning their true age are all horrific racial stereotypes. Punishment and education is the only way to deal with these matters."" A statement from Beardsley's solicitors released shortly after the verdict was made public said: ""Peter Beardsley is very surprised and disappointed by the decision of the Regulatory Commission. ""It was almost impossible for Peter to clear his name because of the serious flaws and contamination of evidence that occurred in the disciplinary process before Newcastle United and by the unusual fact that the FA Rules put the burden of proof on him to prove his innocence in the proceedings. ""After a long process which has been unnecessarily protracted, Peter feels vindicated that the Commission has expressly found that he is not a racist."" It added he had been ""inundated with support"" from ""fellow professionals of the highest repute including John Barnes, Kevin Keegan, Les Ferdinand and Andrew Cole, as well as other football professionals including managers, coaches, players, and football fans, all of which provided unchallenged evidence to the Commission as to Peter's good character, the fact that he is not a racist and whatever was said, there was no intent to cause offence"".

"Ryanair's group chief executive Michael O'Leary Nearly half of Ryanair's shareholders voted against a pay deal for Michael O'Leary that could hand the chief executive â¬99m (Â£88m). The Irish airline said that just 50.5% of investors voted in favour of the company's remuneration report. The revolt comes at a difficult time for Ryanair which is facing more strike action from pilots and is cutting jobs. Following the vote, a spokesman said it would consult with its investors. He said: ""Ryanair is, and will continue, to consult with its shareholders and we will report back to them over the coming year on how the board will adapt its decision-making to reflect their advice and input on all these topics."" Earlier this year, Mr O'Leary signed a new contract to stay on as chief executive until 2024. Under the deal he stands to make â¬99m from stock options if he doubles Ryanair's profit or share price. Ryanair pilots vote for further strikes Ryanair rated 'greedy and arrogant' by customers Michael O'Leary: Ryanair's outspoken boss In the last financial year, however, the airline's profit dropped sharply and Mr O'Leary said on Thursday that he was planning to cut between 500 and 700 jobs. Ryanair said Mr O'Leary's agreement to stay for another five years ""gives certainty to our shareholders"". It also noted that his remuneration is ""considerably lower than many other European airline chief executives"". However, a sizeable number of the airline's shareholders voted against the company's remuneration report at its annual general meeting (AGM) on Thursday. Pilots are planning more walkouts this month in a row over pay and conditions. The pilots' union Balpa said its members want the same kind of agreements that exist in other airlines on pensions, loss of licence insurance, maternity benefits allowances and pay. Ryanair branded earlier strikes as ""pointless"" as industrial action had not resulted in any flight cancellations. Under his new deal, Mr O'Leary's pay and the maximum annual bonus have both been cut in half to â¬500,000. He was also granted 10 million share options. These are shares he can acquire for â¬11.12 and then sell at the market price if Ryanair's profits hit â¬2bn in any year up to 2024 or its share price reaches â¬21 for a period of 28 days from April next year. He would then pocket the difference. The company's shares are currently trading at â¬9.84. Pre-tax profit dropped to â¬948m in the year to 31 March compared to â¬1.6bn in the previous 12 months.

"The pound would fall further under a no-deal Brexit, says the Bank The Bank of England has signalled that prolonged Brexit uncertainty will keep interest rates lower for longer. Policymakers said the UK would avoid falling into recession this year, but warned that Brexit and trade worries were weighing on the economy. The Bank kept interest rates on hold at 0.75%. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) that sets interest rates also warned that a no-deal Brexit would hit the economy. Policymakers said it would lead to weaker growth, higher inflation and a further drop in the value of the pound. However, the Bank stressed that interest rates could move up or down if the UK left the European Union without a deal. The minutes of the Bank's September meeting said that policymakers would have to balance raising interest rates to keep a lid on inflation against cutting them to support growth. The UK economy contracted by 0.2% in the three months to June. The Bank expects the economy to expand by 0.2% in the third quarter of this year. While this is weaker than the 0.3% growth predicted last month, it means the UK is expected to avoid a technical recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of economic decline. A survey by the Bank showed that consumer spending remained robust, with many families choosing to spend more time in the UK this summer rather than go abroad because of the weaker pound. More holidaymakers have chosen to stay in the UK It said the increase in ""staycations"" had boosted spending on restaurants and hotel accommodation. The Bank also said the government's decision to inject more money into departments in the latest Spending Review would boost UK growth by around 0.4% over the next three years. The MPC said that the ongoing uncertainty over the UK's relationship with the EU risked a further period of ""entrenched uncertainty"". They said ongoing uncertainty would lead to weaker growth and less inflationary pressure, reducing the Bank's need to raise interest rates. The minutes of the meeting said: ""The longer those uncertainties persisted, particularly in an environment of weaker global growth, the more likely it was that demand growth would remain below potential."" However, policymakers repeated that more clarity that the economy was heading towards a Brexit deal meant that increases in interest rates would be needed over the next three years. The Bank of England, like many of us, is on hold, and in a Brexit holding pattern too. Although there is no change in the Bank of England's interest rate decision, marking out the UK from its counterparts in the US and eurozone, there are interesting Brexit developments in September's deliberations of the Monetary Policy Committee. For the first time, the Bank has felt the need to signal a direction of travel for interest rates in the now plausible scenario of ""political events"" leading to ""a further period of entrenched uncertainty"" about Brexit. The committee concluded that the longer that uncertainty continues, particularly against a background of a weak global economy, the more likely that growth, and also inflation will slow. The implication of these minutes being that UK base rates would also remain lower for longer. It has until now signalled that rates are likely to rise gradually back from its post-crisis lows only if there was a ""smooth Brexit"", a deal with a transition. Or else under no-deal, amid exchange rate falls, inflation rises and slower economy, there could be either cuts or rises. Policymakers said the US China trade war had intensified over the summer, which would continue to weigh on overall growth. Manufacturing output continued to be weak, and while policymakers said the direct economic impact of ongoing trade tensions was likely to be ""relatively small"", they said the trade war was ""having a material negative impact on global business investment growth"". They did not say how the recent attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil supply would affect inflation except to say that prices had risen sharply following the attacks.

"Agriculture groups were among the first to object to the EU deal, before fires in the Amazon rainforest drew global attention MPs in Austria have dealt a blow to the EU's landmark trade deal with South America's economic bloc, by demanding a government veto on the deal. The draft free trade agreement took 20 years to complete and the EU has described it as its biggest so far. France and Ireland have already warned they will reject the deal if Brazil does not do more to curb fires in the Amazon rainforest. Austrian groups say the deal must do more to tackle environment issues. All but one of Austria's main parties rejected the deal in a parliamentary sub-committee, from the far right to the centre left. Mercosur includes four South American economies - Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay. A fifth member, Venezuela, is currently suspended. Without backing from every government in the EU, the Mercosur deal cannot go through. JÃ¶rg Leichtfried of the centre-left SPÃ hailed the decision as a ""great success for consumers, the environment and animal welfare as well as human rights"", warning that it would have been bad for climate protection and labour rights in South America. This video can not be played Why the Amazon rainforest helps fight climate change Austria's trade union federation ÃGB had campaigned against the deal, arguing it had not sought binding rules on workers and the environment but focused on the interests of industry rather than people. 'Historic' EU-South America trade deal agreed Seven nations agree Amazon protection pact France threatens to block trade over Amazon fires What is Mercosur,external Green MEP Monika Vana praised the decision as ""laying down a marker in Europe"". Austria's federation of industry, however, has backed the Mercosur deal, warning against ""populist scaremongering and free-trade myths"" and insisting that the deal includes a commitment to the Paris Climate Agreement and the fight against deforestation in the Amazon. The liberal Neos party was alone in rejecting a veto, calling instead for the deal to be renegotiated. Austrians are currently in the grip of an election campaign ahead of a 29 September vote. The centre-right alliance with the far-right Freedom Party fell apart in May amidst a corruption scandal. The deal was announced amid great fanfare in June, but weeks later Europe's leaders were shocked by the spread of fires raging in the Amazon rainforest. Brazil's President, Jair Bolsonaro, was accused by France's Emmanuel Macron of lying over his stance on climate change. When Mr Macron pledged millions of dollars in aid to help reforest the Amazon, Mr Bolsonaro hit back by accusing him of treating it as a ""colony or a no-man's land"". Allow Twitter content?

Ireland and Luxembourg also threatened to block the deal because of the far-right Brazilian leader's environmental policy. The EU is already Mercosur's biggest trade partner, accounting last year for 20.1% of the bloc's trade in goods such as food, drink, farm products and tobacco. EU exports account for only 2.3% of the European bloc's total and tariffs on EU products are as high as 35% for cars and clothing. The agreement, which would cover 780 million people, aims to remove trade barriers,externaland promote high standards, with a commitment to sustainable management and conservation of forests and respect for labour rights. European Council President Donald Tusk said last month it was difficult to see the accord getting through while fires were continuing in the Amazon rainforest. Allow Twitter content?

"Peter Beardsley made 326 appearances for Newcastle as a forward Former Newcastle United forward Peter Beardsley has been suspended from all football-related activity for 32 weeks for making racist comments to players. Ex-England man Beardsley called one black player ""a monkey"" while Newcastle's Under-23s coach and joked about climbing trees, an independent Football Association panel said. It added his remarks ""were obviously racist and wholly unacceptable"". Beardsley said he was ""surprised and disappointed"" by the panel's findings. He was charged by the Football Association with three counts of using racist language to playersin Marchand had ""categorically denied"" the claims. He left Newcastle after a 14-month club investigation earlier this year. The FA panel said in its written reasons: ""Even if he did not intend to do so, he plainly did cause offence."" Beardsley, who was capped 59 times by England, has been ordered to complete a face-to-face education course. However, the panel said it did not believe Beardsley was racist. ""We are satisfied that Mr Beardsley is not a racist in the sense of being ill-disposed to persons on grounds of their race or ethnicity,"" it said. ""He is now 58 years of age. It is also relevant that he has not had the benefit of training and education about offensive racist remarks and the importance of not making them."" One of the witnesses to the ""monkey"" comment"" said: ""I don't think Peter meant it as racist, but it came out looking bad as he is a black player."" The panel did, though, say it had ""serious reservations about Mr Beardsley's credibility"". One of the aggravating factors in deciding its punishment was that Beardsley had contended that ""three of the black players had made up the allegations motivated by financial greed, for which he did not have a shred of evidence"". As a player, Newcastle-born Beardsley enjoyed two spells at his hometown club, making more than 300 appearances, and also played for Liverpool, Everton, Manchester City, Fulham, Bolton, Hartlepool, Doncaster, Carlisle and Vancouver Whitecaps. All three charges wereproven by the panel,,externalwhich found: Beardsley said: ""You should be used to that"" to one or more black players of African origin at a team-building event at Go Ape He questioned the legitimacy of the age of black players - ""a negative stereotype that players of black African origin commit fraud as to their true age"", the FA panel said, and He called a player of black African origin a monkey during a game of head tennis. Football's anti-discrimination group Kick It Out called on Newcastle to publish its own findings from its internal investigation in the wake of the FA panel's punishment, ""and clarify whether he was sacked for racist abuse"". It added: ""Beardsley's career in football has no relevance to this case - calling black players monkeys, comparing black players to apes and questioning their true age are all horrific racial stereotypes. Punishment and education is the only way to deal with these matters."" A statement from Beardsley's solicitors released shortly after the verdict was made public said: ""Peter Beardsley is very surprised and disappointed by the decision of the Regulatory Commission. ""It was almost impossible for Peter to clear his name because of the serious flaws and contamination of evidence that occurred in the disciplinary process before Newcastle United and by the unusual fact that the FA Rules put the burden of proof on him to prove his innocence in the proceedings. ""After a long process which has been unnecessarily protracted, Peter feels vindicated that the Commission has expressly found that he is not a racist."" It added he had been ""inundated with support"" from ""fellow professionals of the highest repute including John Barnes, Kevin Keegan, Les Ferdinand and Andrew Cole, as well as other football professionals including managers, coaches, players, and football fans, all of which provided unchallenged evidence to the Commission as to Peter's good character, the fact that he is not a racist and whatever was said, there was no intent to cause offence"".

"The pound would fall further under a no-deal Brexit, says the Bank The Bank of England has signalled that prolonged Brexit uncertainty will keep interest rates lower for longer. Policymakers said the UK would avoid falling into recession this year, but warned that Brexit and trade worries were weighing on the economy. The Bank kept interest rates on hold at 0.75%. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) that sets interest rates also warned that a no-deal Brexit would hit the economy. Policymakers said it would lead to weaker growth, higher inflation and a further drop in the value of the pound. However, the Bank stressed that interest rates could move up or down if the UK left the European Union without a deal. The minutes of the Bank's September meeting said that policymakers would have to balance raising interest rates to keep a lid on inflation against cutting them to support growth. The UK economy contracted by 0.2% in the three months to June. The Bank expects the economy to expand by 0.2% in the third quarter of this year. While this is weaker than the 0.3% growth predicted last month, it means the UK is expected to avoid a technical recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of economic decline. A survey by the Bank showed that consumer spending remained robust, with many families choosing to spend more time in the UK this summer rather than go abroad because of the weaker pound. More holidaymakers have chosen to stay in the UK It said the increase in ""staycations"" had boosted spending on restaurants and hotel accommodation. The Bank also said the government's decision to inject more money into departments in the latest Spending Review would boost UK growth by around 0.4% over the next three years. The MPC said that the ongoing uncertainty over the UK's relationship with the EU risked a further period of ""entrenched uncertainty"". They said ongoing uncertainty would lead to weaker growth and less inflationary pressure, reducing the Bank's need to raise interest rates. The minutes of the meeting said: ""The longer those uncertainties persisted, particularly in an environment of weaker global growth, the more likely it was that demand growth would remain below potential."" However, policymakers repeated that more clarity that the economy was heading towards a Brexit deal meant that increases in interest rates would be needed over the next three years. The Bank of England, like many of us, is on hold, and in a Brexit holding pattern too. Although there is no change in the Bank of England's interest rate decision, marking out the UK from its counterparts in the US and eurozone, there are interesting Brexit developments in September's deliberations of the Monetary Policy Committee. For the first time, the Bank has felt the need to signal a direction of travel for interest rates in the now plausible scenario of ""political events"" leading to ""a further period of entrenched uncertainty"" about Brexit. The committee concluded that the longer that uncertainty continues, particularly against a background of a weak global economy, the more likely that growth, and also inflation will slow. The implication of these minutes being that UK base rates would also remain lower for longer. It has until now signalled that rates are likely to rise gradually back from its post-crisis lows only if there was a ""smooth Brexit"", a deal with a transition. Or else under no-deal, amid exchange rate falls, inflation rises and slower economy, there could be either cuts or rises. Policymakers said the US China trade war had intensified over the summer, which would continue to weigh on overall growth. Manufacturing output continued to be weak, and while policymakers said the direct economic impact of ongoing trade tensions was likely to be ""relatively small"", they said the trade war was ""having a material negative impact on global business investment growth"". They did not say how the recent attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil supply would affect inflation except to say that prices had risen sharply following the attacks.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""I don't want to exaggerate Brexit progress"" Confidential documents that ""reflect the ideas the UK has put forward"" on Brexit have been shared with the EU, the UK government has said. Ministers will table ""formal written solutions when we are ready"" and not to an ""artificial deadline"", it added. Boris Johnson said he did not want to ""exaggerate progress"" of negotiations, but some was being made. It comes after Finland's prime minister said that Mr Johnson had 12 days to set out his Brexit plans to the EU. But a government source said the development was not in response to the remarks. Meanwhile, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has told Sky News that talks earlier this week with Mr Johnson were ""rather positive"" and that a deal could be reached in the next few weeks. Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said he will try to get a deal with Mr Johnson when they meet at a UN summit in New York next week. But his deputy, Simon Coveney, said there was ""still a big gap"" between what the UK government wanted and what Ireland and the EU needed, in terms of getting a deal. Kuenssberg: What happens next if the PM gets a Brexit deal? UK 'has 12 days to set out Brexit plans' Brexit talks 'should not be a pretence' - Barnier The commission said it had received documents from the UK government and technical talks were taking place. Chief spokesperson Mina Andreeva also confirmed there would be talks at a political level at a meeting on Friday between the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, and Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay. The technical discussions were on some aspects of rules relating to customs and manufactured goods, as well as sanitary rules and phytosanitary rules - which relate to the health of plants - she said. The BBC also understands ""live discussions"" are taking place between the EU and UK about ruling out another delay to Brexit if a deal is agreed. Sources told BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg that, if a plan is signed off by both sides, the EU could then announce it would not grant an extension to 31 October deadline if MPs voted the deal down - essentially giving them a choice between the negotiated deal or a no-deal Brexit. Other sources on the EU and UK sides played down the possibility, denying there had been any formal consideration of the proposal and saying the current focus was on getting a deal. But Laura Kuenssberg said: ""It's clear that government officials are considering ways of sticking to the prime minister's October deadline, with, or without a deal being reached."" Mr Johnson has said he wants to leave the EU, preferably with a deal, on 31 October and has urged the EU to scrap the backstop in the withdrawal agreement reached by predecessor Theresa May. The backstop is the controversial policy aimed at preventing the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland and it was a key sticking point in Mrs May's attempts to get Parliament to back her plan. The EU has asked for alternative suggestions and had criticised the UK for not putting any plans in writing. Mr Juncker told Sky News that the EU did not ""need the backstop"" if all its objectives for the Irish border were met. He added that ""if the results are there, I don't care about the instruments"". Finnish PM Antti Rinne (left) says he and French President Emmanuel Macron (right) agreed the new deadline for Boris Johnson Mr Johnson said: ""I don't want to exaggerate the progress that we are making, but we are making progress."" He said the UK needed to leave in a way that allowed it to ""do things differently"" and ""not remain under the control of the EU in terms of laws and trade policy"". But he also reiterated the need to ensure no hard border returned to Northern Ireland, and the Good Friday Agreement was protected. ""We think we can do that,"" said the PM. ""We think we can solve that problem and I think we are making some progress."" He added: ""Let's see where we get. It is vital whatever happens that we prepare for no-deal and we will be ready for no-deal on 31 October. We have got to do both things at once."" Could the Supreme Court overrule the government? Could MPs return to Parliament? Parliament suspended 'to stop MPs interfering' Earlier, Mr Rinne said he and French President Emmanuel Macron agreed the UK needed to produce the proposals in writing by the end of September, adding if not, ""then it's over"". Finland currently holds the EU's rotating presidency. A French government official said the deadline was ""not at all a new proposal"" and added: ""If we don't get the proposals before the end of September, we will not have enough time to discuss them before the summit in October."" The sending of the documents to the EU comes as the legal battle over the suspension of the UK Parliament is in its third day at the UK's Supreme Court. The UK government is arguing the decision to prorogue Parliament was a political matter and not for the courts to ""design a set of rules"" around it. But campaigners say the move was used ""for an improper purpose"" - to stop MPs scrutinising Mr Johnson's plans in the run up to Brexit on 31 October. The prime minister prorogued Parliament earlier this month for five weeks, with MPs not scheduled to return until 14 October.

"Jason Lawrance got a woman pregnant after telling her he had undergone a vasectomy A man found guilty of rape after lying about having had a vasectomy is appealing against the convictions. Jason Lawrance's convictions were thought to be the first of their kind and could have wider implications for others who deceive sexual partners. A woman had consented to having sex with Lawrance, but a jury found the consent she gave was negated because he deceived her with his vasectomy lie. Now his legal team is challenging that decision. The vasectomy lie convictions were overshadowed by the fact Lawrance is a serial rapist who has attacked numerous women. His legal team will only be appealing against the convictions in relation to Lawrance's vasectomy deceit, and not his other offences. Shaun Draycott, his solicitor, said: ""Following the convictions recorded in this case, an application for leave to appeal has been lodged with the Court of Appeal and there is optimism with regard to its prospect of success. ""If these convictions are upheld on appeal, the concern is that members of the public, both male and female, who have never been considered criminals in the eyes of the law will be at risk of prosecution for serious sexual offences."" The woman Lawrance deceived became pregnant, despite taking emergency contraception, then had an abortion. This video can not be played Convicted rapist Lawrance was a keen amateur boxer Jason Lawrance, originally from Leicestershire, wasgiven a life sentence in 2016for raping five women, attempting to rape one woman, and sexually assaulting another. The assaults took place between June 2011 and November 2014 in Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire and Cambridgeshire.

"Jason Lawrance got a woman pregnant after telling her he had undergone a vasectomy A man found guilty of rape after lying about having had a vasectomy is appealing against the convictions. Jason Lawrance's convictions were thought to be the first of their kind and could have wider implications for others who deceive sexual partners. A woman had consented to having sex with Lawrance, but a jury found the consent she gave was negated because he deceived her with his vasectomy lie. Now his legal team is challenging that decision. The vasectomy lie convictions were overshadowed by the fact Lawrance is a serial rapist who has attacked numerous women. His legal team will only be appealing against the convictions in relation to Lawrance's vasectomy deceit, and not his other offences. Shaun Draycott, his solicitor, said: ""Following the convictions recorded in this case, an application for leave to appeal has been lodged with the Court of Appeal and there is optimism with regard to its prospect of success. ""If these convictions are upheld on appeal, the concern is that members of the public, both male and female, who have never been considered criminals in the eyes of the law will be at risk of prosecution for serious sexual offences.""

"Early evidence of the effects of MUP suggest it is helping cut alcohol-related deaths in Glasgow A charity has called for Scotland's minimum unit pricing policy for alcohol (MUP) to be rolled out across the UK. It followed the publication of evidence suggesting MUP has had a significant impact on drinking patterns. Data presented at a conference in Glasgow suggested alcohol-related deaths in the city had fallen by 21.5%. The policy was introduced in May 2018, but organisers said there was already an indication it was working - and should be more widely applied. The research was presented at the British Association for the Study of the Liver (BASL) conference in Glasgow and was based on unpublished data from the city's Alcohol and Drugs Partnership (ADP). The British Liver Trust said although the results came very soon after the law was introduced and the long term impact was still being studied, they nonetheless had important implications for MUP in England and the rest of the UK. Scotland was the first country in the world to implement a minimum unit price for alcohol, following a 10-year campaign by health bodies. It means licensed premises in Scotland cannot sell alcohol below a price which depends on the amount of alcohol contained in the product. It is currently set at 50p per unit of alcohol. New drink laws 'implemented effectively' Has new alcohol law changed drinking habits? Dr Ewan Forrest who presented the results of the research at the conference said there had been a 21.5% reduction in alcohol-related deaths in Glasgow from 2017 to 2018  - from 186, down to 146. Almost half (44%) the deaths in 2018 occurred before May when MUP was introduced. Dr Forrest said: ""Glasgow has always had much higher levels of alcohol-related deaths than other parts of Scotland. ""This latest information suggests that MUP may be reducing alcohol-related harm in those at highest risk. ""More time is needed to assess the effect of MUP on the rest of Scotland and to get a clearer idea as to how MUP might affect the rest of the UK."" The data from the ADP suggested the reduction in the number of alcohol-related deaths had been most marked in the most deprived areas of the city where the behaviour of consumers was more price-sensitive. MUP targeted high-strength cheap ciders and spirits which saw steep price rises. The British Liver Trust, which campaigned for MUP, has launched a ""Love your liver"" road show which offers people a free screening test Prof Matthew Cramp, president of BASL, said: ""This early evidence suggests that implementing MUP does exactly what it is supposed to - it is a highly targeted measure that improves the health of the heaviest drinkers and those experiencing the most harm from alcohol whilst those who drink in moderation continue much as before."" Pamela Healy, chief executive of the British Liver Trust which campaigned for the introduction of MUP said: ""We are facing a liver disease epidemic in the UK and a major reason for this is that as a nation we are drinking too much alcohol. ""There is good evidence that interventions such as minimum unit pricing (MUP), targeted taxes and marketing regulations reduce alcohol harm. ""Alcohol taxes have been cut repeatedly in real terms. The government needs to look carefully at the outcomes from Scotland on MUP so that more lives can be saved.""

"High concentrations of substandard care homes in some areas leave families with no choice but to accept an under-performing home for older and disabled relatives, an analysis suggests. Over a third of beds were in settings rated as not good enough in a sixth of areas, the think tank IPPR found. In two places - Newham in London and Manchester - at least half were. Campaigners said high concentrations of substandard care would mean that good homes would be over-subscribed. What's happened to the social care plan? 'I'll be broke if I live to 100' NHS care funding a 'postcode lottery' In each local authority area the IPPR, which worked with research group Future Care Capital, mapped the proportion of care home places rated as inadequate or requiring improvement by the Care Quality Commission. Overall, 23% of the 456,000 beds were in settings that fell into one of the two categories. But in some places the concentrations were so high that half or more of beds were in under-performing homes. The London borough of Newham had the highest concentration - more than 60% of beds were in homes judged not good enough. This was followed by Manchester on 50%. Overall, 26 local authorities had more than a third of beds in sub-standard settings. By comparison, Southampton, Windsor and Maidenhead, Peterborough and Kingston, in London, all had less than 5% of beds in homes judged not good enough. Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, said the situation was ""unacceptable"" and left some people with ""no choice"" but to accept sub-standard care homes because good homes would be over-subscribed. ""The sad truth is that following years of underfunding and neglect, the social care system has now more or less completely broken down in some parts of the country,"" she said. The IPPR agreed it was a sign of a failing market. The think tank said costs had been cut in the care sector, and urged the government to take action by investing and reforming social care. It wants to see tax rises to provide free personal care for all and to help expand the number of beds by up to 75,000, arguing the state could be more involved in running services. Care companies have complained over recent years they have been squeezed by the low fees paid by councils, which fund most care home places. The system is means-tested for over-65s, which means there are large numbers of self-funders. The government said its plans to reform the system would be published in ""due course"" and pointed out it had announced an extra Â£1.5bn for the sector for 2020-21 in the recent spending round. ""We expect everyone to be able to access high quality, safe and compassionate care,"" a Department of Health and Social Care spokesman added.

"This video can not be played Counts and celebrations: How the night unfolded Scotland has voted to stay in the United Kingdom after voters decisively rejected independence. With the results in from all 32 council areas, the ""No"" side won with 2,001,926 votes over 1,617,989 for ""Yes"". Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond called for unity and urged the unionist parties to deliver on more powers. Prime Minister David Cameron said he was delighted the UK would remain together and that commitments on extra powers would be honoured ""in full"". Mr Cameron said the three main unionist parties at Westminster would now follow through with their pledge of more powers for the Scottish Parliament. He announced thatLord Smith of Kelvin, who led Glasgow's staging of the Commonwealth Games, would oversee the process to take forward the commitments, with new powers over tax, spending and welfare to be agreed by November, and draft legislation published by January. Scottish referendum results in detail The prime minister also acknowledged that the people of England, Wales and Northern Ireland must have a bigger say over their affairs. And he promised a solution to the West Lothian question - the fact that Scottish MPs can vote on English issues at Westminster, and not the other way round. In other developments: US President Barack Obama welcomed Scots' decision to stay in the UK. ""Through debate, discussion, and passionate yet peaceful deliberations, they reminded the world of Scotland's enormous contributions to the UK and the world,"" he said. Police Scotland said Thursday's vote ""passed off smoothly"" with just six arrests across the country mainly for alleged breaches of the peace and assaults. Share prices roseas Scotland voted against independence. Polling officialssaid they were investigating10 cases of suspected electoral fraud at polling stations in Glasgow. Royal Bank of Scotland said it would keep its headquarters in Scotland following the ""No"" vote. Wales's First Minister Carwyn Joneshas called for more funding for his country after Scotland voted to stay in the Union. Northern Ireland First Minister Peter Robinsonsaid a vote on the future of Northern Ireland's border was not necessary following Scotland's 'No' vote. Scotland rejected independence by 55% to 45%. For latest results and full coverage, go tobbc.co.uk/scotland-decides. The result became a mathematical certainty at 06:08, as the returning officer in Fife announced a comfortable No vote. Shortly afterwards, Mr Salmond said he accepted the defeat and called for national unity. He told supporters: ""The unionist parties made vows late in the campaign to devolve more powers to Scotland. ""Scotland will expect these to be honoured in rapid course - as a reminder, we have been promised a second reading of a Scotland Bill by March 27 next year. This video can not be played The moment the No side won an unassailable lead over the Yes camp And the first minister said: ""Whatever else we can say about this referendum campaign, we have touched sections of the community who have never before been touched by politics, these sections of the community have touched us and touched the political process."" In a rallying call to his supporters, Mr Salmond urged the Yes voters to reflect on how far they had come.""I don't think any of us, whenever we entered politics, would have thought such a thing to be either credible or possible,"" he said. He also claimed the campaign had put ""a scare and a fear of enormous proportions"" at the heart of the Westminster establishment. ""Today of all days as we bring Scotland together, let us not dwell on the distance we have fallen short, let us dwell on the distance we have travelled and have confidence the movement is abroad in Scotland that will take this nation forward,"" he added. This video can not be played Alex Salmond and David Cameron react to the result Edinburgh ""Yes"" supporters gutted Glasgow ""No"" supporters party at dawn Scotland vote: The world reacts Key figures give their reaction The morning after the No before The margin of victory for the Better Together campaign - 55% to 45% - was greater by about 3% than that anticipated by the final opinion polls. The winning total needed was 1,852,828. Speaking in Downing Street, Mr Cameron said the result was decisive. He said: ""Now the debate has been settled for a generation, or as Alex Salmond has said: 'Perhaps for a lifetime'. ""So there can be no disputes, no re-runs; we have heard the will of the Scottish people."" The prime minister also spoke of the implications for the other nations of the UK.

What does ""No"" vote mean for England? How the No side won The Union stays - but what has it meant for 300 years? Go to the BBC'sScotland Decides pagefor more details ""In Wales there are proposals to give the Welsh Government and Assembly more powers and I want Wales to be at the heart of the debate on how to make the United Kingdom work for all our nations,"" he said. ""In Northern Ireland, we must work to ensure that the devolved institutions function effectively."" Mr Cameron said ""millions of voices of England must also be heard"". ""The question of English votes for English laws, the so-called West Lothian question, requires a decisive answer so just as Scotland will vote separately in the Scottish Parliament on their issues on tax, spending and welfare, so too England as well as Wales and Northern Ireland should be able to vote on these issues. ""And all this must take place in tandem with and at the same pace as the settlement for Scotland."" Analysis by Andrew Marr, author and BBC presenter What started as a vote on whether Scotland would leave the UK has ended with an extraordinary constitutional revolution announced outside Downing Street by the Prime Minister. It throws down the gauntlet to the Labour Party, and hints that we are going to see very big change coming and it had better come quickly. We always used to be told that if you laid all the economists in the world end to end they still wouldn't reach a conclusion and I think that could be said often about parliamentary committees and inquiries and commissions. Well, it can't happen this time because it's not taking place in a sealed room with the Westminster parties, the old smug consensus, getting round an argument with each other as before. This is really taking place in a huge glass house, being watched by all the Scottish voters and by millions of people around the UK. What the Scottish shock has done is produce a constitutional revolution on a very, very tight timetable. Possibly the most exciting political story in my lifetime. Following his appointment by the prime minister, Lord Smith of Kelvin said he had begun work to oversee the process of delivering more powers for the Scottish Parliament. He said: ""There is an appetite for change and a strengthening of the powers for the Scottish Parliament. This is backed by all the main political parties. ""My role is to create a process through which we can channel that energy into real action. ""This won't be a drawn out process; I have started work today and will present what I hope will be unifying recommendations on 30th November."" Lord Kelvin said there would be an opportunity for ""everyone to have their say"". He promised to engage with all political parties, trade unions, businesses or voluntary organisations and listen to ""ideas and thoughts"" from ordinary people. No supporters celebrate after their decisive victory A man walks past a discarded ""Yes"" campaign paper hat on the Royal Mile ain Edinburgh Alistair Darling, who led the Better Together campaign, said the people of Scotland had ""chosen unity over division and positive change rather than needless separation"". ""It is a momentous result for Scotland and also for the United Kingdom as a whole,"" he said. Mr Darling said the result had ""reaffirmed all that we have in common and the bonds that tie us together"", adding: ""Let them never be broken."" ""As we celebrate, let us also listen,"" he said. Pro-independence supporters console one another in Edinburgh ""No"" campaigners were jubilant as the scale of the result became known Many ""Yes"" supporters were visibly upset by the result Across Scotland, the ""No"" vote had a majority in 28 of the country's 32 local authority areas. Dundee was the first area to back independence. On a turnout of 78.8%, ""Yes"" polled 53,620 votes to the ""No"" campaign's 39,880. The other three areas were all clustered in Labour's traditional west of Scotland heartland. Glasgow, Scotland's largest council area and the third largest city in Britain, voted in favour of independence by 194,779 to 169,347, although turnout was lower than in other areas at 75%. West Dunbartonshire also gave its backing to independence, voting 54% to 46% in favour, with North Lanarkshire completing the ""Yes"" quartet by 51% to 49%. In Scotland's 28 other local authority areas, it was a night of huge disappointment for the pro-independence movement. Hoped-for breakthroughs in other traditional Labour strongholds such as South Lanarkshire, Inverclyde and across Ayrshire never materialised. Edinburgh, the nation's capital, clearly rejected independence by 194,638 to 123,927 votes, while Aberdeen City voted ""No"" by a margin of more than 20,000 votes. Royal correspondent Nick Witchell at Balmoral Balmoral seems very remote and cut off but of course the Royal Family has been following this minutely. Reaction - one word, relief. Relief that's it's over, relief that Scotland has decided what it has. The Queen undoubtedly, privately would have felt immense sadness had the United Kingdom been split up. Relief too for her officials who had been starting to contemplate some very tricky constitutional issues. Once all the politicians have said what they wish to say, I think this afternoon it is expected that the Queen will issue a short written statement. It seems logical to surmise that after this really quite divisive campaign she will concentrate on the vote, the decision that Scotland has taken, and express the hope that Scotland will now move on.

"This video can not be played Former PM David Cameron explains how he sought the Queen's help in Scottish independence vote Former PM David Cameron has revealed he asked whether the Queen could ""raise an eyebrow"" about the prospect of Scotland voting for independence. He told the BBC he sought help from royal officials days before the 2014 vote amid ""mounting panic"" he may lose. What was discussed was not ""anything that would be in any way improper... but just a raising of the eyebrow even... a quarter of an inch"", he said. The Queen laterurged people to ""think very carefully about the future"". The comments - made to a well-wisher outside a church on the Balmoral estate - were one of the main talking points of the referendum campaign. Reflecting on his rise to power and six years in Downing Street in a two-part BBC documentary, Mr Cameron said the Queen's words on the issue were ""very limited but helped to put a slightly different perception on things"". Forget Brexit - what else does Cameron's book tell us? Cameron: Johnson and Gove behaved 'appallingly' PM apology to Queen for 'purr' claim Scotland went on to reject independence by a margin of 55.3% to 44.7%, a result which Mr Cameron said left him ""blissfully happy"". In a statement, Alex Salmond, who resigned as Scotland's first minister in the wake of the result, said Mr Cameron's actions were not only improper, but showed how desperate the No side was during the final stages of the independence campaign. This video can not be played Former PM David Cameron criticises Boris Johnson's motives for supporting Leave campaign The Cameron Years, which begins on Thursday, examines Mr Cameron's modernisation of the party, his decision to enter a coalition with the Liberal Democrats after the 2010 election and the fallout from 2016 Brexit referendum, which led to his resignation. In it, he says: He ""broods"" every day about the Brexit referendum and its consequences He ignored George Osborne's advice against the poll and Michael Gove's reservations Boris Johnson ""agonised"" over his position and ""did not really want to leave"" the EU He still believes Brexit can ""be delivered and made to work"" His government's austerity programme was ""painful"" but necessary Legalising gay marriage was perhaps his ""proudest"" achievement in office On the EU referendum, Mr Cameron told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he ""wasn't the slightest bit complacent"" during the campaign, saying that he fought ""with every fibre of my being"". But he said the Labour leadership during the campaign ""simply wasn't there, wasn't committed"" and it was ""very hard to fight these things on your own"". He added that the result would ""probably have been even worse"" if people knew he would quit if Leave won the vote. Just as the first rule of Fight Club is that you do not talk about Fight Club, the first rule of the relationship between the prime minister and the Queen is that you never, ever talk about the relationship between the PM and the Queen. It is difficult to imagine anything other than horror in the Palace at David Cameron's revelations. Not just because he has broken the first rule. But because he has made it painfully clear that in 2014 he used the Queen for his own political purposes. And that she and her advisors thought that was OK. The revelation comes as her suspension of Parliament - a suspension made on the effective instruction of Boris Johnson - comes under unprecedented scrutiny in the Supreme Court. The two cases are very different; but they both highlight the dark greys of the Queen's constitutional position, the discretion she has or lacks, under extraordinary circumstances, to speak out and act. In the run-up to the 18 September poll on Scottish independence, it was reported that the Queen was concerned about the possibility of Scotland opting to sever the 300-year union with England and Wales. A Sunday Times poll on 7 September putting the Yes campaign ahead contributed to a ""mounting sense of panic"" in Downing Street, Mr Cameron recalls. The poll, which was published while he and his wife, Samantha, were staying at Balmoral, ""hit me like a blow to the solar plexus"". A poll finding the Yes campaign in front contributed to a ""mounting sense of panic"" in Downing Street Mr Cameron - who agreed to hold the independence referendum in the face of opposition within his party - said there followed urgent conversations between advisers in Downing Street and Buckingham Palace to figure out how the Queen could comment while still remaining within the constitutional boundaries of neutrality. ""I remember conversations I had with my private secretary and he had with the Queen's private secretary and I had with the Queen's private secretary, not asking for anything that would be in any way improper or unconstitutional but just a raising of the eyebrow even, you know, a quarter of an inch. We thought would make a difference."" Buckingham Palace insisted that the Queen was above politics When asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme for more detail about what had happened, Mr Cameron said he ""didn't want to say anything more about this"". ""I'm sure that some people would think, possibly even me, that I've already said perhaps a little bit too much,"" he said. At the time, the BBC's royal correspondent said the Queen's words were ""more of an observation than an intervention"", while Buckingham Palace said any suggestion the Queen was seeking to influence the outcome of the referendum was ""categorically wrong"". Officials insisted the monarch was above politics, and the issue of Scotland's future was a matter for the people. Two weeks after the Scottish referendum, Mr Cameron was forced to apologise after suggesting the Queen ""purred down the phone"" when she was told about the No result. While he feels ""sorry"" about events since the 2016 Brexit vote, Mr Cameron said he did not regret the decision to hold the EU referendum. While some people would ""never forgive"" him, he maintained the UK's 40-year membership was becoming ""unstable"" and the duty of leaders was to ""see difficulties coming and try to resolve them and shape the country's response to them"". He accepted he ""totally underestimated the latent Leave gene"" in his party and that during the campaign while ""he had a winning hand, he could not seem to play it"". After losing the vote, Mr Cameron said he knew he had to quit because he did not have the ""credibility to deliver Brexit"", but was ""desperately sad"" his time in office was cut short. Mr Cameron said the coalition government staved off a financial crisis ""I think of all the things we could and should have done if we had been able... to win the referendum,"" he recalls. ""A whole lot of what we could have done effectively ran into the sand of the European issue."" On his economic and social record, he rejects as ""total nonsense"" opponents' claims that he embraced deep spending cuts as a political choice to reduce the size of the state. He says the multi-billion pound budget deficit inherited by his government in 2010 was a ""clear and present danger to the British economy"" requiring immediate action. ""In the end there were difficult and painful decisions, but inequality fell and the share of income tax paid by the richest went up, not down,"" he argued. ""We protected pensioners, we protected the NHS, we protected help for the poorest."" Mr Cameron's long-awaited memoirs, entitled For The Record, was published on Thursday. In excerpts published by the Times last week, he accused Boris Johnson and Michael Gove of behaving ""appallingly"" during the Brexit referendum.

"Scottish government forced to reverse named person policy after panel of experts say it is unworkable Education Secretary says 'we will withdraw our bill and repeal the relevant legislation' Tories call for apology over one of the 'most deeply unpopular and illiberal policies of modern times' This move is the 'mother and father of humiliating U-turns' says Labour Louise Wilson and Craig Hutchison Education Secretary John Swinney That's all from Holyrood Live on Thursday 19 September 2019. Education Secretary John Swinney confirmed the controversial plan to appoint a named person to safeguard the welfare of every child in the country is to be scrapped. The scheme, which was branded a ""snooper's charter"" by opponents, was due to be introduced three years ago. But it was delayed when the Supreme Court ruled thatpart of the plan breached Human Rights laws. Scottish Conservative education spokesperson Liz Smith called for an apology over ""one of the most deeply unpopular and illiberal policies of modern times"". Her counterpart in Scottish Labour, Iain Gray, called the announcement the ""mother and father of humiliating U-turns"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Green MSP Andy Wightman says today's debate is not a new one, arguing the current practice is based on an ""outdated 2008 order"". The committee's proposal is not about this government, or the last one, or any individual minister he states. It is about who gets what statistics, how much of it and who authorises it, he adds. Mr Wightman says the committee's proposal does not even go as far as what experts are saying, insisting no member or minister should have an issue with supporting it if they believe in good governance and transparency. Labour MSP Rhoda Grant says pre-release access allows the government to spin statistics to its advantage. She insists government comment released alongside statistics ""puts a gloss"" on them. Mr Grant says having different interpretations of the same statistics on different days undermines public confidence. Having a ""realistic analysis"" of statistics available at the same time they are released would be better, she argues. The Labour MSP points to suggestions that pre-release access should be offered for three hours rather than 24 hours. Tory MSP Dean Lockhart Tory MSP Dean Lockhart says the government was criticised by its own information commissioner last year for secretive and biased responses to FOIs. Mr Lockhart points out the Scottish government continues to get pre-release access giving them 24 hours or more to spin a story around stats no matter how bad they are. For example yesterday's story that Scotland was close to recession was dominated by SNP spin that Brexit was to blame, he suggests. Mr Lockhart adds that is odd considering the rUK economy is growing at twice the rate of Scotland. The Tory MSP says that the committee is being forced to act because the government has not. Public Finance Minister Kate Forbes says pre-release access is the norm, with UK government departments still having it in place. Only the ONS has removed it, she states. The advice of the professionals who produce official statistics is to have tightly controlled pre-release access, she insists. Ms Forbes says pre-release access does not give Scottish ministers an advantage but rather enables people with responsibilities to talk about the issues with understanding and in depth. Everybody has access to statistics as soon as they are published, she adds. The committee wants parliament to get the statistics at the same time as Derek Mackay The Economy, Energy and Fair Work Committee is seeking to table legislation to cut early access ministers have to economic data. Under current rules, the Scottish government can get ""pre-release access"" to certain official statistics. But the majority of MSPs on the committee argued that everyone should have equal access to GDP and retail data, and is putting forward a bill to this end. The committee is calling for backing of the proposal of a committee bill contained in thePre-release Access â Committee Bill proposal report,external. The report made 29 recommendations for improvements to Scotlandâs economic data, the majority of which were accepted. It argues economic statistics should be a public asset, an aid to understanding those political and macro-economic decisions that affect us all, and as such ought to be available when published on an equal and not a privileged basis. Economy Committee convener Gordon Lindhurst Economy committee convener Gordon Lindhurst tells the chamber the majority view of the committee was to stop economic data going to the Scottish government ahead of the parliament. Mr Lindhurst asks why not end pre-release access (PRA) to statistics. He says even those who were not in the majority wanted changes to PRA. Mr Lindhurst pivots to the committee bill citing three strands: The economy committee is now calling for an end to the Scottish government getting early access to economic data. A report from the committee concluded suchdata should be accessible to all- and MSPs are seeking approval to bring forward a bill to this end. It has drawn up legislation - the first committee bill at Holyrood for several years - to remove pre-release access entirely for GDP and retail sales statistics, and to cut the time limit on other releases to 24 hours. The committee's four SNP MSPs did not agree with the group's decision, and Finance Secretary Derek Mackay has argued that early access to figures is ""essential"" for ministers coming up with policy responses.

The Scottish government has been forced to reverse one of its flagship policies on young people after a panel of experts said it was unworkable. The named person scheme was supposed to identify a teacher or other professional for every child in Scotland as a point of contact to help and support them. However critics argued that it was an unnecessary intrusion into family life. And in 2016, the Supreme Court ruled that the Scottish government did not have the powers to share information about young people which the service required. Education Secretary John Swinney has just told MSPs that local named-person schemes would continue but the legislation to enforce it was being withdrawn. Conservative MSP Liz Smith said it was one of the most deeply unpopular and illiberal policies of modern times and called for an apology. This was echoed by Labour's Iain Gray, who called it the ""mother and father of humiliating u-turns"". Lib Dem MSP Alex Cole-Hamilton says this has wasted years of time and good will of people within the sector. He asks about the costs - in terms of legal bills and workforce hours - of the policy. Mr Swinney says the government faced legal costs at the Court of Session and the Supreme Court, but adds this was reasonable in order to defend legislation backed by this parliament. The cost of the development panel was less than Â£10,000 because much of the time was given freely, he adds. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Green MSP Ross Greer Green MSP Ross Greer says this announcement completely vindicates the education committee's decision not to proceed with this bill. The named person policy has been devastated by the bungling of this government, he adds. Mr Greer asks what the cabinet secretary has to say to those already working as named persons across the country. Mr Swinney says he hopes they will take from his statement the support from the government for their work. The deputy first minister thanks those professionals for their work and encourages them to take forward the good practice they've developed. Allow Twitter content?

"Ryanair's group chief executive Michael O'Leary Nearly half of Ryanair's shareholders voted against a pay deal for Michael O'Leary that could hand the chief executive â¬99m (Â£88m). The Irish airline said that just 50.5% of investors voted in favour of the company's remuneration report. The revolt comes at a difficult time for Ryanair which is facing more strike action from pilots and is cutting jobs. Following the vote, a spokesman said it would consult with its investors. He said: ""Ryanair is, and will continue, to consult with its shareholders and we will report back to them over the coming year on how the board will adapt its decision-making to reflect their advice and input on all these topics."" Earlier this year, Mr O'Leary signed a new contract to stay on as chief executive until 2024. Under the deal he stands to make â¬99m from stock options if he doubles Ryanair's profit or share price. Ryanair pilots vote for further strikes Ryanair rated 'greedy and arrogant' by customers Michael O'Leary: Ryanair's outspoken boss In the last financial year, however, the airline's profit dropped sharply and Mr O'Leary said on Thursday that he was planning to cut between 500 and 700 jobs. Ryanair said Mr O'Leary's agreement to stay for another five years ""gives certainty to our shareholders"". It also noted that his remuneration is ""considerably lower than many other European airline chief executives"". However, a sizeable number of the airline's shareholders voted against the company's remuneration report at its annual general meeting (AGM) on Thursday. Pilots are planning more walkouts this month in a row over pay and conditions. The pilots' union Balpa said its members want the same kind of agreements that exist in other airlines on pensions, loss of licence insurance, maternity benefits allowances and pay. Ryanair branded earlier strikes as ""pointless"" as industrial action had not resulted in any flight cancellations. Under his new deal, Mr O'Leary's pay and the maximum annual bonus have both been cut in half to â¬500,000. He was also granted 10 million share options. These are shares he can acquire for â¬11.12 and then sell at the market price if Ryanair's profits hit â¬2bn in any year up to 2024 or its share price reaches â¬21 for a period of 28 days from April next year. He would then pocket the difference. The company's shares are currently trading at â¬9.84. Pre-tax profit dropped to â¬948m in the year to 31 March compared to â¬1.6bn in the previous 12 months.

"This video can not be played Former PM David Cameron explains how he sought the Queen's help in Scottish independence vote Former PM David Cameron has revealed he asked whether the Queen could ""raise an eyebrow"" about the prospect of Scotland voting for independence. He told the BBC he sought help from royal officials days before the 2014 vote amid ""mounting panic"" he may lose. What was discussed was not ""anything that would be in any way improper... but just a raising of the eyebrow even... a quarter of an inch"", he said. The Queen laterurged people to ""think very carefully about the future"". The comments - made to a well-wisher outside a church on the Balmoral estate - were one of the main talking points of the referendum campaign. Reflecting on his rise to power and six years in Downing Street in a two-part BBC documentary, Mr Cameron said the Queen's words on the issue were ""very limited but helped to put a slightly different perception on things"". Forget Brexit - what else does Cameron's book tell us? Cameron: Johnson and Gove behaved 'appallingly' PM apology to Queen for 'purr' claim Scotland went on to reject independence by a margin of 55.3% to 44.7%, a result which Mr Cameron said left him ""blissfully happy"". In a statement, Alex Salmond, who resigned as Scotland's first minister in the wake of the result, said Mr Cameron's actions were not only improper, but showed how desperate the No side was during the final stages of the independence campaign. This video can not be played Former PM David Cameron criticises Boris Johnson's motives for supporting Leave campaign The Cameron Years, which begins on Thursday, examines Mr Cameron's modernisation of the party, his decision to enter a coalition with the Liberal Democrats after the 2010 election and the fallout from 2016 Brexit referendum, which led to his resignation. In it, he says: He ""broods"" every day about the Brexit referendum and its consequences He ignored George Osborne's advice against the poll and Michael Gove's reservations Boris Johnson ""agonised"" over his position and ""did not really want to leave"" the EU He still believes Brexit can ""be delivered and made to work"" His government's austerity programme was ""painful"" but necessary Legalising gay marriage was perhaps his ""proudest"" achievement in office On the EU referendum, Mr Cameron told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he ""wasn't the slightest bit complacent"" during the campaign, saying that he fought ""with every fibre of my being"". But he said the Labour leadership during the campaign ""simply wasn't there, wasn't committed"" and it was ""very hard to fight these things on your own"". He added that the result would ""probably have been even worse"" if people knew he would quit if Leave won the vote. Just as the first rule of Fight Club is that you do not talk about Fight Club, the first rule of the relationship between the prime minister and the Queen is that you never, ever talk about the relationship between the PM and the Queen. It is difficult to imagine anything other than horror in the Palace at David Cameron's revelations. Not just because he has broken the first rule. But because he has made it painfully clear that in 2014 he used the Queen for his own political purposes. And that she and her advisors thought that was OK. The revelation comes as her suspension of Parliament - a suspension made on the effective instruction of Boris Johnson - comes under unprecedented scrutiny in the Supreme Court. The two cases are very different; but they both highlight the dark greys of the Queen's constitutional position, the discretion she has or lacks, under extraordinary circumstances, to speak out and act. In the run-up to the 18 September poll on Scottish independence, it was reported that the Queen was concerned about the possibility of Scotland opting to sever the 300-year union with England and Wales. A Sunday Times poll on 7 September putting the Yes campaign ahead contributed to a ""mounting sense of panic"" in Downing Street, Mr Cameron recalls. The poll, which was published while he and his wife, Samantha, were staying at Balmoral, ""hit me like a blow to the solar plexus"". A poll finding the Yes campaign in front contributed to a ""mounting sense of panic"" in Downing Street Mr Cameron - who agreed to hold the independence referendum in the face of opposition within his party - said there followed urgent conversations between advisers in Downing Street and Buckingham Palace to figure out how the Queen could comment while still remaining within the constitutional boundaries of neutrality. ""I remember conversations I had with my private secretary and he had with the Queen's private secretary and I had with the Queen's private secretary, not asking for anything that would be in any way improper or unconstitutional but just a raising of the eyebrow even, you know, a quarter of an inch. We thought would make a difference."" Buckingham Palace insisted that the Queen was above politics When asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme for more detail about what had happened, Mr Cameron said he ""didn't want to say anything more about this"". ""I'm sure that some people would think, possibly even me, that I've already said perhaps a little bit too much,"" he said. At the time, the BBC's royal correspondent said the Queen's words were ""more of an observation than an intervention"", while Buckingham Palace said any suggestion the Queen was seeking to influence the outcome of the referendum was ""categorically wrong"". Officials insisted the monarch was above politics, and the issue of Scotland's future was a matter for the people. Two weeks after the Scottish referendum, Mr Cameron was forced to apologise after suggesting the Queen ""purred down the phone"" when she was told about the No result. While he feels ""sorry"" about events since the 2016 Brexit vote, Mr Cameron said he did not regret the decision to hold the EU referendum. While some people would ""never forgive"" him, he maintained the UK's 40-year membership was becoming ""unstable"" and the duty of leaders was to ""see difficulties coming and try to resolve them and shape the country's response to them"". He accepted he ""totally underestimated the latent Leave gene"" in his party and that during the campaign while ""he had a winning hand, he could not seem to play it"". After losing the vote, Mr Cameron said he knew he had to quit because he did not have the ""credibility to deliver Brexit"", but was ""desperately sad"" his time in office was cut short. Mr Cameron said the coalition government staved off a financial crisis ""I think of all the things we could and should have done if we had been able... to win the referendum,"" he recalls. ""A whole lot of what we could have done effectively ran into the sand of the European issue."" On his economic and social record, he rejects as ""total nonsense"" opponents' claims that he embraced deep spending cuts as a political choice to reduce the size of the state. He says the multi-billion pound budget deficit inherited by his government in 2010 was a ""clear and present danger to the British economy"" requiring immediate action. ""In the end there were difficult and painful decisions, but inequality fell and the share of income tax paid by the richest went up, not down,"" he argued. ""We protected pensioners, we protected the NHS, we protected help for the poorest."" Mr Cameron's long-awaited memoirs, entitled For The Record, was published on Thursday. In excerpts published by the Times last week, he accused Boris Johnson and Michael Gove of behaving ""appallingly"" during the Brexit referendum.

"Finnish PM Antti Rinne (left) says he and French President Emmanuel Macron (right) agreed the new deadline for Boris Johnson Boris Johnson has 12 days to set out his Brexit plans to the EU, according to Finland's prime minister. Antti Rinne said he and French President Emmanuel Macron agreed the UK needed to produce the proposals in writing by the end of September, adding if not, ""then it's over"". Finland currently holds the EU's rotating presidency. A Downing Street source said: ""We will continue negotiating and put forward proposals at the appropriate time."" Mr Johnson has said a deal is possible at a crucial summit of EU leaders on 17 October, but he has insisted Brexit will happen by the 31 October deadline, even if a deal is not agreed. Brexit talks 'should not be a pretence' - Barnier Brexit solution must recognise NI status - Foster The UK government said talks with the EU have been making progress since Mr Johnson came into No 10 in July. It said it had put forward ""a number of proposals"" as alternatives to the Irish border backstop - the policy aimed at preventing the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland and a key sticking point in former PM Theresa May's Brexit deal. But Mr Johnson has repeatedly refused to reveal details of the proposals in interviews, saying he did not want to negotiate in public. The EU has continued to criticise the UK for not putting any plans in writing. Earlier, the European Commission President, Jean-Claude Juncker, said a meeting with Mr Johnson on Monday had been ""constructive"". But he said until proposals had been put forward, ""I will not be able to tell you, looking you straight in the eye, that any real progress has been achieved"". Johnson attacked by Luxembourg PM over Brexit Politics, not process, will make the difference Mr Rinne spoke to reporters after a meeting with the French president in Paris on Wednesday. He said: ""We both agreed that it is now time for Boris Johnson to produce his own proposals in writing - if they exist. ""If no proposals are received by the end of September, then it's over."" The Finnish PM intends to discuss the new deadline with the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, and Mr Johnson in the coming days, but the position has not yet been agreed with other EU nations. An official at the Elysee said the plan was ""not at all a new proposal"" and added: ""If we don't get the proposals before the end of September, we will not have enough time to discuss them before the summit in October."" Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg insisted the prime minister was on course to deliver a ""fundamentally different"" Brexit deal to ensure the UK leaves on October 31. He told a Telegraph event that to achieve such an outcome the government had to ""listen very carefully to what the DUP says"". DUP Leader Arlene Foster spoke to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce on issues concerning devolution and Brexit On Wednesday, DUP leader Arlene Foster told business leaders in Dublin that she wanted a solution to Brexit thatdoes not affect Northern Ireland's constitutional position. Mrs Foster - whose party's support had until recently given the Conservatives a majority in Parliament - said a Brexit deal ""will not be achieved that involves a backstop - whether it is UK-wide or Northern Ireland specific"". The whole of the UK had to leave the customs union and single market, she said. But she added that the DUP was prepared to ""look at Northern Ireland-specific solutions achieved with the support and consent of the representatives of the people of Northern Ireland"". Protesters outside the UK's Supreme Court in London It comes as the legal battle over the suspension of the UK Parliament is to go into a third day at the Supreme Court later. The UK government is arguing the decision to prorogue Parliament was a political matter and not for the courts to ""design a set of rules"" around it. But campaigners say the move was used ""for an improper purpose"" - to stop MPs scrutinising Mr Johnson's plans in the run up to Brexit on 31 October. The prime minister prorogued Parliament earlier this month for five weeks, with MPs not scheduled to return until 14 October. Mr Rees-Mogg, who travelled to Balmoral to seek the Queen's approval over the move, said it was ""nonsense"" to suggest she was misled over the decision. Second day of legal prorogation battle ends Could the Supreme Court overrule the government? Could MPs return to Parliament?

The Scottish government has been forced to reverse one of its flagship policies on young people after a panel of experts said it was unworkable. The named person scheme was supposed to identify a teacher or other professional for every child in Scotland as a point of contact to help and support them. However critics argued that it was an unnecessary intrusion into family life. And in 2016, the Supreme Court ruled that the Scottish government did not have the powers to share information about young people which the service required. Education Secretary John Swinney has just told MSPs that local named-person schemes would continue but the legislation to enforce it was being withdrawn. Conservative MSP Liz Smith said it was one of the most deeply unpopular and illiberal policies of modern times and called for an apology. This was echoed by Labour's Iain Gray, who called it the ""mother and father of humiliating u-turns"". Lib Dem MSP Alex Cole-Hamilton says this has wasted years of time and good will of people within the sector. He asks about the costs - in terms of legal bills and workforce hours - of the policy. Mr Swinney says the government faced legal costs at the Court of Session and the Supreme Court, but adds this was reasonable in order to defend legislation backed by this parliament. The cost of the development panel was less than Â£10,000 because much of the time was given freely, he adds. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The named person policy has been devastated by the bungling of this government, he adds. Mr Greer asks what the cabinet secretary has to say to those already working as named persons across the country. Mr Swinney says he hopes they will take from his statement the support from the government for their work.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""I don't want to exaggerate Brexit progress"" Confidential documents that ""reflect the ideas the UK has put forward"" on Brexit have been shared with the EU, the UK government has said. Ministers will table ""formal written solutions when we are ready"" and not to an ""artificial deadline"", it added. Boris Johnson said he did not want to ""exaggerate progress"" of negotiations, but some was being made. It comes after Finland's prime minister said that Mr Johnson had 12 days to set out his Brexit plans to the EU. But a government source said the development was not in response to the remarks. Meanwhile, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has told Sky News that talks earlier this week with Mr Johnson were ""rather positive"" and that a deal could be reached in the next few weeks. Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said he will try to get a deal with Mr Johnson when they meet at a UN summit in New York next week. But his deputy, Simon Coveney, said there was ""still a big gap"" between what the UK government wanted and what Ireland and the EU needed, in terms of getting a deal. Kuenssberg: What happens next if the PM gets a Brexit deal? UK 'has 12 days to set out Brexit plans' Brexit talks 'should not be a pretence' - Barnier The commission said it had received documents from the UK government and technical talks were taking place. Chief spokesperson Mina Andreeva also confirmed there would be talks at a political level at a meeting on Friday between the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, and Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay. The technical discussions were on some aspects of rules relating to customs and manufactured goods, as well as sanitary rules and phytosanitary rules - which relate to the health of plants - she said. The BBC also understands ""live discussions"" are taking place between the EU and UK about ruling out another delay to Brexit if a deal is agreed. Sources told BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg that, if a plan is signed off by both sides, the EU could then announce it would not grant an extension to 31 October deadline if MPs voted the deal down - essentially giving them a choice between the negotiated deal or a no-deal Brexit. Other sources on the EU and UK sides played down the possibility, denying there had been any formal consideration of the proposal and saying the current focus was on getting a deal. But Laura Kuenssberg said: ""It's clear that government officials are considering ways of sticking to the prime minister's October deadline, with, or without a deal being reached."" Mr Johnson has said he wants to leave the EU, preferably with a deal, on 31 October and has urged the EU to scrap the backstop in the withdrawal agreement reached by predecessor Theresa May. The backstop is the controversial policy aimed at preventing the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland and it was a key sticking point in Mrs May's attempts to get Parliament to back her plan. The EU has asked for alternative suggestions and had criticised the UK for not putting any plans in writing. Mr Juncker told Sky News that the EU did not ""need the backstop"" if all its objectives for the Irish border were met. He added that ""if the results are there, I don't care about the instruments"". Finnish PM Antti Rinne (left) says he and French President Emmanuel Macron (right) agreed the new deadline for Boris Johnson Mr Johnson said: ""I don't want to exaggerate the progress that we are making, but we are making progress."" He said the UK needed to leave in a way that allowed it to ""do things differently"" and ""not remain under the control of the EU in terms of laws and trade policy"". But he also reiterated the need to ensure no hard border returned to Northern Ireland, and the Good Friday Agreement was protected. ""We think we can do that,"" said the PM. ""We think we can solve that problem and I think we are making some progress."" He added: ""Let's see where we get. It is vital whatever happens that we prepare for no-deal and we will be ready for no-deal on 31 October. We have got to do both things at once."" Could the Supreme Court overrule the government? Could MPs return to Parliament? Parliament suspended 'to stop MPs interfering' Earlier, Mr Rinne said he and French President Emmanuel Macron agreed the UK needed to produce the proposals in writing by the end of September, adding if not, ""then it's over"". Finland currently holds the EU's rotating presidency. A French government official said the deadline was ""not at all a new proposal"" and added: ""If we don't get the proposals before the end of September, we will not have enough time to discuss them before the summit in October."" The sending of the documents to the EU comes as the legal battle over the suspension of the UK Parliament is in its third day at the UK's Supreme Court. The UK government is arguing the decision to prorogue Parliament was a political matter and not for the courts to ""design a set of rules"" around it. But campaigners say the move was used ""for an improper purpose"" - to stop MPs scrutinising Mr Johnson's plans in the run up to Brexit on 31 October. The prime minister prorogued Parliament earlier this month for five weeks, with MPs not scheduled to return until 14 October.

Antti Rinne said he and French President Emmanuel Macron agreed the UK needed to produce the proposals in writing by the end of September, adding if not, ""then it's over"". Finland currently holds the EU's rotating presidency. A Downing Street source said: ""We will continue negotiating and put forward proposals at the appropriate time."" Mr Johnson has said a deal is possible at a crucial summit of EU leaders on 17 October, but he has insisted Brexit will happen by the 31 October deadline, even if a deal is not agreed. Brexit talks 'should not be a pretence' - Barnier Brexit solution must recognise NI status - Foster The UK government said talks with the EU have been making progress since Mr Johnson came into No 10 in July. It said it had put forward ""a number of proposals"" as alternatives to the Irish border backstop - the policy aimed at preventing the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland and a key sticking point in former PM Theresa May's Brexit deal. But Mr Johnson has repeatedly refused to reveal details of the proposals in interviews, saying he did not want to negotiate in public. The EU has continued to criticise the UK for not putting any plans in writing. Earlier, the European Commission President, Jean-Claude Juncker, said a meeting with Mr Johnson on Monday had been ""constructive"". But he said until proposals had been put forward, ""I will not be able to tell you, looking you straight in the eye, that any real progress has been achieved"". Johnson attacked by Luxembourg PM over Brexit Politics, not process, will make the difference Mr Rinne spoke to reporters after a meeting with the French president in Paris on Wednesday. He said: ""We both agreed that it is now time for Boris Johnson to produce his own proposals in writing - if they exist. ""If no proposals are received by the end of September, then it's over."" The Finnish PM intends to discuss the new deadline with the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, and Mr Johnson in the coming days, but the position has not yet been agreed with other EU nations. An official at the Elysee said the plan was ""not at all a new proposal"" and added: ""If we don't get the proposals before the end of September, we will not have enough time to discuss them before the summit in October."" Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg insisted the prime minister was on course to deliver a ""fundamentally different"" Brexit deal to ensure the UK leaves on October 31. He told a Telegraph event that to achieve such an outcome the government had to ""listen very carefully to what the DUP says"". DUP Leader Arlene Foster spoke to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce on issues concerning devolution and Brexit On Wednesday, DUP leader Arlene Foster told business leaders in Dublin that she wanted a solution to Brexit thatdoes not affect Northern Ireland's constitutional position. Mrs Foster - whose party's support had until recently given the Conservatives a majority in Parliament - said a Brexit deal ""will not be achieved that involves a backstop - whether it is UK-wide or Northern Ireland specific"". The whole of the UK had to leave the customs union and single market, she said. But she added that the DUP was prepared to ""look at Northern Ireland-specific solutions achieved with the support and consent of the representatives of the people of Northern Ireland"". Protesters outside the UK's Supreme Court in London It comes as the legal battle over the suspension of the UK Parliament is to go into a third day at the Supreme Court later. The UK government is arguing the decision to prorogue Parliament was a political matter and not for the courts to ""design a set of rules"" around it. But campaigners say the move was used ""for an improper purpose"" - to stop MPs scrutinising Mr Johnson's plans in the run up to Brexit on 31 October. The prime minister prorogued Parliament earlier this month for five weeks, with MPs not scheduled to return until 14 October. Mr Rees-Mogg, who travelled to Balmoral to seek the Queen's approval over the move, said it was ""nonsense"" to suggest she was misled over the decision.

"The report also stated there has been a decrease in the number of on-street sex workers Publicity around a change to Northern Ireland's prostitution laws caused a spike in business, a new report has claimed. Academics carried out a three-year review of the impact of the Human Trafficking and Exploitation Act 2015. The law introduced the ""Nordic model"",which criminalised paying for sexual services in Northern Ireland. Sex workers, consulted for the review, said media discussion at the time publicised the idea of prostitution. First arrest in NI under new sex law 'No prosecutions' for paying for sex in NI Paying for sex to become crime in NI The report said sex workers noted ""a surge in business in the run-up to the legislation and its immediate aftermath and it was suggested that the public debate around Article 64A publicised prostitution to those who had never previously considered it"". Article 64A in the 2015 act related to paying for sex. The Northern Ireland Assembly passed the Human Trafficking and Exploitation Bill in December 2014. The private member's bill was brought before the house by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) peer Lord Morrow. DUP peer Lord Morrow criticised the methodology of the report He criticised the methodology of the report and claimed on Good Morning Ulster that those who compiled it had a ""clear track record on this issue in favour of decriminalisation"". Lord Morrow added that he was ""disappointed in some regard with how the legislation has been implemented"" but that it had led to arrests and convictions ""so the PSNI and PPS (Public Prosecution Service) can build on this in the future"". One of the academics involved in the report, Dr Caoimhe NÃ­ DhÃ³naill, rejected Lord Morrow's criticism, tweeting that his claims were ""unfounded and untrue"" and that they ""simply reported what was found"".

Earlier, she told Good Morning Ulster that ""the demand for sex work is as strong as ever"". ""Now because clients have been criminalised, the clients are putting a lot more pressure on sex workers to put themselves in more risky situations and to move into sexual practices that they wouldn't have done before,"" she said. The report, based on research which examined a period between June 2015 and December 2018, also found an increase in online advertising for prostitution. Looking at a total of 173,460 advertisements, there was a 5% increase in the total number over that period. The report said that worked out at about 308 sex workers advertising each day. The estimated number of sex workers in Northern Ireland increased from 3,351 up to 3,973. The number of sex workers in Northern Ireland increased from 3,351 up to 3,973 The report also examined issues around the safety of sex workers and human trafficking for exploitation. On the basis of the findings, it concluded there was ""no evidence that the offence of purchasing sexual services has produced a downward pressure on the demand for, or supply of, sexual services"". Responding to the report, the Sex Workers Alliance Ireland (SWAI) said it showed current legislation is ""not fit for purpose"". ""Sex workers in Ireland tend to work both jurisdictions so a lot of the findings in this report will be applicable to the Republic of Ireland,"" said Kate McGrew, current sex worker and spokesperson for the SWAI. ""If the purpose of the law was to decrease demand it has failed. ""If the purpose of the law was to help sex workers it has failed."" The report said the legislation had little effect on the supply or demand for sexual services The report said the ""tailing off"" in demand, which had been expected, has not happened. Rather, the legislation ""has had little effect on the supply or demand for sexual services"". On the issue of safety, the report states serious crimes against sex workers are ""comparatively rare"". However, information gathered from a website used by sex workers to report instances of abuse showed increases in the number of reports it had received of assaults, sexual assaults, and threatening behaviour. The report also stated there has been a decrease in the number of on-street sex workers, falling from about 20 operating in Northern Ireland in 2014, down to less than 10 currently. In 2014, ahead of the law change, baseline research was carried out by the Department of Justice to give a point of comparison. A requirement was built into it at the time for a review to be carried out after three years. ""The evidence from Northern Ireland based on a comparison of the before and after data suggests very strongly that Article 64A has had minimal to no effect on the demand for prostitution, the number of active sex workers in the jurisdiction and on levels of human trafficking for sexual exploitation,"" the report concluded.

"Network Rail has submitted a planning application to install a bridge walk and visitor hub on the rail bridge Visitors will be able to walk at the top of the Forth Bridge rail crossing if proposals from Network Rail are approved. The operator has submitted a planning application to install a bridge walk and visitor hub. It is hoped the plan could attract 85,000 visitors a year to one of the world's most famous railway bridges. Network Rail wants to construct a walkway and a viewing platform on the south cantilever. A visitor reception hub would be created at South Queensferry. There are longer-term plans to build similar facilities on the Fife side of the bridge. The Forth Bridge was awardedUnesco World Heritage sitestatus in 2015. The landmark, which was designed by Sir John Fowler and Benjamin Baker, took eight years to build at a cost of Â£3.2m. When it was opened in March 1890, it was the longest cantilever bridge in the world and the first major crossing made entirely of steel. Spanning 1.5 miles, weighing 53,000 tonnes and containing 6.5m rivets, the bridge carries 200 trains per day over the Firth of Forth, linking Fife with the Lothians.

"Early evidence of the effects of MUP suggest it is helping cut alcohol-related deaths in Glasgow A charity has called for Scotland's minimum unit pricing policy for alcohol (MUP) to be rolled out across the UK. It followed the publication of evidence suggesting MUP has had a significant impact on drinking patterns. Data presented at a conference in Glasgow suggested alcohol-related deaths in the city had fallen by 21.5%. The policy was introduced in May 2018, but organisers said there was already an indication it was working - and should be more widely applied. The research was presented at the British Association for the Study of the Liver (BASL) conference in Glasgow and was based on unpublished data from the city's Alcohol and Drugs Partnership (ADP). The British Liver Trust said although the results came very soon after the law was introduced and the long term impact was still being studied, they nonetheless had important implications for MUP in England and the rest of the UK. Scotland was the first country in the world to implement a minimum unit price for alcohol, following a 10-year campaign by health bodies. It means licensed premises in Scotland cannot sell alcohol below a price which depends on the amount of alcohol contained in the product. It is currently set at 50p per unit of alcohol. New drink laws 'implemented effectively' Has new alcohol law changed drinking habits? Dr Ewan Forrest who presented the results of the research at the conference said there had been a 21.5% reduction in alcohol-related deaths in Glasgow from 2017 to 2018  - from 186, down to 146. Almost half (44%) the deaths in 2018 occurred before May when MUP was introduced. Dr Forrest said: ""Glasgow has always had much higher levels of alcohol-related deaths than other parts of Scotland. ""This latest information suggests that MUP may be reducing alcohol-related harm in those at highest risk. ""More time is needed to assess the effect of MUP on the rest of Scotland and to get a clearer idea as to how MUP might affect the rest of the UK."" The data from the ADP suggested the reduction in the number of alcohol-related deaths had been most marked in the most deprived areas of the city where the behaviour of consumers was more price-sensitive. MUP targeted high-strength cheap ciders and spirits which saw steep price rises. The British Liver Trust, which campaigned for MUP, has launched a ""Love your liver"" road show which offers people a free screening test Prof Matthew Cramp, president of BASL, said: ""This early evidence suggests that implementing MUP does exactly what it is supposed to - it is a highly targeted measure that improves the health of the heaviest drinkers and those experiencing the most harm from alcohol whilst those who drink in moderation continue much as before."" Pamela Healy, chief executive of the British Liver Trust which campaigned for the introduction of MUP said: ""We are facing a liver disease epidemic in the UK and a major reason for this is that as a nation we are drinking too much alcohol. ""There is good evidence that interventions such as minimum unit pricing (MUP), targeted taxes and marketing regulations reduce alcohol harm. ""Alcohol taxes have been cut repeatedly in real terms. The government needs to look carefully at the outcomes from Scotland on MUP so that more lives can be saved.""

Volunteers at Stonehaven Men's Shed have been collecting the used legs so they can then be given a new lease of life in places such as The Gambia. The prosthetics are stripped down to their components before being sent to Africa to be rebuilt for new owners. The group works in partnership with the charity Legs4Africa. One of the reasons the project is possible is that most parts used in the legs are standardised around the world, so they can be taken elsewhere and used again. The prosthetics are stripped down to their component parts Men in Stonehaven are using their skills to help For the grateful recipients - often from deprived communities - this can mean a chance of a more active and independent life. Stonehaven Men's Shed allows members to share tools and resources to work on projects of their own choosing. Travellers asked to carry legs to Africa 'Wonky' donkey gets prosthetic foot John Robson, from Stonehaven Rotary Club, collects prosthetics discarded by hospitals from all over the country. He then brings them to the small Stonehaven team consisting of retired engineers and former tradesmen. John Robson said it is a ""win-win situation"" Mr Robson said he began by contacting hospitals across Scotland - in Edinburgh, Dundee, Inverness, Aberdeen and Glasgow - and has been collecting legs from them ever since. He said: ""These legs were getting dumped basically for ethical reasons nobody wanted to use somebody else's old leg. ""They come from the hospitals from the deceased, or were badly-fitted, or people grow out of them or whatever reason they're no longer required and they lie on shelves in the limb-fitting centre until eventually they are thrown out. ""They don't want to throw them out, they are valuable pieces of equipment, but that's what happens, until this project came along. ""Now they are glad to give us the legs, because they know they're being re-used. They go to Africa and the parts are made into new legs."" He added: ""It's a wonderful feeling, it's a win-win situation, everybody wins."" Young girl Wudeh has been offered a new lease of life Fellow helper Willie Shepherd said: ""This in fact is the only Men's Shed doing this prosthetic dismantling in the whole of Scotland. ""So for us it's a pleasure, it's also a privilege to be involved in something as important as this. I think it is very important work."" And Bill Emslie said of his retirement pastime: ""Your time is your own now, I retired five years ago, I just said to myself I cannot sit on my backside and do nothing. ""The camaraderie here is fantastic. We are all after the same aim - to help someone in need."" Legs4Africa has collected about 1,500 legs from hospitals and individuals this year, all of which have been dismantled by Men's Sheds across the UK including Stonehaven. Since the charity began five years ago it has shipped enough parts to build 5,700 legs to centres in 10 countries across Africa.

"High concentrations of substandard care homes in some areas leave families with no choice but to accept an under-performing home for older and disabled relatives, an analysis suggests. Over a third of beds were in settings rated as not good enough in a sixth of areas, the think tank IPPR found. In two places - Newham in London and Manchester - at least half were. Campaigners said high concentrations of substandard care would mean that good homes would be over-subscribed. What's happened to the social care plan? 'I'll be broke if I live to 100' NHS care funding a 'postcode lottery' In each local authority area the IPPR, which worked with research group Future Care Capital, mapped the proportion of care home places rated as inadequate or requiring improvement by the Care Quality Commission. Overall, 23% of the 456,000 beds were in settings that fell into one of the two categories. But in some places the concentrations were so high that half or more of beds were in under-performing homes. The London borough of Newham had the highest concentration - more than 60% of beds were in homes judged not good enough. This was followed by Manchester on 50%. Overall, 26 local authorities had more than a third of beds in sub-standard settings. By comparison, Southampton, Windsor and Maidenhead, Peterborough and Kingston, in London, all had less than 5% of beds in homes judged not good enough. Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, said the situation was ""unacceptable"" and left some people with ""no choice"" but to accept sub-standard care homes because good homes would be over-subscribed. ""The sad truth is that following years of underfunding and neglect, the social care system has now more or less completely broken down in some parts of the country,"" she said. The IPPR agreed it was a sign of a failing market. The think tank said costs had been cut in the care sector, and urged the government to take action by investing and reforming social care. It wants to see tax rises to provide free personal care for all and to help expand the number of beds by up to 75,000, arguing the state could be more involved in running services. Care companies have complained over recent years they have been squeezed by the low fees paid by councils, which fund most care home places. The system is means-tested for over-65s, which means there are large numbers of self-funders. The government said its plans to reform the system would be published in ""due course"" and pointed out it had announced an extra Â£1.5bn for the sector for 2020-21 in the recent spending round. ""We expect everyone to be able to access high quality, safe and compassionate care,"" a Department of Health and Social Care spokesman added.

"Finnish PM Antti Rinne (left) says he and French President Emmanuel Macron (right) agreed the new deadline for Boris Johnson Boris Johnson has 12 days to set out his Brexit plans to the EU, according to Finland's prime minister. Antti Rinne said he and French President Emmanuel Macron agreed the UK needed to produce the proposals in writing by the end of September, adding if not, ""then it's over"". Finland currently holds the EU's rotating presidency. A Downing Street source said: ""We will continue negotiating and put forward proposals at the appropriate time."" Mr Johnson has said a deal is possible at a crucial summit of EU leaders on 17 October, but he has insisted Brexit will happen by the 31 October deadline, even if a deal is not agreed. Brexit talks 'should not be a pretence' - Barnier Brexit solution must recognise NI status - Foster The UK government said talks with the EU have been making progress since Mr Johnson came into No 10 in July. It said it had put forward ""a number of proposals"" as alternatives to the Irish border backstop - the policy aimed at preventing the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland and a key sticking point in former PM Theresa May's Brexit deal. But Mr Johnson has repeatedly refused to reveal details of the proposals in interviews, saying he did not want to negotiate in public. The EU has continued to criticise the UK for not putting any plans in writing. Earlier, the European Commission President, Jean-Claude Juncker, said a meeting with Mr Johnson on Monday had been ""constructive"". But he said until proposals had been put forward, ""I will not be able to tell you, looking you straight in the eye, that any real progress has been achieved"". Johnson attacked by Luxembourg PM over Brexit Politics, not process, will make the difference Mr Rinne spoke to reporters after a meeting with the French president in Paris on Wednesday. He said: ""We both agreed that it is now time for Boris Johnson to produce his own proposals in writing - if they exist. ""If no proposals are received by the end of September, then it's over."" The Finnish PM intends to discuss the new deadline with the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, and Mr Johnson in the coming days, but the position has not yet been agreed with other EU nations. An official at the Elysee said the plan was ""not at all a new proposal"" and added: ""If we don't get the proposals before the end of September, we will not have enough time to discuss them before the summit in October."" Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg insisted the prime minister was on course to deliver a ""fundamentally different"" Brexit deal to ensure the UK leaves on October 31. He told a Telegraph event that to achieve such an outcome the government had to ""listen very carefully to what the DUP says"". DUP Leader Arlene Foster spoke to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce on issues concerning devolution and Brexit On Wednesday, DUP leader Arlene Foster told business leaders in Dublin that she wanted a solution to Brexit thatdoes not affect Northern Ireland's constitutional position. Mrs Foster - whose party's support had until recently given the Conservatives a majority in Parliament - said a Brexit deal ""will not be achieved that involves a backstop - whether it is UK-wide or Northern Ireland specific"". The whole of the UK had to leave the customs union and single market, she said. But she added that the DUP was prepared to ""look at Northern Ireland-specific solutions achieved with the support and consent of the representatives of the people of Northern Ireland"". Protesters outside the UK's Supreme Court in London It comes as the legal battle over the suspension of the UK Parliament is to go into a third day at the Supreme Court later. The UK government is arguing the decision to prorogue Parliament was a political matter and not for the courts to ""design a set of rules"" around it. But campaigners say the move was used ""for an improper purpose"" - to stop MPs scrutinising Mr Johnson's plans in the run up to Brexit on 31 October. The prime minister prorogued Parliament earlier this month for five weeks, with MPs not scheduled to return until 14 October. Mr Rees-Mogg, who travelled to Balmoral to seek the Queen's approval over the move, said it was ""nonsense"" to suggest she was misled over the decision. Second day of legal prorogation battle ends Could the Supreme Court overrule the government? Could MPs return to Parliament?

"Jason Lawrance got a woman pregnant after telling her he had undergone a vasectomy A man found guilty of rape after lying about having had a vasectomy is appealing against the convictions. Jason Lawrance's convictions were thought to be the first of their kind and could have wider implications for others who deceive sexual partners. A woman had consented to having sex with Lawrance, but a jury found the consent she gave was negated because he deceived her with his vasectomy lie. Now his legal team is challenging that decision. The vasectomy lie convictions were overshadowed by the fact Lawrance is a serial rapist who has attacked numerous women. His legal team will only be appealing against the convictions in relation to Lawrance's vasectomy deceit, and not his other offences. Shaun Draycott, his solicitor, said: ""Following the convictions recorded in this case, an application for leave to appeal has been lodged with the Court of Appeal and there is optimism with regard to its prospect of success. ""If these convictions are upheld on appeal, the concern is that members of the public, both male and female, who have never been considered criminals in the eyes of the law will be at risk of prosecution for serious sexual offences."" The woman Lawrance deceived became pregnant, despite taking emergency contraception, then had an abortion. This video can not be played Convicted rapist Lawrance was a keen amateur boxer Jason Lawrance, originally from Leicestershire, wasgiven a life sentence in 2016for raping five women, attempting to rape one woman, and sexually assaulting another. The assaults took place between June 2011 and November 2014 in Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire and Cambridgeshire. He met the women through online dating site Match.com - which was also how he met his wife - and Dating Direct. Lawrance, now 54,went on trial again in Julyaccused of raping and sexually assaulting six more women. One of these was the woman he deceived about having had a vasectomy. He was convictedof five charges of rape, one charge of sexual assault and a further charge of assault by penetration. He was found not guilty of two charges of rape. A vasectomy is a surgical operation to make a man sterile Lawrance and the woman were texting each other before they met and he told her he had undergone ""the snip"" in a discussion about contraception. The woman checked with him in person when they met up for sex, and Lawrance again said he had undergone a vasectomy. They had sex twice and Lawrance left in the middle of the night. He later texted her saying: ""I have a confession. I'm still fertile. Sorry. xxx"" Lawrance's text messages were used as evidence he had deceived the woman, and that he knew the woman would not have consented to sex without contraception. He was charged with two counts of rape because he had sex with the woman twice. Rape is defined in the Sexual Offences Act 2003 The Sexual Offences Act 2003,externalsays a person commits rape if the other person ""does not consent to the penetration"" or they ""do not reasonably believe"" the person consents. Section 74 of the act,externalspecifies that a person consents if he or she ""agrees by choice, and has the freedom and capacity to make that choice"". Clive Stockwell QC, prosecuting Lawrance, told jurors that because he deceived the woman, this had ""robbed her of her freedom of choice"". ""Her consent was obtained by a deception,"" he said in his opening. ""That, we submit, is not true consent."" However, defence barrister David Emanuel QC said classing it as rape was ""taking it too far"". ""The big question is can a lie turn consensual sex into non-consensual?"" he asked the jury. ""This is why the case is like no others. We had a note [from a member of the jury] asking 'is lying about the snip classed as rape?' ""You have absolutely hit the nail on the head. The answer is it is up to you."" The jury decided it was rape and found Lawrance guilty of those two charges. Sandra Paul,external, a solicitor who specialises in cases of sexual misconduct, predicted the convictions would lead to more cases of this kind coming before the courts. ""This decision, particularly if it's publicised, is going to give people confidence to approach the police,"" said Ms Paul, a partner at Kingsley Napley. ""The fact this conviction exists now sets a precedent and opens the door to make future convictions in similar cases more likely. ""However, any jury will have to look at the facts of a case and make a decision based on the evidence."" She said the jury being aware of Lawrance's previous convictions probably influenced their decision. ""If this was Joe Bloggs with no previous convictions, might they say that was a bad thing to do but not a criminal thing to do?"" she asked. She felt more guidance was needed from a higher court because of the wider implications, and said a judgment from the Court of Appeal would give this.

"Consumers spent more money on credit cards with UK retailers last year than they did in cash, a retailers' trade body has said. Debit cards were the most popular, but falling cash use pushed notes and coins down to third place, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said. Cash accounted for just over Â£1 in every Â£5 spent with UK shops. The BRC argued that rising costs faced by retailers to process card payments could push up prices. The decline of cash in the UK - in charts Cash or no cash - where do you stand? Credit and charge cards accounted for Â£82bn, or 22%, of retail sales last year - outstripping cash (Â£78bn) for the first time, according to the BRC, which has been running its payments survey for 20 years. Spending on debit cards totalled Â£216bn. Cash was still used more frequently than credit cards, but the typical transaction using notes and coins was worth over Â£20 less than the average credit card payment of Â£31.54. Andrew Cregan, policy adviser at the BRC, said that falling cash use and growth of online shopping were both factors in the shift. He echoed concerns that any move to a totally cashless society could leave millions of people in the lurch. Without cash, it would be harder to leave tips or give to the homeless. Vulnerable people, such as those with physical or mental health problems, who find it hard to use digital services, people who have been bankrupt, or those who use cash as a lifeline when in difficult or abusive relationships, could also be severely affected. However, the BRC's main concern for its members - the retailers - was the cost of accepting card payments. The average cost faced by a retailer for a debit card transaction was 6.23p, rising to 18.19p for credit or charge cards, compared with 1.66p for cash, the BRC said. Mr Cregan said about a third of the cost on cards was the so-called scheme fee charged by card companies such as Visa and Mastercard, and that cost had been rising sharply.

"High concentrations of substandard care homes in some areas leave families with no choice but to accept an under-performing home for older and disabled relatives, an analysis suggests. Over a third of beds were in settings rated as not good enough in a sixth of areas, the think tank IPPR found. In two places - Newham in London and Manchester - at least half were. Campaigners said high concentrations of substandard care would mean that good homes would be over-subscribed. What's happened to the social care plan? 'I'll be broke if I live to 100' NHS care funding a 'postcode lottery' In each local authority area the IPPR, which worked with research group Future Care Capital, mapped the proportion of care home places rated as inadequate or requiring improvement by the Care Quality Commission. Overall, 23% of the 456,000 beds were in settings that fell into one of the two categories. But in some places the concentrations were so high that half or more of beds were in under-performing homes. The London borough of Newham had the highest concentration - more than 60% of beds were in homes judged not good enough. This was followed by Manchester on 50%. Overall, 26 local authorities had more than a third of beds in sub-standard settings. By comparison, Southampton, Windsor and Maidenhead, Peterborough and Kingston, in London, all had less than 5% of beds in homes judged not good enough. Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, said the situation was ""unacceptable"" and left some people with ""no choice"" but to accept sub-standard care homes because good homes would be over-subscribed. ""The sad truth is that following years of underfunding and neglect, the social care system has now more or less completely broken down in some parts of the country,"" she said. The IPPR agreed it was a sign of a failing market. The think tank said costs had been cut in the care sector, and urged the government to take action by investing and reforming social care. It wants to see tax rises to provide free personal care for all and to help expand the number of beds by up to 75,000, arguing the state could be more involved in running services. Care companies have complained over recent years they have been squeezed by the low fees paid by councils, which fund most care home places. The system is means-tested for over-65s, which means there are large numbers of self-funders. The government said its plans to reform the system would be published in ""due course"" and pointed out it had announced an extra Â£1.5bn for the sector for 2020-21 in the recent spending round. ""We expect everyone to be able to access high quality, safe and compassionate care,"" a Department of Health and Social Care spokesman added.

"Booking.com is continuing to mislead its customers despite a crackdown by regulators, claims a new report. The Competition and Markets Authority ruled this year that booking sitesmust review the way they rankand display rooms, over pressure-selling concerns. An investigation byWhich?,externalsays Booking.com is still giving false accounts of the popularity of rooms. However, the site told the BBC it has ""worked hard to implement the commitments"" agreed with the CMA. Which? carried out spot checks on six leading hotel booking websites, which were ordered to make changes earlier this year. Offending sites had until September to alter their practices. Hotel booking sites to end 'misleading' sales Watchdog takes aim at hotel booking sites The sites had previously been found to be engaging in practices which included misleading discount claims, pressure-selling and hidden charges. According to the consumer watchdog, five out of 10 of Booking.com's ""only 1 room left on our site"" claims failed to give an accurate picture of availability. Which? claims the website is still falsely representing the popularity of rooms The Banjo B&B in Liverpool showed ""1 room left"" on a ""budget double room"". But when Which? clicked through, it says there were four identical ""budget double rooms"" for the same price of Â£49. The CMA, which first launched its investigation into online booking sites last October, sent warning letters to ""a range of sites"" in June, demanding they review their practices to make sure they are fair, and comply with consumer protection law. Despite the move, Which? Travel's Naomi Leach says consumers are still being pressured into making bookings. ""We found clear evidence that Booking.com has not yet sufficiently cleaned up its act and is flouting the rules on pressure-selling, which could lead to millions of consumers being rushed into making a booking,"" she said. ""It must now provide cast-iron guarantees that it won't continue to mislead holidaymakers with these unscrupulous practices. Otherwise, the regulator will have to step in with strong action to bring it into line."" A spokesperson for Booking.com told the BBC: ""We work continuously to bring transparency, choice and value to travellers, constantly testing and improving the way in which we present our services online. ""We have worked hard to implement the commitments agreed with the CMA and maintain continuing collaboration and dialogue to inform ongoing enhancement of the consumer experience."" Mike Hursthouse told BBC News: ""A year ago, I wanted to book a room to be able to attend an early meeting the following morning. ""I chose a country pub with five or six rooms and used Booking.com. ""During the process, I kept getting nudge messages, 'Only one room left,' 'In high demand,' et cetera. ""When I finally arrived at the pub, I told the landlord I had booked a room. ""He said, ""You must be Mr Hursthouse,' 'How did you know my name?' I asked. 'You're the only person we have booked tonight,' he replied."" A hotelier in Cornwall told BBC News: ""I have a small B&B, which I have owned for three years, and have not yet made a profit, due to Booking.com. ""I have had lots of customers book through them, then if they cancel..., booking.com still take the commission from me.

"Consumers spent more money on credit cards with UK retailers last year than they did in cash, a retailers' trade body has said. Debit cards were the most popular, but falling cash use pushed notes and coins down to third place, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said. Cash accounted for just over Â£1 in every Â£5 spent with UK shops. The BRC argued that rising costs faced by retailers to process card payments could push up prices. The decline of cash in the UK - in charts Cash or no cash - where do you stand? Credit and charge cards accounted for Â£82bn, or 22%, of retail sales last year - outstripping cash (Â£78bn) for the first time, according to the BRC, which has been running its payments survey for 20 years. Spending on debit cards totalled Â£216bn. Cash was still used more frequently than credit cards, but the typical transaction using notes and coins was worth over Â£20 less than the average credit card payment of Â£31.54. Andrew Cregan, policy adviser at the BRC, said that falling cash use and growth of online shopping were both factors in the shift. He echoed concerns that any move to a totally cashless society could leave millions of people in the lurch. Without cash, it would be harder to leave tips or give to the homeless. Vulnerable people, such as those with physical or mental health problems, who find it hard to use digital services, people who have been bankrupt, or those who use cash as a lifeline when in difficult or abusive relationships, could also be severely affected. However, the BRC's main concern for its members - the retailers - was the cost of accepting card payments. The average cost faced by a retailer for a debit card transaction was 6.23p, rising to 18.19p for credit or charge cards, compared with 1.66p for cash, the BRC said.

"The report also stated there has been a decrease in the number of on-street sex workers Publicity around a change to Northern Ireland's prostitution laws caused a spike in business, a new report has claimed. Academics carried out a three-year review of the impact of the Human Trafficking and Exploitation Act 2015. The law introduced the ""Nordic model"",which criminalised paying for sexual services in Northern Ireland. Sex workers, consulted for the review, said media discussion at the time publicised the idea of prostitution. First arrest in NI under new sex law 'No prosecutions' for paying for sex in NI Paying for sex to become crime in NI The report said sex workers noted ""a surge in business in the run-up to the legislation and its immediate aftermath and it was suggested that the public debate around Article 64A publicised prostitution to those who had never previously considered it"". Article 64A in the 2015 act related to paying for sex. The Northern Ireland Assembly passed the Human Trafficking and Exploitation Bill in December 2014. The private member's bill was brought before the house by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) peer Lord Morrow. DUP peer Lord Morrow criticised the methodology of the report He criticised the methodology of the report and claimed on Good Morning Ulster that those who compiled it had a ""clear track record on this issue in favour of decriminalisation"". Lord Morrow added that he was ""disappointed in some regard with how the legislation has been implemented"" but that it had led to arrests and convictions ""so the PSNI and PPS (Public Prosecution Service) can build on this in the future"". One of the academics involved in the report, Dr Caoimhe NÃ­ DhÃ³naill, rejected Lord Morrow's criticism, tweeting that his claims were ""unfounded and untrue"" and that they ""simply reported what was found"".

Earlier, she told Good Morning Ulster that ""the demand for sex work is as strong as ever"". ""Now because clients have been criminalised, the clients are putting a lot more pressure on sex workers to put themselves in more risky situations and to move into sexual practices that they wouldn't have done before,"" she said. The report, based on research which examined a period between June 2015 and December 2018, also found an increase in online advertising for prostitution. Looking at a total of 173,460 advertisements, there was a 5% increase in the total number over that period. The report said that worked out at about 308 sex workers advertising each day. The estimated number of sex workers in Northern Ireland increased from 3,351 up to 3,973. The number of sex workers in Northern Ireland increased from 3,351 up to 3,973 The report also examined issues around the safety of sex workers and human trafficking for exploitation. On the basis of the findings, it concluded there was ""no evidence that the offence of purchasing sexual services has produced a downward pressure on the demand for, or supply of, sexual services"". Responding to the report, the Sex Workers Alliance Ireland (SWAI) said it showed current legislation is ""not fit for purpose"". ""Sex workers in Ireland tend to work both jurisdictions so a lot of the findings in this report will be applicable to the Republic of Ireland,"" said Kate McGrew, current sex worker and spokesperson for the SWAI. ""If the purpose of the law was to decrease demand it has failed. ""If the purpose of the law was to help sex workers it has failed."" The report said the legislation had little effect on the supply or demand for sexual services The report said the ""tailing off"" in demand, which had been expected, has not happened. Rather, the legislation ""has had little effect on the supply or demand for sexual services"". On the issue of safety, the report states serious crimes against sex workers are ""comparatively rare"". However, information gathered from a website used by sex workers to report instances of abuse showed increases in the number of reports it had received of assaults, sexual assaults, and threatening behaviour. The report also stated there has been a decrease in the number of on-street sex workers, falling from about 20 operating in Northern Ireland in 2014, down to less than 10 currently. In 2014, ahead of the law change, baseline research was carried out by the Department of Justice to give a point of comparison. A requirement was built into it at the time for a review to be carried out after three years. ""The evidence from Northern Ireland based on a comparison of the before and after data suggests very strongly that Article 64A has had minimal to no effect on the demand for prostitution, the number of active sex workers in the jurisdiction and on levels of human trafficking for sexual exploitation,"" the report concluded.

"Finnish PM Antti Rinne (left) says he and French President Emmanuel Macron (right) agreed the new deadline for Boris Johnson Boris Johnson has 12 days to set out his Brexit plans to the EU, according to Finland's prime minister. Antti Rinne said he and French President Emmanuel Macron agreed the UK needed to produce the proposals in writing by the end of September, adding if not, ""then it's over"". Finland currently holds the EU's rotating presidency. A Downing Street source said: ""We will continue negotiating and put forward proposals at the appropriate time."" Mr Johnson has said a deal is possible at a crucial summit of EU leaders on 17 October, but he has insisted Brexit will happen by the 31 October deadline, even if a deal is not agreed. Brexit talks 'should not be a pretence' - Barnier Brexit solution must recognise NI status - Foster The UK government said talks with the EU have been making progress since Mr Johnson came into No 10 in July. It said it had put forward ""a number of proposals"" as alternatives to the Irish border backstop - the policy aimed at preventing the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland and a key sticking point in former PM Theresa May's Brexit deal. But Mr Johnson has repeatedly refused to reveal details of the proposals in interviews, saying he did not want to negotiate in public. The EU has continued to criticise the UK for not putting any plans in writing. Earlier, the European Commission President, Jean-Claude Juncker, said a meeting with Mr Johnson on Monday had been ""constructive"". But he said until proposals had been put forward, ""I will not be able to tell you, looking you straight in the eye, that any real progress has been achieved"". Johnson attacked by Luxembourg PM over Brexit Politics, not process, will make the difference Mr Rinne spoke to reporters after a meeting with the French president in Paris on Wednesday. He said: ""We both agreed that it is now time for Boris Johnson to produce his own proposals in writing - if they exist. ""If no proposals are received by the end of September, then it's over."" The Finnish PM intends to discuss the new deadline with the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, and Mr Johnson in the coming days, but the position has not yet been agreed with other EU nations. An official at the Elysee said the plan was ""not at all a new proposal"" and added: ""If we don't get the proposals before the end of September, we will not have enough time to discuss them before the summit in October."" Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg insisted the prime minister was on course to deliver a ""fundamentally different"" Brexit deal to ensure the UK leaves on October 31. He told a Telegraph event that to achieve such an outcome the government had to ""listen very carefully to what the DUP says"". DUP Leader Arlene Foster spoke to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce on issues concerning devolution and Brexit On Wednesday, DUP leader Arlene Foster told business leaders in Dublin that she wanted a solution to Brexit thatdoes not affect Northern Ireland's constitutional position. Mrs Foster - whose party's support had until recently given the Conservatives a majority in Parliament - said a Brexit deal ""will not be achieved that involves a backstop - whether it is UK-wide or Northern Ireland specific"". The whole of the UK had to leave the customs union and single market, she said. But she added that the DUP was prepared to ""look at Northern Ireland-specific solutions achieved with the support and consent of the representatives of the people of Northern Ireland"". Protesters outside the UK's Supreme Court in London It comes as the legal battle over the suspension of the UK Parliament is to go into a third day at the Supreme Court later. The UK government is arguing the decision to prorogue Parliament was a political matter and not for the courts to ""design a set of rules"" around it. But campaigners say the move was used ""for an improper purpose"" - to stop MPs scrutinising Mr Johnson's plans in the run up to Brexit on 31 October. The prime minister prorogued Parliament earlier this month for five weeks, with MPs not scheduled to return until 14 October. Mr Rees-Mogg, who travelled to Balmoral to seek the Queen's approval over the move, said it was ""nonsense"" to suggest she was misled over the decision. Second day of legal prorogation battle ends Could the Supreme Court overrule the government? Could MPs return to Parliament?

"This video can not be played Former PM David Cameron explains how he sought the Queen's help in Scottish independence vote Former PM David Cameron has revealed he asked whether the Queen could ""raise an eyebrow"" about the prospect of Scotland voting for independence. He told the BBC he sought help from royal officials days before the 2014 vote amid ""mounting panic"" he may lose. What was discussed was not ""anything that would be in any way improper... but just a raising of the eyebrow even... a quarter of an inch"", he said. The Queen laterurged people to ""think very carefully about the future"". The comments - made to a well-wisher outside a church on the Balmoral estate - were one of the main talking points of the referendum campaign. Reflecting on his rise to power and six years in Downing Street in a two-part BBC documentary, Mr Cameron said the Queen's words on the issue were ""very limited but helped to put a slightly different perception on things"". Forget Brexit - what else does Cameron's book tell us? Cameron: Johnson and Gove behaved 'appallingly' PM apology to Queen for 'purr' claim Scotland went on to reject independence by a margin of 55.3% to 44.7%, a result which Mr Cameron said left him ""blissfully happy"". In a statement, Alex Salmond, who resigned as Scotland's first minister in the wake of the result, said Mr Cameron's actions were not only improper, but showed how desperate the No side was during the final stages of the independence campaign. This video can not be played Former PM David Cameron criticises Boris Johnson's motives for supporting Leave campaign The Cameron Years, which begins on Thursday, examines Mr Cameron's modernisation of the party, his decision to enter a coalition with the Liberal Democrats after the 2010 election and the fallout from 2016 Brexit referendum, which led to his resignation. In it, he says: He ""broods"" every day about the Brexit referendum and its consequences He ignored George Osborne's advice against the poll and Michael Gove's reservations Boris Johnson ""agonised"" over his position and ""did not really want to leave"" the EU He still believes Brexit can ""be delivered and made to work"" His government's austerity programme was ""painful"" but necessary Legalising gay marriage was perhaps his ""proudest"" achievement in office On the EU referendum, Mr Cameron told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he ""wasn't the slightest bit complacent"" during the campaign, saying that he fought ""with every fibre of my being"". But he said the Labour leadership during the campaign ""simply wasn't there, wasn't committed"" and it was ""very hard to fight these things on your own"". He added that the result would ""probably have been even worse"" if people knew he would quit if Leave won the vote. Just as the first rule of Fight Club is that you do not talk about Fight Club, the first rule of the relationship between the prime minister and the Queen is that you never, ever talk about the relationship between the PM and the Queen. It is difficult to imagine anything other than horror in the Palace at David Cameron's revelations. Not just because he has broken the first rule. But because he has made it painfully clear that in 2014 he used the Queen for his own political purposes. And that she and her advisors thought that was OK. The revelation comes as her suspension of Parliament - a suspension made on the effective instruction of Boris Johnson - comes under unprecedented scrutiny in the Supreme Court. The two cases are very different; but they both highlight the dark greys of the Queen's constitutional position, the discretion she has or lacks, under extraordinary circumstances, to speak out and act. In the run-up to the 18 September poll on Scottish independence, it was reported that the Queen was concerned about the possibility of Scotland opting to sever the 300-year union with England and Wales. A Sunday Times poll on 7 September putting the Yes campaign ahead contributed to a ""mounting sense of panic"" in Downing Street, Mr Cameron recalls. The poll, which was published while he and his wife, Samantha, were staying at Balmoral, ""hit me like a blow to the solar plexus"". A poll finding the Yes campaign in front contributed to a ""mounting sense of panic"" in Downing Street Mr Cameron - who agreed to hold the independence referendum in the face of opposition within his party - said there followed urgent conversations between advisers in Downing Street and Buckingham Palace to figure out how the Queen could comment while still remaining within the constitutional boundaries of neutrality. ""I remember conversations I had with my private secretary and he had with the Queen's private secretary and I had with the Queen's private secretary, not asking for anything that would be in any way improper or unconstitutional but just a raising of the eyebrow even, you know, a quarter of an inch. We thought would make a difference."" Buckingham Palace insisted that the Queen was above politics When asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme for more detail about what had happened, Mr Cameron said he ""didn't want to say anything more about this"". ""I'm sure that some people would think, possibly even me, that I've already said perhaps a little bit too much,"" he said. At the time, the BBC's royal correspondent said the Queen's words were ""more of an observation than an intervention"", while Buckingham Palace said any suggestion the Queen was seeking to influence the outcome of the referendum was ""categorically wrong"". Officials insisted the monarch was above politics, and the issue of Scotland's future was a matter for the people. Two weeks after the Scottish referendum, Mr Cameron was forced to apologise after suggesting the Queen ""purred down the phone"" when she was told about the No result. While he feels ""sorry"" about events since the 2016 Brexit vote, Mr Cameron said he did not regret the decision to hold the EU referendum. While some people would ""never forgive"" him, he maintained the UK's 40-year membership was becoming ""unstable"" and the duty of leaders was to ""see difficulties coming and try to resolve them and shape the country's response to them"". He accepted he ""totally underestimated the latent Leave gene"" in his party and that during the campaign while ""he had a winning hand, he could not seem to play it"". After losing the vote, Mr Cameron said he knew he had to quit because he did not have the ""credibility to deliver Brexit"", but was ""desperately sad"" his time in office was cut short. Mr Cameron said the coalition government staved off a financial crisis ""I think of all the things we could and should have done if we had been able... to win the referendum,"" he recalls. ""A whole lot of what we could have done effectively ran into the sand of the European issue."" On his economic and social record, he rejects as ""total nonsense"" opponents' claims that he embraced deep spending cuts as a political choice to reduce the size of the state. He says the multi-billion pound budget deficit inherited by his government in 2010 was a ""clear and present danger to the British economy"" requiring immediate action. ""In the end there were difficult and painful decisions, but inequality fell and the share of income tax paid by the richest went up, not down,"" he argued. ""We protected pensioners, we protected the NHS, we protected help for the poorest."" Mr Cameron's long-awaited memoirs, entitled For The Record, was published on Thursday. In excerpts published by the Times last week, he accused Boris Johnson and Michael Gove of behaving ""appallingly"" during the Brexit referendum.
