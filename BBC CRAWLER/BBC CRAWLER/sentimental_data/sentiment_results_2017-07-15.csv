Ms Dugdale has been dating Mid Fife and Glenrothes MSP Jenny Gilruth for about four months. At the beginning of the yearthe Labour leader split up with her former partner of nine years, Louise Riddell. In a joint statement, Ms Dugdale and Ms Gilruth asked for their privacy to be respected and said they did not consider their new relationship to be ""news"". Ms Gilruth was elected to Holyrood last May and is a parliamentary liaison officer to Deputy First Minister John Swinney. The statement said: ""We don't consider this to be 'news' - but we appreciate others might and we want to go about our daily lives normally. ""We would like to thank our friends, family and colleagues for their kindness over the past few months and for their love and support.

"If the Observer is right, the mood in Brussels - a day before the next round of Brexit talks - is ""cautiously optimistic."" But the message doesn't seem to have reached the cartoonists. In keeping with the start of the holiday season, theSunday Express,externaloffers an image of Theresa May at the wheel of the Brexit car - the back seat is crammed with people, all shouting advice: ""Speed up!"" ""Slow down!"" ""Turn back!"" The drawing inthe Sunday Times,externalshows Mrs May and her cabinet colleagues entangled in a never-ending bill. ""What do you mean?"" she complains. ""This is just for starters!"" Of course both cartoons are about the seemingly inescapable politics of the subject. According tothe Observer,external, the kind of exit from the EU that Mrs May is pursuing has revealed ""a picture of incapacity, incompetence, self-deception, dishonesty, partisanship, and harmful confusion"". The paper sees ""the Tory hard Brexiteers"" as ""the lords of misrule."" The Sunday Telegraph,externalasks what the term ""hard Brexit"" means and answers ""really just Brexit with some negative branding"". If supporters of withdrawal want to cheer themselves up,the Sun on Sunday,externalsays they should just consider Tony Blair's latest intervention. ""As ever,"" the paper says, he ignored the will of the British people, providing ""a classic example of the kind of arch-deviousness that became his stock-in-trade as prime minister"". TheSunday Mirror,externalreports that a quarter of teachers who have qualified since 2011 have already left the profession, according to figures obtained by Labour. It suggests their motives for quitting were low pay and harsh conditions. Laura Jackson writes in theSunday Express,externalthat she left after two years because the job was eroding her mental health. She describes the miseries she experienced: the horrifying behaviour of the pupils towards each other and her, the open hostility of parents, the power cuts in her classroom and the crushing workload. The Sunday Times,externalthinks TV viewers may be shocked when the BBC reveals how much its better paid presenters earn.

"Prof Mirzakhani is seen as an inspiration for young female mathematicians Maryam Mirzakhani, the first woman to receive the prestigious Fields Medal for mathematics, has died in the US. The 40-year-old Iranian, a professor at Stanford University, had breast cancer which had spread to her bones. Nicknamed the ""Nobel Prize for Mathematics"", the Fields Medal is only awarded every four years to between two and four mathematicians under 40. It wasgiven to Prof Mirzakhaniin 2014 for her work on complex geometry and dynamical systems. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said Prof Mirzakhani's death caused ""great sorrow,"" state media reported. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said her death was a cause for grief for all Iranians. ""A light was turned off today. It breaks my heart... gone far too soon,"" US-Iranian scientist Firouz Naderi posted on Instagram. He added in a subsequent post:  ""A genius? Yes. But also a daughter, a mother and a wife."" Prof Mirzakhani and her husband, Czech scientist Jan Vondrak, had one daughter. Some social media users criticised Iranian officials for not using recent images of Prof Mirzakhani which showed her uncovered hair. Iranian women must cover their hair in line with a strict interpretation of Islamic law on modesty. Iranian official media and politicians used older pictures in their social media tributes, which show her hair covered. Iranian Speaker Ali Larijani - using an older image of Prof Mirzakhani - said on Instagram that her loss ""caused great regret"" Stanford University President Marc Tessier-Lavigne described Prof Mirzakhani as ""a brilliant mathematical theorist and also a humble person who accepted honours only with the hope that it might encourage others to follow her path"". ""Maryam is gone far too soon but her impact will live on for the thousands of women she inspired to pursue math and science,"" he said. ""Her contributions as both a scholar and a role model are significant and enduring and she will be dearly missed here at Stanford and around the world."" Born in 1977, Prof Mirzakhani was brought up in post-revolutionary Iran andwon two gold medals in the International Mathematical Olympiad,externalas a teenager. She earned a PhD at Harvard University in 2004, and later worked at Princeton before securing a professorship at Stanford in 2008. Strange matter wins physics Nobel John Nash's ground-breaking ideas in maths What exactly is 'game theory'? Her receipt of the Fields Medal three years ago ended a long wait for women in the mathematics community for the prize, first established in 1936. Prof Mirzakhani was also the first Iranian to receive it. The citation said she had made ""striking and highly original contributions to geometry and dynamical systems"" and that her most recent work constituted ""a major advance"". Prof Dame Frances Kirwan, a member of the medal selection committee from the University of Oxford, said at the time: ""I hope that this award will inspire lots more girls and young women, in this country and around the world, to believe in their own abilities and aim to be the Fields Medallists of the future.""

But then disaster struck. Donal sliced his finger open and blood starting pouring onto the chopping board. Viewers at home watched with sympathy and amusement at the unfolding scene. ""Wow! Donal Skehan is so professional! Cut finger on live TV and he cracks on!"" said viewerTania O'Donell,externalon Twitter. The presenter carried on cooking and chatting valiantly, until he seemed to realise quite how bad the cut was. ""Nothing like a bit of blood on a Saturday morning just to get you alive and kicking. I'm glad Julian is here to keep us going,"" he said, though some viewers remarked he had gone slightly pale. Many sent their best wishes to Donal. But just when everyone had recovered, things took another turn. A cameraman strode confidently in front of the camera as guests gathered around a table behind him. When alerted to his presence, he meekly put his hand to his mouth in surprise before sharply exiting the set. ""Loving the show today.

"Builders in the old part of the Canadian city of Quebec have unearthed a live shell fired by the British during a siege in 1759. They posed for photos with the large, 90kg (200lb) projectile, unaware that it was still potentially explosive. Army bomb disposal experts later collected the device, saying there was still a danger, CBC reports. The British besieged Quebec while fighting the French at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. What's in store for Canada's next 150 years? What's Canada really good at? What does it mean to be Canadian today? Quebec City archaeologist Serge Rouleau, who examined the munition before the army and noticed that it still contained a charge, described it as an incendiary bomb,Le Soleil news site,external(in French) reports. He had taken it home after the builders' firm,Lafontaine Inc,external, contacted the municipal authorities. ""The ball would break and the powder would ignite, setting fire to the building,"" Master Warrant Officer Sylvain Trudel, a senior munitions technician, wasquoted by CBC,externalas saying. ""With time, humidity got into its interior and reduced its potential for exploding, but there's still a danger,"" he added. ""Old munitions like this are hard to predict. You never know to what point the chemicals inside have degraded."" The shell is now at a safe site and will either be disarmed or destroyed if necessary, CBC says. It is believed it was fired at Quebec City from Levis, across the St Lawrence River, the broadcaster adds. The Battle of the Plains of Abraham, part of the Seven Years' War, ended in victory for the British, and was a major milestone towards the end of French rule in what is now Canada.

"This video can not be played President Recep Tayyip Erdogan addressed a huge Istanbul crowd Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has given emotional speeches to tens of thousands of people a year after a coup attempt was faced down in the streets. Mr Erdogan praised those people, including MPs, who had defended democracy and his government. He backed the death penalty for coup plotters and said they should wear Guantanamo Bay-style uniforms. Nearly 250 people died and 2,196 were wounded fighting the coup attempt by an army faction on 15 July last year. The government has since led a crackdown on alleged coup supporters, with the dismissal of more than 150,000 state employees and the arrest of some 50,000 people. The coup failed for several reasons, including a lack of support in higher echelons of the armed forces and a lack of political or public backing. Why did the Turkish coup plot fail? Plotters tried to detain Mr Erdogan as he holidayed in an Aegean resort, but he had left and the coup was thwarted by civilians and soldiers loyal to the president. It is on these people that the president has focused in commemorations. ""People that night did not have guns, they had a flag and more importantly, they had their faith,"" he told thousands of supporters. However, the national unity that was initially felt against the coup has faded, and divisions have widened, correspondents say. Opponents of Mr Erdogan boycotted the day and night of speeches and pageantry. They say his government's actions over the past year amount to an attempt to purge dissent. Such purges continued right up to last Friday, when more than 7,000 state employees were dismissed. The human impact of Turkey's purges The officers who cannot go home Mr Erdogan addressed Turks who had rallied to the bridge over the Bosphorus where civilians had confronted pro-coup soldiers last year. He said: ""I am grateful to all members of my nation who defended their country."" Mr Erdogan said that 250 people had lost their lives but the country had won its future. ""Putschists who closed off the bridge on that night wanted to show the world that they were in control,"" he said, but were countered by ""millions who took to the streets that night to defend the honour of their nation"". He said he would ""break the heads of the traitors"" who plotted the coup. Mr Erdogan also said he had spoken to Prime Minister Binali Yildirim about the coup plotters, saying: ""When they appear in court, let's make them appear in uniform suits like in Guantanamo."" The president then unveiled a ""martyrs' memorial"" at the bridge, which has been renamed the Bridge of the Martyrs of July 15. Tens of thousands went to the bridge in Istanbul that has become a landmark of the failed coup Moving on to Ankara, the capital, he spoke in parliament a year to the hour after it was bombed by warplanes. He said that on the night of the coup, ""our nation showed the whole world what a nation we are"". One supporter in the crowd, who gave his name only as Murat, said: """"If it happened again, I would stay out again. That night, it was like a war. We take ownership of this country and this people."" The date of 15 July has been declared an annual holiday called Democracy and National Unity Day. Earlier Mr Yildirim told a special session of parliament that 15 July 2016 was a ""second War of Independence"", following the conflict that led to the creation of the modern state in the 1920s. ""It has been exactly one year since Turkey's darkest and longest night was transformed into a bright day, since an enemy occupation turned into the people's legend,"" the prime minister said. But Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the head of the main opposition Republican People's Party, said: ""This parliament, which withstood bombs, has been rendered obsolete and its authority removed. ""In the past year, justice has been destroyed. Instead of rapid normalisation, a permanent state of emergency has been implemented."" Turkey's trauma after night of the tanks The Turkish authorities accused a movement loyal to the Muslim cleric, Fethullah Gulen, of organising the plot. Mr Gulen, who remains in the United States, denies any involvement, and Washington has so far resisted calls from the Turkish authorities to extradite him. President Erdogan inspected the honour guard ahead of special session of parliament in Ankara The BBC's Turkey correspondent, Mark Lowen, says that for half of the country, he says, 15 July 2016 was its rebirth; for the other half, its aftermath is killing off what was left of Turkish democracy. Civilians, as those here on the Bosphorus bridge, helped defy the coup last year Billboards like this one paying tribute to the ""Legend of 15 July"" have been erected Critics say Mr Erdogan is using the purges to stifle political dissent, and last weekhundreds of thousands of people gathered in Istanbulat the end of a 450km (280-mile) ""justice"" march against the government. The president accused the marchers of supporting terrorism.

"This video can not be played Tony Blair: ""One option... would be Britain staying within a reformed European Union"" Some EU leaders may be prepared to compromise on the free movement of people to help Britain stay in the single market, Tony Blair has said. He told the Today programme one option was for Britain ""staying within a reformed EU"". The ex-PM said he would not disclose conversations he had had in Europe - but insisted he was not speaking ""on a whim"". The government insists Brexit will give the UK greater control of its borders. Labour's shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said Mr Blair ""hadn't really listened to the nature of the debate going on in the pubs, the clubs and school gates"". ""We have to respect the referendum result,"" Mr McDonnell said, adding that Labour could ""negotiate access to the single market"". Mr Blair spoke to the BBC after he argued in an article for his own institute that there was room for compromise on free movement of people. He told Today the situation in Europe was different to when Britain voted to leave the EU - a move Mr Blair described as ""the most serious it's taken since the Second World War"". He said France's new president, Emmanuel Macron - whose political party was formed last year - was proposing ""far-reaching reforms"" for the EU. ""Europe itself is now looking at its own reform programme,"" Mr Blair said. ""They will have an inner circle in the EU that will be part of the eurozone and an outer circle."" When pressed on what evidence there was to suggest European nations would compromise, Mr Blair said: ""I'm not going to disclose conversations I've had within Europe, but I'm not saying this literally on the basis of a whim. ""They will make reforms that I think will make it much more comfortable for Britain to fit itself in that outer circle."" Brexit: All you need to know Expats, exports, security: What's worrying the EU He said ""majorities"" of people in France, Germany and the UK supported changes around benefits and with regards to those who come to Europe without a job. ""I'm not saying these could be negotiated,"" Mr Blair said. ""I'm simply saying if we were looking at this from the point of view of the interests of the country, one option within this negotiation would be Britain staying within a reformed European Union."" He said the majority of EU migrants in the UK are ""people we want in this country"". Support for free movement rules 'eroding' The people who will negotiate Brexit 10 Areas that will shape the Brexit talks EU leaders have previously said the UK must accept free movement of people if it wants to stay inside the single market. But in his article for the Institute for Global Change,external, Mr Blair said senior figures had told him they were willing to consider changes to one of the key principles of the single market. ""The French and Germans share some of the British worries, notably around immigration, and would compromise on freedom of movement,"" he wrote. But last week the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said the freedom of movement of people, goods, services and capital - the key principles of the single market - were ""indivisible"". Prime Minister Theresa May has pledged to control EU migration and has reiterated her commitment to reducing net migration to the tens of thousands. She has said that outside the single market, and without rules on freedom of movement, the UK will be able to make its own decisions on immigration. Mr Blair also said more was known now about the effects of the Brexit process on the UK. ""We know our currency is down significantly, that's a prediction by the international markets as to our future prosperity. We know businesses are already moving jobs out of the country. ""We know last year we were the fastest-growing economy in the G7. We're now the slowest."" Mr Blair accepted Labour was behind its leader Jeremy Corbyn ""for now"". But he warned if Brexit was combined with leaving the single market, and ""the largest spending programme Labour had ever proposed"" the country ""would be in a very serious situation."" This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""I hope he (Tony Blair) has looked very carefully at our manifesto"" Mr Blair said leaving the single market was a ""damaging position"" shared by Labour and he urged the party's leadership to champion a ""radically distinct"" position on Europe. But Jeremy Corbyn said Labour's position on free movement was ""very clear"", adding: ""We would protect EU nationals' rights to remain here, including the rights of family reunion."" Responding to Mr Blair's comments, the party leader said: ""I think our economy will do very well under a Labour government. ""It will be an investment-led economy that works for all - so we won't have zero-hour contracts, insecure employment. ""We won't have communities being left behind."" Mr Blair has previously said Brexit was an issue he felt so strongly about, that it tempted him to return to politics. But Labour MP Frank Field, who backed Brexit, said he did not think Mr Blair was ""a person to influence public opinion now"". ""We're now set on the course of leaving [the EU]. We actually need a safe harbour to continue those negotiations when we're out. ""And I wouldn't actually be believing those people who are set on destroying our attempts to leave, who are now appearing as wolves in sheep's clothing."" Richard Tice, of pro-Brexit group Leave Means Leave, said Mr Blair's comments ""demonstrate how out of touch he is with British voters"". ""The former prime minister believes that freedom of movement is the only issue with the EU, when in reality the British people also voted to leave in order to take back control of our laws and money and no longer be dictated to by the European Court of Justice,"" he added. Conservative MEP David Campbell Bannerman said Mr Blair's assertion that Britain could find a way to remain within a reformed EU was a ""dodgy claim, as opposed to a dodgy dossier"". ""We've heard this all before. David Cameron was given such assurances and in the end the EU did nothing for him. ""If they do nothing for Cameron, they're not going to do anything for Blair, I'm afraid.""

"This video can not be played A survivor describes how a wall fell directly onto the crowd A wall collapsed at a football stadium in Senegal on Saturday, killing eight people and injuring almost 90. It fell in after fighting began between rival fans and police responded with tear gas, with a stampede ensuing. Stade de Mbour were playing Union Sportive Ouakam at the Demba Diop stadium in the capital Dakar. The country has suspended all sporting and cultural events for the rest of the month. During the clashes, home fans threw projectiles including stones at others. Pictures circulating online appear to show people scrambling over a low wall amid clouds of gas. Passions were high at the game, the League Cup final. With the score 1-1 after 90 minutes, Mbour took a goal in the first period of extra time to win 2-1, and violence broke out at the final whistle. Cheikh Maba Diop, whose friend died in the incident and who helped move people out of the stadium, told AFP news agency: ""All of a sudden when the wall fell... we knew exactly that some of our own had lost their lives because the wall fell directly on to people."" A spokesman for President Macky Sall said campaigning for upcoming elections would be suspended on Sunday as a mark of respect, and that there should be ""punishments serving as a warning"". There are also suggestions that the stadium itself was in a poor state of repair, BBC Africa reporter James Copnall says. An enquiry announced by the government will no doubt examine all this, he adds.

"Women gathered on the steps of Congress for their ""sleeveless Friday"" protest US Congresswomen have protested for the right to bare arms in parts of Washington DC's Capitol building. The National Rifle Association may be disappointed to learn that this is not a typo. They are not campaigning to bear weapons, but to stand against the Congressional dress code. The long-standing code bans sleeveless tops, among other things. The protest comes after a number of women have recently reported being told their outfits violated the rules. Female reporters have said they had been prevented from entering the lobby area, where the press meets to ask questions of US politicians. On Friday, RepresentativeJackie Speier tweeted,externalto encourage colleagues to dress in clothes that showed their arms, calling the protest ""Sleeveless Friday"".

Jan Schakowsky, a representative for Illinois, also joined in After a backlash, House Speaker Paul Ryan emphasised that the code had not been devised under his term, and agreed it needs to be modernised.

Speaker Ryan said, earlier in June, that members should wear ""appropriate business attire"". Californian Congresswoman Lucille Roybal-Allard also took part In the UK, a similar debate recently erupted when House of Commons Speaker John Bercow said he was happy to relax the rules.

"The film Dunkirk tells the story of British and Allied troops trapped on the beach surrounded by enemy forces in 1940 Christopher Nolan's World War Two thriller Dunkirk hits the screens in the US and the UK this month, dramatising the daring rescue of 300,000 Allied troops from the approaching German army. But as they escaped across the English Channel, thousands of civilians were left to fend for themselves. This is the story of one family. It was May 1940 and Eva Zusman, her husband Stanislas and four-year-old daughter Anita had arrived in the Belgian beach resort of De Panne from their home in Antwerp. They were joined by Stanislas's father and close family. It was a holiday arranged at the last minute to celebrate Eva's return from her hometown of Geneva, where she was visiting her family. De Panne was ideal for a family summer holiday. White sandy beaches stretched as far as the eye could see. But the day after their arrival on 10 May, Germany invaded Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. For Anita - who is now 80 and living in Geneva - the news came from a local police warden carrying a drum. Belgium's resistance did not last long. Thousands of Nazi troops were marching across the Low Countries towards northern France and the coast. Eva and Stanislas hesitated, aware that as Jews they would be among the first to be targeted in occupied Belgium. After several days they joined others making their way on foot towards France. The pace was slow. Born with a deformed hip, Eva limped heavily while her father-in-law, Abraham, needed a wheelchair. Anita and her cousins, at first terrified of what was happening, were soon distracted by views of the sea and ran ahead. Stanislas bought a car and hired a young local man to drive the Zusman family towards the border. Once in France, they stopped at a guesthouse to rest. Eva, with little Anita, in the fur coat that would become a lifeline when they lost most of their possessions They left their suitcases in the car and paid for their driver to spend the night at the guesthouse with them. In the morning they were to continue their journey south. Eva would not be separated from the fur coat that she had bought in Geneva the previous winter. It was to accompany her every step of her journey. In the morning both car and driver had disappeared. Their only means of transport and their belongings had gone. By 15 May the Netherlands had surrendered to Germany and the Zusman family were on their way to Dunkirk. Dunkirk spirit revives Ealing memories Veteran recalls horror of Dunkirk When they arrived days later, the city felt unnaturally quiet. Bomb explosions could be heard in the distance and smoke was visible to the north. Eva searched for provisions and a place to stay, and found both in a farmhouse on the outskirts of the city. What happened in Dunkirk was to haunt Eva for many years after the war and she wrote down her memories in her diary. ""We didn't know that the entire British army was back in Dunkirk as they were trying to escape back by the sea. We spent a terrible night under bombardment in Dunkirk, we didn't know what awaited the soldiers on the beach. Stanis thought we should board one of the boats heading to England too."" By 21 May, British, French and Belgian troops were in effect trapped along the French coast. A French division had held the Germans near Lille and given the Allies time to gather in Dunkirk, but time was running out. Prime Minister Winston Churchill had called for small private boats and ships to gather along the coast to take part in the evacuation. German bombers pounded British troops stuck in the open on Dunkirk beach Stanis and his family joined other civilians fleeing the bombardment. They headed south-east, hoping for a train to take them away from the fighting. Bikes, carts, horse-drawn carriages, trucks, prams, young and old, women and children fled south in whatever way they could. Nobody knew how long the journey would last or where they would spend the night. More than 20,000 civilians were to lose their lives in France in May and June 1940. Anita still remembers the warmth of her mother's fur coat. She slept on it and covered herself with it when it was cold at night. It became more of a treasure than Eva could have ever imagined. Then came the separation. Stanis decided to buy a motorcycle with a sidecar. Anita with her father in 1939 - they would become separated as they fled the German advance A young man was found to drive it and Eva was to go in the sidecar with her daughter, while Stanis would follow with his father and his brother's family. Their aim was to head south to Lyon, from where they thought they would take a train. The journey was slow because of the crowds of refugees. Eventually the petrol ran out and mother and daughter continued on foot. Even now Anita remembers the hunger. They went for days with little or nothing to eat, sometimes buying bread and vegetables from locals. Eva wrote in her diary: ""I will never forget a farmer who gave me an egg for Anita and a lady who wanted to snatch it from me to give it to her elderly husband. I kept it for Anita, I was able to boil it, she ate it very happily and she vomited it straight away."" Most people on the roads slept under trees and in the bushes, but Eva hoped for a safer place. One night she knocked on the door of a farm, asking for food and a place to sleep. But the farmer was overwhelmed by the number of refugees on his doorstep. Anita and Eva in happier times in Villars, Switzerland, months before they were forced to become refugees Turned away, they sheltered in nearby fields and awoke to the siren of an approaching German Stuka dive-bomber. Stuka bombers terrified the local population at this time, their sirens a warning of imminent attack. Eva watched the plane dive as it approached its target, its machine-gun spraying bullets everywhere. Then it dropped a bomb and the farm went up in flames. Eva and Anita ran as far as they could, to escape the heat of the flames, and the danger that the fire would spread to the dry fields nearby. Eva threw herself on the ground, trying to cover Anita with her own body. What would happen to her child if she died, she thought. It would be better if they died together. Stuka dive-bombers terrified civilians in the Nazis' 1939-1940 Blitzkrieg The German checkpoint was barely visible, as so many people were attempting to get through. Long lines of trucks, carriages and those on foot had found their journey brought to an unexpected stop. Eva had heard rumours that the Germans were coming. But no-one realised that the occupying army was already everywhere. At the checkpoint Eva came face to face with the first Nazi soldier she had ever seen. Unsure how to address him, she decided on German, to do everything in her power to get herself and her daughter out of the French fields and back to the Belgian capital, Brussels. While Eva had been talking, Anita had been picking daisies and came to her mother's rescue. She handed him the bunch of flowers she had picked and remembers the scene to this day. ""He took me in his arms with the flowers, and told my mother that he had a daughter my age at home. He asked us where we came from and what he could do to help. When my mother said Switzerland, he laughed."" There were no open roads into neutral Switzerland, but he did help get them to Brussels. As the rest of the queue looked on in envy, Eva and Anita got into a chauffeur-driven German Volkswagen and were taken to Brussels. After six weeks on the road they were finally reunited with Stanis. The Zusmans returned to their lives in Belgium, but as anti-Semitic laws intensified in Brussels, Anita was put on a Red Cross train to Switzerland, and was followed by her mother. Stanis tried to join them but was caught and eventually murdered by the Nazis at Auschwitz in February 1943. Nadia Ragozhina is a distant cousin of Eva Zusman and is working on a book on her family's past through the 20th Century.

"Fewer people are getting divorced in England and Wales, figures released in June show. Is this a cause for celebration? Reality Check asks whether we are becoming a nation of couples living happily ever after. In 2015,the most recent year we have figures for,external, 101,055 opposite sex couples divorced in England and Wales, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This was a fall of 9.1% from the year before and down 34% from a peak in 2003. But the important figure to look at is the rate. This is the number of every 1,000 people married who are getting divorced and will indicate how stable marriage is. The 2015 figures show that for both men and women the rate dropped to 8.5 per 1,000, from 9.3 the year before. You can see from the graph below that this rate has continued to fall since a peak in 2004. This suggests that marriage has indeed become more stable. So are we a nation full of happily married couples? Well, for the past 45 years, the number of people of the opposite sex getting married has largely been falling. In 2014,the last year for which we have data,external, there were 247,372 marriages between opposite sex couples in England and Wales. This was slightly up on the previous year, 2013, which saw the lowest marriage rate on record. Calculated per 1,000 population, the rate was 22.5 for men and 20.4 for women. The ONS think this was probably because of people avoiding the ""unlucky"" number 13. But there has been a general trend away from tying the knot that began from a peak in 1972, when there were 426,000 marriages. So while marriage can be seen as more stable, fewer of us are tying the knot. This decline can be explained by a growing number of people who are single and a rise in the number of people living together without getting married. Cohabitation may no longer be seen as shamefully living in sin, but figures are harder to collate because, unlike marriage, there is no official record. Instead, we need to look at large household surveys. Although data is not directly comparable with annual marriage and divorce rates, this can provide a useful picture. Figures released by the ONS on Thursday,externalshow that 9.8% of the population of England and Wales were cohabiting in 2016. This is up from 6.8% in 2002. This rise in cohabitation can also be seen in theONS Families and Households UK survey,external. This is a UK-wide report based on theLabour Force Survey,externalwhich interviews 40,000 households every quarter. Here, the ONS definition of family includes same and opposite sex couples with and without dependent children. From their 2016 sample, the ONS calculated that there were 3.3 million cohabiting families across the UK, more than double the 1996 figure of 1.5 million families. This makes cohabiting the fastest growing family type over the past two decades. Of course, it will take time before this rise in cohabitation becomes evident in the population as a whole. In fact, married couples remain the most common form of family type at just under 12.7 million. Again, this includes couples with and without dependent children. So the question becomes; are people living together happily ever after, even though they aren't married? We do not know how many people ""divorce"" from a cohabiting relationship each year but one way to build a picture of whether cohabiting couples remain happily together, is to compare them with married couples. In other words, are people who live together more or less likely to end the relationship than those who marry? Finding an answer to this question involves using longitudinal household surveys that gather data over time. One useful place isThe Millennium Cohort Study,external, which follows the lives of nearly 19,000 children born in the UK in 2000-2001. AnIFS study of this data,externalfound that 9% of couples, married when their child was born, were no longer together when the child turned five, compared with 27% of cohabiting couples. This suggests that cohabiting couples with children are more likely to ""divorce"" than married couples. Harry Benson, of the Marriage Foundation, who advocates for marriage, and Prof Stephen McKay, from the University of Lincoln, looked at another large dataset fromUnderstanding Society,,externalwhich surveys 40,000 UK households. They found that the break-up rate for parents,externalof children who were 14 or 15 in 2009-10 was 24% if the parents were married before the child was born. This rose to 69% in cases where the parents were not married before the child's birth and remained unmarried. However, both the Millennium Cohort Study and Understanding Society only have data for cohabiting couples with children. For cohabiting couples without children, we simply do not have good data. Without complete data on cohabitation, it is impossible to know how many unmarried couples continue to live together. However, the declining divorce rate suggests that marriage itself is becoming more stable.

"Professor Hugh Herr believes we're entering a new era of human-machine interoperability We all like to joke about what might happen if robots, powered by artificial intelligence, decide they want to overthrow humans. That scenario is, at best, decades away. But this week Iâve been pondering something much more immediate, and in my view, more likely. What will happen when humans decide to become robots? ""Weâre at a key transition in human history,â says Prof Hugh Herr, who heads theBiomechatronics,externalGroup at the famed Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He says the groupâs aim is to establish the scientific and technological conditions that will eventually eliminate disability, whether through paralysis or amputation. But when that incredible goal has been achieved, then what? ""Weâre fusing the nervous system with the built world,â he says. ""Weâre transitioning from a relationship where we use technology that is separate from our nervous system, to a new epoch of integration, of human physiology."" Simulating ankles Prof Herr is a double amputee. In 2012, I saw him move a room in London to tears when he revealed his incredibly sophisticated bionic legs that allowed him to move with natural poise and grace. In 2014, Prof Herrâs technology meant Adrianne Haslet-Davis returned to the dancefloor, less than a year after  losing a limb in the Boston marathon bombings. Herfirst performance after the incident brought a TED talk audience instantly to its feet,external. I visited Prof Herrâs lab last week to learn more about the work his team is doing, and where it may lead. Right now, much of the research is focused on doing things the human body can do instinctively, but which are extremely complex to engineer. This foot is able to detect when it is in mid-air, and react accordingly Roman Stolyarov, a researcher at the lab, demonstrated how they are using sensors similar to those found on self-driving cars to give prosthetic legs an awareness of what is around them. This is important to make the leg behave differently when, for example, walking down stairs. The human brain, whether the person realises it or not, is able to instinctively prepare the leg to land on a step. Teaching a prosthesis to do the same is the difference between having a bionic leg and, to put it crassly, a peg leg. âThe motor is able to work in such a way that simulates a real biological ankle joint,â Mr Stolyarov told me. âThe [leg] uses on-board sensors to infer whether the leg is in the air or on the ground, and perform actions that to the person feel much more like real walking than they would get from a passive prosthesis.â The end result is that walking is considerably less tiring for amputees like Ryan Cannon, who lost his leg following complications after he broke it. âI can move in a more rhythmic, symmetrical way,â he told me. ""Being able to move in that manner allows me to walk at a faster pace for a longer distance and to do more activities during the day.â But not all the work carried out here is about replacing limbs. Itâs also looking at improving them. One exoskeleton project reduces the physical exertion when walking by 25%, explained researcher Tyler Clites. âWhat that means is, if you were to walk 100 miles, it would only feel like you walked 75. ""Weâre able to do that today. Those are devices I would expect to see rolling out commercially in the next several years.â Beyond MIT, others are working on similar initiatives.US retail chain Lowes is piloting,externalexoskeltons for staff, developed at Virginia Tech, that assist them with lifting at work. âI definitely think that we are entering an age in which the line between biological systems and synthetic systems is going to be very much blurred,â Mr Clites said. Staff at US chain Lowes are trying out new exoskeleton technology He said this future brings a concern that the rich and fortunate of the world may become physically superior, too. âThen what you do is create a new baseline for physical ability, and perhaps mental ability, thatâs only achievable by people who are already in a position of privilege.â That said, Prof Herr said he was confident that as the cost of prosthetics became lower, it wouldnât leave poorer people behind. ""The cost of robotics is going to plummet,â he said. ""Itâs hard to predict whether thereâll be large separations in society."" Amputation reinvention Before that day, work will be mostly focused on improving the lives of amputees. But in that endeavour, one of the obstacles hindering Prof Herrâs work is one of compatibility. Much like an old computer peripheral that can't plug into a new laptop, nor can most amputees âplug inâ to the latest technologies being developed in this lab. To solve this, the team is urgently trying to change the way limbs are amputated. ""The method that is used today to amputate limbs has fundamentally not changed since the US Civil War,â Prof Herr said. ""So while youâve seen tremendous progress in mechatronics and robotics, youâve not seen progress in how surgeries are performed to amputate limbs. That is now changing. ""Weâre redesigning how limbs are amputated to create the right mechanical and electrical interfacing environment.â He said this interfacing would join the brain directly to the limb, creating a sense among amputees that they are making their bodies whole again. ""What weâre experiencing clinically is that when we attach these limbs to people and we listen to their testimonials, they use language such as 'I have my limb back, Iâm healed, itâs part of meâ.â Once that breakthrough is fully achieved - and thereâs evidence of progress literally walking around Prof Herrâs lab - he said humans will surely begin to consider themselves eligible for an upgrade. ""Weâll be more open to using all kinds of materials to make up our bodies,â he said. ___________ Follow Dave Leeon Twitter,external You can reach Dave securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +1 (628) 400-7370 Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Watch: Ferocious and explosive fire burns behind CBS reporter Liam Payne cause of death confirmed as UK inquest opens Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

"For some, Rudolf Nureyev's relationships with men as well as women have tarnished his reputation in Russia The Bolshoi hasn't pulled a premiere so late in the day since Soviet times. So whenit called off Nureyev: The Ballet, rumours immediately began to fly. The theatre boss insisted the work was so complex it just wasn't ready. But another theory has persisted - that Rudolf Nureyev, who mesmerised audiences and defined an era in dance, was just too gay for today's Russia. The theatre denied that. After all, they knew Nureyev's story when they commissioned the ballet: his love affairs and his death after developing Aids. So why are so many so quick to disbelieve them? Homophobia is pretty rife in Russia. Talk of gay rights often brings snorts about ""Western values"" that no-one wants imposed. Russia has a different culture, different values, say people from politicians and religious figures down. Tolerance doesn't always seem like one of them. Attempts to stage Gay Pride events have ended in punch-ups and arrests: anti-gay vigilantes have set up dates, only to attack the men on arrival and film it. And in Chechnya, it's not long since reports emerged of dozens of gay men being rounded up by police and tortured. Trump and Putin: Comparing the men behind the meeting The Rudolf Nureyev phenomenon Chechen police 'kidnap and torture gay men' - LGBT activists The events in Chechnya are exceptional. But it seems that a rise in homophobia has matched a rise in anti-Western feeling more generally here, all of it part of a broader backlash against the chaos - others call it freedom - of the 1990s. That decade is now painted as a time when the West was running the show here, supposedly ""forcing"" its alien ways and values on Russia, weak after the collapse of the USSR. Now back on its own two feet, this country's busy shaking off that ""domination"". Spreading harmony? The Russian and American presidents strike a familiar pose It's all led by the ultimate macho man, Vladimir Putin. To his supporters, Putin is the judo black belt, teetotal athlete who's taking on a degenerate, weak - even effeminate - West. He's the president who strips naked to the waist and rides horses; he descends in submarines and soars through the skies in fighter jets. Images of all of those adrenalin-pumped moments and more are plastered over souvenir mugs for sale in Moscow underpasses, so enthusiasts can enjoy their very own Putin pin-up with their coffee. It's under Putin that Russia's been flexing its military muscle again too. Whether it's flying fighter jets or launching cruise missiles in Syria or rolling tanks on parade across Red Square, this country wants to be seen as powerful again. So it's no surprise that Vladimir Vladimirovich is a big fan of manspreading. From news conferences to receiving foreign presidents, sitting with his legs wide apart is Putin's favourite macho pose. At the G20 summit in Hamburg, he and Donald Trump seemed to be competing to see who could spread furthest. The Bolshoi says that Nureyev will open in May 2018 All of this, of course, is painting with broad brushstrokes. Russia is not totally testosterone-fuelled but a place of nuance and variety. If not, the head of Russia's most celebrated theatre would never have chosen a ballet about Nureyev in the first place. The director would never have included love scenes, or men in drag and there would have been no vast, full-frontal nude portrait of the Soviet star. One dancer I met called Nureyev the most important ballet he's ever worked on - precisely because of the themes it tackles. But he fears the production may prove too radical for the Bolshoi, more like an antiques shop, in his view, full of old, admired classics. The Bolshoi has promised that Nureyev will open - uncensored - early next May. If it does, then maybe President Putin could go. He could sit in the front row, minus the manspread, and show that he sees Rudolf Nureyev as a great Russian to celebrate - whatever his sexuality.

"This video can not be played Tony Blair: ""One option... would be Britain staying within a reformed European Union"" Some EU leaders may be prepared to compromise on the free movement of people to help Britain stay in the single market, Tony Blair has said. He told the Today programme one option was for Britain ""staying within a reformed EU"". The ex-PM said he would not disclose conversations he had had in Europe - but insisted he was not speaking ""on a whim"". The government insists Brexit will give the UK greater control of its borders. Labour's shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said Mr Blair ""hadn't really listened to the nature of the debate going on in the pubs, the clubs and school gates"". ""We have to respect the referendum result,"" Mr McDonnell said, adding that Labour could ""negotiate access to the single market"". Mr Blair spoke to the BBC after he argued in an article for his own institute that there was room for compromise on free movement of people. He told Today the situation in Europe was different to when Britain voted to leave the EU - a move Mr Blair described as ""the most serious it's taken since the Second World War"". He said France's new president, Emmanuel Macron - whose political party was formed last year - was proposing ""far-reaching reforms"" for the EU. ""Europe itself is now looking at its own reform programme,"" Mr Blair said. ""They will have an inner circle in the EU that will be part of the eurozone and an outer circle."" When pressed on what evidence there was to suggest European nations would compromise, Mr Blair said: ""I'm not going to disclose conversations I've had within Europe, but I'm not saying this literally on the basis of a whim. ""They will make reforms that I think will make it much more comfortable for Britain to fit itself in that outer circle."" Brexit: All you need to know Expats, exports, security: What's worrying the EU He said ""majorities"" of people in France, Germany and the UK supported changes around benefits and with regards to those who come to Europe without a job. ""I'm not saying these could be negotiated,"" Mr Blair said. ""I'm simply saying if we were looking at this from the point of view of the interests of the country, one option within this negotiation would be Britain staying within a reformed European Union."" He said the majority of EU migrants in the UK are ""people we want in this country"". Support for free movement rules 'eroding' The people who will negotiate Brexit 10 Areas that will shape the Brexit talks EU leaders have previously said the UK must accept free movement of people if it wants to stay inside the single market. But in his article for the Institute for Global Change,external, Mr Blair said senior figures had told him they were willing to consider changes to one of the key principles of the single market. ""The French and Germans share some of the British worries, notably around immigration, and would compromise on freedom of movement,"" he wrote. But last week the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said the freedom of movement of people, goods, services and capital - the key principles of the single market - were ""indivisible"". Prime Minister Theresa May has pledged to control EU migration and has reiterated her commitment to reducing net migration to the tens of thousands. She has said that outside the single market, and without rules on freedom of movement, the UK will be able to make its own decisions on immigration. Mr Blair also said more was known now about the effects of the Brexit process on the UK. ""We know our currency is down significantly, that's a prediction by the international markets as to our future prosperity. We know businesses are already moving jobs out of the country. ""We know last year we were the fastest-growing economy in the G7. We're now the slowest."" Mr Blair accepted Labour was behind its leader Jeremy Corbyn ""for now"". But he warned if Brexit was combined with leaving the single market, and ""the largest spending programme Labour had ever proposed"" the country ""would be in a very serious situation."" This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""I hope he (Tony Blair) has looked very carefully at our manifesto"" Mr Blair said leaving the single market was a ""damaging position"" shared by Labour and he urged the party's leadership to champion a ""radically distinct"" position on Europe. But Jeremy Corbyn said Labour's position on free movement was ""very clear"", adding: ""We would protect EU nationals' rights to remain here, including the rights of family reunion."" Responding to Mr Blair's comments, the party leader said: ""I think our economy will do very well under a Labour government. ""It will be an investment-led economy that works for all - so we won't have zero-hour contracts, insecure employment. ""We won't have communities being left behind."" Mr Blair has previously said Brexit was an issue he felt so strongly about, that it tempted him to return to politics. But Labour MP Frank Field, who backed Brexit, said he did not think Mr Blair was ""a person to influence public opinion now"". ""We're now set on the course of leaving [the EU]. We actually need a safe harbour to continue those negotiations when we're out. ""And I wouldn't actually be believing those people who are set on destroying our attempts to leave, who are now appearing as wolves in sheep's clothing."" Richard Tice, of pro-Brexit group Leave Means Leave, said Mr Blair's comments ""demonstrate how out of touch he is with British voters"". ""The former prime minister believes that freedom of movement is the only issue with the EU, when in reality the British people also voted to leave in order to take back control of our laws and money and no longer be dictated to by the European Court of Justice,"" he added. Conservative MEP David Campbell Bannerman said Mr Blair's assertion that Britain could find a way to remain within a reformed EU was a ""dodgy claim, as opposed to a dodgy dossier"". ""We've heard this all before. David Cameron was given such assurances and in the end the EU did nothing for him. ""If they do nothing for Cameron, they're not going to do anything for Blair, I'm afraid.""

"This video can not be played ""My helmet saved me,"" says London acid attack victim Jabed Hussain The victim of an acid attack has said it felt like fire had been thrown at him when two moped riders pulled up alongside him and threw a corrosive substance in his face. Jabed Hussain, 32, was one of five people attacked during a 90-minute period in London on Thursday night. The delivery driver, whose own moped was stolen, said ""my helmet saved me"". Two teenage boys have been arrested. The government said it was considering more controls on corrosive substances. ""I took off my helmet and I was just screaming for help because it's getting dry and as much as it's getting dry it's burning. So I was just screaming for water,"" Mr Hussain said, adding that he was now too scared to go back to work. The attacks - five in total - took place across Islington, Stoke Newington and Hackney on Thursday, with one victim suffering ""life-changing injuries"". Ch Insp Ben Clark, from the Met's Hackney Borough, said all of the victims were riding mopeds. Police have said they are linking the attacks and the boys - aged 15 and 16 - had been arrested on suspicion of robbery and causing grievous bodily harm. Food delivery services Deliveroo and UberEATS confirmed two of the victims were couriers working for the firms. Deliveroo called the attack ""truly shocking"" while UberEats said it was ""horrific and senseless"". Why are acid attacks on the rise? How to treat a chemical burn The attacks happened amid rising concern about the number of assaults involving corrosive substances in London. Since 2010,there have been more than 1,800 reports of attacks involving corrosive fluids in the capital. So far this year - excluding Thursday night - the Met has recorded 119 such attacks. And in 2016, it was used in 458 crimes, compared with 261 in 2015, according to Met Police figures. On Friday, a moped rider in his 20s was possibly hit with acid following an attempted robbery at 17:00 BST in Dagenham, east London. The Met said the victim was approached by two males on a moped who squirted what was described as a ""noxious substance"" at him as they tried to steal his moped. He was taken to hospital but has now been discharged. Met Commissioner Cressida Dick said the growing trend of victims being doused with corrosive liquids was concerning. Labour MP for East Ham Stephen Timmshas tabled an adjournment debate for Monday in the House of Commons,externalon the rise. Jaf Shah, from the Acid Survivors Trust, has called for a licensing system and said under 18s should be prohibited from purchasing sulphuric or any form of concentrated acid. A Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister viewed acid attacks as ""horrific"". ""We are working with the police to see what more we could do."" Home Office minister Sarah Newton said the government was considering tighter controls, but said regulation would be difficult, as ""these chemicals are under everyone's kitchen sinks"". This video can not be played Footage posted by Turon Miah shows an acid attack victim being doused with water A Met spokesman said officers were looking at whether the attackers were targeting moped riders to steal their bikes. The 16-year-old boy was arrested in Kingsbury Road, north-west London, early on Friday, while the 15-year-old was arrested in Stoke Newington several hours later. 22:25 BST:A 32-year-old man on a moped in Hackney Road is left with facial injuries after a moped, with two male riders, pulls up alongside and attacks him. They also steal his moped. 22:49 BST:A 44-year-old man has a corrosive substance thrown in his face by two men on a moped in Islington. 23:05 BST:A corrosive substance is reported to have been thrown in the face of a 52-year-old man by two men on a moped in Shoreditch High Street. The victim is taken to hospital. 23:18 BST:Police receive reports of a robbery in Cazenove Road, Stoke Newington, where a corrosive substance is thrown. A 24-year-old man suffers facial injuries described as ""life changing"". 23:37 BST:A 33-year-old man on a moped in traffic in Chatsworth Road, Clapton, has liquid sprayed in his face and his vehicle stolen. Hackney resident Jon Moody said he was watching TV on Thursday when he heard screaming and ran to the window. ""I heard a high-pitched scream but thought it was the boys playing football... I heard more shouting and ran to my window,"" he said. ""I could see a man in serious distress, he was screaming in pain. ""There were only two police officers with the victim, they took out two large water canisters and poured it over him."" He said he believed the victim was a delivery driver and about 20 fellow delivery drivers turned up at the scene. This video can not be played What should you do in case of a chemical burn?

"Husbands can play old-school games such as Tekken 3 in the pods A Chinese mall has introduced ""husband storage"" facilities for wives to leave their spouse while they shop, it's reported. According toThe Paper,external, the Global Harbour mall in Shanghai has erected a number of glass pods for wives to leave any disgruntled husbands that don't want to be dragged around the shops. Inside each individual pod is a chair, monitor, computer and gamepad, and men can sit and play retro 1990s games. Currently, the service is free, but staff told the newspaper that in future months, users will be able to scan a QR code and pay a small sum for the service using their mobile phones. A few men that tried out the pods told The Paper that they thought they were a novel idea. Mr Yang said he thinks the pods are ""Really great. I've just played Tekken 3 and felt like I was back at school!"" Another man, Mr Wu, agreed, but said that that he thought there were areas for improvement. ""There's no ventilation or air conditioning, I sat playing for five minutes and was drenched in sweat."" The pods have been the source of much humour on Chinesesocial media,external, and have sparked debate about whether they could be rolled out even wider.

"Clockwise from top left: Sunderland, Paisley, Swansea, Coventry, Stoke Coventry, Paisley, Sunderland, Swansea and Stoke-on-Trent will compete to host a year-long celebration of art and performance as UK City of Culture 2021. The five locations are on a shortlist for the title, but six other bidding towns and cities missed out. The five left in the race will hope to emulate the success of Hull, which is UK City of Culture this year. The title is awarded every four years and the winner for 2021 will be the third UK City of Culture. It's the birthplace of Philip Larkin, one of England's finest poets, and the home of the 2 Tone ska movement through bands like The Specials and The Selecter. Venues would include Warwick Arts Centre, the Belgrade Theatre and the Herbert Art Gallery and Museum. It's not just about the existing culture - it is, as the bid organisers say, ""about changing the reputation of a city"". This Renfrewshire town, population 76,000, is perhaps most famous for the Paisley print - the intricate, colourful designs that were inspired by Kashmiri patterns in the 18th Century and popularised in the psychedelic 1960s. It was also home to Gerry Rafferty, known for his hit Baker Street. Former Doctor Who star David Tennant grew up in the city, while Paolo Nutini's dad runs a fish and chip cafe there. There are plans for Paisley Museum to have a Â£42m revamp - though it's not due to reopen until 2022. Stoke is most famous as the capital of the English ceramics industry, which it is trying to revive, with designers like Emma Bridgewater there andKeith Brymer Jonesfrom the BBC's Great Pottery Throwdown about to move into the old Spode factory. It can also claim Robbie Williams, the Staffordshire Hoard - a treasure trove of Anglo-Saxon gold - and, in nearby Newcastle-under-Lyme, the pioneering New Vic theatre. Sunderland's claims to fame range from Middle Ages chronicler Venerable Bede and England's first ever stained glass window to a fertile indie music scene that spawned bands like Frankie and the Heartstrings and The Futureheads. It also has The National Glass Centre, the Northern Gallery of Contemporary Art and Sunderland Empire. And a new Â£10m cultural quarter is in development, including a music and arts hub in the old fire station. Swansea Bay was on the shortlist last time and the city has now come back again. It is the home of poet Dylan Thomas - as well as a permanent exhibition that opened on his 100th birthday in 2014 - not to mention Catherine Zeta Jones and TV writer Russell T Davies. Its Glynn Vivian Art Gallery reopened last year after a Â£6m facelift, and the council says being City of Culture would kick-start its longer-term plans for ""culture-led regeneration"". The places that didn't make the shortlist include Perth, which had been the bookmakers' favourite. All the bidding cities are particularly keen to win the title after seeing the example ofwhat's been achieved in Hull. Recent research suggests nine out of 10 local residents experienced a City of Culture event in the first three months of the year, while being City of Culture has boosted the local economy by an estimated Â£60m. Hull's year as City of Culture has been seen as a success so far Arts minister John Glen said: ""The strength of the competition showed us how valuable our cultural assets are to our towns, boosting tourism and jobs in local communities. ""I have seen first hand how Hull has embraced its status as City of Culture 2017, and how beneficial it has been for the area. I am looking forward to seeing what will come in 2021."" The UK City of Culture scheme is separate from the European Capital of Culture, a title shared this year by Aarhus in Denmark and Paphos in Cyprus. A British city is expected to be European Capital of Culture in 2023 - despite Brexit - with Leeds, Dundee and Milton Keynes among those interested.

"Young families were particularly hard hit by an ""abrupt"" slowdown in living standards in the year before the general election, a think tank says. The Resolution Foundation,externalfound that average income growth halved to 0.7% during that period compared with the previous year. Those aged 25-34 were worst hit, it said, with their average incomes no higher than they were in 2002-03. The Treasury said it was taking ""concrete steps"" to help families. The Resolution Foundation analyses living standards, and says its goal is to improve outcomes for people on low and modest incomes. It said young families were the only group whose incomes have failed to return to pre-financial crisis levels. Pensioner incomes grew by 30% over that 15-year period, the think tank said. ""The typical 25 to 34-year-old appears no better off today than in 2002-03,"" the report said. ""In comparison, typical incomes for all other age groups are now above, or very near, their pre-recession peaks."" The fall in average income growth followed a ""mini-boom"" between 2013 and 2015, the foundation said, when living standards improved. Are pensioners better off than workers? Pensions, parents and children: Am I better off? Families in rented accommodation have experienced little or no income growth, while home-owners had a 1.7% growth, the report found. A Treasury spokesperson said the government was taking action to increase people's incomes and help families ""keep more of what they earn"". The Treasury said: ""We have cut taxes so a basic rate taxpayer pays Â£1,000 less income tax compared to 2010 and introduced theNational Living Wagewhich means Â£1,400 a year extra for a worker."" The spokesperson said the government was investing in affordable homes andgovernment-backed loansto help first-time buyers. The think tank's senior economic analyst, Adam Corlett, said: ""For millions of young and lower-income families the slowdown over the last year has come off the back of a tough decade for living standards, providing a bleak economic backdrop to the shock election result. ""Over the last 15 years and four prime ministers, Britain has failed to deliver decent living standards growth for young families and those on low incomes. ""Rising housing costs have added further financial pressures."" Over the year, incomes among low to middle-income families grew by 0.4%, compared with 1% for those in the top half of the income distribution. Two out of five of this group said they were not able to save Â£10 per month, while 42% cannot afford a holiday at least one week per year. ""Despite the welcome political focus on such 'just managing families', we estimate that income growth for this group in 2016-17, ahead of the election, was lower than for higher income groups,"" the report said. The top 1% of households had a ""rapid recovery"" in incomes, the report said, and now have an 8.7% share of the nation's income. The think tank said the fortunes of the top 1% had been the driving force of rising inequality since the mid-1990s. Inequality among the remaining 99% of the population fell over the same period.

"This video can not be played Tony Blair: ""One option... would be Britain staying within a reformed European Union"" Some EU leaders may be prepared to compromise on the free movement of people to help Britain stay in the single market, Tony Blair has said. He told the Today programme one option was for Britain ""staying within a reformed EU"". The ex-PM said he would not disclose conversations he had had in Europe - but insisted he was not speaking ""on a whim"". The government insists Brexit will give the UK greater control of its borders. Labour's shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said Mr Blair ""hadn't really listened to the nature of the debate going on in the pubs, the clubs and school gates"". ""We have to respect the referendum result,"" Mr McDonnell said, adding that Labour could ""negotiate access to the single market"". Mr Blair spoke to the BBC after he argued in an article for his own institute that there was room for compromise on free movement of people. He told Today the situation in Europe was different to when Britain voted to leave the EU - a move Mr Blair described as ""the most serious it's taken since the Second World War"". He said France's new president, Emmanuel Macron - whose political party was formed last year - was proposing ""far-reaching reforms"" for the EU. ""Europe itself is now looking at its own reform programme,"" Mr Blair said. ""They will have an inner circle in the EU that will be part of the eurozone and an outer circle."" When pressed on what evidence there was to suggest European nations would compromise, Mr Blair said: ""I'm not going to disclose conversations I've had within Europe, but I'm not saying this literally on the basis of a whim. ""They will make reforms that I think will make it much more comfortable for Britain to fit itself in that outer circle."" Brexit: All you need to know Expats, exports, security: What's worrying the EU He said ""majorities"" of people in France, Germany and the UK supported changes around benefits and with regards to those who come to Europe without a job. ""I'm not saying these could be negotiated,"" Mr Blair said. ""I'm simply saying if we were looking at this from the point of view of the interests of the country, one option within this negotiation would be Britain staying within a reformed European Union.""

But in his article for the Institute for Global Change,external, Mr Blair said senior figures had told him they were willing to consider changes to one of the key principles of the single market. ""The French and Germans share some of the British worries, notably around immigration, and would compromise on freedom of movement,"" he wrote. But last week the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said the freedom of movement of people, goods, services and capital - the key principles of the single market - were ""indivisible"". Prime Minister Theresa May has pledged to control EU migration and has reiterated her commitment to reducing net migration to the tens of thousands. She has said that outside the single market, and without rules on freedom of movement, the UK will be able to make its own decisions on immigration. Mr Blair also said more was known now about the effects of the Brexit process on the UK. ""We know our currency is down significantly, that's a prediction by the international markets as to our future prosperity. We know businesses are already moving jobs out of the country. ""We know last year we were the fastest-growing economy in the G7. We're now the slowest."" Mr Blair accepted Labour was behind its leader Jeremy Corbyn ""for now"". But he warned if Brexit was combined with leaving the single market, and ""the largest spending programme Labour had ever proposed"" the country ""would be in a very serious situation."" This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""I hope he (Tony Blair) has looked very carefully at our manifesto"" Mr Blair said leaving the single market was a ""damaging position"" shared by Labour and he urged the party's leadership to champion a ""radically distinct"" position on Europe. But Jeremy Corbyn said Labour's position on free movement was ""very clear"", adding: ""We would protect EU nationals' rights to remain here, including the rights of family reunion."" Responding to Mr Blair's comments, the party leader said: ""I think our economy will do very well under a Labour government. ""It will be an investment-led economy that works for all - so we won't have zero-hour contracts, insecure employment. ""We won't have communities being left behind."" Mr Blair has previously said Brexit was an issue he felt so strongly about, that it tempted him to return to politics. But Labour MP Frank Field, who backed Brexit, said he did not think Mr Blair was ""a person to influence public opinion now"". ""We're now set on the course of leaving [the EU]. We actually need a safe harbour to continue those negotiations when we're out. ""And I wouldn't actually be believing those people who are set on destroying our attempts to leave, who are now appearing as wolves in sheep's clothing."" Richard Tice, of pro-Brexit group Leave Means Leave, said Mr Blair's comments ""demonstrate how out of touch he is with British voters"". ""The former prime minister believes that freedom of movement is the only issue with the EU, when in reality the British people also voted to leave in order to take back control of our laws and money and no longer be dictated to by the European Court of Justice,"" he added. Conservative MEP David Campbell Bannerman said Mr Blair's assertion that Britain could find a way to remain within a reformed EU was a ""dodgy claim, as opposed to a dodgy dossier"".

"The Ethiopian wolf has lost 99% of its range Six of the world's large carnivores have lost more than 90% of their historic range, according to a study. The Ethiopian wolf, red wolf, tiger, lion, African wild dog and cheetah have all been squeezed out as land is lost to human settlements and farming. Reintroduction of carnivores into areas where they once roamed is vital in conservation, say scientists. This relies on human willingness to share the landscape with the likes of the wolf. Theresearch,external, published inRoyal Society Open Science,external, was carried out by Christopher Wolf and William Ripple of Oregon State University. They mapped the current range of 25 large carnivores using International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List data. This was compared with historic maps from 500 years ago. The work shows that large carnivore range contractions are a global issue, said Christopher Wolf. ""Of the 25 large carnivores that we studied, 60% (15 species) have lost more than half of their historic ranges,'' he explained. ""This means that scientifically sound reintroductions of large carnivores into areas where they have been lost is vital both to conserve the large carnivores and to promote their important ecological effects. ""This is very dependent on increasing human tolerance of large carnivores - a  key predictor of reintroduction success."" The tiger has lost 95% of its range The researchers say re-wilding programmes will be most successful in regions with low human population density, little livestock, and limited agriculture. Additionally, regions with large networks of protected areas and favourable human attitudes toward carnivores are better suited for such schemes. ""Increasing human tolerance of large carnivores may be the best way to save these species from extinction,"" said co-researcher William Ripple. ""Also, more large protected areas are urgently needed for large carnivore conservation."" When policy is favourable, carnivores may naturally return to parts of their historic ranges. This has begun to happen in parts of Europe with brown bears, lynx, and grey wolves. The Eurasian lynx and grey wolf are among the carnivores that have the smallest range contractions. The dingo and several types of hyena are also doing relatively well, compared with the lion and tiger. Follow Helen onTwitter,external.

""We know last year we were the fastest-growing economy in the G7. We're now the slowest."" Mr Blair accepted Labour was behind its leader Jeremy Corbyn ""for now"". But he warned if Brexit was combined with leaving the single market, and ""the largest spending programme Labour had ever proposed"" the country ""would be in a very serious situation."" This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""I hope he (Tony Blair) has looked very carefully at our manifesto"" Mr Blair said leaving the single market was a ""damaging position"" shared by Labour and he urged the party's leadership to champion a ""radically distinct"" position on Europe. But Jeremy Corbyn said Labour's position on free movement was ""very clear"", adding: ""We would protect EU nationals' rights to remain here, including the rights of family reunion."" Responding to Mr Blair's comments, the party leader said: ""I think our economy will do very well under a Labour government. ""It will be an investment-led economy that works for all - so we won't have zero-hour contracts, insecure employment. ""We won't have communities being left behind."" Mr Blair has previously said Brexit was an issue he felt so strongly about, that it tempted him to return to politics. But Labour MP Frank Field, who backed Brexit, said he did not think Mr Blair was ""a person to influence public opinion now"". ""We're now set on the course of leaving [the EU]. We actually need a safe harbour to continue those negotiations when we're out. ""And I wouldn't actually be believing those people who are set on destroying our attempts to leave, who are now appearing as wolves in sheep's clothing."" Richard Tice, of pro-Brexit group Leave Means Leave, said Mr Blair's comments ""demonstrate how out of touch he is with British voters"". ""The former prime minister believes that freedom of movement is the only issue with the EU, when in reality the British people also voted to leave in order to take back control of our laws and money and no longer be dictated to by the European Court of Justice,"" he added. Conservative MEP David Campbell Bannerman said Mr Blair's assertion that Britain could find a way to remain within a reformed EU was a ""dodgy claim, as opposed to a dodgy dossier"". ""We've heard this all before. David Cameron was given such assurances and in the end the EU did nothing for him. ""If they do nothing for Cameron, they're not going to do anything for Blair, I'm afraid.""

"Mr Castro said he rejected Mr Trump's ""manipulation of the topic of human rights"" The president of Cuba has spoken publicly for the first time against US President Donald Trump's rollback of a thaw between the two countries a month ago. President Raul Castro said ""attempts to destroy the revolution"" would fail. Mr Trump has tightened restrictions on US travel to and business with the communist island. But the US embassy in Havana, re-opened by former President Barack Obama, is still operating. Four takeaways from Trump's Cuba policy Trump's plans for Cuba: What could change? Mr Castro was speaking in front of Cuba's national assembly. It was his first public comment on the policy changes Mr Trump announced a month ago. State-run Cuban media quoted Mr Castro as saying that Mr Trump was using ""old and hostile rhetoric"" and had returned to ""confrontation that roundly failed over 55 years"". He said: ""We reject the manipulation of the topic of human rights against Cuba, which can be proud of much in this area and does not need to receive lessons from the United States nor anyone."" Mr Trump anchoredhis policy rollbackin human rights concerns raised by political opponents of Cuba's communist government, many of whom have fled to Miami where Mr Trump announced the changes on 16 June. Mr Castro continued: ""Cuba and the United States can cooperate and live side by side, respecting their differences. But no one should expect that for this, one should have to make concessions inherent to one's sovereignty and independence."" Mr Castro will step down as president in seven months, but will remain the head of the country's Communist Party.

"Billie Eilish: ""Lyrics are so important. I don't think people realise how important they are"". Billie Eilish may only be 15 years old, but she's already a formidable talent (and a real-life pirate, but more on that later). A member of the Los Angeles Children's Chorus, she wrote her first song - about falling into a black hole - when she was four. But it was her dance instructor who unlocked her talent for smart, dark pop songs when he asked her to submit a song for class. Along with her older brother Finneas, Billie came up withOcean Eyes,external- an astonishingly assured ballad which compared falling in love to falling off a cliff under ""napalm skies"". She posted it on Soundcloud so her teacher could hear it, went to bed, and woke up to a flurry of emails about her burgeoning music career. Ocean Eyes has racked up nine million plays since Eilish uploaded it to Soundcloud last summer Since then, she's been on a steep upswing, signed by Interscope Records and releasing one head-turning track after another. The highlight (so far) isBellyache,external, in which she sings from the point of view of a conflicted psychopath. ""Where's my mind?""she trills as an acoustic guitar trades blows with a gut-punch drum loop.""Maybe it's in the gutter, where I left my lover."" It's the pop equivalent of a Tarantino movie - finding comic absurdity in the midst of eye-popping gore. The lyrics might keep it off the radio, but Billie isn't too worried. ""I don't need many people to care,"" says the singer. ""Even if other people don't like it, I like it."" As she gears up to release her first EP, Eilish sat down for a frank chat with the BBC about her lyrical fantasies, getting to grips with the music industry and her very unusual middle name. Hello Billie Eilishâ¦ Have I pronounced that right? Yes! It's eye-lish, like eyelash with a lish. Your family name is O'Connell, though, so is that a stage name? It is my middle name. So I'm Bille Eilish Pirate Baird O'Connell. Pirate! That's an amazing name. Pretty weird, right? Pirate was going to be my middle name but then my uncle had a problem with it because pirates are bad. Then Baird is my mother's name. The singer co-writes most of her material with her brother, Finneas, who you may recognise as Alistair from the TV show Glee It's been a year since Ocean Eyes went onto Soundcloud. It was written for a dance class, right? Oh yeah! My dance teacher knew that I sing, so he asked us to make a song and I thought that was the coolest thing ever. My brother had written Ocean Eyes and we recorded it, basing all of the production around contemporary and lyrical dance. I think of most songs that way - if you can't dance to a song, it's not a song. Anyway, we put it on Soundcloud, literally to send the link to my teacher and then it just grew from there. It's been played more than nine million times now. When did you notice it was taking off? It was really confusing. I didn't understand what was going on. I literally thought it was like my popular friend had reposted it. 'Wow, it's getting so many listens!' What happened next? A lot of meetings! ""I don't like it when people know my age,"" says the singer. What are those meetings like? Do you go in super-confident, like, ""I've got the goods, what are you going to offer me?"" or is it totally nerve-wracking? I was 13 when this started, so I didn't know anything about anything. I'd go into meetings and they'd say, ""So Billie, what do you think?"" and I'd just be like, ""Am I supposed to know? Because I don't,"". But eventually I got the hang of it. And now the meetings I have are a bit more like, ""OK, Billie, what exactly do you want?' and then I explain every single detail of every single thing that I'm thinking; and people do it! It's insane. You have stuff floating around in your mind and you tell somebody and they go, ""Oh yeah, we can make that happen"". It's like, ""What? WHY?"". So it's like Spider-Man. With great power comes great responsibility. I am exactly like Spider-Man. I promise. I get the impression from your lyrics, especially, that you have a very clear idea of the things you want to talk about.  How do you approach writing? Lyrics are so important but they're really underrated. So many lyrics right now are just the same thing - ""Oh, I love you but I'm sad because you don't love me and...blah"". You can say that in a more interesting way. Me and my brother write a lot of fiction. Like in Bellyache, obviously. I don't kill people. That's a relief. Right? But you can put yourself in a character or a situation you would not normally be in. You don't have to be in love to write a love song. You don't have to kill somebody to write a song about killing somebody. It's like jumping into another world. The singer says she's been approached to write songs for other people after her own music got noticed So do you consider it like acting? Or do you really want to murder someone, but haven't got round to it yet? Yikes! Maybe... But both of my parents are actors, and I was in plays when I was younger. Then I went to an audition and I came back going, ""I hate this. I'm not doing this ever again."" What happened at that audition? Some lame stuff, dude. But it's just fun to get to tell a story [in a song]. If you just write about things you've been through, you might get to a point where you go, ""I don't feel like this any more, so it's not worth pursuing"". No. No. It's especially worth it. What's the lyric you're proudest of? Well, I wrote Bellyache with my brother, and he wrote Ocean Eyes, and we have a ton of other songs on the EP that I'm really excited about. Do you find you write better with him than anyone else? We've had sessions with artists and writers and producers and not that those sessions were bad, but when we write, just us together, it's so much more raw, I guess. And straight from the heart. Tell me how Bellyache came to be... I wasn't like, ""Let's write a song about killing someone!"". We were sitting in my garage rehearsing for a show with my brother's friends. Finneas started riffing on the guitar, and one of them started playing on the piano, and I sang the first line - ""Sitting all alone, with a mouthful of gum in the driveway"". Then my brother sang, ""My friends aren't far, in the back of the car"" and I was like ""Lay their bodies,"" like I had killed them. And he just said, ""Woah, that's so cool!"". The video for Bellyache sees Billie on the run after her crime spree, pulling a trolley full of cash It just grew from there. He came into my room a couple of days later and he was like, 'dude, I wrote the chorus for this'. And he sang it all, and the last line was, ""And now I got a bellyache"" and I was like, ""That is genius"". It's such a childish line. No grown up says, ""I have a bellyache, I gotta go"". But it's kind of part of the song, because it's about someone whose really young and knows they're a psychopath. They're like, ""Maybe I shouldn't steal this money and kill these people... but I'm going to anyway"". It's a very cinematic lyric. You can see the film opening on you in the car, then the camera cuts to the bodies in the boot. Some people don't really realise what I'm saying until they've listened to it a couple of times. My friends would be like, ""Dude I was listening to Bellyache the other day, actually listening to it, and what the hell were you writing about?"". And then you say, ""I'm glad you've heard it. Now never cross me again"". Exactly. Don't wrong me. Your new song is calledCopycat,external. What's that about? You'll understand when you hear it, but it's about people who feel justified in copying everything you do. It's not about someone particular, I just wrote it. I had two sisters growing up - and that sort of thing seemed to happen quite frequently in their peer groups. Is it a girl thing? It probably is, and it's tortuous. Especially if it's somebody close to you. It's like, ""Be your own self - don't try to be me!"". The singer, who turned 15 in December, is accompanied on the road by her mother You've just played your first headline show in the UK. Do you get nervous? Not really. I don't get nerves, I just get excited. Does your dance training help with confidence and stage presence? Yeah. I mean, I was really a dancer. Then I got injured, so I haven't really danced since Ocean Eyes came out. Oh no, what happened? I strained my growth plate. My bone separated from my muscle in my hip. It was really bad. It's so weird, because it can't happen to you if you're over 16 - but I was in a class with a bunch of seniors, because I was at that level. We were doing hip-hop and it just popped. So I haven't really danced since then, which was like a year-and-a-half ago, which has been horrible. There is a dance video for Ocean Eyes, though, so are you on the mend? I was injured for the dance video, actually. I had sprained my ankle in December,and I had also strained my groin and I have shoulder problems. That's a sign to concentrate on the music. I guess it is, but I'm trying to get back into dance slowly. I love movement. I love moshing.  I always heads right for the front and dig in there and mosh really hard with all the guys. None of the girls want to mosh, so I'm like the only girl getting punched in the face. Billie Eilish releases her new song, Copycat, today.
