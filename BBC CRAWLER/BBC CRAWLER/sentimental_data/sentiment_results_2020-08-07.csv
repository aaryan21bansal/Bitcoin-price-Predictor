"Almost 37,000 people crossed the English Channel in small boats in 2024, figures released on New Year's Day show. Last year was the deadliest on record for people trying to make the crossing, according to a United Nations agency. In 2024, 36,816 were detected making the crossing. That's higher than in 2023, when29,437 people arrived. However, the highest recorded figures are for 2022, when 45,755 people made the crossing. Since 2018, when figures were first recorded, more than 150,000 people have arrived in small boats. Of those who arrived in 2024, more than23,000 did so after Labour won the July general election.

Applications peaked at about 103,000 in 2002, as people fled conflicts in Afghanistan, Somalia and Iraq. Claims then fell sharply, dropping to a 20-year low of 22,600 in 2010. However, numbers rose again throughout the 2010s, as refugees fled Syria. Asylum applications have risen again in recent years, more than doubling from 45,318 in the year to September 2021 to 92,776 just one year later, followed by smaller increases since then. In the year to September 2024, the largest number of asylum seekers came from Pakistan, with more than 9,500 applications. Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Syria, and India were among the other countries with most applications. Ukrainian refugees who came to the UK after Russia's invasion of their country are not included in the figures. As of 26 November 2024,266,300 visas had been issued to Ukrainian refugees,external, who came through legal routes set up by the UK government. There are separate arrangements for a few other specific groups, such as some Afghan refugees and Hong Kong citizens. Some people wait months or even years for their claims to be considered. At the end of September 2024, there were 97,170 cases relating to 133,409 people awaiting an initial decision. Former Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak pledged to clear older claims by the end of 2023. However, 4,500 ""complex cases"" were still awaiting a decision at the end of December that year.

Germany received the largest number, with 319,710 applicants. Spain had the second highest number (163,755) followed by France (163,190) and Italy (158,560). In 2023, the UK government made initial decisions on 93,303 asylum applications - including people attached to them such as children or other dependents - and granted more than two thirds of them (67%). In the same period, Germany made 217,430 asylum decisions, and granted 62%. France - a country with a similar-sized population to the UK - made 132,695 decisions, and granted 31% of them.

"Mark Meadows (left) and Steven Mnuchin represent the White House in the talks Last-ditch negotiations at the US Congress to forge another stimulus package for the coronavirus-ravaged economy have collapsed in stalemate. Democrats and Republicans remain at odds over everything from unemployment benefits to financial aid for schools to cash injections for states' coffers. The US unemployment rate stands at 10.2%, higher than any level during the 2008 financial crisis. Jobless benefits have expired, as has a federal moratorium on evictions. The failure to reach a deal will disappoint tens of millions of unemployed Americans who had been receiving an extra $600 (Â£450) a week on top of normal unemployment benefits during the pandemic. That payment expired last month and Republicans want to reduce it. On Friday, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the most powerful elected Democrat, held a meeting in her Capitol Hill office with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. Mrs Pelosi said in a news conference that she was willing to offer a trillion-dollar compromise on a $3.5tn (Â£2.7tn) stimulus bill passed by her Democratic-controlled chamber but rejected by the Republican-held Senate. US jobs growth slows in July as pandemic takes toll US economy suffers sharpest contraction in decades ""We'll go down one trillion, you go up one trillion,"" she told reporters as she staked out her position, adding: ""We have a moral responsibility to find common ground."" As he entered Mrs Pelosi's office on Friday, Mr Mnuchin called her proposal ""a non-starter"". Republicans prefer a package closer to $1tn total and want any deal to include legal protections for employers against virus-related health claims from workers. They also want far less aid to local governments than Democrats are seeking. Why US is expecting an 'avalanche' of evictions The millions of Americans 'hanging by a thread' In a surprise news conference on Friday evening from his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, where he is spending the weekend, President Trump blamed Democratic congressional leaders for the impasse. ""Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer continue to insist on radical left-wing policies that have nothing to do with the China virus,"" he said. He added: ""If Democrats continue to hold this critical relief hostage, I will act under my authority as president to get Americans the relief they need."" This video can not be played Despite the economy shrinking, US stocks have rallied Mr Trump said he may seek to defer the payroll tax, unemployment benefits and student loan interest until the end of the year, as well as extending the eviction moratorium. The White House has previously suggested the president would take unilateral action through executive order. But it is unclear how much he can change by fiat, given that Congress controls federal spending. After weeks of negotiations, during which federal unemployment support for millions of Americans ended and economic numbers indicated the recovery was stalling, congressional Democrats and administration officials were able to offer the nation... nothing. Both sides agreed that something had to be done to help the unemployed, provide some support to schools that are struggling to cope with the pandemic and protect those facing eviction. The challenge was there was still at least a trillion dollars in daylight between their two plans, and neither side seemed willing to budge. That suggests that both sides are willing to endure the political and economic fallout of a continued impasse. Democrats may believe that Americans will blame the president or recalcitrant Senate Republicans who have shown little interest in more deficit spending. The White House may hope that whatever unilateral actions Donald Trump can take will offer him some political protections. The bottom line, however, is that millions of Americans will teeter closer to the edge of the financial abyss - and with Congress leaving town for summer recess, there's little sign of substantive help from Washington anytime soon. The US unemployment rate continued to fall in July in the US, but it was a much lower decrease than in May and June, denting hopes of an economic revival. Negotiations have been going on for the past two weeks, as the US death toll from the coronavirus pandemic surpasses 160,000. The US has far more Covid-19 cases by volume than any other country - more than 4.9 million - and its rate of infection has risen steadily throughout the summer. Congress has already allocated some $3tn for pandemic relief so far. Some Republicans in Congress do not wish to spend any more. Nearly half of Republican senators say they would oppose any new relief bill at all. Following the 90-minute meeting, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told reporters it was ""disappointing"". ""We're asking them again to be fair, to meet us in the middle, not to have a 'my way or the highway attitude,' which they seem to have.""

" By Rami Ruhayem in Beirut and Paul Adams in London By Rami Ruhayem in Beirut and Paul Adams in London First, the ground shook, ever so slightly, almost imperceptibly. A quick look around confirmed the sensation; the wardrobes in the house were shaking. One second, two seconds, three, and it stopped. A moment of stillness, and then it struck - an earth-shattering blast. This time the whole building shook, but that was nothing compared with  the sound. And this was more than 10km from the site of the blast in Beirut. An instinctive rush to the windows to see smoke billowing from the direction of the capital. Then, an instinctive rush away - what if there was another one? For many, it was the loudest explosion in memory, and there’s no shortage of explosive memories in Lebanon. On the highway into Beirut from the north, ambulances inched their way through heavy traffic - a stream of motorists desperate to get to the surrounding neighbourhoods, check on friends and relatives, and take them away. On the opposite side, cars sped in the other direction, making their escape from the inferno. With traffic at a standstill, radios and phones brought the most terrible news - of hospitals overwhelmed, of thousands injured, and of the raging fire. Those driving towards Beirut were forced by the army to make a U-turn, or continue on foot if they chose. Broken glass crunched underfoot on the last stretch of road before entering the city, and a tractor roared through, clearing piles of rubble. Buildings were barely recognisable, with empty window frames and no lights in sight. A few silent figures emerged from the dark, some wounded but walking, others sitting and waiting with empty stares and barely a sound. The closer to Beirut, the darker it got. It had started with a fire in the port. Even now it’s not clear the precise time the blaze started. But by 17:54 local time, a tweet from a correspondent for the Los Angeles Times showed the smoke billowing into the sky. What followed has been shown in a series of videos posted on social media. There is an initial explosion which throws denser, darker smoke and debris into the air. A series of flashes can be seen, almost like fireworks going off. An intense area of flame can be seen at the base of the smoke. Then, 35 seconds after the first blast, there is a second, massive explosion. A huge column of red/brown smoke goes up and a white dome-like cloud follows the blast out. Scores dead. Thousands injured. The heart of a city destroyed. And at the centre of it, a warehouse full of nearly 3,000 tonnes of a chemical used for explosive. Ammonium nitrate. The photo is from summer 2014. Two men stand smiling on the deck of an unremarkable looking cargo ship in Beirut Harbour. Innocuous looking white sacks are stacked in the hold behind them. The sacks contain nearly 3,000 tonnes of high-density ammonium nitrate. One man, in blue, slightly squinting into the camera, is on the phone. He was a man with a lot on his mind. By that point Captain Boris Prokoshev and several of his crew had been stuck in the port for months. The ship, the MV Rhosus, had set out from Batumi, Georgia, in late September 2013, apparently destined for Beira, in Mozambique. Built in 1986, the Rhosus was getting old. On trips around the Mediterranean earlier in the year, she had fallen foul of inspectors. In July 2013, at the port of Seville, inspectors found 14 separate deficiencies, from corroded decks to poor fire safety. The Rhosus in 2012 The Rhosus in 2012 From May 2012, it had had a new owner, Igor Grechushkin, a Cyprus-based Russian businessman. According to business contacts, the MV Rhosus was Grechushkin’s first foray into running his own ship. In Batumi, the bill of lading - the document acknowledging receipt of cargo - lists Rustavi Azot LLC as the company supplying the ammonium nitrate and says the customer is the International Bank of Mozambique, acting on behalf of a small Mozambique firm specialising in the manufacture of commercial explosives. Prokoshev, who says he joined the Rhosus as captain in Turkey, has told the BBC it was soon apparent there were major problems. The ship’s original crew had left, he said, claiming they hadn’t been paid for four months.  According to Prokoshev, when the ship and its new crew arrived in Athens, food and other goods had to be returned to suppliers because the owner said he couldn’t afford to pay for them. The ship spent four weeks there while the owner hunted for additional cargo to pay transit fees through the Suez Canal. Eventually, this resulted in a fateful detour to Beirut. Source: MarineTraffic Source: MarineTraffic Prokoshev told the BBC this was to pick up additional cargo - a consignment of road-building equipment, including heavy rollers. But someone hadn’t done their calculations. When the cargo was winched on to the ship’s deck hatches, they started to buckle. “The hatches were rusty, old,” Prokoshev said. “So we couldn’t take it. I refused. It would break the boat.” The effort was abandoned. Now, with the new crew starting to fear that they might suffer the same fate as their predecessors, Prokoshev says he decided to head for Cyprus to sort things out with Grechushkin. But before the Rhosus could leave Beirut, the Lebanese authorities intervened. According to the Lloyd’s List intelligence database, the ship was eventually seized on 4 February 2014, due to unpaid bills totalling $100,000. Some crew members were allowed to leave, but Prokoshev was ordered to stay, along with his chief engineer, third engineer and bosun, all Ukrainian. They weren’t even allowed to leave the ship. “They kept us as hostages,” he told the BBC. Prokoshev says he tried to enlist the help of Russian President Vladimir Putin, writing to him every month. In a separate interview with Radio Liberty, he says he got a frosty answer from the Russian consulate in Beirut. “They told me ‘What do you want Putin to do? Send special forces to release you by force?’” The plight of the crew came to the attention of the International Federation of Transport Workers. In late March, an ITF inspector, Olga Ananyina, said the crew had no means of subsistence. “The team is on the brink of survival,” shewrote on 28 March 2014. She said Igor Grechushkin’s company had no money to pay debts, either to the crew or the port, and she sounded a warning. “In addition to the above problems,” she wrote, “the crew is alarmed by the fact that in the holds of the Rhosus vessel there is a particularly dangerous cargo - ammonium nitrate. The port authorities of Beirut do not allow the unloading or reloading of cargo to another vessel. This fact further complicates the already difficult situation of seafarers.” Hers wasn’t the only warning. Four months later, an article on the trade website FleetMon highlighted the same danger. “Crew kept hostages on a floating bomb,”  was theheadline on an article posted 23 July 2014. The article summed up the dilemma. “The port authorities don’t want to be left with an abandoned vessel on their hands,” it said, “loaded with dangerous cargo.” The ageing Rhosus was not in good shape, taking on water that had to be bailed out every day. Prokoshev said they were concerned about the cargo. “We needed to be sure… the cargo was kept dry and not spoiled,” he told the BBC. “If you live on a boat, you look after it. You don’t want it to sink.” The crew sold some of the ship’s fuel to pay for legal help. After a three-month court process, Lebanese lawyers finally managed to secure their freedom. “We closed all the compartments, locked them and handed the keys to immigration at the port,” Prokoshev says. According to the International Transport Workers’ Federation, Prokoshev and his Ukrainian colleagues finally left Beirut in September 2014. Grechushkin did apparently pay for their passage to Odessa, but Prokoshev says he’s still owed $60,000 in unpaid wages. Some time later - it’s not clear when - the ship’s dangerous cargo was also removed. Abandoned by its owner and its crew, and taking on water, Prokoshev says the Rhosus eventually sank. According to one analysis- the Rhosus currently sits under water in Beirut harbour, less than a third of a mile from the site of the explosion. According to Lloyds List Intelligence records, the ship ""sank in the breakwater in February 2018"". Reflecting on the disaster of 4 August, Prokoshev is scathing about the authorities in Beirut. “They themselves are to blame,” he told Radio Liberty. “They should have got rid of it [the cargo] as soon as possible.” The authorities should have given it to Lebanese farmers to use as fertiliser, he says. “If no-one is asking for the cargo, it means that it’s no-one’s!” The ship’s owner Igor Grechushkin did not respond to BBC requests for comment. An account of the case of the Rhosus, by two lawyers who represented the crew, said their successful appeal had been based on “the imminent danger the crew was facing, given the ‘dangerous’ nature of the cargo still stored in the ship’s holds”. Their account, published in October 2015, ends with words that now seem chilling. “Owing to the risks associated with retaining the Ammonium Nitrate on board the vessel, the port authorities discharged the cargo onto the port’s warehouse. The vessel and cargo remain to date in port awaiting auctioning and/or proper disposal.” Many of those seeing the blast and the domed cloud thought immediately of a nuclear bomb. It wasn’t, but the strength of the explosion was immense. Ammonium nitrate is used the world over as a high-nitrogen fertiliser in agriculture. But it’s also extremely effective as an explosive, especially in mining. Comparisons with other explosive materials are often imprecise and misleading, but a former British Army bomb disposal expert says the Beirut blast was the equivalent of 1-2 kilotons of TNT. Some estimates have even been slightly higher than that. By comparison it is estimated that the Hiroshima bomb in August 1945 exploded with an energy equivalent to 12-15 kilotons. Courtesy: Gaby Salem Courtesy: Gaby Salem The ammonium nitrate should never have been stored this way in the middle of a city, but it still would have taken something to detonate it. So what was on fire at the warehouse in the run-up to the disaster? The flashes and the popping that preceded the main blast looked to many like fireworks. The Director of Customs,  Badri Daher, asked by Lebanese media whether fireworks were stored in the vicinity, answered simply “most likely, yes”. Other reports have suggested the fire could have been started by welding work. ""We were asked to fix a door of the warehouse by State Security and we did that at noon, but what occurred in the afternoon I have no idea,"" CNN quoted the port’s general manager, Hassan Koraytem, as telling OTV. Whatever started the fire, it led to a small crew of firefighters being sent to deal with it. Nine men and one woman were outside Warehouse 12 when the blast occurred. Two have been confirmed dead. The others are missing. But it is now clear a number of officials in the Lebanese state were aware for years of the danger lurking in the port. Ordinary Lebanese only found out when it blew up their capital. So customs officials, possibly anticipating the public rage, swiftly leaked documents to show that responsibility did not lie with them. Between 2014 and 2017, they had sent no fewer than five letters to a Judge of Urgent Matters, asking for permission to re-export or sell the ammonium nitrate. The letters show that they were aware of the material in store, and knew that it was dangerous. Some might read these letters and assume that customs officials had done all they could, and that there was no response from the judiciary. After the explosion more firefighters arrived to take on the blaze After the explosion more firefighters arrived to take on the blaze But that narrative has been swiftly challenged. While no-one has contested the authenticity of the letters, the counter-attack has placed the correspondence in a different context. Riyad Qobaissi, an investigative journalist at local broadcaster Al Jadeed, has spent much of his career investigating corruption at Beirut’s port and customs. The night after the explosion he offered his analysis; that the letters did not follow the right procedures, and that the judge had repeatedly pointed this out, requesting further information. Qobaissi says the customs officials simply kept resending the same letters. At the request of the Ministry of Transport and Public Works, the judge had given permission for the cargo to be offloaded in the first place. But he said it had to be stored in an appropriate place with safety measures in place. “The ministry stored it in the port, and handed it over to customs,” Nizar Saghieh of Legal Agenda, an NGO based in Beirut, told the BBC. “That was a big mistake. The law… explicitly forbids the storage of such explosives in the port.” Saghieh says the responsibility for the ammonium nitrate’s storage in the port lies with the ministry, customs, and port management. “The judge here did not make a mistake, as there is a law stating that if a ship carrying a dangerous load is sinking, the Judge of Urgent Matters can allow it to be ‘floated’.” Interior of the warehouse (Courtesy: @DimaSadek) Interior of the warehouse (Courtesy: @DimaSadek) The ministry of transport and public works is responsible for the load, he says. ""[The ministry] gave up that responsibility to customs. The judge had delegated responsibility to the ministry, the ministry delegated [in turn] to customs.” What they should have done, he suggests, is to sell it, which they had the authority to do, ask for permission to destroy it, or even destroy it without asking. “All they did was send those letters,” he says. The Beirut story is not unique. In February 2009, a Cypriot-flagged vessel carrying 98 shipping containers full of military propellant was intercepted by the US Navy in the Red Sea. The containers were stored, in direct sunlight, at the Evangelos Florakis Naval Base in Cyprus where, on 11 July 2011, the entire stockpile blew up, killing 13 people and causing more than €3bn of damage. “Will people die at the doors of hospitals?” a hospital owner was asked. “No, they’ll die inside,” he said, because drugs and medical equipment will run out. You’d think he was speaking after the blast that simultaneously overwhelmed hospitals and destroyed the port. But this was last year, long before the blast, before Covid-19, back when life in much of the world was “normal”, but Lebanon was already stepping into an apocalyptic nightmare. Now 4 August 2020 has seen a terrifying blow, with the explosion at the port underlining the twin pillars of Lebanon’s unfolding tragedy - a corrupt system immune to accountability, and an economy seen by many people as rigged to serve the establishment. Last year, the country’s post-civil war economic order already looked poised to come crashing down as protests attacked the status quo. They saw an entrenched elite scrambling to preserve its wealth and power, as people mobilised to hold them to account for three decades of plunder. Anger was mixed with euphoria at what seemed to many the long-awaited dream of a radical, nationwide revolution against the system itself. A new power formed on the streets, cowing the political class. Such was the rage that for a while, politicians wouldn’t show their faces, not on the streets nor even on the screens. In squares across the country, tents were set up for night-time discussions. The political, economic and legal framework that enabled a narrow ruling elite to enrich itself at the expense of the people was deconstructed. On trial was a century-old sectarian power-sharing system, a 30-year old economic model, and perhaps most of all, the banks. Since the early 1990s, they’d been piling up profits from interest on government debt. Political factions, representing different sects, carved up the state’s resources and dispensed welfare, jobs, and benefits to their respective communities. Debt, and interest on debt, took more and more of what the government could spend. The system endured several shocks: assassinations, a war with Israel, prolonged political paralysis. It even briefly prospered, with money flowing in after the global crash to the perceived safety of Lebanon’s banking system. The implicit guarantee of Lebanon’s economy came mostly from France and Saudi Arabia. Every time the country ran into trouble with its finances, the former would use its diplomatic clout and the latter its deep pockets to arrange for an international bail-out. New, longer-term loans and grants would be extended, and Lebanon would keep paying interest on its old debt. On top of these guarantees, the country also relied on a steady stream of remittances from emigrants. But in 2011, both remittances and the guarantee started gradually, almost imperceptibly, diminishing. The war in Syria struck tourism and export routes. The 2014 oil price crash hit remittances, especially from Gulf states. And a tightening US financial noose aimed at strangling the Lebanese militant group and political party Hezbollah took its toll. US allies in the Gulf withdrew their implicit guarantees, as did France, which now insisted on austerity measures and reforms before investing. And so it began. The banks blocked people’s access to their savings, but big money seemed to find its way out.  The national currency crashed. Inflation edged towards hyperinflation, jobs were lost, the middle class plummeted into poverty, and the poor sank further into misery. Meanwhile, the protest movement stagnated. It had displayed a stubborn resistance to organisation, and no leadership or well-defined coalition emerged to carry the early gains through the minefield of Lebanese politics. Power seemed to gravitate back to various established factions and the economic elite. The protest movement had vowed to exact a price for the economic collapse from those who had let it happen. In the wake of the explosion, that feeling is now morphing into something more vengeful; many are wishing death on those responsible. But Lebanon’s modern history reveals a system that’s almost designed to obscure responsibility, and allow everyone off the hook. Throughout the decades, rampant corruption and profiteering have often been detailed and dissected in public, by journalists or by rival factions trading accusations. But no-one has been held to account. All attempts to do so would run against the sectarian barrier. Officials and politicians have had cover from their respective factions, which in turn have had cover from their religious establishments. Positions in the bureaucracy have been divided among various sects, with positions reserved for Christians, Sunnis, Shia, and Druze. Political success for a party has not been linked to policy programmes, but to their ability to carry the banner of their sect, and become the gateway to their sect’s share of jobs and spoils. Office-holders have been more like proteges than civil servants. But 2,700 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, sitting in the port of Beirut for six years, has just blown up. Who will pay? Meanwhile, thousands are injured, and hospitals and pharmacies have exhausted precious supplies. Hundreds of thousands are displaced, and many can’t afford to rebuild their homes. Every event over the past year, from the crash through to Covid-19, seems to have reminded the Lebanese of how broken and unproductive their economy is, how decimated their agriculture, and how lacking in economic sovereignty they are. And also how utterly dependent they are - for their most basic needs - on imports. Mostly through the port of Beirut.

"In June there were almost 37,000 people in Guildford on Universal Credit - a rise of 148% since March London's commuter towns have seen the highest rate of people moving onto Universal Credit since the coronavirus lockdown began, BBC research has found. Guildford, Stevenage and Hemel Hempstead have had disproportionate rises in people claiming the benefit. Nearly 5.5 million people are now claiming benefits across Britain - an 81% increase since March. Experts said the drop in office-based working in the capital has impacted employment in commuter towns. Some of those who have applied for Universal Credit were forced to do so because they did not qualify for other government support, such as the furlough scheme or help for the self-employed. Universal Credit claims hit record during lockdown Huge increase in families hitting benefits cap Universal Credit failing millions, say peers BBC analysis of official postcode data from the Department for Work and Pensions shows that Guildford in Surrey had the sharpest increase in the proportion of people moving onto the working-age benefit. In June, there were almost 37,000 people in the town on Universal Credit - a rise of 148% since March, according to the latest figures. Two of London's outer boroughs, Harrow and Kingston-upon-Thames, have also seen increases far in excess of the national average.

"The number of people in England testing positive for coronavirus may be levelling off, according to a household survey by the Office for National Statistics. After a low in cases at the end of June,it estimated infections had risen slightly in July,external. Restrictions have been introduced in Preston and kept in place in 18 other areasto control outbreaks. Public Health England says virus levels remain ""stable at a national level"". The ONS figures are based on throat and nose swabs from nearly 120,000 people. They are tested whether they have symptoms or not. How many cases are there in your area? Individuals in hospitals and care homes are not included in the ONS survey, which has been estimating cases in private households since May. Figures for Wales have been included for the first time - and during the week of 27 July to 2 August, 1,400 people are estimated to have had Covid-19. In England, the figure for the same week is 28,300. However, there is uncertainty around these figures because they are based on modelling a sample of the population and a very small number of positive tests - just 53 people from 53 households over six weeks. And the ONS says there is no clear evidence from its survey to say whether infection rates differ by region in England. Local restrictions are currently in placein 18 areas in Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire and East Lancashire,external, plusLeicester,external. Preston, in Lancashire, has now also been added to that list. This means there are stricter rules on socialising for people living in these areas and for businesses, in order to control the spread of the virus. Public Health England's watchlist of areas with rising cases now includes Blackburn with Darwen, Leicester, Burnley, Hyndburn, Pendle, Rossendale, Bolton, Bury, Manchester, Oldham, Rochdale, Salford, Stockport, Tameside, Trafford, Wigan, Bradford, Calderdale and Kirklees. Leicester was the first place in the UK to have a local lockdown introduced after a rise in Covid-19 cases.The city's pubs and restaurants are now preparing for their first weekendopen in months. At a national level, PHE says 4,605 cases of coronavirus were detected in the last week of July - similar to the week before. Any sign of cases levelling off is welcome news. The ONS can only say this ""may"" be happening because its trends are based on 53 people testing positive for the virus over a six week period. It is too small a number to be certain. This set of data is from people who were tested between 27 July and 2 August. That means it is too soon to seen the effect of the greater restrictions imposed on parts of northern England, which came in late on 30 July, or Boris Johnson postponing the easing of lockdown planned for the start of August. The latest data does not contradict UK chief medical advisor, Prof Chris Whitty, saying last week that we are ""near the limit"" of opening up society. And the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) has warned that it ""does not have confidence"" that R is currently below 1 in England. However, these are national pictures and what is most important isthe data from where you live. The ONS infection survey cannot pick out a Leicester and the R number cannot say Aberdeen is different to the rest of Scotland. The latest R number for the UK was also published on Friday. It is now estimated to be between 0.8 and 1.0, suggesting coronavirus cases in the UK are either stable or shrinking slightly. However SAGE, the government's scientific advisors, says it does ""not have confidence that R is currently below 1 in England"". The number relates to how many people each infected person is passing the virus on to. Anything above 1.0 means cases are starting to grow again. LOCKDOWN UPDATE:What's changing, where? SCHOOLS:What is school life like now? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Prof Keith Neal, emeritus professor of the epidemiology of infectious diseases, at the University of Nottingham, said estimating R was becoming ""increasingly difficult"" because of the small number of cases around. ""A local cluster in one part of a region such as Leicester in the East Midlands can give a value over 1 overall for the region but the figure would be much lower in the rest of the region. ""These local clusters need to be identified and managed with locally targeted measures,"" he said. ""For many parts of the country, infection rates continue to fall but caution and avoidance of high risk mixing needs to continue."" Prof Neal added: ""The best way the public can help control Covid-19 is to get tested if they have symptoms, and if positive, isolate and identify their contacts.""

"In June there were almost 37,000 people in Guildford on Universal Credit - a rise of 148% since March London's commuter towns have seen the highest rate of people moving onto Universal Credit since the coronavirus lockdown began, BBC research has found. Guildford, Stevenage and Hemel Hempstead have had disproportionate rises in people claiming the benefit. Nearly 5.5 million people are now claiming benefits across Britain - an 81% increase since March. Experts said the drop in office-based working in the capital has impacted employment in commuter towns. Some of those who have applied for Universal Credit were forced to do so because they did not qualify for other government support, such as the furlough scheme or help for the self-employed. Universal Credit claims hit record during lockdown Huge increase in families hitting benefits cap Universal Credit failing millions, say peers BBC analysis of official postcode data from the Department for Work and Pensions shows that Guildford in Surrey had the sharpest increase in the proportion of people moving onto the working-age benefit. In June, there were almost 37,000 people in the town on Universal Credit - a rise of 148% since March, according to the latest figures. Two of London's outer boroughs, Harrow and Kingston-upon-Thames, have also seen increases far in excess of the national average.

"Sette Buenaventura was determined not to let her painful leg stop her working A nurse who shrugged off persistent pain to continue working on the coronavirus front line has had her leg amputated after discovering a tumour. Sette Buenaventura, 26, ignored cramp in her right calf for eight weeks while working at Salford Royal Hospital. A scan in April revealed a sarcoma and her leg was removed above the knee. She said working as a nurse means ""you forget about your own pains because youâre busy helping other people... but everything comes at a cost"". Ms Buenaventura, from Eccles, had struggled to walk due to the pain in her leg, but assumed she was experiencing the side-effects of being on her feet all day. ""When Covid-19 kicked off, we worked flat out, we didnât have time to worry about aches and pains,"" she said. ""We were there every hour to help anyone who needed us [and] I got a real taste for that level of commitment. ""That is what working in hospitals is like - you forget about your own pains because youâre busy helping other people, which I love to do, but everything comes at a cost."" Sette Buenaventura wants others to listen to their bodies more She said the cancerous tumour swelled to the ""size of a golf ball"" and she was told in May her only chance of survival was amputation. ""When they told me I had to have my leg removed, I got very upset, but because I had no time to think about it, I just got on with it,"" she said. ""I like to look after myself and try my best to be healthy. ""I work in healthcare and never expected this to happen to me."" She has now been fitted with a prosthetic limb and hopes to return to work in November. She said she wanted people to learn from her experience. ""I think it's really important for anyone with a lingering pain to go and get it checked out,"" she said. ""If I had caught this sooner, I would probably be in a different position now.""

"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says Aberdeen players 'blatantly' broke the rules on coronavirus The number of cases in Aberdeen's Covid cluster has risen to 101 as Nicola Sturgeon said she was ""furious"" at footballers who broke lockdown rules. The first minister said it was ""unacceptable"" that eight Aberdeen players had visited a bar in the city on Saturday night. They are all now self-isolating after twotested positive for Covid-19. Lockdown measures werereintroduced in the city on Wednesdayas the number of cases in the cluster grew. Ms Sturgeon told her daily briefing there had been an additional 22 cases in the last day, taking the total to 101. The total number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Scotland rose by 43 on Friday, and no deaths were reported for the 22nd consecutive day. Aberdeen FC's Covid-19 cases: What do we know? Graduate 'heartbroken' after losing job due to lockdown Aberdeen lockdown: 'It feels never ending' How is Scotland tackling local Covid clusters? Ms Sturgeon said 27 of the confirmed cases were in the Grampian area, although it was not yet clear how many were connected to the Aberdeen outbreak. The Aberdeen players who are self-isolating had visited the city's Soul bar on Saturday. Images were shared on social media showing queues of people gathered outside the bar, which is one of about 30 venues now linked to the cluster. A picture taken at the weekend showed people queuing outside the Soul bar in Aberdeen Ms Sturgeon said: ""It is  now clear that all eight of these players visited a bar in Aberdeen on Saturday night. ""In doing so they blatantly broke the rules that had been agreed between the SFA, the SPFL, and the Scottish government, which, to put it mildly, is completely unacceptable."" The first minister said she supported the decision to cancel the club's match with St Johnstone this weekend. ""We are asking members of the public to behave in a highly precautionary manner,"" she said. ""When a football club ends up with players infected with Covid - and let's remember this is not through bad luck but through clear breaches of the rules - we cannot take even a small risk that they then spread the infection to other parts of the country."" Aberdeen played their first game of the season at Pittodrie on Saturday Ms Sturgeon added that she was ""pretty furious"" at the situation - and that if players did not abide by the rules, they were putting the return of the professional game at risk. Aberdeen chairman Dave Cormack said he had apologised to football and health authorities, and to the other Premiership clubs. ""Regrettably, what has happened in the last few days has undermined all the hard work that has gone into keeping our players and staff safe,"" he said. ""We are now dealing with this internally with the seriousness it deserves. ""In the meantime, I'd like to reassure the relevant bodies, our fans and everyone associated with the club that our already rigorous measures are being forensically scrutinised and that no stone will be left unturned in ensuring that no-one is under any doubt about what must be adhered to."" The outbreak in Aberdeen has been linked to bars and restaurants The coronavirus cluster in Aberdeen has been linked to pubs and restaurants. A list has been published of premises visited by people confirmed to have the virus. They are: Bieldside Inn, Bobbin, Brewdog (Castlegate), Buckie Farm Carvery, CafÃ© Andaluz, CafÃ© Dag, CafÃ© Drummond, The Cock & Bull, College Bar, The Dutch Mill, Dyce Carvery, East End Social Club, Ferryhill House Hotel, Hawthorn/Adam Lounge, The Howff, The Justice Mill, The Marine Hotel, McGinty's, McNasty's, Malmaison,  Moonfish CafÃ©, No.10 Bar, O'Donoghues, Old Bank Bar, Prohibition, Soul, Spider's Web, The Draft Project. The list also includes Aboyne, Deeside and Hazlehead golf clubs, and the Banks O'Dee Football Club. Anyone who had visited any of these premises should be ""extra vigilant for symptoms"" - even if they had not been contacted by specialist tracers. The lockdown restrictions which have been reimposed for the city's 228,000 residents include: not to travel more than five miles for leisure or holidays not to travel to the city for leisure or to visit friends and family, even if you live in Aberdeenshire if you are currently visiting the city, you can stay - but take necessary precautions when returning home no indoor visits with other households bars, cafes, restaurants and pubs must close, although takeaways can remain open.

"Mark Meadows (left) and Steven Mnuchin represent the White House in the talks Last-ditch negotiations at the US Congress to forge another stimulus package for the coronavirus-ravaged economy have collapsed in stalemate. Democrats and Republicans remain at odds over everything from unemployment benefits to financial aid for schools to cash injections for states' coffers. The US unemployment rate stands at 10.2%, higher than any level during the 2008 financial crisis. Jobless benefits have expired, as has a federal moratorium on evictions. The failure to reach a deal will disappoint tens of millions of unemployed Americans who had been receiving an extra $600 (Â£450) a week on top of normal unemployment benefits during the pandemic. That payment expired last month and Republicans want to reduce it. On Friday, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the most powerful elected Democrat, held a meeting in her Capitol Hill office with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. Mrs Pelosi said in a news conference that she was willing to offer a trillion-dollar compromise on a $3.5tn (Â£2.7tn) stimulus bill passed by her Democratic-controlled chamber but rejected by the Republican-held Senate. US jobs growth slows in July as pandemic takes toll US economy suffers sharpest contraction in decades ""We'll go down one trillion, you go up one trillion,"" she told reporters as she staked out her position, adding: ""We have a moral responsibility to find common ground."" As he entered Mrs Pelosi's office on Friday, Mr Mnuchin called her proposal ""a non-starter"". Republicans prefer a package closer to $1tn total and want any deal to include legal protections for employers against virus-related health claims from workers. They also want far less aid to local governments than Democrats are seeking. Why US is expecting an 'avalanche' of evictions The millions of Americans 'hanging by a thread' In a surprise news conference on Friday evening from his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, where he is spending the weekend, President Trump blamed Democratic congressional leaders for the impasse. ""Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer continue to insist on radical left-wing policies that have nothing to do with the China virus,"" he said. He added: ""If Democrats continue to hold this critical relief hostage, I will act under my authority as president to get Americans the relief they need."" This video can not be played Despite the economy shrinking, US stocks have rallied Mr Trump said he may seek to defer the payroll tax, unemployment benefits and student loan interest until the end of the year, as well as extending the eviction moratorium. The White House has previously suggested the president would take unilateral action through executive order. But it is unclear how much he can change by fiat, given that Congress controls federal spending. After weeks of negotiations, during which federal unemployment support for millions of Americans ended and economic numbers indicated the recovery was stalling, congressional Democrats and administration officials were able to offer the nation... nothing. Both sides agreed that something had to be done to help the unemployed, provide some support to schools that are struggling to cope with the pandemic and protect those facing eviction. The challenge was there was still at least a trillion dollars in daylight between their two plans, and neither side seemed willing to budge. That suggests that both sides are willing to endure the political and economic fallout of a continued impasse. Democrats may believe that Americans will blame the president or recalcitrant Senate Republicans who have shown little interest in more deficit spending. The White House may hope that whatever unilateral actions Donald Trump can take will offer him some political protections. The bottom line, however, is that millions of Americans will teeter closer to the edge of the financial abyss - and with Congress leaving town for summer recess, there's little sign of substantive help from Washington anytime soon. The US unemployment rate continued to fall in July in the US, but it was a much lower decrease than in May and June, denting hopes of an economic revival. Negotiations have been going on for the past two weeks, as the US death toll from the coronavirus pandemic surpasses 160,000. The US has far more Covid-19 cases by volume than any other country - more than 4.9 million - and its rate of infection has risen steadily throughout the summer. Congress has already allocated some $3tn for pandemic relief so far. Some Republicans in Congress do not wish to spend any more. Nearly half of Republican senators say they would oppose any new relief bill at all. Following the 90-minute meeting, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told reporters it was ""disappointing"". ""We're asking them again to be fair, to meet us in the middle, not to have a 'my way or the highway attitude,' which they seem to have.""

"This video can not be played The explosion caused huge damage to the port and surrounding areas of Beirut UN agencies have warned of a humanitarian crisis in Lebanon after Tuesday's devastating blast in Beirut. Lebanon was already suffering a major economic downturn before the explosion, which left at least 154 people dead, 5,000 injured and 300,000 homeless. The World Food Programme said the damage to Beirut's port would interrupt food supplies and push prices up. The World Health Organization said the health system was seriously damaged, with three hospitals out of action. Meanwhile, Lebanese President Michel Aoun rejected calls for an international investigation into the explosion, and said local authorities would examine whether it was triggered by ""external interference"" such as a bomb. The leader of the militant Hezbollah movement, Hassan Nasrallah, also denied allegations that it had stored weapons or ammunition at the port. The government has said the blast was the result of the detonation of 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate that had been stored unsafely at the port for six years. The decision to keep so much explosive material in a warehouse near the city centre has been met with disbelief and fury by many Lebanese, who have long accused the political elite of corruption, neglect and mismanagement. Before Tuesday's explosion, 75% of Lebanese were in need of aid, 33% had lost their jobs, and one million people were living below the poverty line. Lebanon's main grain silo at Beirut port was destroyed by Tuesday's explosion WFP spokeswoman Elisabeth Byrs told reporters in Geneva that the organisation was concerned the severe damage to Beirut's port - the largest in the country - could limit the flow of food supplies and push prices beyond the reach of many. The WFP was sending 5,000 food parcels that would be enough to feed a family of five for a month, and was planning to import wheat flour and grains, she said. Christian Lindmeier of the WHO meanwhile warned that Lebanon's hospitals were overwhelmed with the patients, some were damaged and some non-functional, and that 500 beds had been lost. 'We don't have dreams any more' Beirut explosion: Before-and-after images What we know about the blast Why Lebanon is in crisis The WHO has delivered emergency trauma and surgical supply kits containing essential medicines and medical supplies, and is calling for $15m (Â£11.5m) to cover immediate needs and ensure continuity in the response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Lebanon was also seeing a rise in cases of the coronavirus disease but 17 containers of masks, gowns and gloves, shipped to Beirut by the WHO, had been completely destroyed, Mr Lindmeier said. This video can not be played Beirut resident May Melki says her rendition of Auld Lang Syne is a ""homage"" to the blast victims The UN Refugee Agency, which normally supports Lebanon's 1.5 million Syrian refugees, said it was releasing emergency shelter materials to all those in need. Many countries have offered aid to help Lebanon, with the US announcing on Friday that it planned to immediately send $15m worth of food and medicine. Lebanon's president and prime minister have said the ammonium nitrate - which is commonly used as a fertiliser but can also made into an explosive - had been stored in a warehouse at the port without any safety precautions since 2014, when it was unloaded from an impounded cargo ship. On Wednesday, Mr Aoun promised a transparent investigation by Lebanese authorities and to ""hold those responsible and those who were negligent accountable, and serve them the most severe punishment"". This video can not be played ""Now I'm shaking, all the way from up to down"" However, calls for international investigation have grown since then. The president ruled out such a move on Friday, saying: ""The goal behind calls for an international investigation into the port issue is to dilute the truth."" He also said the government-backed inquiry was looking into three possibilities: negligence, accident or what he called ""external interference through a rocket or bomb or other act"". Officials have said the explosion appears to have been triggered by a fire and there has been no evidence so far of the third possibility mentioned by Mr Aoun. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, Mr Aoun's political ally, meanwhile denied any responsibility for the blast, insisting that his group did not control the port and that it had stored no weapons or ammunition there. ""Not a weapons cache, not a missile factory, not a single missile, not a single rifle, not a single bomb, not a bullet, not nitrates. Nothing at all. Not now, not in the past,"" he declared in a speech. This video can not be played The BBC's Sarah Rainsford spoke to Boris Prokoshev, captain of the MV Rhosus BBC Middle East analyst Sebastian Usher says Mr Nasrallah's denial is necessary because many Lebanese believe the exact opposite - he needs to shore up his position and that of his movement, which still wields decisive power in Lebanon.

"Almost 37,000 people crossed the English Channel in small boats in 2024, figures released on New Year's Day show. Last year was the deadliest on record for people trying to make the crossing, according to a United Nations agency. In 2024, 36,816 were detected making the crossing. That's higher than in 2023, when29,437 people arrived. However, the highest recorded figures are for 2022, when 45,755 people made the crossing. Since 2018, when figures were first recorded, more than 150,000 people have arrived in small boats. Of those who arrived in 2024, more than23,000 did so after Labour won the July general election.

However, numbers rose again throughout the 2010s, as refugees fled Syria. Asylum applications have risen again in recent years, more than doubling from 45,318 in the year to September 2021 to 92,776 just one year later, followed by smaller increases since then. In the year to September 2024, the largest number of asylum seekers came from Pakistan, with more than 9,500 applications. Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Syria, and India were among the other countries with most applications.

"This video can not be played BA staff facing redundancy or pay cuts speak out Some British Airways staff who have accepted voluntary redundancy say they had felt ""forced"" into it. BA wants to cut 12,000 job roles and says 6,000 staff have volunteered. Carol - not her real name - said BA had told her if she did not accept the offer of voluntary redundancy she would  have to apply for a job and if she did not get it she would only receive a statutory redundancy payout. She says the airline's conduct was ""a slap in the face"". Carol, who had worked for BA for 23 years, told the BBC: ""They [BA] said 'If you don't take the offer, you'll go into the fire-and-rehire phase', but if we aren't hired, we'll get only statutory redundancy."" Those BA cabin crew who did reapply for their jobs on a new contract are expected to find out later on Friday whether or not they lose their jobs. Carol, who worked on the long-haul fleet, said it was a foregone conclusion that the airline would not re-hire older cabin crew members. ""Even before I had accepted the voluntary redundancy offer, I had a message on my roster from BA: 'Thank you for your service. Good luck'. That is all I got from them after 23 years. ""It's a slap in the face, but it shows they knew who they were getting rid of,"" she said. She says she will be forced to sell her home since her redundancy payment won't cover her mortgage. ""It's actually age discrimination, we were forced out."" BA cabin crew: I won't earn enough to pay my mortgage British Airways: A breakdown in trust? Erica - again, not her real name - had been with British Airways long enough to remember being cabin crew on a Concorde jet, but accepted voluntary redundancy after seeing the brand airline turn into a ""toxic work environment"". ""The way they dealt with this was so underhand,"" she said. ""Yes coronavirus has had a terrible impact on the industry, but these are permanent pay cuts to what is a temporary problem. But this is a restructure that BA has wanted for a long time"". Most of those who are offered a new contract will suffer steep pay cuts, changes to their terms and conditions, and reduced allowances which top up their base salaries. Other workers such as engineers, ground crew and office staff are also expected to hear whether they have a future at the airline over the coming days. British Airways says more than 6,000 staff across the business have applied for voluntary redundancy and ""refutes claims that our colleagues were pressured"". The airline has begun culling employee positions as part of a major cost-cutting drive, which it insists is vital to ensure its long-term survival. But the way in which it has done so has provoked deep resentment among a large proportion of its workforce - and threats of industrial action. ""I'm looking at losing 50% of my take-home pay,"" says Vicky - a cabin crew member who works in BA's long-haul fleet. ""I'm a single mother. I can't afford to have half of my pay taken away from me"". Vicky - not her real name - is in her mid-thirties. She has been with the company for more than 15 years. Although she lives in the north east, she was among hundreds of staff who travelled to BA's headquarters near Heathrow earlier this week, to vent their anger at the company's management. ""It's the most stressful time I've ever been through,"" she says. ""I feel absolutely gutted."" BA cabin crew: I won't earn enough to pay my mortgage British Airways, like other airlines, has suffered deeply from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. In the three months to the end of June it lost more than Â£700m. For weeks, at the height of the lockdown, the bulk of its fleet was grounded, and it was unable to operate more than a handful of planes each day. The company does not expect the aviation industry to recover fully until at least 2023. In April, its parent company International Airlines Group (IAG) announced plans for a major restructuring of BA's business, which it saidcould result in up to 12,000 redundancies. BA then made it clear it needed to cut costs dramatically - and warned that concessions would be needed from remaining staff on pay, as well as on terms and conditions. It said that if an agreement could not be reached with unions, it would force its plans through - by handing staff their notice, and offering them new contracts on different terms. Some cabin crew staff have already been informed that they are affected. Unions have condemned this policy as ""fire and rehire"". It has also been heavily criticised by many MPs, with the chair of the Transport Select Committee, Conservative Huw Merriman, describing it as ""the equivalent of putting a gun to someone's head"". Despite significant tensions between the two sides, the pilots' union Balpa has since managed to reach an agreement with BA, which reduced the number of possible redundancies in exchange for significant concessions on pay. But relations between the company and unions representing other staff - Unite and GMB - have been considerably more strained. No deal has yet been done, and BA has pushed forward with its plans. Those plans have major implications for BA's cabin crew. The company currently has different crew divisions, or ""fleets"", which operate as separate units with their own terms and conditions. It wants to create a single organisation, and put all crew on the same type of contract. For lower paid staff, principally those who have joined the company since 2010, this would mean a modest salary increase. For longer serving crew, who are well-paid by industry standards, it would mean a cut in basic salary of 20%. But because they will also lose other allowances, many say they will see their overall take-home wages drop by 40% to 50%. IAG chief Willie Walsh has said the downturn in air travel is not temporary Executives insist such changes are necessary, in the face of what IAG's chief executive Willie Walsh described last week as the biggest crisis the airline has ever faced. Mr Walsh told the BBC: ""Anyone who believes that this is just a temporary downturn and therefore can be fixed with temporary measures, I'm afraid seriously misjudges what the industry is going through."" But many employees believe the company is deliberately exploiting the immediate crisis to justify pushing through far-reaching, irreversible changes. ""I really love my job"", says Vicky ""I'm just really upset with how things have planned out. I think it's a permanent solution to a temporary problem. Yet our managers are only taking temporary pay cuts."" British Airways: A breakdown in trust? Staff elsewhere in British Airways are also affected by the changes, with the threat of compulsory redundancy hanging over them and the prospect of steep pay cuts ahead. John - again, not his real name - is an engineer who helps maintain BA's long-haul aircraft at Heathrow. He wants to stay in his job, because he is worried his qualifications would not be recognised in other industries and he would struggle to find an employer willing to take him on. ""Let's be realistic"", he says, ""No-one is going to take someone in their 50s and train them up when they can get a 20-something instead. It's not going to happen."" John says many of his colleagues are in a similar position - and the worry is proving an unwelcome distraction at work. ""I've been walking around checking an aircraft prior to departure, and I find I can't remember what I've been looking at - so I have to do it again,"" he says. ""I can't see how you can be expected to work like that. But this process is being driven by accountants, and they can't see further than their noses."" Although BA is still in talks with unions, relations are far from cordial. Last week the general secretary of Unite, Len McCluskey described the company's strategy as ""despicable"", and said the union was working towards industrial action with immediate effect. But the airline insists it has no option. ""Our half year results clearly show the enormous financial impact of Covid-19 on our business,"" said a spokesperson. ""We are having to make difficult decisions and take every possible action now to protect as many jobs as possible."" ""And, while we never could have anticipated being in a position of making redundancies, over 6,000 of our colleagues have now indicated that they wish to take voluntary redundancy from BA.""

"Eric Joyce, who pleaded guilty to making an indecent image of a child, has been sentenced A former Labour MP and ex-Army officer who admitted making an indecent image of a child has been sentenced. Eric Joyce had a 51-second film on a device that showed ""the sexual abuse of very young children"", Ipswich Crown Court heard. The former shadow minister and ex-MP for Falkirk was arrested in 2018. Joyce, 59, of Worlingworth, Suffolk, was sentenced to eight months in prison suspended for two years, and must complete 150 hours of unpaid work. The court heard the category A film - the most serious there is - was accessed by Joyce between August 2013 and November 2018. It featured what appeared to be seven different children, aged between 12 months and seven years. Joyce, seen here in 2015, served in the Army for 21 years Judge Mr Justice Edis said: ""That these acts of abuse happened is because there are people like you who want to watch these films. ""If there was no market, those children wouldn't be subjected to these very serious offences."" The judge said Joyce had ""sought help"" and there was evidence he had been able to ""reduce, perhaps completely"" his ""impulsive behaviour"". Michael Proctor, prosecuting, said a number of computer devices and hard drives were seized by police from Joyce's address in November 2018 following intelligence. Initially Joyce told police ""he had never seen child abuse material"", Mr Proctor said. But following analysis of his computer, Joyce told police that some of what he said ""wasn't true"" and that ""he had seen a mixture of images"". The prosecution said there was evidence of searches ""for material for five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10-year-old girls"". Joyce was convicted of assaulting two teenagers in London in 2014 Joyce served as a Labour MP from 2000 to 2012, beforesitting as an independent,externaluntil 2015. He originally joined the Army in 1977 before serving for 21 years, during which he rose to the rank of major. The court heard his previous convictions included drink-driving, common assaults and a public order offence. Mitigating, Mark Shelley said Joyce had no previous convictions for sexual offences and that he had given up drinking. Joyce also received a sexual harm prevention order, was given an 18-day rehabilitation activity requirement and ordered to pay prosecution costs of Â£1,800.

I can't afford to have half of my pay taken away from me"". Vicky - not her real name - is in her mid-thirties. She has been with the company for more than 15 years. Although she lives in the north east, she was among hundreds of staff who travelled to BA's headquarters near Heathrow earlier this week, to vent their anger at the company's management. ""It's the most stressful time I've ever been through,"" she says. ""I feel absolutely gutted."" BA cabin crew: I won't earn enough to pay my mortgage British Airways, like other airlines, has suffered deeply from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. In the three months to the end of June it lost more than Â£700m. For weeks, at the height of the lockdown, the bulk of its fleet was grounded, and it was unable to operate more than a handful of planes each day. The company does not expect the aviation industry to recover fully until at least 2023. In April, its parent company International Airlines Group (IAG) announced plans for a major restructuring of BA's business, which it saidcould result in up to 12,000 redundancies. BA then made it clear it needed to cut costs dramatically - and warned that concessions would be needed from remaining staff on pay, as well as on terms and conditions. It said that if an agreement could not be reached with unions, it would force its plans through - by handing staff their notice, and offering them new contracts on different terms. Some cabin crew staff have already been informed that they are affected. Unions have condemned this policy as ""fire and rehire"". It has also been heavily criticised by many MPs, with the chair of the Transport Select Committee, Conservative Huw Merriman, describing it as ""the equivalent of putting a gun to someone's head"". Despite significant tensions between the two sides, the pilots' union Balpa has since managed to reach an agreement with BA, which reduced the number of possible redundancies in exchange for significant concessions on pay. But relations between the company and unions representing other staff - Unite and GMB - have been considerably more strained. No deal has yet been done, and BA has pushed forward with its plans. Those plans have major implications for BA's cabin crew. The company currently has different crew divisions, or ""fleets"", which operate as separate units with their own terms and conditions. It wants to create a single organisation, and put all crew on the same type of contract. For lower paid staff, principally those who have joined the company since 2010, this would mean a modest salary increase. For longer serving crew, who are well-paid by industry standards, it would mean a cut in basic salary of 20%. But because they will also lose other allowances, many say they will see their overall take-home wages drop by 40% to 50%. IAG chief Willie Walsh has said the downturn in air travel is not temporary Executives insist such changes are necessary, in the face of what IAG's chief executive Willie Walsh described last week as the biggest crisis the airline has ever faced. Mr Walsh told the BBC: ""Anyone who believes that this is just a temporary downturn and therefore can be fixed with temporary measures, I'm afraid seriously misjudges what the industry is going through."" But many employees believe the company is deliberately exploiting the immediate crisis to justify pushing through far-reaching, irreversible changes. ""I really love my job"", says Vicky ""I'm just really upset with how things have planned out. I think it's a permanent solution to a temporary problem. Yet our managers are only taking temporary pay cuts."" British Airways: A breakdown in trust? Staff elsewhere in British Airways are also affected by the changes, with the threat of compulsory redundancy hanging over them and the prospect of steep pay cuts ahead. John - again, not his real name - is an engineer who helps maintain BA's long-haul aircraft at Heathrow. He wants to stay in his job, because he is worried his qualifications would not be recognised in other industries and he would struggle to find an employer willing to take him on. ""Let's be realistic"", he says, ""No-one is going to take someone in their 50s and train them up when they can get a 20-something instead. It's not going to happen."" John says many of his colleagues are in a similar position - and the worry is proving an unwelcome distraction at work. ""I've been walking around checking an aircraft prior to departure, and I find I can't remember what I've been looking at - so I have to do it again,"" he says. ""I can't see how you can be expected to work like that. But this process is being driven by accountants, and they can't see further than their noses."" Although BA is still in talks with unions, relations are far from cordial. Last week the general secretary of Unite, Len McCluskey described the company's strategy as ""despicable"", and said the union was working towards industrial action with immediate effect. But the airline insists it has no option. ""Our half year results clearly show the enormous financial impact of Covid-19 on our business,"" said a spokesperson. ""We are having to make difficult decisions and take every possible action now to protect as many jobs as possible."" ""And, while we never could have anticipated being in a position of making redundancies, over 6,000 of our colleagues have now indicated that they wish to take voluntary redundancy from BA.""

"This video can not be played BA staff facing redundancy or pay cuts speak out Some British Airways staff who have accepted voluntary redundancy say they had felt ""forced"" into it. BA wants to cut 12,000 job roles and says 6,000 staff have volunteered. Carol - not her real name - said BA had told her if she did not accept the offer of voluntary redundancy she would  have to apply for a job and if she did not get it she would only receive a statutory redundancy payout. She says the airline's conduct was ""a slap in the face"". Carol, who had worked for BA for 23 years, told the BBC: ""They [BA] said 'If you don't take the offer, you'll go into the fire-and-rehire phase', but if we aren't hired, we'll get only statutory redundancy."" Those BA cabin crew who did reapply for their jobs on a new contract are expected to find out later on Friday whether or not they lose their jobs. Carol, who worked on the long-haul fleet, said it was a foregone conclusion that the airline would not re-hire older cabin crew members. ""Even before I had accepted the voluntary redundancy offer, I had a message on my roster from BA: 'Thank you for your service. Good luck'. That is all I got from them after 23 years. ""It's a slap in the face, but it shows they knew who they were getting rid of,"" she said. She says she will be forced to sell her home since her redundancy payment won't cover her mortgage. ""It's actually age discrimination, we were forced out."" BA cabin crew: I won't earn enough to pay my mortgage British Airways: A breakdown in trust? Erica - again, not her real name - had been with British Airways long enough to remember being cabin crew on a Concorde jet, but accepted voluntary redundancy after seeing the brand airline turn into a ""toxic work environment"". ""The way they dealt with this was so underhand,"" she said. ""Yes coronavirus has had a terrible impact on the industry, but these are permanent pay cuts to what is a temporary problem. But this is a restructure that BA has wanted for a long time"". Most of those who are offered a new contract will suffer steep pay cuts, changes to their terms and conditions, and reduced allowances which top up their base salaries. Other workers such as engineers, ground crew and office staff are also expected to hear whether they have a future at the airline over the coming days. British Airways says more than 6,000 staff across the business have applied for voluntary redundancy and ""refutes claims that our colleagues were pressured"". The airline has begun culling employee positions as part of a major cost-cutting drive, which it insists is vital to ensure its long-term survival. But the way in which it has done so has provoked deep resentment among a large proportion of its workforce - and threats of industrial action.

"The US Treasury has imposed sanctions on Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam and 10 other top officials from Hong Kong and mainland China. The sanctions were used to target those undermining Hong Kong's autonomy, said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. ""The United States stands with the people of Hong Kong,"" Mr Mnuchin added. The move comes weeks after China imposed a controversial national security law on Hong Kong, which critics say threatens its freedoms. US-China tensions continue to escalate. Earlier this week, theTrump administration moved to ban US transactions with the Chinese owners of the WeChat and TikTok apps. Among those sanctioned are Hong Kong's police commissioner and several political secretaries. Profile: Carrie Lam, Chief Executive of Hong Kong The US Treasury directly accused Ms Lam of ""implementing Beijing's policies of suppression of freedom and democratic processes"". ""In 2019, Lam pushed for an update to Hong Kong's extradition arrangements to allow for extradition to the mainland, setting off a series of massive opposition demonstrations in Hong Kong,"" the US Treasury added in a statement. On Saturday, the Hong Kong government branded the move ""blatant and barbaric interference in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China, using Hong Kong as a pawn"". Ms Lam's spokesman said she would not be ""intimidated"". ""Speaking on behalf of her senior colleagues who are being targeted, the Chief Executive Mrs Carrie Lam said that we are discharging an honourable duty to safeguard national security, protecting the life and interests of not only the 7.5 million Hong Kong people but also the 1.4 billion Mainlanders."" Luo Huining, Beijing's representative in Hong Kong, is among those sanctioned. He said the measures were ridiculous. Hong Kong Commerce Secretary Edward Yau called the sanctions disproportionate and warned of retaliation against US businesses in the region. The 11 sanctioned officials will have all property in the US seized and financial assets frozen. THE US MOVE:Should US firms be worried about Hong Kong sanctions? RISING TENSIONS:The Hong Kong crisis and the new world order THE NEW LAW:What it is and why Hong Kong is worried WHAT COULD HAPPEN:Life sentences for breaking the law and more ELSEWHERE IN THE REGION:What might happen next in the South China Sea? The US has strongly criticised Hong Kong's national security law, with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo calling it an ""Orwellian move"" and an assault ""on the rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong"". China has defended its controversial law as necessary to stop foreign interference in Hong Kong and the often violent pro-democracy protests that took place last year. Announcing the sanctions on Friday, Mr Pompeo said: ""The Chinese Communist Party has made clear that Hong Kong will never again enjoy the high degree of autonomy that Beijing itself promised to the Hong Kong people and the United Kingdom for 50 years. ""President Trump has made clear that the United States will therefore treat Hong Kong as 'one country, one system' and take action against individuals who have crushed the Hong Kong people's freedoms."" Ms Lam has previously scoffed at the suggestion of sanctions, saying last month: ""I do not have any assets in theÂ United StatesÂ nor do I long for moving to theÂ United States."" The latest sanctions were authorised by an executive order Mr Trump signed in July aimed at punished China for its role in Hong Kong's affairs. This video can not be played 'Their freedom has been taken away' Tensions between the US and China have risen at an accelerated pace in recent months. The White House has accused China of lying about the origins of the coronavirus, which emerged from China late last year; of using social media apps to spy on Americans; of ""stealing"" intellectual property; and of hiding a wanted criminal within a Chinese embassy in the US - to name only a few allegations. Both countries ordered each other's consulates in major cities to close last month as tensions rose. The US has also pressured partners in the Five Eyes intelligence alliance- Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the UK - to ban China's Huawei 5G telecoms systems, citing national security concerns. China has expelled journalists from major US newspapers after the US placed new restrictions on Chinese media outlets that are affiliated with the country's communist government. US sanctions on Chinese over Xinjiang 'abuse' Earlier this month China issued arrest warrants for six pro-democracy activists, including an American citizen. China's push into the South China Sea has also alarmed its neighbours as well as the US, which has increased the pace navy patrols sent into the sea to counter Chinese expansion. Analysis by Zhaoyin Feng, BBC News Chinese, Washington The US sanctions on Chinese and Hong Kong officials had been looming for weeks. The actual personal impact on these Hong Kong-based officials may be limited if they have no financial interests in the US and no plans to travel there. And Carrie Lam herself said recently that she is not afraid of the sanctions. But this move is highly symbolic, as it's Washington's latest step condemning Beijing's drive to curtail freedoms and democracy in Hong Kong. The former British colony has become a major point of contention between the US and China. The world's two largest economies seem to be going through a painful ""divorce,"" with a consequential US presidential election only three months away. What does Washington get out of this? By being tough on Beijing the Trump administration is trying to rally voters, while the China hawks in the White House are aiming to correct the course of a bilateral relationship from which they believe China has gained more than America.

"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus outbreak this Friday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. Restrictions on households mixing indoors or in gardens in parts of northern Englandwill be extended to Preston from midnight, the Department of Health has announced. The city is now listed as an ""area of intervention"" after a spike in cases. Current rules on gatherings in Greater Manchester, Leicester, parts of West Yorkshire and East Lancashire will remain in place. Restrictions in Leicester, Blackburn and Bradford will also continue, the department said. However, for England as a whole, the number of people testing positive for coronavirus may be levelling off,according to new data from the Office for National Statistics. The figures are based on throat and nose swabs from nearly 120,000 people. The figures are based on modelling a sample of the population and a very small number of positive tests.

"House prices hit a new all time high in July as the property market gradually reopened, after being put on pause during the coronavirus lockdown. According to the latest Halifax House Price Index the average price of a home was Â£241,604 last month, 1.7% higher than June's Â£237,834. Prices are 3.8% higher than July 2019. Halifax managing director Russell Galley said pent-up demand and a lack of available houses had combined to push up prices. The government's cut in stamp duty had also boosted buyers' enthusiasm, he said. Last month Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced a temporary suspension of stamp duty on property sales up to Â£500,000 in England and Northern Ireland. House prices 'bounced back in July' How will the stamp duty holiday work? These latest figures mirror recent figures from the Nationwide Building Society, which showed house prices bounced back in July, climbing 1.7% during the month. ""The latest data adds to the emerging view that the market is experiencing a surprising spike post lockdown,"" said Mr Galley. But he warned that while the prospects for the housing market were brighter than might have been expected three months ago, the effects of the pandemic were still creating a great deal of long-term uncertainty. ""As government support measures come to an end, the resulting impact on the macroeconomic environment, and in turn the housing market, will start to become more apparent,"" he added. This view was echoed by Anna Clare Harper, author of Strategic Property Review, who said that the Halifax findings  reflected current confidence in the economy: ""What we can't forecast is what happens next: economically, and in policy. ""What we can predict accurately is that these two factors will prove fundamental to the future of the UK housing market."", she said. Another property specialist, Tomer Aboody, director of MT Finance, called on the government to consider further stamp duty relief on properties selling for more than Â£500,000 as he stressed the importance of the sector to the UK economy. ""Now more than ever the housing industry should be looked upon as the foundation upon which to keep the UK working.""

"In June there were almost 37,000 people in Guildford on Universal Credit - a rise of 148% since March London's commuter towns have seen the highest rate of people moving onto Universal Credit since the coronavirus lockdown began, BBC research has found. Guildford, Stevenage and Hemel Hempstead have had disproportionate rises in people claiming the benefit. Nearly 5.5 million people are now claiming benefits across Britain - an 81% increase since March. Experts said the drop in office-based working in the capital has impacted employment in commuter towns. Some of those who have applied for Universal Credit were forced to do so because they did not qualify for other government support, such as the furlough scheme or help for the self-employed. Universal Credit claims hit record during lockdown Huge increase in families hitting benefits cap Universal Credit failing millions, say peers BBC analysis of official postcode data from the Department for Work and Pensions shows that Guildford in Surrey had the sharpest increase in the proportion of people moving onto the working-age benefit. In June, there were almost 37,000 people in the town on Universal Credit - a rise of 148% since March, according to the latest figures. Two of London's outer boroughs, Harrow and Kingston-upon-Thames, have also seen increases far in excess of the national average. Laura Gardiner, research director at the Resolution Foundation think tank, which researches living standards of those on low-to-middle incomes, said the large numbers of workers in London who have still not returned to their offices are contributing to the demand for Universal Credit. ""Those workers may be able to continue working from home, but lots of the industries around them - the cafes, restaurants, the retail sectors - people who travel into the city to provide services to those office workers, therefore have nothing to do,"" she said. ""Those people tend to live on the outskirts of cities, and this is especially acute in London."" Places with the highest rate of people moving onto Universal Credit since March Guildford - 148% Harrow - 142% Kingston-Upon-Thames - 138% Hemel Hempstead - 129% Redhill - 128% Stevenage - 127% Luton - 126% Bromley - 124% Ilford - 120% North West London - 117% Source: BBC analysis of Department for Work and Pensions data between March and June Linford Miles, 31, is a self-employed photographer and filmmaker from Farnham, Surrey.

""As we saw Covid sweeping across the world, I started getting more and more calls from clients saying, we don't feel it's a safe idea going ahead with these projects. ""Every single job I had was cancelled. ""I looked at the self-employment scheme, but I didn't qualify as I had only just started up within the past 12 months, so the only option was Universal Credit. ""I've always seen myself as being self-sufficient, I've always tried to keep a job. So it was pretty disheartening when I had to apply for Universal Credit. ""It definitely affected my mental health - I didn't really want to leave the house, I didn't feel much pride or self-respect. It caused a great deal of stress. ""The money from Universal Credit was nowhere near enough to cover my personal expenses - never mind my business expenses. ""I was being hounded as well by messages on the Universal Credit system to apply for work, to look for employment, to attend job fairs. Every single email that came in, every single ping, just triggered something in my mind, it just added more stress."" The volunteers of Stoke Community Support, a church-led initiative in Guildford, started cooking meals to help local families in need in April. They initially provided frozen dishes twice a week to 45 families. They're now helping 140 households. The increase has been driven in large part by people losing their jobs or seeing their hours cut. ""A lot of retail jobs have gone,"" said Peter Curran, who leads the project. ""Manual workers, zero hours type contracts, in coffee shops - that's where a lot of the job losses are."" The Guildford area has a large number of consultancy businesses and self-employed traders, dozens of which have become insolvent in recent weeks. Allen Ruddock, a financier turned property developer, is struggling to keep his businesses afloat. He was advised to apply for Universal Credit but he says his pride has so far stopped him from doing so. ""Guildford is a very entrepreneurial environment, and a lot of small businesses get created,"" he says. ""But when something like Covid hits, if you're not an established business, then you are going to have to seek support elsewhere. ""I've gone from a five-figure salary to scraping to get by on a few thousand and that's why Universal Credit might end up being my sole option in the end.""

" One day, the virus will subside. It could be eradicated. But even then, life will not simply return to the way it was before Covid-19. Spurred on by the coronavirus crisis, architects have been rethinking the buildings we inhabit. Scroll down to find out how the future might look. Meet Laila.It's 2025 and she works from home four days a week. It's been that way since the 2020 lockdown. It's 06:30 and she's on her way to work. Laila arrives at her office building at 07:00. Start times at the company where she works are staggered to minimise the number of people arriving at the same time. Her ""office days"" are mainly for meetings. Gone are the days when she'd head into the office to work at a screen. She can do that at home. Laila's employer used to share a much larger office building with several other companies. Now they're in a smaller, newly-refurbished premises all to themselves. On the ground floor Laila pauses in front of a thermal body scanner to check her temperature is normal. Today it's 36.5C. She passes. A camera, used for facial recognition, identifies her as a staff member and a security barrier opens. At no point does she touch anything.  Laila is on a contactless pathway. The lift to her office on the fourth floor is voice-activated. Touchless technology has replaced grubby buttons. The maximum occupancy is two. On the fourth floor she walks down the corridor and through the door. Both are wider than before, made that way to keep staff further apart and reduce the chances of a virus being transmitted. At the door Laila uses a hand sanitiser. She's so used to it now that she doesn't even think about it. She sits down at the desk.  Much of the furniture - as well as wall panels and facades - is made from antimicrobial material.  It's easier to clean and harder for bacteria to stick to. Laila makes a coffee in the kitchen area where the worktops are also antimicrobial. The handles on the drawers and cupboards are made of copper. It's a costly but naturally microbe-repellent material. The air conditioning system uses UV light to kill pathogens. It also reduces the humidity to help prevent germs multiplying, responding to a stream of data from sensors fixed around the building, and wearable sensors used by staff. Laila's office used to be completely open plan.  Now she's partitioned off.  To her left there is a clear plastic screen so that she can at least see her colleagues. The screens are removable, bolted into fixtures in the floor. They go up if there's the threat of an outbreak, but come out if the threat subsides. In front of Laila's desk, the separation is done with plants. The staff got fed up with plastic everywhere a couple of years ago. They said it made the office feel like a hospital. Laila prefers the plants. Laila's morning is spent in a meeting about a new project. It's face-to-face with colleagues - but all at a safe distance. The only reason Laila goes into the office now is for this kind of interaction - in which meeting people in real life produces better results than seeing each other online. It's 16:00 and time to go home. Laila moved to the suburbs with a friend after the lockdown in 2020. It's a longer commute, but she doesn't mind as it's only once a week. A bigger home meant more space. When the lockdown came she thought working from home would only last a few weeks, and that she'd manage with a laptop on the kitchen table. But when weeks turned into months, and months turned into years, she knew she would need a home office and her old flat in town was nowhere near big enough. She now works in an upstairs room. There's a new standing desk, a properly adjustable office chair and storage for documents. She never realised, before, how important it was to have good lighting, so she had spotlights installed in the ceiling and bought a proper desk lamp. Laila is saving up to replace the double glazing. She's near a big road and she needs to concentrate hard when she's working - sound-proofing is an issue she hadn't anticipated. She thought about a loft extension and building an office in the garden, but decided on the bedroom office option for now. It's been quite a change for Laila - and millions like her. Meet Laila.

She thought about a loft extension and building an office in the garden, but decided on the bedroom office option for now. It's been quite a change for Laila - and millions like her. While Laila made changes to her life relatively quickly after the pandemic hit, architecture, in reality, moves slowly. Buildings typically take five years to design, finance and construct. Many people can't afford to move house - or spend money on home improvements. And in the teeth of a recession, many employers won't have the money to relocate or reorganise. If Covid-19 dies out in the coming months and a vaccine is found quickly, many homes and workplaces could return to something like ""normal"". But aspects of Laila's imaginary life may become reality for many of us, particularly if there are continued outbreaks and no vaccine is found. Many architects believe a major shift towards working from home will be the most significant impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the built environment. Why? The short answer is money, says Prof David Burney, who served as New York City commissioner for public architecture under Mayor Michael Bloomberg. ""Companies can cut their bills for office space dramatically by increasing the number of staff working from home – and they will do it,"" he says. ""We're already seeing some in the commercial real estate business in a state of panic. They can see the demand for office space declining."" ""I think we could see a lot of existing buildings become unmarketable,"" says Hugh Pearman of the Royal Institute of British Architects (Riba). Large-scale office spaces, particularly in high-rise buildings which are hard to modify, are already becoming less attractive. ""And there will be pressure to flee the city,"" he says. Mr Pearman points out that health concerns have driven key architectural developments in the past. Worries about disease and poor air quality triggered population movements away from city centres in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and the growth of suburbs was a direct consequence. If pre-Covid homes were all about relaxing and recharging, post-Covid homes will be part home, part workplace, says UK architect Grace Choi. ""Many more people are going to want more space in their homes to work, or at least some versatility in the space that they have. We're all going to need to configure our space in a more intelligent way."" Ms Choi says her practice is already getting many more inquiries from builders about homes with office spaces and garden studios, as workers find that perching at the kitchen table with a laptop just doesn't cut it. Homeworking doesn't suit many jobs, of course, and thousands of offices are here to stay. Architects envisage that creative thinking and new technology will help keep them relevant. ""The days of sitting there hammering away on a laptop are gone - you can do that from home,"" says  Dale Sinclair, architect and director of innovation at AECOM. ""What's really exciting is that going into the office will be for collaboration, generating ideas with colleagues."" Mr Sinclair is one of the many architects predicting vastly more automation in offices, particularly ""touchless technology"" or ""contactless pathways"" and a greater use of data. ""Buildings are going to have a huge amount of technology: people using their phones to navigate through them, face recognition, voice activation. And we'll see many more robot assistants and sensors picking up data,"" he says. ""This whole area is going to really take off. We're already using this technology in hospitals – and Covid-19 is massively accelerating the move towards using it in other places."" Information from fixed and wearable sensors could be used to adjust air temperature and humidity in the fight against some pathogens. Air conditioning systems using UV light to kill bacteria and some viruses are already in use, with light sources in the coils at the centre of the system or in the ducting. The downside of the open-plan office is obvious during the pandemic, but some experts believe that open plan could survive if measures to limit interaction are in place. Where partitions are essential, architects and designers are trying to minimise their negative impact on social interaction. Can they be removed when there's little threat, but reinstalled if there is an outbreak? Can they be clear, rather than opaque, so that staff can still have eye contact with workmates? For Ben Channon, head of wellbeing at Assael Architecture, biophilia - our in-built affinity with the natural world - is the way forward. ""We can use rows of plants to separate people.  People are quite scared – they're not going to want to come back to a plastic cubicle that smells of bleach. In the right circumstances plant screening can be a much better solution - and can also help with air quality."" Mr Channon advocates using naturally antimicrobial materials like copper and its alloys, in high-touch areas like door and drawer handles. Copper is expensive but ""businesses are seeing the cost now of what happens when they don't have these things,"" he says. While remote working for many may be the legacy of Covid-19, coming together in the real world is still fundamental to human psychology, says Sadie Morgan from London-based firm dRMM. ""Taking risks and creativity, essential for businesses, generally happens in groups, real groups - not in a virtual space - when you can see people directly and be in the same space."" Grace Choi agrees. ""We shouldn't underestimate the need to get together to exchange ideas. ""We miss body language, cues for when to speak, fluid conversation and the connections between us.""

"Rescue workers in Lebanon are searching for dozens of people missing after Tuesday's deadly blast Anti-government protesters clashed with security forces on Thursday night Many in Lebanon blame government negligence for the explosion Beirut's hospitals are strained by bed and equipment shortages given the high number of people hurt The UN is releasing emergency supplies, as it warns of a humanitarian crisis The blast killed at least 154 people, injured about 5,000 others, and left about 300,000 homeless Edited by Robert Greenall We're ending our live coverage of the fallout from the Lebanon explosion, but you can keep up with all the latest developments on the BBC News website and across radio and TV. Here's a quick recap of some of the biggest updates from today:   Today's live coverage was brought to you by Robert Greenall, Thomas Spender, Yaroslav Lukov, George Wright and Alice Cuddy  The Fayed family Some tourists are travelling to witness the fallout for themselves. BBC Arabic correspondent Carine Torbey met a family who had travelled for more than two hours from Bekaa in Lebanon to witness the devastation. âWe are heartbroken. We came from Bekaa to share the feeling with our fellow Lebanese families in Beirut. We want to share their pain and see it with our own eyes,â Safaa Fayed said. Media reports say that 38 Syrians and two Egyptians were among foreign nationals who died in Tuesday's blast. At least four migrant workers from Bangladesh, as well as two citizens of the Philippines and one Ethiopian were also killed, reports say. French architect Jean-Marc Bonfils, involved in rebuilding Beirut after the civil war, and a German diplomat were among the first fatalities to be announced.    BBC Arabic's Rami Ruhayem has been following Lebanese President Michel Aoun's extensive news conference on Tuesday's explosion. He tweets (in Arabic) thatMr Aoun explained how he had received information ""about the storage at the port"",externalon 20 July and immediately ordered the Supreme Defence Council to remove it. President Aoun, right, met his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, on Thursday Lebanon President Michel Aoun has rejected calls for an international investigation into the explosion. Questioned by a journalist as to whether he was against an international investigation, the president replied ""of course"", adding that such a probe ""would dilute the truth"". It comes as several local media channels have said they will continue to boycott all speeches from political figures in protest against the fallout of the blast. One of the country's biggest news channels, LBC Lebanon, refrained from broadcasting the president's speech today, BBC Beirut correspondent Carine Torbey reports. The channel will also refrain from broadcasting a speech by the Hezbollah leader, Hasan Nasrallah.   Several countries have also pledged support to rescue and reconstruction efforts The United States says it is providing more than $15m (Â£11.5m) in ""humanitarian assistance"" to Lebanon following this week's explosion. In a statement, its international aid agency USAID said the money would go towards food and medical supplies. It will amount to three months' worth of food for 50,000 people, and three months' worth of medicine for 60,000 people, it said. ""We stand with the people of Lebanon as they seek relief and accountability in this difficult time,"" USAID added in a statement. Numerous other countries have also offered support to Lebanon following the explosion, including money and manpower for rescue and reconstruction efforts. The UK earlier this weekpromised a Â£5m aid package. BBC OS Armenia street after the blast was like ""a scene from a disaster movie"", said Nadia Hardman Armenia street, a short walk away from the devastated port of Beirut, has gained attention online for before-and-after
photos showing residents coming together to clear the destruction there. Nadia Hardman lives on the street, about 400m (1,312ft) from where the
explosion happened. âI arrived an hour or two after to the devastation of our
building,â she toldBBC OS on World Service radio. ""It was like a scene from a disaster movie. My living room
door was in the kitchen, the kitchen door was in the hallway, shattered glass
everywhere.â But when she came down from her flat the next day, she was shocked
to find that the street - which is lined with restaurants, shops and bars - was
clean.  Armenia street after the clean-up Volunteers - both residents of the street and those from other parts of Lebanon - had come together to sweep away rubble. Hussein Zreik travelled from Baalbek, about 70km (43 miles) north-east of Beirut, to help. He warned that while rubble had been cleared, there was still structural damage to many of the buildings. ""There are some buildings that collapsed, and now we think there will be more than 10 others that will collapse. ""Weâve contacted someone from the government telling them to offer help. But the government is not offering anything to anyone. Weâve been told that they didnât even pass by [Armenia street],"" Mr Zreik said. Nassif Hitti announces his resignation on Monday Nassif Hitti was Lebanon's minister for foreign affairs until he resigned on Monday - a day before the Beirut blast - warning that the country was becoming a failed state. He accused the government of a lack of will to enact the reforms called for by the Lebanese people and the international community. Speaking to the BBC, he said the devastating explosion was a wake-up call for the Lebanese people. ""The Beirut blast reveals the kind of structural corruption, negligence, personalised politics, lack of responsibility and lack of accountability of the Lebanese system,"" he said. ""This tragedy is an indicator, unfortunately, of the crisis we have - that we have to stop it and start [anew]."" Boris Prokoshev (right) says the ship went to Beirut to pick up road-building equipment The Russian captain of the ship whose cargo is thought to have caused this week's explosion has spoken to the BBC's Sarah Rainsford about how it came to be impounded in Beirut in 2013. Boris Prokoshev said the Rhosus was travelling with ""2,750 one-tonne bags"" of ammonium nitrate on board - a cargo he described as ""dangerous, but not so
dangerous you canât transport it"". After taking over the vessel in Turkey, he said he was told to travel to Beirut to pick up road-building equipment, but found that it was too heavy to get on board. ""The shipâs hatches buckled. They were rusty, old. So we couldnât take it. I refused,"" he recalled. Lebanese authorities impounded the ship for non-payment of port fees and a fine for failing to collect the extra cargo. ""They knew what we had on board,"" he said of the ammonium nitrate. ""Iâd informed them
and I sent them scans of the papers for the cargo."" With the ship impounded, Mr Prokoshev said he and three crew members were forced to remain on board for 10 months, before the case was resolved through the courts. ""When we went, the ship was fine, in good condition. We closed all the compartments, locked them and handed the keys to immigration at the port,"" the captain said. He did not learn until later that the cargo had been unloaded and the vessel had sunk. Boris Prokoshev and some of his crew remained on the impounded vessel for months Julian HajjBBC Arabic Ruined in the blast, this building is home to Annahar, one of Lebanon's most prominent daily newspapers. Fifteen of the paper's journalists were injured in the explosion. For perhaps the first time in its 87-year history, the paper has not published since Tuesday. The German Office for the Protection of the Constitution has confirmed media reports that the Lebanese Shia group Hezbollah stored  quantities of ammonium nitrate in a warehouse in southern Germany. The office told Die Zeit newspaper that so-called cold packs containing material including ammonium nitrate had been discovered in 2016 and had then been taken out of the country. ""The stored cold packs were taken out of the country in 2016. There is no indication that the storage of these cold packs has any connection to the warehouse in Beirut port,"" the office said in a statement. Terrorism expert Michael Ortmann was quoted by German media as saying several hundred kilograms of ammonium nitrate had been stored in Germany. Media reports say the Israeli secret service Mossad alerted the German authorities to the existence of the warehouse earlier this year as well as giving further information about the group's activity in Germany.Germany banned the group in April. Germany's interior ministry has refused to give further details, citing the need to protect active investigations. BBC journalist Mohamed Madi is on the ground in Beirut as anger begins to surface among many locals. ""Shock is beginning to turn into anger in Beirut,"" he writes. ""As hope fades for survivors, families of the dead and missing as well as ordinary Beirutis are now starting to turn their attention to what's next. ""Many want to make Saturday a day of national protest - not only for this tragedy, but for what they see as decades of government ineptitude."" Allow Twitter content?

Satellite and aerial images show the extent of the Beirut port explosion that ripped through the Lebanese city on Tuesday. Below are pictures of the port taken in 2019 and 5 August 2020, a day after the blast.  Aid agencies estimate that around 300,000 people have been left homeless by the explosion and there are fears of food and medicine shortages. Read our full story here These pictures show damage to the St George's Hospital in Achrafiyeh district near the port that has put the facility out of action entirely. The blast left the hospital, one of the oldest in the city, with collapsed ceilings and beds covered in broken glass. Staff evacuated the hospital on Tuesday night and this included the transfer of 20 patients who were being treated for Covid-19, AFP quoted hospital chief Eid Azar as saying. Patients had to be carried down flights of stairs because the lifts were no longer working, the hospital courtyard was turned into a field clinic and nurses applied stitches by the light of their cellphones, he said. A number of hospital staff members were wounded in the blast, Mr Azar said. The death toll from Tuesday's explosion has risen to 154, Lebanon's official National News Agency (NNA) quoted the health minister as saying. About 120 people remain in critical condition. Many of them require complex surgery after being injured by glass shards, Minister of Public Health Hamad Hassan said. An ammonium nitrate explosion can release toxic gases Ammonium nitrate - the substance blamed for Tuesday's explosion -  is a crystal-like white solid which is made in large industrial quantities. Its biggest use is as a source of nitrogen for fertiliser, but it is also used to create explosives for mining. ""You won't just find ammonium nitrate in the ground,"" explains Andrea Sella, professor of chemistry at University College London. That's because it's synthetic, made by reacting ammonia with nitric acid, he says. Ammonium nitrate is made all over the world and is relatively cheap to buy. But storing it can be a problem, and it has been associated with serious industrial accidents in the past. Read more here Beirut resident Rayane Awkal has told the BBC she was meeting a friend in a coffee shop in the Gemmazye area when the blast happened. She said the sound was like that of a plane and then ""everything was shattered,
there was glass on the floor"". âAll of a sudden my friend started screaming 'My leg, my leg!' And I look down and I see her leg split near her knee and bleeding."" Rayane said they somehow managed to go to a nearby hospital where they saw many injured people. ""There was blood everywhere, and we were told
they werenât admitting anyone."" Three hospitals refused to treat her friend but eventually she ""got stitched"" in a hospital outside the capital. ""Iâm very fortunate that miraculously I got out safe, my
parents are safe,"" Rayane said. But she added: ""Iâm very angry as a citizen because I feel nobody is
listening to us. ""We are just fed lies after lies by this corrupted system, by
corrupted politicians who are just trying to buy time to try to get themselves
out of this mess. ""Because it is their mess, their lies and blood is on their
hands â everyone who has died, everyone who got injured, every last - business,
every last house - itâs on them because of their mismanagement and because of
everything they have done wrong.â Members of the public are turning out in the their droves to help with the huge clean up in Beirut. Andrew, 18, and his friends are helping to clean the areas of Mar Mikhael, Gemmayze and Geitawi. ""Although
this is a very saddening period Lebanon is passing through, a lot of the people
present have made the atmosphere jolly, almost celebratory,"" he tells the BBC. ""A lot of people are
coming every single day, bringing their own cleaning supplies with them - brooms, plastic bags, gloves and such. The ones that aren't cleaning have set
up booths for things like first aid, offering food and water, and even shade to
rest."" Lina Sinjab, BBC Middle East correspondent, is also on the ground in Beirut. ""I am at Gemmayzeh street - the one that saw most damage
after the explosion. The street is filled with volunteers with their cleaning
equipment to help clear debris and rubble,"" she says. ""Incredible spirit after such a
shock and traumatic experience."" A Russian rescuer with a sniffer dog searches for survivors in Beirut Four more bodies have been recovered in the past 24 hours by French rescuers, as a big international search operation continues at Beirut's devastated port. Near the disembowelled silos at the port, Russian rescuers were ankle-deep in corn, as excavators removed mangled shipping containers, the AFP news agency reports. It says an eerie sense of calm filled the once-bustling port, reduced to an enormous scrapyard.
   The only sounds are those of heavy machinery cutting through forests of twisted iron rods and mountains of concrete rubble to clear a path for the rescuers. Tom BatemanBBC Middle East correspondent We take a walk at dawn through a
shattered city. Glass and rubble from destroyed apartments is now piling
up on street corners, sometimes spreading into the roads.The devastation runs from
neighbourhood to neighbourhood. Closer
to the blast site is Gemmayzeh district. We stumble upon Nabil el-Alam standing
outside the ruins of his hospital, where he is deputy director. The Rosary Sisters site was built
only four years ago, and was full with patients and staff when the explosion
happened a few blocks away. Nabil
tells me a staff member was killed and many patients hurt in the blast. âWhen I heard the explosion I came here
directly and I saw the hospital, all destroyed. So we worked to help the people,â he said. He wasnât in his office at the time,
and he thanks God - it was completely destroyed and he would have been killed,
he says. Nabil fights back
tears. âAll the [patients] were in shock, all with injuries. We tried to help
them, to transfer them to other hospitals. âWe lost the hospital. We lost our jobs. We lost hopeâ. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,1.0
"This video can not be played The explosion caused huge damage to the port and surrounding areas of Beirut UN agencies have warned of a humanitarian crisis in Lebanon after Tuesday's devastating blast in Beirut. Lebanon was already suffering a major economic downturn before the explosion, which left at least 154 people dead, 5,000 injured and 300,000 homeless. The World Food Programme said the damage to Beirut's port would interrupt food supplies and push prices up. The World Health Organization said the health system was seriously damaged, with three hospitals out of action. Meanwhile, Lebanese President Michel Aoun rejected calls for an international investigation into the explosion, and said local authorities would examine whether it was triggered by ""external interference"" such as a bomb. The leader of the militant Hezbollah movement, Hassan Nasrallah, also denied allegations that it had stored weapons or ammunition at the port. The government has said the blast was the result of the detonation of 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate that had been stored unsafely at the port for six years. The decision to keep so much explosive material in a warehouse near the city centre has been met with disbelief and fury by many Lebanese, who have long accused the political elite of corruption, neglect and mismanagement. Before Tuesday's explosion, 75% of Lebanese were in need of aid, 33% had lost their jobs, and one million people were living below the poverty line. Lebanon's main grain silo at Beirut port was destroyed by Tuesday's explosion WFP spokeswoman Elisabeth Byrs told reporters in Geneva that the organisation was concerned the severe damage to Beirut's port - the largest in the country - could limit the flow of food supplies and push prices beyond the reach of many. The WFP was sending 5,000 food parcels that would be enough to feed a family of five for a month, and was planning to import wheat flour and grains, she said. Christian Lindmeier of the WHO meanwhile warned that Lebanon's hospitals were overwhelmed with the patients, some were damaged and some non-functional, and that 500 beds had been lost. 'We don't have dreams any more' Beirut explosion: Before-and-after images What we know about the blast Why Lebanon is in crisis The WHO has delivered emergency trauma and surgical supply kits containing essential medicines and medical supplies, and is calling for $15m (Â£11.5m) to cover immediate needs and ensure continuity in the response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Lebanon was also seeing a rise in cases of the coronavirus disease but 17 containers of masks, gowns and gloves, shipped to Beirut by the WHO, had been completely destroyed, Mr Lindmeier said. This video can not be played Beirut resident May Melki says her rendition of Auld Lang Syne is a ""homage"" to the blast victims The UN Refugee Agency, which normally supports Lebanon's 1.5 million Syrian refugees, said it was releasing emergency shelter materials to all those in need. Many countries have offered aid to help Lebanon, with the US announcing on Friday that it planned to immediately send $15m worth of food and medicine. Lebanon's president and prime minister have said the ammonium nitrate - which is commonly used as a fertiliser but can also made into an explosive - had been stored in a warehouse at the port without any safety precautions since 2014, when it was unloaded from an impounded cargo ship. On Wednesday, Mr Aoun promised a transparent investigation by Lebanese authorities and to ""hold those responsible and those who were negligent accountable, and serve them the most severe punishment"". This video can not be played ""Now I'm shaking, all the way from up to down"" However, calls for international investigation have grown since then. The president ruled out such a move on Friday, saying: ""The goal behind calls for an international investigation into the port issue is to dilute the truth."" He also said the government-backed inquiry was looking into three possibilities: negligence, accident or what he called ""external interference through a rocket or bomb or other act"". Officials have said the explosion appears to have been triggered by a fire and there has been no evidence so far of the third possibility mentioned by Mr Aoun. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, Mr Aoun's political ally, meanwhile denied any responsibility for the blast, insisting that his group did not control the port and that it had stored no weapons or ammunition there. ""Not a weapons cache, not a missile factory, not a single missile, not a single rifle, not a single bomb, not a bullet, not nitrates. Nothing at all. Not now, not in the past,"" he declared in a speech. This video can not be played The BBC's Sarah Rainsford spoke to Boris Prokoshev, captain of the MV Rhosus BBC Middle East analyst Sebastian Usher says Mr Nasrallah's denial is necessary because many Lebanese believe the exact opposite - he needs to shore up his position and that of his movement, which still wields decisive power in Lebanon.

"The US Treasury has imposed sanctions on Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam and 10 other top officials from Hong Kong and mainland China. The sanctions were used to target those undermining Hong Kong's autonomy, said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. ""The United States stands with the people of Hong Kong,"" Mr Mnuchin added. The move comes weeks after China imposed a controversial national security law on Hong Kong, which critics say threatens its freedoms. US-China tensions continue to escalate. Earlier this week, theTrump administration moved to ban US transactions with the Chinese owners of the WeChat and TikTok apps. Among those sanctioned are Hong Kong's police commissioner and several political secretaries. Profile: Carrie Lam, Chief Executive of Hong Kong The US Treasury directly accused Ms Lam of ""implementing Beijing's policies of suppression of freedom and democratic processes"". ""In 2019, Lam pushed for an update to Hong Kong's extradition arrangements to allow for extradition to the mainland, setting off a series of massive opposition demonstrations in Hong Kong,"" the US Treasury added in a statement. On Saturday, the Hong Kong government branded the move ""blatant and barbaric interference in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China, using Hong Kong as a pawn"". Ms Lam's spokesman said she would not be ""intimidated"". ""Speaking on behalf of her senior colleagues who are being targeted, the Chief Executive Mrs Carrie Lam said that we are discharging an honourable duty to safeguard national security, protecting the life and interests of not only the 7.5 million Hong Kong people but also the 1.4 billion Mainlanders."" Luo Huining, Beijing's representative in Hong Kong, is among those sanctioned. He said the measures were ridiculous. Hong Kong Commerce Secretary Edward Yau called the sanctions disproportionate and warned of retaliation against US businesses in the region. The 11 sanctioned officials will have all property in the US seized and financial assets frozen. THE US MOVE:Should US firms be worried about Hong Kong sanctions? RISING TENSIONS:The Hong Kong crisis and the new world order THE NEW LAW:What it is and why Hong Kong is worried WHAT COULD HAPPEN:Life sentences for breaking the law and more ELSEWHERE IN THE REGION:What might happen next in the South China Sea? The US has strongly criticised Hong Kong's national security law, with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo calling it an ""Orwellian move"" and an assault ""on the rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong"". China has defended its controversial law as necessary to stop foreign interference in Hong Kong and the often violent pro-democracy protests that took place last year. Announcing the sanctions on Friday, Mr Pompeo said: ""The Chinese Communist Party has made clear that Hong Kong will never again enjoy the high degree of autonomy that Beijing itself promised to the Hong Kong people and the United Kingdom for 50 years. ""President Trump has made clear that the United States will therefore treat Hong Kong as 'one country, one system' and take action against individuals who have crushed the Hong Kong people's freedoms."" Ms Lam has previously scoffed at the suggestion of sanctions, saying last month: ""I do not have any assets in theÂ United StatesÂ nor do I long for moving to theÂ United States."" The latest sanctions were authorised by an executive order Mr Trump signed in July aimed at punished China for its role in Hong Kong's affairs. This video can not be played 'Their freedom has been taken away' Tensions between the US and China have risen at an accelerated pace in recent months. The White House has accused China of lying about the origins of the coronavirus, which emerged from China late last year; of using social media apps to spy on Americans; of ""stealing"" intellectual property; and of hiding a wanted criminal within a Chinese embassy in the US - to name only a few allegations. Both countries ordered each other's consulates in major cities to close last month as tensions rose. The US has also pressured partners in the Five Eyes intelligence alliance- Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the UK - to ban China's Huawei 5G telecoms systems, citing national security concerns. China has expelled journalists from major US newspapers after the US placed new restrictions on Chinese media outlets that are affiliated with the country's communist government. US sanctions on Chinese over Xinjiang 'abuse' Earlier this month China issued arrest warrants for six pro-democracy activists, including an American citizen. China's push into the South China Sea has also alarmed its neighbours as well as the US, which has increased the pace navy patrols sent into the sea to counter Chinese expansion. Analysis by Zhaoyin Feng, BBC News Chinese, Washington The US sanctions on Chinese and Hong Kong officials had been looming for weeks. The actual personal impact on these Hong Kong-based officials may be limited if they have no financial interests in the US and no plans to travel there. And Carrie Lam herself said recently that she is not afraid of the sanctions. But this move is highly symbolic, as it's Washington's latest step condemning Beijing's drive to curtail freedoms and democracy in Hong Kong. The former British colony has become a major point of contention between the US and China. The world's two largest economies seem to be going through a painful ""divorce,"" with a consequential US presidential election only three months away. What does Washington get out of this? By being tough on Beijing the Trump administration is trying to rally voters, while the China hawks in the White House are aiming to correct the course of a bilateral relationship from which they believe China has gained more than America.

"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says Aberdeen players 'blatantly' broke the rules on coronavirus The number of cases in Aberdeen's Covid cluster has risen to 101 as Nicola Sturgeon said she was ""furious"" at footballers who broke lockdown rules. The first minister said it was ""unacceptable"" that eight Aberdeen players had visited a bar in the city on Saturday night. They are all now self-isolating after twotested positive for Covid-19. Lockdown measures werereintroduced in the city on Wednesdayas the number of cases in the cluster grew. Ms Sturgeon told her daily briefing there had been an additional 22 cases in the last day, taking the total to 101. The total number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Scotland rose by 43 on Friday, and no deaths were reported for the 22nd consecutive day. Aberdeen FC's Covid-19 cases: What do we know? Graduate 'heartbroken' after losing job due to lockdown Aberdeen lockdown: 'It feels never ending' How is Scotland tackling local Covid clusters? Ms Sturgeon said 27 of the confirmed cases were in the Grampian area, although it was not yet clear how many were connected to the Aberdeen outbreak. The Aberdeen players who are self-isolating had visited the city's Soul bar on Saturday. Images were shared on social media showing queues of people gathered outside the bar, which is one of about 30 venues now linked to the cluster. A picture taken at the weekend showed people queuing outside the Soul bar in Aberdeen Ms Sturgeon said: ""It is  now clear that all eight of these players visited a bar in Aberdeen on Saturday night. ""In doing so they blatantly broke the rules that had been agreed between the SFA, the SPFL, and the Scottish government, which, to put it mildly, is completely unacceptable."" The first minister said she supported the decision to cancel the club's match with St Johnstone this weekend. ""We are asking members of the public to behave in a highly precautionary manner,"" she said. ""When a football club ends up with players infected with Covid - and let's remember this is not through bad luck but through clear breaches of the rules - we cannot take even a small risk that they then spread the infection to other parts of the country."" Aberdeen played their first game of the season at Pittodrie on Saturday Ms Sturgeon added that she was ""pretty furious"" at the situation - and that if players did not abide by the rules, they were putting the return of the professional game at risk. Aberdeen chairman Dave Cormack said he had apologised to football and health authorities, and to the other Premiership clubs. ""Regrettably, what has happened in the last few days has undermined all the hard work that has gone into keeping our players and staff safe,"" he said. ""We are now dealing with this internally with the seriousness it deserves. ""In the meantime, I'd like to reassure the relevant bodies, our fans and everyone associated with the club that our already rigorous measures are being forensically scrutinised and that no stone will be left unturned in ensuring that no-one is under any doubt about what must be adhered to."" The outbreak in Aberdeen has been linked to bars and restaurants The coronavirus cluster in Aberdeen has been linked to pubs and restaurants. A list has been published of premises visited by people confirmed to have the virus. They are: Bieldside Inn, Bobbin, Brewdog (Castlegate), Buckie Farm Carvery, CafÃ© Andaluz, CafÃ© Dag, CafÃ© Drummond, The Cock & Bull, College Bar, The Dutch Mill, Dyce Carvery, East End Social Club, Ferryhill House Hotel, Hawthorn/Adam Lounge, The Howff, The Justice Mill, The Marine Hotel, McGinty's, McNasty's, Malmaison,  Moonfish CafÃ©, No.10 Bar, O'Donoghues, Old Bank Bar, Prohibition, Soul, Spider's Web, The Draft Project. The list also includes Aboyne, Deeside and Hazlehead golf clubs, and the Banks O'Dee Football Club. Anyone who had visited any of these premises should be ""extra vigilant for symptoms"" - even if they had not been contacted by specialist tracers.

"House prices hit a new all time high in July as the property market gradually reopened, after being put on pause during the coronavirus lockdown. According to the latest Halifax House Price Index the average price of a home was Â£241,604 last month, 1.7% higher than June's Â£237,834. Prices are 3.8% higher than July 2019. Halifax managing director Russell Galley said pent-up demand and a lack of available houses had combined to push up prices. The government's cut in stamp duty had also boosted buyers' enthusiasm, he said. Last month Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced a temporary suspension of stamp duty on property sales up to Â£500,000 in England and Northern Ireland. House prices 'bounced back in July' How will the stamp duty holiday work? These latest figures mirror recent figures from the Nationwide Building Society, which showed house prices bounced back in July, climbing 1.7% during the month. ""The latest data adds to the emerging view that the market is experiencing a surprising spike post lockdown,"" said Mr Galley. But he warned that while the prospects for the housing market were brighter than might have been expected three months ago, the effects of the pandemic were still creating a great deal of long-term uncertainty. ""As government support measures come to an end, the resulting impact on the macroeconomic environment, and in turn the housing market, will start to become more apparent,"" he added. This view was echoed by Anna Clare Harper, author of Strategic Property Review, who said that the Halifax findings  reflected current confidence in the economy: ""What we can't forecast is what happens next: economically, and in policy. ""What we can predict accurately is that these two factors will prove fundamental to the future of the UK housing market."", she said. Another property specialist, Tomer Aboody, director of MT Finance, called on the government to consider further stamp duty relief on properties selling for more than Â£500,000 as he stressed the importance of the sector to the UK economy. ""Now more than ever the housing industry should be looked upon as the foundation upon which to keep the UK working.""

"A woman photographed in Dungeness, Kent, on Thursday appeared to be heavily pregnant A total of 235 migrants were intercepted crossing the English Channel on Thursday, the Home Office confirmed - a record for a single day. Among them was a group of 15, including children and a heavily pregnant woman, that landed on a beach in Kent. In total, 17 vessels were apprehended by The Maritime and Coastguard Agency and Border Force units. On Friday, at least 130 people in 13 vessels were brought to the UK, the Home Office said. At about 20:20 BST it said that Border Force was continuing to deal with ""a number of ongoing incidents"". Why are migrants crossing the English Channel? BBC reporter Simon Jones said a kayak and other inflatable vessels had also been reported heading towards the Kent coast. Including Thursday's total, 3,948 people have crossed the Channel in more than 300 boats so far this year. A boat with about 17 people on board was spotted off the coast of Dover by the BBC The Home Office has not been able to supply a breakdown of genders or nationalities of those who were intercepted on Thursday. Minister for Immigration Compliance and the Courts Chris Philp said he shared ""the anger and frustration of the public at the appalling number of crossings"" on Thursday. By Simon Jones, BBC News We took to the sea at 04:00 BST - and shortly after sunrise on Friday the eagle-eyed skipper of our fishing boat spotted something on the horizon. Motoring toward us is a boat carrying 17 people. They told us they were from Iraq, and there was a pregnant woman on board, along with several children. They were trying to reach Kent. The Coastguard asked us to shadow them as the Border Force was busy dealing with other boats and kayaks in the Channel. But after an hour, with the White Cliffs in sight, there was a problem - their engine broke down. Another Border Force boat though was already en route to pick them up and take them to Dover. As they stepped foot on British soil, they had achieved their goal. One of the vessels was carrying 26 people. In one incident, Border Force officers apprehended 15 migrants who had landed at Dungeness beach on Thursday. Eyewitness Susan Pilcher told the BBC she had seen three family groups - including a woman who appeared to be heavily pregnant - as well as two single men. The French authorities said they had also rescued migrants from several kayaks in their own waters as they headed for the UK. A helicopter was used in the response that saw at least 23 people intercepted and brought back to France. Thursday's figure breaks a record set only a week ago, when202 people crossed in 24 hours. Susan Pilcher said there appeared to be three family groups Mr Philp said: ""The crossings are totally unacceptable and unnecessary as France is a safe country. ""We work closely with France and I will be in Paris early next week to seek to agree stronger measures with them, including interceptions and returns. ""This situation simply cannot go on."" He said the only option was to make the route ""completely unviable"" to deter people from attempting it. Regarding reports the Navy could be used to patrol the Channel, Chancellor Rishi Sunak told Sky News: ""I wouldn't want to speculate on exactly what measures will be put in place. ""It's important that we work closely with our French allies on this situation. ""Obviously France is a safe country for migrants to be, we all want to see these crossings reduced and, pending the outcomes of those conversations [in France] we can decide on the best next steps to take."" An inquiry has been launched into thereasons behind the huge increasein Channel crossings by migrants. Among the areas the home affairs committee will examine are: The role of criminal gangs in the crossings The responses of UK and French authorities to combat illegal migration and support legal routes to asylum The conditions experienced by people gathered in northern France seeking to enter the UK and the risks they face Migrants' treatment by UK authorities on their arrival, particularly that of unaccompanied children Follow BBC South East onFacebook,external, onTwitter,external, and onInstagram,external.Send your story ideas tosoutheasttoday@bbc.co.uk.

"TikTok is threatening legal action against the US after Donald Trump ordered firms to stop doing business with the Chinese app within 45 days. The company said it was ""shocked"" by an executive order from the US President outlining the ban. TikTok said it would ""pursue all remedies available"" to ""ensure the rule of law is not discarded"". Mr Trump issued a similar order against China's WeChat in a major escalation in Washington's stand-off with Beijing. WeChat's owner, Tencent, said: ""We are reviewing the executive order to get a full understanding."" As well as WeChat, Tencent is also a leading gaming company and its investments include a 40% stake in Epic Games - the company behindthe hugely popular Fortnite video game. The president has already threatened to ban TikTok in the US, citing national security concerns, and the company is now in talks to sell its American business to Microsoft. They have until 15 September to reach a deal - a deadline set by Mr Trump. The Trump administration claims that the Chinese government has access to user information gathered by TikTok, which the company has denied. TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, said it had attempted to engage with the US government for nearly a year ""in good faith"". However, it said: ""What we encountered instead was that the administration paid no attention to facts, dictated terms of an agreement without going through standard legal processes, and tried to insert itself into negotiations between private businesses."" The executive orders against the short-video sharing platform and the messaging service WeChat are the latest measure in an increasingly broad Trump administration campaign against China. Is the US about to split the internet? Beyond TikTok: Who else might Trump ban? What TikTokers make of Trump's ban threat On Thursday, Washington announced recommendations that Chinese firms listed on US stock markets should be delisted unless they provided regulators with access to their audited accounts. China's Foreign Ministry on Friday accused the US of using national security as a cover to exert hegemony. In both executive orders, Mr Trump says that the spread in the US of mobile apps developed and owned by Chinese firms ""threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States"". The US government says TikTok and WeChat ""capture vast swaths of information from its users"". ""This data collection threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans' personal and proprietary information."" The executive order also claims both apps gather data on Chinese nationals visiting the US, allowing Beijing ""to keep tabs"" on them. This video can not be played WATCH: What's going on with TikTok? Mr Trump's executive order also says TikTok's data collection could allow China to track US government employees and gather personal information for blackmail, or to carry out corporate espionage. He notes that reports indicate TikTok censors content deemed politically sensitive, such as protests in Hong Kong and China's treatment of the Uighurs, a Muslim minority.Â The orders have been issued under legal authority from the National Emergencies Act and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. In its most robust response so far to the US government, TikTok says the executive order that has been issued is based on ""unnamed reports with no citations"". ""We have made clear that TikTok has never shared user data with the Chinese government, nor censored content at its request,"" it said. ""We even expressed our willingness to pursue a full sale of the US business to an American company."" Mr Trump said this week he would support the sale to Microsoft as long as the US government received a ""substantial portion"" of the sale price. TikTok said the new executive order ""risks undermining global businesses' trust in the United States' commitment to the rule of law"", adding it sets ""a dangerous precedent for the concept of free expression and open markets"". ""We will pursue all remedies available to us in order to ensure that the rule of law is not discarded and that our company and our users are treated fairly - if not by the administration, then by the US courts,"" it said. Zhaoyin Feng, BBC News Chinese, Washington DC The TikTok ban is hardly a surprise, as the app has faced scrutiny in the US for months. But the almost identical ban on WeChat is more of a bombshell. Immediately after President Trump's executive order was announced, I received a flood of messages on my WeChat. Friends in America and their loved ones in China were in an absolute panic. They are thousands of miles apart but asking the same question: How are we supposed to keep in touch after WeChat is banned in the US? It's nearly impossible to avoid WeChat for those who have any connections to China. The billion-user app is like WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, PayPal, Uber, and even Tinder, all in one ecosystem. America's move to block WeChat, a prominent example of China's tech innovation, will be seen as an attack on its culture, its people and the state. It'll enhance the popular view in China that Washington is unreasonably suppressing its biggest competitor in technology. If the ban is fully enforced, it'd be a disaster for anyone who has families, friends or a business in China. While tit-for-tat has become the new normal in US-China relations, this move will cut off virtually all people-to-people communication between the world's two most influential countries. Mr Trump has been waging a trade war against China since taking office. The US government took action last year against two Chinese communications companies, Huawei and ZTE, including locking them out of government contracts. Most recently, he has blamed the country for the global coronavirus pandemic, which has crippled the US economy. Meanwhile, many of the biggest US platforms - Google, Twitter and Facebook - are banned inside China. TikTok - which has up to 80 million active monthly users in the US - has exploded in popularity in recent years, mostly with people under 20. This video can not be played What is TikTok? The app is reported to have around 800 million active monthly users, with its biggest markets having grown in the US and India. India has, however, already blocked TikTok, as well as other Chinese apps. Australia, which has already banned Huawei and ZTE, is also considering banning TikTok. WeChat is very popular among those users who have connections to China, where major social networking platforms - such as WhatsApp and Facebook - are blocked. It is also viewed as being a key instrument in China's internal surveillance apparatus - requiring local users who have been accused of spreading malicious rumours to register a facial scan and voice print. A seminar held earlier this year by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute think tank discussed how groups within the app would be used to recommend holiday destinations, restaurants and the like on a day-to-day basis, but then switch to spreading political messages in line with Beijing's thinking at critical times.

"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says Aberdeen players 'blatantly' broke the rules on coronavirus The number of cases in Aberdeen's Covid cluster has risen to 101 as Nicola Sturgeon said she was ""furious"" at footballers who broke lockdown rules. The first minister said it was ""unacceptable"" that eight Aberdeen players had visited a bar in the city on Saturday night. They are all now self-isolating after twotested positive for Covid-19. Lockdown measures werereintroduced in the city on Wednesdayas the number of cases in the cluster grew. Ms Sturgeon told her daily briefing there had been an additional 22 cases in the last day, taking the total to 101. The total number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Scotland rose by 43 on Friday, and no deaths were reported for the 22nd consecutive day. Aberdeen FC's Covid-19 cases: What do we know? Graduate 'heartbroken' after losing job due to lockdown Aberdeen lockdown: 'It feels never ending' How is Scotland tackling local Covid clusters? Ms Sturgeon said 27 of the confirmed cases were in the Grampian area, although it was not yet clear how many were connected to the Aberdeen outbreak. The Aberdeen players who are self-isolating had visited the city's Soul bar on Saturday. Images were shared on social media showing queues of people gathered outside the bar, which is one of about 30 venues now linked to the cluster. A picture taken at the weekend showed people queuing outside the Soul bar in Aberdeen Ms Sturgeon said: ""It is  now clear that all eight of these players visited a bar in Aberdeen on Saturday night. ""In doing so they blatantly broke the rules that had been agreed between the SFA, the SPFL, and the Scottish government, which, to put it mildly, is completely unacceptable."" The first minister said she supported the decision to cancel the club's match with St Johnstone this weekend. ""We are asking members of the public to behave in a highly precautionary manner,"" she said. ""When a football club ends up with players infected with Covid - and let's remember this is not through bad luck but through clear breaches of the rules - we cannot take even a small risk that they then spread the infection to other parts of the country."" Aberdeen played their first game of the season at Pittodrie on Saturday Ms Sturgeon added that she was ""pretty furious"" at the situation - and that if players did not abide by the rules, they were putting the return of the professional game at risk. Aberdeen chairman Dave Cormack said he had apologised to football and health authorities, and to the other Premiership clubs. ""Regrettably, what has happened in the last few days has undermined all the hard work that has gone into keeping our players and staff safe,"" he said. ""We are now dealing with this internally with the seriousness it deserves. ""In the meantime, I'd like to reassure the relevant bodies, our fans and everyone associated with the club that our already rigorous measures are being forensically scrutinised and that no stone will be left unturned in ensuring that no-one is under any doubt about what must be adhered to."" The outbreak in Aberdeen has been linked to bars and restaurants The coronavirus cluster in Aberdeen has been linked to pubs and restaurants. A list has been published of premises visited by people confirmed to have the virus. They are: Bieldside Inn, Bobbin, Brewdog (Castlegate), Buckie Farm Carvery, CafÃ© Andaluz, CafÃ© Dag, CafÃ© Drummond, The Cock & Bull, College Bar, The Dutch Mill, Dyce Carvery, East End Social Club, Ferryhill House Hotel, Hawthorn/Adam Lounge, The Howff, The Justice Mill, The Marine Hotel, McGinty's, McNasty's, Malmaison,  Moonfish CafÃ©, No.10 Bar, O'Donoghues, Old Bank Bar, Prohibition, Soul, Spider's Web, The Draft Project. The list also includes Aboyne, Deeside and Hazlehead golf clubs, and the Banks O'Dee Football Club.

"This video can not be played Boy swept out to sea thanks RNLI rescuers A 10-year-old boy who was swept out to sea during a day trip to the beach with his family has described how he feared he was going to die. Ravi Saini survived for more than an hour using floating advice he had remembered from a BBC TV documentary. Rescuers praised him when they found him on his back, with his arms and legs spread, shouting for help in the water near Scarborough on 31 July. ""I felt like 'yeah I finally got a second chance to live',"" said Ravi. Ravi was given gifts by the lifeboat crew and had a tour of the RNLI base on Thursday Ravi, from Leeds, had been at the beach in South Bay with his father, Nathu Ram, 37, his mother, Puspa Devi, 34, and his nine-year-old sister, Muskan. He thanked the lifeboat crew again for saving him while touring the town's RNLI base on Thursday and described how he had been in the water with his father and sister when he suddenly realised he was out of his depth. ""I realised I was floating and I was like 'help me, help me',"" said Ravi. ""My dad tried to come but the water was higher than him."" The 10-year-old sat in the lifeboat that saved him from the sea and thanked the crew again ""I was petrified and I thought that this was the end of my life,"" he continued. After what felt like ""five hours"" at sea, he said he heard the lifeboat's engine approaching. Ravi, who has weekly swimming lessons, described being a fan of theBBC documentary Saving Lives At Sea, in which he saw the ""Float to Live"" technique of lying on your back, staying calm and spreading out like a starfish.

"The explosion at a portside warehouse in Beirut sent devastating shockwaves across the Lebanese capital, decimating seafront buildings and causing widespread destruction. At least 137 people died and about 5,000 others have been injured. Satellite and aerial images show the extent of the physical damage to a city more accustomed to such scenes as a result of war than accident. The Orient Queen cruise ship was docked in Beirut a few hundred metres from the warehouse when the explosion happened. Damage from the blast caused her to take on water and capsize. One crew member died and another is still missing, according to the ship's operators Abou Merhi Cruises. The company's dockside offices were also wiped out by the force of the blast. The grain silos - the large white building on the dockside -  took the brunt of the blast. Genevieve Langdon, Professor of Blast and Impact Engineering at the University of Sheffield, said the grain inside the silo would have compacted under the enormous blast pressure, but would also have absorbed and deflected some of the blast. ""As the blast wave struck the silo wall, it probably dissipated a great deal of energy,"" she said. ""Without the grain silos in the way, we expect the damage in the area behind them would have been even worse."" Aid agencies estimate that around 300,000 people have been left homeless by the explosion and there are fears of food and medicine shortages. Doctors Without Borders (MSF) president Mego Terzian said warehouses storing medicines and vaccines in the port were damaged, and the country's largest dialysis centre, in central Beirut, was completely destroyed. He compared the aftermath of the blast to destruction caused during the country's 1975-90 civil war. ""We lived difficult and similar experiences during the Lebanese war,"" he told AFP. Lebanon's maritime trade will now shift to the country's second biggest city, Tripoli, so that the country can start to receive medical aid, foodstuffs, fuel and basic goods. Qatar, Kuwait and Jordan are reported to be sending field hospitals. The shopping centre, restaurants and souks in downtown Beirut, to the west of the blast area, didn't escape damage. Windows and glass shopfronts were shattered by the explosion. The city's governor, Marwan Abboud, said repairing public property and heritage buildings was likely to cost billions of dollars.

"Energy bills will fall by an average of Â£84 in October for millions after the energy regulator lowered the price cap due to cheaper gas wholesale prices. Ofgem has cut the default price cap to Â£1,042, its lowest level since the cap was introduced in January 2019. The pre-payment meter cap will fall by an average of Â£95 to Â£1,070. Ofgem said the changes would mean ""big savings"" for around 11 million households on default tariffs and four million on prepayment meters. The regulator said the reduction was due to a sharp decrease in wholesale gas prices since the cap was last updated in February. But it warned that the cap was likely to rise in April as wholesale prices have started to recover since hitting 20-year lows in the spring. ""Millions of households, many of whom face financial hardship due to the Covid-19 crisis, will see big savings on their energy bills this winter when the level of the cap is reduced,"" said Jonathan Brearley, chief executive of Ofgem. But he said people ""can reduce their energy bills further by shopping around for a better deal"". Speaking to BBC Breakfast he advised: ""Phone up your supplier and ask them to put you on the best deal they can offer. ""If you can go further and get into the market and switch supplier, that will get you an even better deal than the regulated tariff."" ""This reduction in the price cap represents a much-needed financial boost for millions of households, at a time when many people are struggling due to the economic impact of Covid-19 and lockdown,"" said Ed Dodman, director of regulatory affairs at the Energy Ombudsman. ""Shopping around for a cheaper energy deal is still the best way to save money, particularly for customers on standard variable tariffs, but before switching to a new supplier it's a good idea to check out its customer service credentials. He said review sites and other online tools give an idea of the quality of service on offer and can help people to make an informed decision when switching. by Simon Read, personal finance reporter The energy price cap limits the amount that anyone on a standard variable tariff or pre-payment meter pays for their heating and lighting. It limits the price a supplier can charge customers per kWH of electricity and gas, not their total bill which will vary depending on how much energy they use. But energy users can save hundreds by switching to a lower-priced fixed deal. All suppliers have fixed-rate deals so the simplest way to save is to contact your existing supplier and asked to be moved to its lowest-priced fixed deal. But you could probably save more by switching to a rival supplier. It's simple to switch using an energy comparison site - all you'll need is your postcode, the name of your current supplier, and the name of your current tariff. Citizens Advice hasa useful guide to choosing the right tariff,external. Ofgem also sets out the steps you should take toswitch energy supplier and shop for a better deal,external. ""This price cap cut is effectively money off what are the most expensive tariffs in the market,"" said Richard Neudegg, head of regulation at comparison website Uswitch.com. ""Wholesale energy prices plunged in March following Covid-19 lockdown measures, but millions of households who are on standard variable tariffs have yet to see the impact on their energy bills."" He said the change in October represents a seven-month lag since the huge plunge in wholesale prices at the start of the lockdown - ""an unavoidable fallout of the price cap system"". ""This summer has seen energy deals at their cheapest since 2018, and millions are already benefiting from the lower wholesale prices,"" he pointed out. ""The news that Ofgem is dropping the price cap by Â£84 is good news at first glance, but there are more savings to be had if people switch to a fixed tariff now,"" said Stephen Murray, energy expert at Moneysupermarket. ""Our view on the price cap has always been clear: don't rely on the cap to reduce your bills. ""If you're on an expensive standard variable tariff and want to save hundreds of pounds on your annual bill, switch your energy supplier as soon as you can. It's simple to do and only takes minutes online."" Meanwhile, Ofgem has recommended that the price cap on household energy bills be kept in place beyond this year. The energy regulator is required to give an annual assessment on the cap based on how competitive the energy market is. It has recommended that the price cap should remain in place in 2021, as without it customers on default tariffs could be overcharged for their energy, it said.

"This video can not be played BA staff facing redundancy or pay cuts speak out Some British Airways staff who have accepted voluntary redundancy say they had felt ""forced"" into it. BA wants to cut 12,000 job roles and says 6,000 staff have volunteered. Carol - not her real name - said BA had told her if she did not accept the offer of voluntary redundancy she would  have to apply for a job and if she did not get it she would only receive a statutory redundancy payout. She says the airline's conduct was ""a slap in the face"". Carol, who had worked for BA for 23 years, told the BBC: ""They [BA] said 'If you don't take the offer, you'll go into the fire-and-rehire phase', but if we aren't hired, we'll get only statutory redundancy."" Those BA cabin crew who did reapply for their jobs on a new contract are expected to find out later on Friday whether or not they lose their jobs. Carol, who worked on the long-haul fleet, said it was a foregone conclusion that the airline would not re-hire older cabin crew members. ""Even before I had accepted the voluntary redundancy offer, I had a message on my roster from BA: 'Thank you for your service. Good luck'. That is all I got from them after 23 years. ""It's a slap in the face, but it shows they knew who they were getting rid of,"" she said. She says she will be forced to sell her home since her redundancy payment won't cover her mortgage. ""It's actually age discrimination, we were forced out."" BA cabin crew: I won't earn enough to pay my mortgage British Airways: A breakdown in trust? Erica - again, not her real name - had been with British Airways long enough to remember being cabin crew on a Concorde jet, but accepted voluntary redundancy after seeing the brand airline turn into a ""toxic work environment"". ""The way they dealt with this was so underhand,"" she said. ""Yes coronavirus has had a terrible impact on the industry, but these are permanent pay cuts to what is a temporary problem. But this is a restructure that BA has wanted for a long time"". Most of those who are offered a new contract will suffer steep pay cuts, changes to their terms and conditions, and reduced allowances which top up their base salaries. Other workers such as engineers, ground crew and office staff are also expected to hear whether they have a future at the airline over the coming days. British Airways says more than 6,000 staff across the business have applied for voluntary redundancy and ""refutes claims that our colleagues were pressured"". The airline has begun culling employee positions as part of a major cost-cutting drive, which it insists is vital to ensure its long-term survival. But the way in which it has done so has provoked deep resentment among a large proportion of its workforce - and threats of industrial action. ""I'm looking at losing 50% of my take-home pay,"" says Vicky - a cabin crew member who works in BA's long-haul fleet. ""I'm a single mother. I can't afford to have half of my pay taken away from me"". Vicky - not her real name - is in her mid-thirties. She has been with the company for more than 15 years. Although she lives in the north east, she was among hundreds of staff who travelled to BA's headquarters near Heathrow earlier this week, to vent their anger at the company's management. ""It's the most stressful time I've ever been through,"" she says. ""I feel absolutely gutted."" BA cabin crew: I won't earn enough to pay my mortgage British Airways, like other airlines, has suffered deeply from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. In the three months to the end of June it lost more than Â£700m. For weeks, at the height of the lockdown, the bulk of its fleet was grounded, and it was unable to operate more than a handful of planes each day. The company does not expect the aviation industry to recover fully until at least 2023. In April, its parent company International Airlines Group (IAG) announced plans for a major restructuring of BA's business, which it saidcould result in up to 12,000 redundancies. BA then made it clear it needed to cut costs dramatically - and warned that concessions would be needed from remaining staff on pay, as well as on terms and conditions. It said that if an agreement could not be reached with unions, it would force its plans through - by handing staff their notice, and offering them new contracts on different terms. Some cabin crew staff have already been informed that they are affected. Unions have condemned this policy as ""fire and rehire"". It has also been heavily criticised by many MPs, with the chair of the Transport Select Committee, Conservative Huw Merriman, describing it as ""the equivalent of putting a gun to someone's head"". Despite significant tensions between the two sides, the pilots' union Balpa has since managed to reach an agreement with BA, which reduced the number of possible redundancies in exchange for significant concessions on pay. But relations between the company and unions representing other staff - Unite and GMB - have been considerably more strained. No deal has yet been done, and BA has pushed forward with its plans. Those plans have major implications for BA's cabin crew. The company currently has different crew divisions, or ""fleets"", which operate as separate units with their own terms and conditions. It wants to create a single organisation, and put all crew on the same type of contract. For lower paid staff, principally those who have joined the company since 2010, this would mean a modest salary increase. For longer serving crew, who are well-paid by industry standards, it would mean a cut in basic salary of 20%. But because they will also lose other allowances, many say they will see their overall take-home wages drop by 40% to 50%. IAG chief Willie Walsh has said the downturn in air travel is not temporary Executives insist such changes are necessary, in the face of what IAG's chief executive Willie Walsh described last week as the biggest crisis the airline has ever faced. Mr Walsh told the BBC: ""Anyone who believes that this is just a temporary downturn and therefore can be fixed with temporary measures, I'm afraid seriously misjudges what the industry is going through."" But many employees believe the company is deliberately exploiting the immediate crisis to justify pushing through far-reaching, irreversible changes. ""I really love my job"", says Vicky ""I'm just really upset with how things have planned out. I think it's a permanent solution to a temporary problem. Yet our managers are only taking temporary pay cuts."" British Airways: A breakdown in trust? Staff elsewhere in British Airways are also affected by the changes, with the threat of compulsory redundancy hanging over them and the prospect of steep pay cuts ahead. John - again, not his real name - is an engineer who helps maintain BA's long-haul aircraft at Heathrow. He wants to stay in his job, because he is worried his qualifications would not be recognised in other industries and he would struggle to find an employer willing to take him on. ""Let's be realistic"", he says, ""No-one is going to take someone in their 50s and train them up when they can get a 20-something instead. It's not going to happen."" John says many of his colleagues are in a similar position - and the worry is proving an unwelcome distraction at work. ""I've been walking around checking an aircraft prior to departure, and I find I can't remember what I've been looking at - so I have to do it again,"" he says. ""I can't see how you can be expected to work like that. But this process is being driven by accountants, and they can't see further than their noses."" Although BA is still in talks with unions, relations are far from cordial. Last week the general secretary of Unite, Len McCluskey described the company's strategy as ""despicable"", and said the union was working towards industrial action with immediate effect. But the airline insists it has no option. ""Our half year results clearly show the enormous financial impact of Covid-19 on our business,"" said a spokesperson. ""We are having to make difficult decisions and take every possible action now to protect as many jobs as possible."" ""And, while we never could have anticipated being in a position of making redundancies, over 6,000 of our colleagues have now indicated that they wish to take voluntary redundancy from BA.""

Ravi, who has weekly swimming lessons, described being a fan of theBBC documentary Saving Lives At Sea, in which he saw the ""Float to Live"" technique of lying on your back, staying calm and spreading out like a starfish. ""All of a sudden the waves were so strong that every single part of my body goes into the water and then it takes 10 seconds or something to get back."" Ravi was in Scarborough's South Bay when he was pulled out to sea The ""float to live"" advice is a key message in the RNLI's national drowning prevention campaign, Respect the Water It urges people to follow potentially lifesaving advice if they find themselves in trouble after falling into cold water Fight your instinct to swim hard or thrash about - this can lead to breathing in water and drowning Instead, relax and float on your back until you have regained control of your breathing You can find more advice on theRNLI's website,external. Source: RNLI His father, a chef, described how he tried to reach his son to rescue him but the water was too deep with strong currents. ""The water was round my neck and I lost my control,"" said Mr Ram. Ravi's father Nathu Ram said he feared his son was going to ""die in front of my eyes"" ""Slowly, slowly he was going too far. Once or twice we saw his face. After that we didn't see him. ""When I was in the water I was struggling and I was thinking that we could both lose our lives."" Going through his mind was the fear that his son might ""die in front of my eyes"", he added. Ravi said: ""I was petrified and I thought that this was the end of my life"" Lifeboat crewman Rudi Barman described Ravi as ""an incredible young man"" who ""resisted the urge to panic"".

"Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has seen his personal wealth rise to $100bn (Â£76bn) after the launch of a new short-form video feature. On Wednesday, Facebook announced the US rollout of Instagram Reels, its rival to controversial Chinese app TikTok. Facebook shares rose by more than 6% on Thursday. Mr Zuckerberg holds a 13% stake in the company. He joins Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Microsoftâs Bill Gates in the exclusive so-called 'Centibillionaire Club'. Technology bosses have been in the spotlight recently as the size and power of their companies and their personal fortunes continue to grow. Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google have been among the biggest benefactors of coronavirus lockdowns and restrictions as more people shop, watch entertainment and socialise online. Mr Zuckerbergâs personal wealth has gained about $22bn this year, while Mr Bezos's has grown by more than $75bn, according to Bloomberg. This video can not be played WATCH: Instagram rolls out its TikTok rival Reels The short-form video feature Reels, which is seen as a rival to  the controversial Chinese-owned TikTok platform, works within the Facebook-owned Instagram photo-sharing app. The launch couldnât have come at a better time for Mr Zuckerberg as late on Thursday Donald Trump issued an executive order to deal with what the US president called the ""threat"" of TikTok in the US. Trump signs order to address 'threat' of TikTok Is the US about to split the internet? Trump administration plans Chinese tech crackdown So-called tech titans, including Mr Zuckerberg, have come under increased scrutiny from US and European lawmakers over allegations that their power and influence are out of control. The five largest US tech companies, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook, and Microsoft, currently have market valuations equivalent to about 30% of US gross domestic product (GDP). Wealth tax US senator and former presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders this week unveiled a plan to tax what he called âobscene wealth gainsâ made by billionaires during the coronavirus pandemic. The âMake Billionaires Pay Actâ would tax 60% of the increase in a billionaire's net worth from from the start of the pandemic through to the end of the year. Mr Sanders proposes that the tax revenue earned would go towards out-of-pocket health-care expenses for Americans. Mr Zuckerberg has previously said he plans to give away 99% of his Facebook shares over his lifetime through the charitable foundation he set up with his wife Priscilla Chan.

"Ex-British spy Christopher Steele wrote a dossier alleging links between Trump and Russia There must be an organised effort to prevent Russia from disrupting and distorting political life, former MI6 officer Christopher Steele has warned. Mr Steele was behind the so-called Trump-Russia dossier, which alleged collusion between Moscow and the US president's 2016 election campaign. In an interview with Conservative MP Damian Collins, he warned that Russia is targeting all political parties. He added the UK had been ""behind the curve"" in deterring Russian activity. Speaking on Mr Collins' podcast, Infotagion, Mr Steele said political parties in the UK are being targeted, whether through donations or cyber-hacking, and must proactively approach the security services for help. Mr Steele argued that Moscow's aim was ""to create great polarity, great partisanship and divisions within political life, the likes of which we have not seen in democracies before"". He said the Kremlin was seeking to shatter consensus and push political debate to the extremes, pointing to Brexit as an example. Former MI6 officer Mr Steele gave evidence to the Intelligence and Security Committee'sRussia inquiry, which released its report last month. The report criticised the security services for failing to investigate whether the Kremlin had interfered in Brexit and other areas of politics in recent years. Russia report: UK 'badly underestimated' threat The unanswered questions from the Russia report Mr Steele said security officials did not like to step into areas that were politically highly sensitive, and that he had told senior politicians of all parties that they must be proactive in approaching MI5 and MI6. He argued that lax regulation of Russian money entering the UK has ""bled"" into political life, with parties being targeted either through donations or computer hacking. ""It needs to be an organised counter-effort to make sure that this doesn't distort and disrupt our political life,"" he said. Russia has previously denied allegations of interference This week, it emerged that documents on UK-US trade talks, leaked before the 2019 election, werestolen from the personal email account of Tory MP Liam Fox. The papers were published online and used by Labour in the 2019 campaign to claim the NHS would be put at risk. The UK government has said Russians almost certainly sought to interfere in the election through the documents. Moscow has denied any role in this and other acts of political interference. Questions have also been raised about funds flowing into the Conservative Party from individuals with links to Russia, but who are now UK citizens and deny any wrongdoing. Ministers are consideringstrengthening security laws to require foreign agents to registerin the UK in future. Mr Steele said he supported such a move but that it needs to be framed carefully so that it is effective. Overall, the UK has been slow to respond, he said. ""There are huge vulnerabilities that are created by democracy and by modern technology and we are not catching up quickly enough with how our adversaries are able to, and willing to, exploit those things without really strong retaliation and deterrence existing,"" he said Trump Russia affair: Key questions answered Russian hackers targeted Liam Fox's personal email Mr Steele, who left MI6 in 2009 and set up a private business intelligence firm called Orbis, is best known for his role in the so-called Trump-Russia dossier, which was made public in January 2016. It alleged collusion between Mr Trump's election campaign and Russia and has become the subject of intense political battles, with the US president tweeting that he wanted Mr Steele extradited. Some of the dossier's claims have been disputed and Mr Steele did not discuss it in detail in the podcast interview, as legal action is ongoing. He did say, though, that he expects more interference in the 2020 US election with some foreign governments concerned about the Democratic candidate Joe Biden winning in November. ""We are on the defensive,"" Mr Steele argued, adding that the West is weaker than at any point since the end of the Cold War.

"Rescue workers in Lebanon are searching for dozens of people missing after Tuesday's deadly blast Anti-government protesters clashed with security forces on Thursday night Many in Lebanon blame government negligence for the explosion Beirut's hospitals are strained by bed and equipment shortages given the high number of people hurt The UN is releasing emergency supplies, as it warns of a humanitarian crisis The blast killed at least 154 people, injured about 5,000 others, and left about 300,000 homeless Edited by Robert Greenall We're ending our live coverage of the fallout from the Lebanon explosion, but you can keep up with all the latest developments on the BBC News website and across radio and TV. Here's a quick recap of some of the biggest updates from today:   Today's live coverage was brought to you by Robert Greenall, Thomas Spender, Yaroslav Lukov, George Wright and Alice Cuddy  The Fayed family Some tourists are travelling to witness the fallout for themselves. BBC Arabic correspondent Carine Torbey met a family who had travelled for more than two hours from Bekaa in Lebanon to witness the devastation. âWe are heartbroken. We came from Bekaa to share the feeling with our fellow Lebanese families in Beirut. We want to share their pain and see it with our own eyes,â Safaa Fayed said. Media reports say that 38 Syrians and two Egyptians were among foreign nationals who died in Tuesday's blast. At least four migrant workers from Bangladesh, as well as two citizens of the Philippines and one Ethiopian were also killed, reports say. French architect Jean-Marc Bonfils, involved in rebuilding Beirut after the civil war, and a German diplomat were among the first fatalities to be announced.    BBC Arabic's Rami Ruhayem has been following Lebanese President Michel Aoun's extensive news conference on Tuesday's explosion. He tweets (in Arabic) thatMr Aoun explained how he had received information ""about the storage at the port"",externalon 20 July and immediately ordered the Supreme Defence Council to remove it. President Aoun, right, met his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, on Thursday Lebanon President Michel Aoun has rejected calls for an international investigation into the explosion. Questioned by a journalist as to whether he was against an international investigation, the president replied ""of course"", adding that such a probe ""would dilute the truth"". It comes as several local media channels have said they will continue to boycott all speeches from political figures in protest against the fallout of the blast. One of the country's biggest news channels, LBC Lebanon, refrained from broadcasting the president's speech today, BBC Beirut correspondent Carine Torbey reports. The channel will also refrain from broadcasting a speech by the Hezbollah leader, Hasan Nasrallah.   Several countries have also pledged support to rescue and reconstruction efforts The United States says it is providing more than $15m (Â£11.5m) in ""humanitarian assistance"" to Lebanon following this week's explosion. In a statement, its international aid agency USAID said the money would go towards food and medical supplies. It will amount to three months' worth of food for 50,000 people, and three months' worth of medicine for 60,000 people, it said. ""We stand with the people of Lebanon as they seek relief and accountability in this difficult time,"" USAID added in a statement. Numerous other countries have also offered support to Lebanon following the explosion, including money and manpower for rescue and reconstruction efforts. The UK earlier this weekpromised a Â£5m aid package. BBC OS Armenia street after the blast was like ""a scene from a disaster movie"", said Nadia Hardman Armenia street, a short walk away from the devastated port of Beirut, has gained attention online for before-and-after
photos showing residents coming together to clear the destruction there. Nadia Hardman lives on the street, about 400m (1,312ft) from where the
explosion happened. âI arrived an hour or two after to the devastation of our
building,â she toldBBC OS on World Service radio. ""It was like a scene from a disaster movie. My living room
door was in the kitchen, the kitchen door was in the hallway, shattered glass
everywhere.â But when she came down from her flat the next day, she was shocked
to find that the street - which is lined with restaurants, shops and bars - was
clean.  Armenia street after the clean-up Volunteers - both residents of the street and those from other parts of Lebanon - had come together to sweep away rubble. Hussein Zreik travelled from Baalbek, about 70km (43 miles) north-east of Beirut, to help. He warned that while rubble had been cleared, there was still structural damage to many of the buildings. ""There are some buildings that collapsed, and now we think there will be more than 10 others that will collapse. ""Weâve contacted someone from the government telling them to offer help. But the government is not offering anything to anyone. Weâve been told that they didnât even pass by [Armenia street],"" Mr Zreik said. Nassif Hitti announces his resignation on Monday Nassif Hitti was Lebanon's minister for foreign affairs until he resigned on Monday - a day before the Beirut blast - warning that the country was becoming a failed state. He accused the government of a lack of will to enact the reforms called for by the Lebanese people and the international community. Speaking to the BBC, he said the devastating explosion was a wake-up call for the Lebanese people. ""The Beirut blast reveals the kind of structural corruption, negligence, personalised politics, lack of responsibility and lack of accountability of the Lebanese system,"" he said. ""This tragedy is an indicator, unfortunately, of the crisis we have - that we have to stop it and start [anew]."" Boris Prokoshev (right) says the ship went to Beirut to pick up road-building equipment The Russian captain of the ship whose cargo is thought to have caused this week's explosion has spoken to the BBC's Sarah Rainsford about how it came to be impounded in Beirut in 2013. Boris Prokoshev said the Rhosus was travelling with ""2,750 one-tonne bags"" of ammonium nitrate on board - a cargo he described as ""dangerous, but not so
dangerous you canât transport it"". After taking over the vessel in Turkey, he said he was told to travel to Beirut to pick up road-building equipment, but found that it was too heavy to get on board. ""The shipâs hatches buckled. They were rusty, old. So we couldnât take it. I refused,"" he recalled. Lebanese authorities impounded the ship for non-payment of port fees and a fine for failing to collect the extra cargo. ""They knew what we had on board,"" he said of the ammonium nitrate. ""Iâd informed them
and I sent them scans of the papers for the cargo."" With the ship impounded, Mr Prokoshev said he and three crew members were forced to remain on board for 10 months, before the case was resolved through the courts. ""When we went, the ship was fine, in good condition. We closed all the compartments, locked them and handed the keys to immigration at the port,"" the captain said. He did not learn until later that the cargo had been unloaded and the vessel had sunk. Boris Prokoshev and some of his crew remained on the impounded vessel for months Julian HajjBBC Arabic Ruined in the blast, this building is home to Annahar, one of Lebanon's most prominent daily newspapers. Fifteen of the paper's journalists were injured in the explosion. For perhaps the first time in its 87-year history, the paper has not published since Tuesday. The German Office for the Protection of the Constitution has confirmed media reports that the Lebanese Shia group Hezbollah stored  quantities of ammonium nitrate in a warehouse in southern Germany. The office told Die Zeit newspaper that so-called cold packs containing material including ammonium nitrate had been discovered in 2016 and had then been taken out of the country. ""The stored cold packs were taken out of the country in 2016. There is no indication that the storage of these cold packs has any connection to the warehouse in Beirut port,"" the office said in a statement. Terrorism expert Michael Ortmann was quoted by German media as saying several hundred kilograms of ammonium nitrate had been stored in Germany. Media reports say the Israeli secret service Mossad alerted the German authorities to the existence of the warehouse earlier this year as well as giving further information about the group's activity in Germany.Germany banned the group in April. Germany's interior ministry has refused to give further details, citing the need to protect active investigations. BBC journalist Mohamed Madi is on the ground in Beirut as anger begins to surface among many locals. ""Shock is beginning to turn into anger in Beirut,"" he writes. ""As hope fades for survivors, families of the dead and missing as well as ordinary Beirutis are now starting to turn their attention to what's next. ""Many want to make Saturday a day of national protest - not only for this tragedy, but for what they see as decades of government ineptitude."" Allow Twitter content?

Satellite and aerial images show the extent of the Beirut port explosion that ripped through the Lebanese city on Tuesday. Below are pictures of the port taken in 2019 and 5 August 2020, a day after the blast.  Aid agencies estimate that around 300,000 people have been left homeless by the explosion and there are fears of food and medicine shortages. Read our full story here These pictures show damage to the St George's Hospital in Achrafiyeh district near the port that has put the facility out of action entirely. The blast left the hospital, one of the oldest in the city, with collapsed ceilings and beds covered in broken glass. Staff evacuated the hospital on Tuesday night and this included the transfer of 20 patients who were being treated for Covid-19, AFP quoted hospital chief Eid Azar as saying. Patients had to be carried down flights of stairs because the lifts were no longer working, the hospital courtyard was turned into a field clinic and nurses applied stitches by the light of their cellphones, he said. A number of hospital staff members were wounded in the blast, Mr Azar said. The death toll from Tuesday's explosion has risen to 154, Lebanon's official National News Agency (NNA) quoted the health minister as saying. About 120 people remain in critical condition. Many of them require complex surgery after being injured by glass shards, Minister of Public Health Hamad Hassan said. An ammonium nitrate explosion can release toxic gases Ammonium nitrate - the substance blamed for Tuesday's explosion -  is a crystal-like white solid which is made in large industrial quantities. Its biggest use is as a source of nitrogen for fertiliser, but it is also used to create explosives for mining. ""You won't just find ammonium nitrate in the ground,"" explains Andrea Sella, professor of chemistry at University College London. That's because it's synthetic, made by reacting ammonia with nitric acid, he says. Ammonium nitrate is made all over the world and is relatively cheap to buy. But storing it can be a problem, and it has been associated with serious industrial accidents in the past. Read more here Beirut resident Rayane Awkal has told the BBC she was meeting a friend in a coffee shop in the Gemmazye area when the blast happened. She said the sound was like that of a plane and then ""everything was shattered,
there was glass on the floor"". âAll of a sudden my friend started screaming 'My leg, my leg!' And I look down and I see her leg split near her knee and bleeding."" Rayane said they somehow managed to go to a nearby hospital where they saw many injured people. ""There was blood everywhere, and we were told
they werenât admitting anyone."" Three hospitals refused to treat her friend but eventually she ""got stitched"" in a hospital outside the capital. ""Iâm very fortunate that miraculously I got out safe, my
parents are safe,"" Rayane said. But she added: ""Iâm very angry as a citizen because I feel nobody is
listening to us. ""We are just fed lies after lies by this corrupted system, by
corrupted politicians who are just trying to buy time to try to get themselves
out of this mess. ""Because it is their mess, their lies and blood is on their
hands â everyone who has died, everyone who got injured, every last - business,
every last house - itâs on them because of their mismanagement and because of
everything they have done wrong.â Members of the public are turning out in the their droves to help with the huge clean up in Beirut. Andrew, 18, and his friends are helping to clean the areas of Mar Mikhael, Gemmayze and Geitawi. ""Although
this is a very saddening period Lebanon is passing through, a lot of the people
present have made the atmosphere jolly, almost celebratory,"" he tells the BBC. ""A lot of people are
coming every single day, bringing their own cleaning supplies with them - brooms, plastic bags, gloves and such. The ones that aren't cleaning have set
up booths for things like first aid, offering food and water, and even shade to
rest."" Lina Sinjab, BBC Middle East correspondent, is also on the ground in Beirut. ""I am at Gemmayzeh street - the one that saw most damage
after the explosion. The street is filled with volunteers with their cleaning
equipment to help clear debris and rubble,"" she says. ""Incredible spirit after such a
shock and traumatic experience."" A Russian rescuer with a sniffer dog searches for survivors in Beirut Four more bodies have been recovered in the past 24 hours by French rescuers, as a big international search operation continues at Beirut's devastated port. Near the disembowelled silos at the port, Russian rescuers were ankle-deep in corn, as excavators removed mangled shipping containers, the AFP news agency reports. It says an eerie sense of calm filled the once-bustling port, reduced to an enormous scrapyard.
   The only sounds are those of heavy machinery cutting through forests of twisted iron rods and mountains of concrete rubble to clear a path for the rescuers. Tom BatemanBBC Middle East correspondent We take a walk at dawn through a
shattered city. Glass and rubble from destroyed apartments is now piling
up on street corners, sometimes spreading into the roads.The devastation runs from
neighbourhood to neighbourhood. Closer
to the blast site is Gemmayzeh district. We stumble upon Nabil el-Alam standing
outside the ruins of his hospital, where he is deputy director. The Rosary Sisters site was built
only four years ago, and was full with patients and staff when the explosion
happened a few blocks away. Nabil
tells me a staff member was killed and many patients hurt in the blast. âWhen I heard the explosion I came here
directly and I saw the hospital, all destroyed. So we worked to help the people,â he said. He wasnât in his office at the time,
and he thanks God - it was completely destroyed and he would have been killed,
he says. Nabil fights back
tears. âAll the [patients] were in shock, all with injuries. We tried to help
them, to transfer them to other hospitals. âWe lost the hospital. We lost our jobs. We lost hopeâ. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.066770114
"The Irish Pub in Namche Bazar is 3,450m above sea level It has been closed since April, you canât reach it by car, and the nearest airport is a two-day hike away â but the world's remotest Irish bar is optimistic business will pick up soon. The Irish Pub in Namche Bazar, Nepal, is 3,450m above sea level, en route to Mount Everest. It has been shut since 10 April, after the pandemic forced Nepal's government to close the mountains to climbers. Yet owner Dawa Sherpa inisists that his bar will thrive beyond coronavirus. The government recently announced it would issue hiking permits for the Himalayasâ autumn season, which begins in September. International flights â which were suspended in March â are due to resume in August. And a new road, which could open next year, should make it easier to bring in beer, food, and even pool tables. Until now, it all had to be flown to âthe worldâs scariest airportâ â and then carried for two days along mountain paths. The pub interior - featuring the heavy Indian pool table Dawa, 35, grew up in theâsmall, colourful, market townâ,externalof Namche Bazar, where his parents worked in agriculture and livestock. After studying at Khumjung âthe âschool in the cloudsâ built by Sir Edmund Hillary's Himalayan Trust in 1961,externalâ he moved to the capital Kathmandu to study business management. Upon returning home, he briefly worked as a trekking guide, before his older brother, who ran a bakery in Namche, spotted a gap in the market. The town was beginning to change â an increase in tourism had a âdramatic effectâ, says Dawa â but it only had one pub. His brother, Phurba Tenzing, used to visit an Irish bar in Kathmandu, owned by Irish people. It gave the brothers an idea â could they open the highest Irish bar in the world? They Googled it, and discovered Paddy's bar in Cusco, Peru. âWe worked out the elevation,â says Dawa. âThey were 50 metres below us.â So, in 2011, they proudly opened The Irish Pub â possibly the highest, and surely remotest, Irish bar in the world. The town of Namche Bazar, with Mount Kongde Ri in the background It is not easy opening a pub in a town with no roads. Supplies are flown in, off season, from Kathmandu to Lukla â a small airport with a short, steep runway. From there, porters carry the goods to Namche. The pub's pool table was brought in this way. âAnd ours is an old, classic Indian table, with huge marble slates,â says Dawa. âThree or four slates, each one weighs maybe 120kg. We canât hire mules or yaks because the paths are too fragile. Itâs all carried by porters - humans - with great carefulness.â They even import Guinness, expensively, via Singapore. âWe donât have a big [profit] margin on it,â says Dawa, who charges 800 rupees ($6.70; Â£5.10) for a pint of the black stuff. âBut weâre an Irish bar - we have to sell Guinness.â Dawa remains optimistic that business will return The bar had a slow start. âAt the beginning, it wasnât that happening,â admits Dawa. âBut we tried really hard to improve the service, ambience, interior. Gradually, we were getting there.â Then, in April 2015,a major earthquake hit Nepal, killing almost 9,000 people and ending the climbing season. A landslide on Everest killed 21 people alone. âWe had to completely shut the bar down,â says Dawa. âWe reopened in autumn, but that wasnât good either.â After the earthquake, an economic blockade - which began in September 2015 and affected the whole country - increased the price of goods by âfour, five, even six timesâ. Yet despite the earthquake, and the blockade, the remotest Irish bar in the world survived. âWe recovered slowly,â says Dawa. âIt took us three or four years to get there, but The Irish Pub became the most happening pub in Namche.â On an average day, customers - usually Australian, American, or European - might include âpeople who just summited Everest, or people whoâve been to base camp for the first timeâ. âAnd a guy whoâs just climbed Everest doesnât mind spending money,â says Dawa. âHeâs buying drinks for sherpas, porters, friends. People are happy.â In 2014, Dawa opened a second pub in the lakeside town of Pokhara, and the Namche bar is now run by Chris, his manager. So, as they prepared for the 2020 spring season, things were looking good. And then, in March, came another calamity. This video can not be played The BBC's Yogita Limaye reports from the town of Lukla, the gateway to Mount Everest Nepal has recorded just 60 Covid-19 deaths, and 21,000 confirmed cases. But infections are rising again â and the impact has already been huge. The country was locked down from March until July; remittances from Nepalis overseas slumped; imports from China fell; and tourism dried up. In the mountains, more than 10,000 guides, sherpas, and other workers lost their jobs. One trade group estimated one million people in the ""mountain belt"" would suffer. But while the Irish Pub in Namche is down, it is not out. Dawa is cautiously optimistic about tourism resuming, and is prepared to reopen for the autumn season in September, if there is demand. Meanwhile, the new road from Kathmandu could have an even bigger impact. Dawa hopes the highway, which is already partly open, will reach Lukla in six to eight months, although engineers tell the BBC it could take two years. Either way, the road, when it opens, will be a boon to the businesses of Namche Bazar. The Mongolian Rooney, the thief, and the fightback Chinese team scale Everest during pandemic How a new map is stirring old rivalries âOnce we get the road, Nepalese and Indian tourists will be enough for us to survive,â says Dawa. âYou know, 80 to 90% of Nepalese people havenât seen Everest themselves, because of the lack of transportation. We have around 55,000 tourists a year in Namche, if things are really good. I think we will get more than 55,000 [extra] if we get a road.â And, as well as extra customers, the new road will mean the beer - and the pool tables - wonât need to be flown in. ""The prices will drop by 50%,â says Dawa. Some things, however, wonât change. The road will only reach Lukla â meaning customers will still need to hike for two days to reach the remotest Irish bar in the world.

" One day, the virus will subside. It could be eradicated. But even then, life will not simply return to the way it was before Covid-19. Spurred on by the coronavirus crisis, architects have been rethinking the buildings we inhabit. Scroll down to find out how the future might look. Meet Laila.It's 2025 and she works from home four days a week. It's been that way since the 2020 lockdown. It's 06:30 and she's on her way to work. Laila arrives at her office building at 07:00. Start times at the company where she works are staggered to minimise the number of people arriving at the same time. Her ""office days"" are mainly for meetings. Gone are the days when she'd head into the office to work at a screen. She can do that at home. Laila's employer used to share a much larger office building with several other companies. Now they're in a smaller, newly-refurbished premises all to themselves. On the ground floor Laila pauses in front of a thermal body scanner to check her temperature is normal. Today it's 36.5C. She passes. A camera, used for facial recognition, identifies her as a staff member and a security barrier opens. At no point does she touch anything.  Laila is on a contactless pathway. The lift to her office on the fourth floor is voice-activated. Touchless technology has replaced grubby buttons. The maximum occupancy is two. On the fourth floor she walks down the corridor and through the door. Both are wider than before, made that way to keep staff further apart and reduce the chances of a virus being transmitted. At the door Laila uses a hand sanitiser. She's so used to it now that she doesn't even think about it. She sits down at the desk.  Much of the furniture - as well as wall panels and facades - is made from antimicrobial material.  It's easier to clean and harder for bacteria to stick to. Laila makes a coffee in the kitchen area where the worktops are also antimicrobial. The handles on the drawers and cupboards are made of copper. It's a costly but naturally microbe-repellent material. The air conditioning system uses UV light to kill pathogens. It also reduces the humidity to help prevent germs multiplying, responding to a stream of data from sensors fixed around the building, and wearable sensors used by staff. Laila's office used to be completely open plan.  Now she's partitioned off.  To her left there is a clear plastic screen so that she can at least see her colleagues. The screens are removable, bolted into fixtures in the floor. They go up if there's the threat of an outbreak, but come out if the threat subsides. In front of Laila's desk, the separation is done with plants. The staff got fed up with plastic everywhere a couple of years ago. They said it made the office feel like a hospital. Laila prefers the plants. Laila's morning is spent in a meeting about a new project. It's face-to-face with colleagues - but all at a safe distance. The only reason Laila goes into the office now is for this kind of interaction - in which meeting people in real life produces better results than seeing each other online. It's 16:00 and time to go home. Laila moved to the suburbs with a friend after the lockdown in 2020. It's a longer commute, but she doesn't mind as it's only once a week. A bigger home meant more space. When the lockdown came she thought working from home would only last a few weeks, and that she'd manage with a laptop on the kitchen table. But when weeks turned into months, and months turned into years, she knew she would need a home office and her old flat in town was nowhere near big enough. She now works in an upstairs room. There's a new standing desk, a properly adjustable office chair and storage for documents. She never realised, before, how important it was to have good lighting, so she had spotlights installed in the ceiling and bought a proper desk lamp. Laila is saving up to replace the double glazing. She's near a big road and she needs to concentrate hard when she's working - sound-proofing is an issue she hadn't anticipated. She thought about a loft extension and building an office in the garden, but decided on the bedroom office option for now. It's been quite a change for Laila - and millions like her. Meet Laila.

She thought about a loft extension and building an office in the garden, but decided on the bedroom office option for now. It's been quite a change for Laila - and millions like her. While Laila made changes to her life relatively quickly after the pandemic hit, architecture, in reality, moves slowly. Buildings typically take five years to design, finance and construct. Many people can't afford to move house - or spend money on home improvements. And in the teeth of a recession, many employers won't have the money to relocate or reorganise. If Covid-19 dies out in the coming months and a vaccine is found quickly, many homes and workplaces could return to something like ""normal"". But aspects of Laila's imaginary life may become reality for many of us, particularly if there are continued outbreaks and no vaccine is found. Many architects believe a major shift towards working from home will be the most significant impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the built environment. Why? The short answer is money, says Prof David Burney, who served as New York City commissioner for public architecture under Mayor Michael Bloomberg. ""Companies can cut their bills for office space dramatically by increasing the number of staff working from home – and they will do it,"" he says. ""We're already seeing some in the commercial real estate business in a state of panic. They can see the demand for office space declining."" ""I think we could see a lot of existing buildings become unmarketable,"" says Hugh Pearman of the Royal Institute of British Architects (Riba). Large-scale office spaces, particularly in high-rise buildings which are hard to modify, are already becoming less attractive. ""And there will be pressure to flee the city,"" he says. Mr Pearman points out that health concerns have driven key architectural developments in the past. Worries about disease and poor air quality triggered population movements away from city centres in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and the growth of suburbs was a direct consequence. If pre-Covid homes were all about relaxing and recharging, post-Covid homes will be part home, part workplace, says UK architect Grace Choi. ""Many more people are going to want more space in their homes to work, or at least some versatility in the space that they have. We're all going to need to configure our space in a more intelligent way."" Ms Choi says her practice is already getting many more inquiries from builders about homes with office spaces and garden studios, as workers find that perching at the kitchen table with a laptop just doesn't cut it. Homeworking doesn't suit many jobs, of course, and thousands of offices are here to stay. Architects envisage that creative thinking and new technology will help keep them relevant. ""The days of sitting there hammering away on a laptop are gone - you can do that from home,"" says  Dale Sinclair, architect and director of innovation at AECOM. ""What's really exciting is that going into the office will be for collaboration, generating ideas with colleagues."" Mr Sinclair is one of the many architects predicting vastly more automation in offices, particularly ""touchless technology"" or ""contactless pathways"" and a greater use of data. ""Buildings are going to have a huge amount of technology: people using their phones to navigate through them, face recognition, voice activation. And we'll see many more robot assistants and sensors picking up data,"" he says. ""This whole area is going to really take off. We're already using this technology in hospitals – and Covid-19 is massively accelerating the move towards using it in other places."" Information from fixed and wearable sensors could be used to adjust air temperature and humidity in the fight against some pathogens. Air conditioning systems using UV light to kill bacteria and some viruses are already in use, with light sources in the coils at the centre of the system or in the ducting. The downside of the open-plan office is obvious during the pandemic, but some experts believe that open plan could survive if measures to limit interaction are in place. Where partitions are essential, architects and designers are trying to minimise their negative impact on social interaction. Can they be removed when there's little threat, but reinstalled if there is an outbreak? Can they be clear, rather than opaque, so that staff can still have eye contact with workmates? For Ben Channon, head of wellbeing at Assael Architecture, biophilia - our in-built affinity with the natural world - is the way forward. ""We can use rows of plants to separate people.  People are quite scared – they're not going to want to come back to a plastic cubicle that smells of bleach. In the right circumstances plant screening can be a much better solution - and can also help with air quality."" Mr Channon advocates using naturally antimicrobial materials like copper and its alloys, in high-touch areas like door and drawer handles. Copper is expensive but ""businesses are seeing the cost now of what happens when they don't have these things,"" he says. While remote working for many may be the legacy of Covid-19, coming together in the real world is still fundamental to human psychology, says Sadie Morgan from London-based firm dRMM. ""Taking risks and creativity, essential for businesses, generally happens in groups, real groups - not in a virtual space - when you can see people directly and be in the same space."" Grace Choi agrees. ""We shouldn't underestimate the need to get together to exchange ideas. ""We miss body language, cues for when to speak, fluid conversation and the connections between us.""

"This video can not be played WATCH: Trump says Biden is 'against God and he's against guns' US President Donald Trump has said Joe Biden is ""against God"", ramping up attacks on his Democratic rival and foreshadowing an ugly election battle. The remarks, during a trip to Ohio, came as Mr Trump tries to make up ground in the crucial Midwestern states that were his path to victory in 2016. ""He's against God. He's against guns,"" said the president, a Republican. Mr Biden, an avowed Catholic, will take on Mr Trump in November. Opinion polls suggest the Democrat currently leads. How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? The former US vice-president has spoken frequently about how his faith helped him cope with the deaths of his first wife and daughter in a 1972 car accident. His campaign spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement on Thursday: ""Joe Biden's faith is at the core of who he is; he's lived it with dignity his entire life, and it's been a source of strength and comfort in times of extreme hardship."" This video can not be played Joe Biden: 'Why the hell would I take a cognitive test?' Mr Trump, who identifies himself as Presbyterian, said of Mr Biden earlier in the day in Cleveland, Ohio: ""He's following the radical left agenda. ""Take away your guns, destroy your Second Amendment. No religion, no anything, hurt the Bible, hurt God. ""He's against God, he's against guns, he's against energy, our kind of energy."" Mr Trump has been accused of using the platform of the presidency for political gain by injecting campaign-style rhetoric into taxpayer-funded official engagements intended to communicate US government policy. Trump's White House convention speech idea scorned At a washing machine factory later on Thursday, the president kept up the onslaught on his challenger. ""I wouldn't say he's at the top of his game,"" the president said. This video can not be played Trump and Biden exchange personal insults On Thursday, Mr Biden appeared to suggest the African-American community was homogenous - a comment Mr Trump then described as ""very insulting"". In an interview, Mr Biden had said: ""What you all know but most people don't know, unlike the African American community with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly different attitudes about different things."" He later issued an apology on Twitter. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

For his part, Mr Trump has long been accused of stoking racial tensions, going back decades before he became a political figure. Last year,Democrats from Virginia's Black Legislative Caucus boycotted Mr Trump's visitbecause of what they termed his ""racist and xenophobic"" rhetoric. Both the Trump and Biden campaigns have also traded accusations that their candidate has dementia. Mr Trump is 74 and Mr Biden 77. In an advertisement released by the Trump campaign this week, the Democrat was depicted as ""hiding"" alone in his basement, using an image that had been edited to remove several other people. Religion has previously come up in this campaign. Mr Biden accused the president of cynically using a Bible for a photo op outside a church in early June after protesters - who were described by journalists at the scene as peaceful - had been forcibly dispersed by law enforcement outside the White House. Throughout his tenure, Mr Trump has enjoyed a mostly strong backing from evangelical Christians. In his list of ""six promises"" for a second term unveiled in Ohio on Thursday, Mr Trump focused heavily on economic recovery, vowing to turn the US into a premier medical manufacturer, launch ""millions"" of manufacturing jobs and bring back American jobs and factories from abroad. The pledges echo many of those from his 2016 campaign, a platform of economic populism often credited with his wins in swing states like Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Ohio. Mr Trump outlined six ""promises"" for his second term But the president's message of prosperity has been thwarted this time around by the coronavirus outbreak. The US economy shrank at a 32.9% annual rate between April and June as the country faced lockdowns and spending cuts during the pandemic, marking the steepest decline since the government began keeping records in 1947. Now, polls show Mr Biden with leads in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - three industrial states his Republican rival won by margins of less than 1% to claim victory in 2016. And in Iowa, Ohio and Texas, where Mr Trump won last time by 8-10%, he is currently neck-and-neck with Mr Biden. Protesters put to flight so Trump can walk to church.

"TikTok is threatening legal action against the US after Donald Trump ordered firms to stop doing business with the Chinese app within 45 days. The company said it was ""shocked"" by an executive order from the US President outlining the ban. TikTok said it would ""pursue all remedies available"" to ""ensure the rule of law is not discarded"". Mr Trump issued a similar order against China's WeChat in a major escalation in Washington's stand-off with Beijing. WeChat's owner, Tencent, said: ""We are reviewing the executive order to get a full understanding."" As well as WeChat, Tencent is also a leading gaming company and its investments include a 40% stake in Epic Games - the company behindthe hugely popular Fortnite video game. The president has already threatened to ban TikTok in the US, citing national security concerns, and the company is now in talks to sell its American business to Microsoft. They have until 15 September to reach a deal - a deadline set by Mr Trump. The Trump administration claims that the Chinese government has access to user information gathered by TikTok, which the company has denied. TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, said it had attempted to engage with the US government for nearly a year ""in good faith"". However, it said: ""What we encountered instead was that the administration paid no attention to facts, dictated terms of an agreement without going through standard legal processes, and tried to insert itself into negotiations between private businesses."" The executive orders against the short-video sharing platform and the messaging service WeChat are the latest measure in an increasingly broad Trump administration campaign against China. Is the US about to split the internet? Beyond TikTok: Who else might Trump ban? What TikTokers make of Trump's ban threat On Thursday, Washington announced recommendations that Chinese firms listed on US stock markets should be delisted unless they provided regulators with access to their audited accounts. China's Foreign Ministry on Friday accused the US of using national security as a cover to exert hegemony. In both executive orders, Mr Trump says that the spread in the US of mobile apps developed and owned by Chinese firms ""threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States"". The US government says TikTok and WeChat ""capture vast swaths of information from its users"". ""This data collection threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans' personal and proprietary information."" The executive order also claims both apps gather data on Chinese nationals visiting the US, allowing Beijing ""to keep tabs"" on them. This video can not be played WATCH: What's going on with TikTok? Mr Trump's executive order also says TikTok's data collection could allow China to track US government employees and gather personal information for blackmail, or to carry out corporate espionage. He notes that reports indicate TikTok censors content deemed politically sensitive, such as protests in Hong Kong and China's treatment of the Uighurs, a Muslim minority.Â The orders have been issued under legal authority from the National Emergencies Act and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. In its most robust response so far to the US government, TikTok says the executive order that has been issued is based on ""unnamed reports with no citations"". ""We have made clear that TikTok has never shared user data with the Chinese government, nor censored content at its request,"" it said. ""We even expressed our willingness to pursue a full sale of the US business to an American company."" Mr Trump said this week he would support the sale to Microsoft as long as the US government received a ""substantial portion"" of the sale price. TikTok said the new executive order ""risks undermining global businesses' trust in the United States' commitment to the rule of law"", adding it sets ""a dangerous precedent for the concept of free expression and open markets"". ""We will pursue all remedies available to us in order to ensure that the rule of law is not discarded and that our company and our users are treated fairly - if not by the administration, then by the US courts,"" it said. Zhaoyin Feng, BBC News Chinese, Washington DC The TikTok ban is hardly a surprise, as the app has faced scrutiny in the US for months. But the almost identical ban on WeChat is more of a bombshell. Immediately after President Trump's executive order was announced, I received a flood of messages on my WeChat. Friends in America and their loved ones in China were in an absolute panic. They are thousands of miles apart but asking the same question: How are we supposed to keep in touch after WeChat is banned in the US? It's nearly impossible to avoid WeChat for those who have any connections to China. The billion-user app is like WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, PayPal, Uber, and even Tinder, all in one ecosystem. America's move to block WeChat, a prominent example of China's tech innovation, will be seen as an attack on its culture, its people and the state. It'll enhance the popular view in China that Washington is unreasonably suppressing its biggest competitor in technology. If the ban is fully enforced, it'd be a disaster for anyone who has families, friends or a business in China. While tit-for-tat has become the new normal in US-China relations, this move will cut off virtually all people-to-people communication between the world's two most influential countries. Mr Trump has been waging a trade war against China since taking office. The US government took action last year against two Chinese communications companies, Huawei and ZTE, including locking them out of government contracts. Most recently, he has blamed the country for the global coronavirus pandemic, which has crippled the US economy. Meanwhile, many of the biggest US platforms - Google, Twitter and Facebook - are banned inside China. TikTok - which has up to 80 million active monthly users in the US - has exploded in popularity in recent years, mostly with people under 20. This video can not be played What is TikTok? The app is reported to have around 800 million active monthly users, with its biggest markets having grown in the US and India. India has, however, already blocked TikTok, as well as other Chinese apps. Australia, which has already banned Huawei and ZTE, is also considering banning TikTok. WeChat is very popular among those users who have connections to China, where major social networking platforms - such as WhatsApp and Facebook - are blocked. It is also viewed as being a key instrument in China's internal surveillance apparatus - requiring local users who have been accused of spreading malicious rumours to register a facial scan and voice print. A seminar held earlier this year by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute think tank discussed how groups within the app would be used to recommend holiday destinations, restaurants and the like on a day-to-day basis, but then switch to spreading political messages in line with Beijing's thinking at critical times.

"This video can not be played The risk of a ""collapse in student numbers"" threatens universities' futures, a think-tank says Universities are facing a ""perfect storm"" which could lead to ""real problems"", a former university vice-chancellor and higher education consultant has said. Sir Deian Hopkin said the number of international students will fall owing to coronavirus and Brexit. Domestic students will also be reluctant to attend during the pandemic, he said. Universities Wales said institutions have proved they can cope. Surveys have suggested the number of international students taking up places in UK universities could drop by more than 50%, while other research claimed domestic enrolment could fall by 15%. In Wales, such a reduction in international students could lead to a loss of about Â£60m in fees. Universities' concern over 2m rule in Wales Â£50m support package for universities and colleges 'I don't even know when I'm moving to university' Universities 'may lose Â£98m' due to pandemic Universities Wales, which represents Welsh institutions, acknowledged that ""these are challenging times for universities"" but said they had proven their abilities to manage. Sir Deian, who was vice-chancellor of London South Bank University for eight years, said: ""The number of students coming from abroad is now likely to drop dramatically and yet universities depend on overseas students so much for their research and for supporting facilities. ""At the same time, there are some doubts that students in Britain may be reluctant to borrow Â£9,000 a year to have much of their courses online and none of the facilities which they would expect to find in university."" Sir Deian Hopkin says students may be reluctant to pay fees for a different experience He said universities had been borrowing money in anticipation of growth, but new facilities might end up not being used. The National Union of Students (NUS) echoed his worries, saying there were concerns the current situation would mean students ""won't get the same student experience"" with many classes being held online. Due to current financial support during the pandemic and fees from the last academic year, the real ""crisis"" could hit next year, Sir Deian said. But Becky Ricketts, NUS Wales president, said the pandemic also provided a chance to develop. ""It's an opportunity for higher education to really look at what we can do in 2020 and going forward, to make sure that students are accessing education in a way that suits them but also in a way that supports our institutions."" She encouraged prospective students to speak to universities as much as possible. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories STRESS:How to look after your mental health ""If you haven't already, start that dialogue with your university, start that dialogue with your students' unions because they are all there to help you make the correct decision for you."" Research by the Institute For Fiscal Studies suggested Welsh universities could lose about Â£3,800 per student due to coronavirus - a lower sum than those in England (Â£4,700) and Scotland (Â£4,500). But the research also says they are not in as strong a position to deal with the losses, with net assets of Â£11,000 per student. Scottish universities have average net assets of Â£20,100 while English ones have an average of Â£18,900. Last month, however, data published by the admissions service Ucas showed record numbers of 18-year-olds in the UK had applied to study at UK universities. What remains unclear is whether students will defer their applications, particularly if there is a second peak in the pandemic ashas been warned of by the chief medical officer. According to the Higher Education Statistics Authority, a university with a net cash inflow of less than 5% could face serious trouble as a result of the current climate. Three Welsh institutions fall into this category - Aberystwyth University, Swansea University and the University of Wales Trinity Saint David. The Welsh Government said it was ""aware of the challenges"" and providing Â£31m to support higher education. ""We're working with our universities to promote them at home and abroad and have published guidance to assist with the safe return of students in the autumn,"" a spokesperson said.

"Tom Jones (right) was shot twice and stabbed in the chest during the armed raid A man given a bravery award after being shot in the face by a bank robber took his own life after suffering nightmares and depression, his son has said. Tom Jones was shot by Jonathan Pay after wrestling him to the ground during the failed raid at Lloyds Bank in Liphook, Hampshire, in 2016. His son, Tom, said his father suffered post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) before his death in February, aged 54. He has been planning a charity walk to raise money for the Samaritans. The attack left a pellet lodged in the base of the skull of Mr Jones, who had been in the bank as a customer with his wife. Both subsequently received awards for bravery from Hampshire Constabulary's chief constable for intervening in the robbery. Det Con Kat Bird said their actions in tackling Pay and grabbing his bag helped provide evidence forensically linking him to the offence. Mr Jones was a ""huge character in the local community"", his son said Jonathan Pay twice opened fire on Mr Jones at Lloyds Bank in Liphook, Hampshire In November 2016,giving an anonymous interview to the BBC, Mr Jones described the moment he was attacked by Pay. ""I had him on the floor and nearly got the gun off him but his friend stabbed me and he shot me in the face,"" he said. ""I dragged him out of the bank then he came back in and shot me again through my hair-line. ""It was adrenaline, complete instinct. I thought my life was going to end in the bank."" His 34-year-old son said Pay first held the gun to his mother's head, which is what had led his father to intervene. ""He became a shadow of his former self as the shot was lodged in his central nervous system, so he was in constant pain,"" he said of his father following the attack. ""He had nightmares about it and hit the drink to help him sleep. It was a downward spiral from there. ""Eventually he distanced himself a bit from everyone. ""His drinking was so bad we had to tell the pubs to not serve him."" Pay was jailed for 16-and-a-half years in November 2016 He said he hoped his charity walk along the South Downs Way, between 25 and 30 August, would help others. ""I am hoping other people in that state of mind will reach out and know that it's acceptable to feel that way and there is a way out that doesn't include taking your own life,"" he said. ""Some good must come of his death."" Coronavirus survivors 'at risk of PTSD' Eyes can reveal if someone has PTSD, study shows Former detective says beekeeping helped his PTSD Mr Jones Jr described his father as a ""huge character in the local community"" who ""hated bullies and injustice"". So far he has raised more than Â£3,000 for the Samaritans, which helps people in emotional distress. Pay, of Liphook Road, Lindford, was jailed for 16-and-a-half years in 2016, having previously admitted wounding with intent, having an imitation firearm with intent and two counts of attempted robbery.

TikTok - which has up to 80 million active monthly users in the US - has exploded in popularity in recent years, mostly with people under 20. This video can not be played What is TikTok? The app is reported to have around 800 million active monthly users, with its biggest markets having grown in the US and India. India has, however, already blocked TikTok, as well as other Chinese apps. Australia, which has already banned Huawei and ZTE, is also considering banning TikTok. WeChat is very popular among those users who have connections to China, where major social networking platforms - such as WhatsApp and Facebook - are blocked. It is also viewed as being a key instrument in China's internal surveillance apparatus - requiring local users who have been accused of spreading malicious rumours to register a facial scan and voice print. A seminar held earlier this year by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute think tank discussed how groups within the app would be used to recommend holiday destinations, restaurants and the like on a day-to-day basis, but then switch to spreading political messages in line with Beijing's thinking at critical times.

"Dozens of people protested near parliament in Beirut Protesters clashed with Lebanese security forces at anti-government demonstrations in Beirut on Thursday. Officers deployed tear gas on dozens of people near parliament. Demonstrators were angered by Tuesday's devastating blast, which officials say was caused by 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate stored unsafely since 2013. Many in Lebanon say government negligence led to the explosion, which killed at least 137 people and injured about 5,000 others. The explosion destroyed entire districts in the capital, with homes and businesses reduced to rubble. Dozens of people are still unaccounted for. Officers deployed tear gas on the small crowd People have blamed government negligence, corruption and mismanagement for the blast The state news agency says 16 people have been taken into custody as part of an investigation announced by the government this week. Since the disaster two officials have resigned. MP Marwan Hamadeh stepped down on Wednesday, while Lebanon's ambassador to Jordan Tracy Chamoun stepped down on Thursday, saying the catastrophe showed the need for a change in leadership. How ship's deadly cargo ended up at Beirut port Earlier on Thursday, French President Emmanuel Macron also visited the city and said Lebanon needed to see ""profound change"" from authorities. He also called for an international investigation into the disaster. This video can not be played Aerial footage shows flattened buildings after an explosion in Beirut's port area By Quentin Sommerville, BBC News, Beirut This port was Lebanon's lifeline to the whole world. Something like 80% of the country's grain came through here. The grain silos, which were built way back when, are teetering. Just beyond there I can see a ship listing heavily. I've lived in Beirut for five years and it's almost unrecognisable - it's a city of sirens, of empty buildings, of empty streets. As I look at the neighbourhood of Gemmayze just behind the port, I can't see a single pane of glass left. Entire roofs have gone - I can see friends' apartments, which are just open to the sky now. All of this area, which was really heavily populated, has been abandoned. No-one is coming back here any time soon. What's really noticeable as you walk the streets here is that every second person seems to have a broom in their hand. There are clear-up teams everywhere, but it's pretty low tech: tiny teams of people with pans and brushes to clean up an an entire city's devastation. The thing that really strikes me is how enormously stupid it was, what criminal negligence it took to leave this highly explosive material right in the very heart of this city, within yards of people, their homes, their businesses. And the authorities here knew - they had been warned that these chemicals were dangerous and that they were a great risk to Beirut and Lebanon. In 2013 a Moldovan-flagged ship, the Rhosus, entered Beirut port after suffering technical problems during its journey from Georgia to Mozambique, according to Shiparrested.com, which deals with shipping-related legal cases. The Rhosus was inspected, banned from sailing onward and was shortly afterwards abandoned by its owners, sparking several legal claims. Its cargo included the ammonium nitrate, which is used as a fertiliser and as an explosive. It was stored in a port warehouse for safety reasons, the report said, and it remained there for the next six years. There are a lot of rules around storing ammonium nitrate, particularly around fire-proofing, because it is so highly explosive if it comes into contact with flames. This video can not be played Rami Ruhayem has been to Gemmayze, the closest residential area to the port The head of the port and the head of the customs authority said that they had written to the judiciary several times asking that the chemical be exported or sold on to ensure port safety. Port General Manager Hassan Koraytem told OTV they had been aware that the material was dangerous when a court first ordered it stored in the warehouse, ""but not to this degree"". IN PICTURES:Chaos and destruction AMMONIUM NITRATE:What is it? How dangerous is it? Q&A:What we know THE CONTEXT:Why Lebanon is in crisis Rescuers are continuing to search for people in Beirut, and security forces have sealed off a wide area around the blast site. On Thursday, two days after the explosion, a French rescue team working in the city said there was still a good chance of finding survivors. One unnamed rescuer told Mr Macron during his visit that they hoped to find a group of seven or eight people believed to be trapped in a ""control room"" under the rubble. Meanwhile, Beirut's hospitals are feeling the strain of so many people needing medical care. Public Health Minister Hamad Hassan said Lebanon's health sector was short of beds, and lacked the equipment necessary to treat the injured and those in critical condition. Beirut's governor Marwan Aboud also warned that as many as 300,000 people have been left homeless by the blast. People in Beirut have been volunteering to clean up the rubble Lebanon also imports most of its food. Because large quantities of grain stored in the port have been destroyed, there are fears that the country will face widespread food insecurity. The future of the port itself is in doubt too. Before this disaster, Lebanon's hospitals were already struggling to cope with a rise in Covid-19 infections. The country is also going through the worst economic crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war, and was seeing regular anti-government street protests. People were having to deal with daily power cuts, a lack of safe drinking water and limited public healthcare. Have you been personally affected by this story?
