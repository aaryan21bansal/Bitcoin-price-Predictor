"Martial hits Saints post with long-range effort Man Utd's Romero makes several excellent saves Penalty awarded for handball by Bailly - appeared to be outside box Southampton end season at home to Stoke Man Utd host Palace on final day Caroline Chapman That's all for tonight over here, folks. You can follow the dramatic Championship play-off semi-finalpenalty shoot out here. There's more Premier League action on Thursday when Leicester face Tottenham. Southampton 0-0 Manchester United A draw means nothing to the Premier League standings. Manchester United will finish the season in sixth, no matter what happens in their final game against Crystal Palace. And even if they win that one, it will
be their lowest ever total of wins in a single Premier League season (17). Southampton remain in eighth - which is the highest position they can finish in - but West Brom, Bournemouth and Leicester City can snatch it off them on the final day. The Saints finish the season against Stoke. Southampton 0-0 Manchester United Manchester United Manchester United goalkeeper Sergio Romero speaking to Sky Sports:""For us, the result is important. When we take a clean sheet it is good for me, and defenders, and for the team. It gives us more confidence for the final. ""For us it's the important game of the year. We need the trophy for the club."" Southampton 0-0 Manchester United Southampton Southampton manager Claude Puel speaking to Sky Sports:""It's a shame our performance was not enough in the first half. But in the second half in terms of opportunities, we deserved to score and had seven or eight shots on target. We needed to be clinical perhaps, but we played good football and had chances to win the game. ""It's a third penalty miss in so many games. It's very important as it can give confidence and we needed confidence at the beginning of the game. It's a problem perhaps for us but in the second half I'm happy with our comeback."" Southampton 0-0 Manchester United Jose Mourinho is asked when fans can expect to see David de Gea again. The United keeper has been linked with a move this summer. ""David? I think the first match against LA Galaxy in pre-season,"" said Mourinho. ""I hope to play Joel Pereira against Palace and Sergio in the Europa final. ""David is top of the world and obviously we want to keep him."" #bbcfootball Dhru Patel:For Jose's sake.. I hope Manchester United win the Europa League! I hope all this Europe prioritising pays off for them. Ricky Lee Everett:United under Jose are abject at best, not calling for his head, but performances have to improve next year Southampton 0-0 Manchester United Manchester United Jose Mourinho is asked if his players came away unscathed tonight:I don't know. Fellani hasn't got a tear but he's experienced enough to know he had a feeling. Apart from that nothing. It's all good. ""We played a good team, a team who tried to win and tried to finish well. I think we did more than ok. ""I think all of them gave me positive feelings. Sergio had a very good performance, more than very good. The team wasn't perfect but individually they gave me good things. They showed me they want to be an option for the final.""  Manchester United will travel to Stockholm next Wednesday to take on Ajax in the Europa League final. Former United coach Rene Meulensteen was speaking to the Monday Night Club on BBC Radio 5 live this week. ""If they donât win the Europa league then itâs a disappointing season, simple as that,"" he said. ""They were clear in setting out their season to get back in Champions League and more than anything compete for the title. ""Itâs a great advert, Ajax v United, but it wont be a straightforward conclusion I donât think."" FT: Southampton 0-0 Manchester United Manchester United Manchester United defender Phil Jones speaking to Sky Sports: ""We've got the final coming up so that's in the back of our minds. Coming off the back of two defeats it's a good result and we kept a clean sheet."" ""Whoever plays in the final is good enough to go out there and win the game. All we can do as indidivuals is play well.""  Southampton 0-0 Manchester United That's 15 draws for Man United this season and 10 for Southampton. We should have guessed the outcome, really.   Southampton 0-0 Manchester United My Â£3.62 is safe! Southampton 0-0 Manchester United Man United have a free-kick, just inside the Southampton half. It's swept in by Wayne Rooney but it's nowhere near causing any danger. Saints clear. Southampton 0-0 Manchester United Jose Mourinho is livid. He's out of the technical area to dispute an offside call against Marcus Rashford, who was sprinting on to a long ball.  Southampton 0-0 Manchester United Four minutes of added time. I'd put my life savings (Â£3.62) on no-one scoring in that time. Southampton 0-0 Manchester United Matt Targett sends Sergio Romero into action again, this time with a low drive from the left. If the rumours are true and David de Gea is leaving this summer, then surely United fans would be happy with Romero taking the number one shirt? #bbcfootball Neil Leverett:Romero's positioning has been superb tonight. Paul Gibbons:Surely you'd want your team brimming with confidence going into a final? Seriously don't understand Mourinho. Gareth Murray:As a pretty meaningless encounter, you would think Mourinho might have encouraged his team to entertain a little. Southampton 0-0 Manchester United 'Attack, attack, attack, attack, attack'. It sounds like that chant is coming from the visiting fans... Southampton 0-0 Manchester United Southampton go all tiki-taka, and play it out beautifully from the back. Dusan Tadic pulls back to Sofiane Boufal, who takes his time to switch to his left foot, but he can't keep his effort down. Southampton 0-0 Manchester United Jay Rodridguez turns and flashes a brilliant strike past Sergio Romero's far post. Was the Saints sub offside? Perhaps. Southampton 0-0 Manchester United It's all gets a bit messy in the midfield. Both teams gifting possession to one another. Sofiant Boufal runs at Phil Jones, wrong-foots Michael Carrick and suddenly Southampton are in loads of space. Jeremy Pied has it out on the right, sends it in but it's soon cleared. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Championship play-off semi-final second leg Forestieri has decisive penalty saved by Ward Hutchinson and Payne also miss from the spot Tie finished 1-1 after extra time Terriers will face Reading at Wembley on 29 May Phil Cartwright FT: Sheff Wed 1-1 Huddersfield (3-4 pens) I think Danny Ward and his Huddersfield team-mates were so excited after their penalty shootout win that they could have run all of the way to Wembley this evening. But they'll have to wait 12 days before they appear at England's national stadium. On Monday 29 May, it will be Reading v Huddersfield Town in the Championship play-off final. We'll have live text and Radio 5 live coverage of that match. Before then, there's the climax to the League Two play-off semi-finals tomorrow. Hope you can join us again then. Luton v Blackpool, Exeter v Carlisle (Thursday, 19:45 BST) If the two Championship play-off semi-finals have been tight and cagey, down in the fourth tier it's been anything but. Eleven goals were scored across the two first legs on Sunday, as Blackpool came from behind to edge Luton 3-2 at Bloomfield Road, while Carlisle rescued a 3-3 draw at home to Exeter. More goals, thrills and spills in round two? Let's hope so. We'll have live text commentary of both second legs on Thursday from 19:15 BST on the BBC Sport website and app. FT: Sheff Wed 1-1 Huddersfield (3-4 pens) Huddersfield head coach David Wagner tells Sky Sports:""First I must share my thoughts with Sheffield Wednesday. They have had a great season and I can only imagine how sad they are. They are great competitors. ""If you play two games and have to go to penalties, it shows how tight and even the games are. ""Everybody knows how great and difficult this occasion can be, but I'm so proud for our football club and everyone connected with it because Huddersfield Town will be at Wembley on 29 May."" FT: Sheff Wed 1-1 Huddersfield (3-4 pens) Sheffield Wednesday's play-off exit means we'll have a Sheffield derby in the Championship next season. Their city rivals, United, cantered to the League One title in 2016-17 and will be back in the second tier for the first time since 2011 next season. FT: Sheff Wed 1-1 Huddersfield (3-4 pens) Steve McClarenEx-England manager on BBC Radio 5 live David Wagner shook every Wednesday player's hand. He's been criticised before about celebrations, so it's good to see. You could easily lose your head, run away with the crowd, run away with the players. But it's a manager's duty and job to stay humble and congratulate the opponents, which he has done. Then he will celebrate and go really wild - so he should do. FT: Sheff Wed 1-1 Huddersfield (3-4 pens) Huddersfield defender Michael Hefele tells Sky Sports:""The whole team believed, even when we went 1-0 down. There was pressure on my penalty, Jack Payne was unlucky, but Danny Ward saved the next one and we got through."" Huddersfield captain Tommy Smith:""It's an amazing feeling. This team are a special bunch, and it stems back to the backroom staff. It's a special club. It's been an unbelievable season and this is an incredible feeling. Why can't we go on and win at Wembley?"" #bbcefl Jordan Ramsden: Congratulations to both Huddersfield and Reading. Who would have predicted this final? Jack Melham:It just wasn't Wednesday's Wednesday. FT: Sheff Wed 1-1 Huddersfield (3-4 pens) Ian WoodcockBBC Sport at Hillsborough Huddersfield's incredible season goes on. They finished 19th in the Championship last season and
had never reached the Championship play-offs before in their history. On the balance of the two games, they probably deserve it
and they will fancy their chances of making more history against Reading at
Wembley. It's 45 years since Huddersfield were in the top flight. They're one win away from getting back there. FT: Sheff Wed 1-1 Huddersfield (3-4 pens) Ian WoodcockBBC Sport at Hillsborough Soon after their shootout victory, Town's players were in a huddle in front of their fans
with David Wagner holding court in the middle. He has done a truly remarkable job in West Yorkshire and
this season will end at Wembley for them. Who knows - he may even be facing his old mate Jurgen Klopp in the Premier League next season?

"Michael Keane played in the same 2011 FA Youth Cup-winning side as Paul Pogba Manchester United are interested in re-signing Â£25m-rated Burnley defender Michael Keane. The 24-year-old wassold to the Clarets for Â£2min 2015 by then-United manager Louis van Gaal. He made his England debut on 22 March this year and is shortlisted for the Professional Footballers' Association young player of the year award. Any deal for Keane would allow United to activate a 25% sell-on clause from the player's initial transfer. If the transfer did go through, it would be the second summer in succession that United would have bought back one of their former academy players followingPaul Pogba's world-record Â£89mreturn in 2016. United manager Jose Mourinho has identified his defence as an area he wishes to improve in the summer and is expected to make significant changes to his squad. Mourinho's men cannot finish in the Premier League top five after they lost against Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday coupled with Arsenal's 2-0 win against Sunderland two days later. The Red Devils have two games remaining, starting with a trip to Southampton on Wednesday before hosting Crystal Palace on Sunday. Stockport-born Keane played in the same 2011 FA Youth Cup-winning side as Pogba and made five senior appearances for United. He joined Burnley after spells on loan at Leicester, Derby and Blackburn. Steve McClaren, former England manager on BBC Radio 5 live I'm surprised Manchester United got rid of him in the first place. We took him on loan at Derby a few years ago when he was 19 or 20 years old. He wasn't physically ready at that stage. He came in as cover for 10 games and was absolutely outstanding. The potential future was there for all to see. He was a modern centre-back - he could get a goal from set-pieces and was aerially very good. He could also bring the ball out from the back and step into midfield. Michael has since cemented a place at Burnley and established himself as a top centre-back.

"This video can not be played A beginner's guide to impeachment and Trump US President Donald Trump has been impeached and now faces the next stage of a process that could, with enough support in Congress, see him removed from office. It all centres on whether or not he improperly sought help from Ukraine to boost his chances of re-election in 2020. Mr Trump became only the third president in US history to be impeached after two votes in the Democratic Party-controlled House of Representatives - but more on what that means below. President Trump, who is a Republican, strongly denies any wrongdoing. President Trump is accused of pressuring Ukraine to dig up damaging information on one of his main Democratic challengers for the presidency in 2020, Joe Biden, and his son Hunter. Hunter worked for a Ukrainian company when Joe Biden was US vice-president. The president is accused of dangling two things as bargaining chips to Ukraine - withholding $400m of military aid to Ukraine that had already been allocated by Congress, and a White House meeting for Ukraine's president. This, Democrats say, amounts to an abuse of presidential power, using the office for personal political gain and to the detriment of national security. Ukraine was using that money in its ongoing conflict with Russia. Mr Trump is also accused of obstructing Congress by refusing to co-operate with the congressional inquiry. A formal complaint from a whistleblower - an unnamed intelligence official who wrote a letter expressing concern about Mr Trump's 25 July call with President Volodymyr Zelensky - kicked off the impeachment process in early September. A rough transcript of the call,externalrevealed that Mr Trump had urged President Zelensky to investigate discredited allegations against Joe and Hunter Biden. This video can not be played What we know about Biden-Ukraine corruption claims The call came shortly after Mr Trump had blocked the release of millions of dollars in US military aid to Ukraine.A senior official later testifiedthat the president made clear the release of the aid was conditional on Mr Biden being investigated, but the White House denies this. In a series of public hearings, a procession of US officials have testified that there was a White House shadow foreign policy led by the president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. Its aim was to get Ukraine to open an investigation into the Bidens and declare as much publicly. Mr Trump denies using US military aid as a bargaining chip with Mr Zelensky and has repeatedly insisted his call with Ukraine's leader was ""perfect"". He has called the impeachment inquiry a ""witch hunt"" by Democrats and elements of the media. He also says it was appropriate to ask Ukraine to investigate ""corruption"", referring to the energy firm where Hunter Biden worked. The Republican defence comes in three parts: - Ukraine's president said he felt no pressure - The Ukrainians were unaware the aid was held back - US military aid was eventually released To impeach, in this context, means to bring charges in Congress that will form the basis for a trial. The US constitution states a president ""shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes or misdemeanours"". It's important to note this is a political process, rather than a criminal one. This video can not be played What does it take to impeach a president? It happens in two stages. The first stage is done now - two articles of impeachment (charges) were brought to the House of Representatives and passed in a vote along party lines. Next the process heads to the Senate where a trial will be held in January. But here, a two-thirds vote is necessary for a president's removal - and this milestone has never been reached in US history. The Senate is currently controlled by the Republican Party so conviction is considered unlikely in Trump's case. Bill Clinton found himself impeached on the grounds of perjury and obstruction of justice after he lied about the nature of his affair with Monica Lewinsky and then allegedly asked her to lie about it as well. But when the trial reached the Senate in 1999, the vote for a conviction failed to get close to the two-thirds backing required. Bill and Hillary Clinton with US House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt after Mr Clinton was impeached The only other president impeached was Andrew Johnson in 1868. He was accused of, among other things, dismissing his secretary of war against the will of Congress. Mr Johnson had a narrow escape - the two-thirds majority in the Senate was missed by just one vote. President Andrew Johnson narrowly survived his impeachment trial Richard Nixon, the 37th US president, resigned in 1974 before he could be impeached over the Watergate scandal. The line of succession for the US government, as established by the Presidential Succession Act of 1947, would mean Vice-President Mike Pence moving into the Oval Office.

"Danielle Jones was waiting to catch a bus to school when she disappeared Despite a jury deciding 15-year-old Danielle Jones was murdered by her uncle Stuart Campbell, one question has always loomed unanswered: Where is her body? This week a new lead offered a ray of hope for an answer. That hope has now faded. Will she ever be found? One man could bring an immediate end to the torment endured for more than 16 years by the family of Danielle Jones. Yet he refuses to do so. And unless Campbell reveals the location of her body, or police get a fresh lead in the case, Danielle's current resting place will remain a mystery. Although their search of garages near her killer's former home has found no trace of her remains, Essex Police has vowed the Danielle Jones case will not be closed until the teenager's body is reunited with her family. Danielle's parents Linda and Tony Jones think about her every day - the daughter who loved her pet rabbits, the band Steps and the singer Robbie Williams. The youngest of three siblings, Danielle was a normal teenager who sang along to pop music in her bedroom and wanted to work with children after leaving school. She was last seen near her East Tilbury home on the morning of 18 June 2001. Like hundreds of thousands of other children that day, she was on her way to catch the school bus. Danielle was last seen near her East Tilbury home on the morning of 18 June 2001 But, Danielle never got on the bus and did not arrive safely at St Clere's School. Shortly after 08:00 BST, she was abducted and murdered by her uncle Stuart Campbell, then a trusted member of the family. But Campbell, who had married into the Jones family, had a dark secret - an unhealthy fascination with teenage girls. It was an obsession that had become focused on Danielle herself. He had also hidden a violent criminal past that stretches back to 1976 when, at the age of 18, he was jailed for four years. Danielle's parents Linda and Tony Jones visiting the scene of the police search on Monday This week, Essex Police revealed officers were searching a block of garages not searched in 2001 Campbell, a builder from Grays who worked across the south east of England, would later seal his fate through his own deceit about his whereabouts that day. But, throughout the investigation that led to his conviction, Danielle would remain missing. Stuart Campbell, who was an uncle by marriage to Danielle, was jailed for life in 2002 Campbell used to approach girls in the street, posing as a photographer, and invite them into his home It emerged after the trial that he was given a 12-month suspended sentence in 1989 after holding a 14-year-old girl at his home and photographing her in a karate suit He was originally charged with abducting the girl and taking indecent pictures of her - but it was dropped after he admitted taking a child without lawful authority In 1976, he was given a four-year jail term after being convicted of robbing a 16-year-old girl in the street Campbell had claimed that on the morning Danielle disappeared he was miles away at a DIY store in Rayleigh. But mobile telephone triangulation - a new forensic tool at the time of his trial - proved this was a lie. He then claimed to have received text messages from Danielle after her disappearance suggesting she was having problems at home. One message read: ""HI STU THANKZ 4 BEIN SO NICE UR THE BEST UNCLE EVER! TELL MUM I'M SO SORRY LUVYA LOADZ DAN XXX"" The telephone evidence would again prove decisive. The message had been sent when Danielle's phone and Campbell's phone were in the same place. And Danielle only wrote messages in lower case text. Danielle's parents Tony and Linda Jones, speaking at a press conference Impact statements from those affected by crimes are often read out in court before offenders are sentenced. This harrowing and brutally honest account from Linda Jones about how she and husband Tony were affected by Danielle's murder was written in 2002. ""Her disappearance has been a life-changing event which my family and I will never really come to terms with and I doubt whether things will ever become normal for us again. ""When Danielle first went missing it was totally unthinkable that she was dead. For the first couple of weeks I couldn't go to sleep, I wouldn't leave home and we didn't lock the front door in case Danielle returned. ""It all seemed like a bad dream, it wasn't real, it wasn't happening to us. I think after a couple of weeks without any news I knew she wouldn't be coming home. It took a long time for Tony to say that Danielle would not be coming home. ""We are both angry and those feelings of anger sometimes bubble up and cause turmoil in our relationship. The whole thing has knocked the stuffing out of us."" Campbell, who pleaded not guilty to murder, was put on trial at Chelmsford Crown Court in 2002. The jury though would find him guilty and he was later sentenced to a life term, with a minimum of 20 years to be served before he would be eligible for parole. But even after he was jailed Campbell, now 59, steadfastly refused to share the whereabouts of Danielle's body. The search at the time of her disappearance was extensive. Involving more than 900 officers and support staff in 2001 and 2002, 1,500 different sites were searched and tonnes of earth were lifted and sifted. But despite the investigation bill reaching Â£1.7m, nothing was found. We now know that one possible lead was not followed up. This video can not be played Danielle Jones: Garages searched in a bid to find body It was revealed only this week, when Essex Police invited the media to a Monday morning press conference. The force refused to say what it was to do with, merely there had been a ""significant development"". This ""development"" included an admission - that police had received ""non-specific information"" about one set of garages in Stifford Clays back in 2001, but no search was carried out. Interest was piqued in February this year, when a member of the public told police of ""unusual activity"" at the site, which is just six miles (10km) from Danielle's home. Her parents Linda and Tony Jones, who visited the garage site on Monday, voiced their hope that the search might bring answers as to what happened to Danielle 16 years ago. Then, just two days after the search started, Assistant Chief Constable Steve Worron said he was confident Danielle was not beneath the main plot being searched. ""A thorough search was conducted on the base which formed the focus of our work yesterday,"" he said on Wednesday, adding: ""I am confident that Danielle's body is not there."" ""I am, however, committed to ensuring that we satisfy ourselves before leaving the area that there is nothing concealed under any of the bases indicated within the information received in February. ""Danielle's family have been updated on this development and we continue to work with them. ""This case is not closed. It will remain open until Danielle's body is found and she is returned to her family. ""The one person who knows where her body is still refuses to tell police or her family. ""Stuart Campbell could end the last 16 years of pain for Linda and Tony and tell them where their daughter is."" Helen McCourt disappeared near her home in Billinge on 9 February 1988 Many feel killers who do not assist police in bringing a full resolution to cases such as that of Danielle's should not be granted parole. One of them, unsurprisingly, is Mrs Jones herself, who is a supporter of Helen's Law. Helen's Law is named afterHelen McCourt- who was murdered on Merseyside in 1988. Her body has never been found. Her mother Marie has offered her support to the Jones family. She said the Jones family had endured ""terrible torment"" in not knowing where Danielle's body lies. ""I think for Linda and Tony at this moment in time, all they want is to have Danielle back in the fold of her family, where they can arrange to give her a proper and decent burial,"" Mrs McCourt said.

"The Iranian authorities have relaxed rules on internet use during the election campaign This is an Iranian election like no other, where the main battles are being fought on social media. For the first time candidates, as well as voters, have discovered the power of messaging apps as a way of bypassing state media and reaching out directly to each other. Rather than relying on state television channels to broadcast their campaign rallies, the two front-runners - President Hassan Rouhani and his hard line rival Ebrahim Raisi - have been live-streaming them on Instagram. At the touch of a button, anyone with a mobile device has been able to tune in, watch and show their support by adding to the blizzard of likes, hearts and smiley faces streaming across the screen. They have also provided constant updates on Telegram, a hugely popular secure messaging app which now has more than 20 million users in Iran. Former President Mohammad Khatami has publicly backed Hassan Rouhani On Sunday, the reformist former President, Mohammad Khatami, posted a video message on Telegram urging voters to support Mr Rouhani, who is seeking a second term. Mr Khatami is banned from appearing on state media and the main TV channels do not even show his photograph or mention his name. But his video went viral, reaching millions of Iranians connected via a vast network of Telegram channels. In parallel to the presidential poll, local elections are also taking place across the country on Friday. Who are the candidates? Economy emerges as critical factor Five things to know Could women decide Iran's next president? How Iran is ruled,external In the capital, Tehran, voters used Twitter and Telegram to challenge the official list of reformist candidates. They began circulating an alternative list of progressive candidates they said had been forced off the reformist ticket. The list caused such a huge stir on social media and prompted some very serious conversations in the reformist camp. President Rouhani is live-streaming his campaign speeches Unusually in a country where access to many websites and social media platforms is blocked, Telegram and Instagram are freely accessible in Iran. When Telegram first appeared in Iran it was seen as a chat application with limited functionalities. The establishment saw it as a relatively safe platform, and it was only when its Russian developers introduced new channel features, and Farsi-speakers began using it in a very different way, that its potential to mobilise millions of people became apparent. Iranians have now created thousands of Telegram channels, and use ""supergroups"" not only to promote their agenda but also to do business and make money. Ebrahim Raisi's supporters are also taking to social media Telegram is suddenly being taken very seriously by the establishment and in the run up to the election the administrators of some popular channels have been detained. Twitter is officially blocked in Iran but people use proxies to tweet. President Rouhani and many of his cabinet members have been active on Twitter for the past four years; Mr Raisi hurriedly set up an account just before launching his campaign. Usually, Twitter conversations that create a buzz then travel to Telegram channels where they can potentially reach a much wider audience. One such conversation discussed demands for gender equality and equal rights for women. Mr Rouhani's campaign team has paid close attention to these conversations and identified keywords to include in his speeches about women, youth and internet freedom. Mr Raisi, a hardliner, is backed by Iran's clerical and security establishment In Iran, where free public debate is restricted and access to the media is controlled very closely, election campaigns are a rare opportunity for people from many different walks of life to make their grievances heard. When Mr Rouhani's speeches have been streamed live on Instagram, for example, members of the LGBT community have taken the opportunity to post questions asking him directly about his views on gay marriage. It would be unthinkable to ask such questions face-to-face in a public forum. The president did not respond to the questions about gay marriage, but he has discussed other taboo issues during the campaign. Mr Rouhani has not responded to questions about his views on gay marriage Many people were surprised when the president attacked Mr Raisi over the former judge's role in the mass executions of thousands of dissidents in prison at the end of the 1980s. It is a dark chapter in recent Iranian history, and one that is usually never mentioned. However, Mr Rouhani's comments prompted a sudden outpouring of heartfelt debate on social media. The president also used social media to raise another unmentionable subject - corruption in the Revolutionary Guards. His veiled comments on the issue sparked off a debate online that soon moved offline into the world of everyday conversation. For both voters and candidates, social media has also provided a way to bypass state censorship. Mr Rouhani may be the president, but that did not stop state television from cutting parts of his campaign video before it was aired. When the censors chopped out clips showing his supporters chanting the names of detained opposition leaders, Mr Rouhani's team released them on social media, allowing them to be watched by millions. Ebrahim Raisi tweeted: âWe intend to open to the youth the gates of senior posts in government.â In response, a woman wrote: âFor God's sake, make sure you don't open the gates to 28-year-old prosecutors (like yourself) who would kill other 30 year olds.â Mr Raisi now has an active fan base on Twitter. His hard line supporters steer conversations against Mr Rouhani and get involved in debates in support of their candidate. But the president's fans have been fighting back, and Mr Raisi's Twitter account has been trolled by people opposed to his candidacy. Throughout his campaign, Mr Rouhani has presented himself as an advocate for social media, reminding supporters that he has fought hard to ensure Telegram and Instagram remain unfiltered. However, the role social media has played in mobilising people during this campaign has not gone unnoticed. Instagram live-streams and Telegram supergroups are clearly a powerful weapon. Whether access will still be available to Iranians after this election could depend very much on the outcome. Who are the candidates?

"Stars from around the world are heading to Cannes for the prestigious film festival, celebrating its 70th anniversary this year. Julianne Moore, Robert Pattinson, Jake Gyllenhaal and Emma Thompson are among those set to be walking the red carpet. The festival opens with Ismael's Ghosts - a French film starring Marion Cotillard - on Wednesday. As the French Riviera resort welcomes the film world for the 11-day event, here's what to expect. Nicole Kidman is set to be Queen of Cannes It's fair to say this is Nicole Kidman's year, with four projects - that's TV as well as film - on show. They include one of the most hotly-anticipated films of the festival, The Beguiled. Directed by Sofia Coppola, the drama is set in an all-female boarding school in America's South during the Civil War and is in competition for the top prize, the Palme d'Or. An injured enemy soldier, played by Colin Farrell, is taken in by the women, but tensions - and sexual jealousy - rise. She stars in Sofia Coppola's The Beguiled alongside Elle Fanning and Kirsten Dunst Kidman and Farrell team up again for The Killing of a Sacred Deer by Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos (The Lobster). She plays the wife of a surgeon - Farrell - who takes in a teenage boy with catastrophic results. Her final film at Cannes is How to Talk to Girls at Parties, based on a Neil Gaiman short story, while she's also in Jane Campion's Top of the Lake, one of the TV picks of the festival. Rihanna will be on the Cannes party circuit You can forget the screening rooms and press junkets - the main action at Cannes is going to be on the red carpet and at the endless parties. Rihanna and Cara Delevingne are among those heading to the waterfront as a social whirl engulfs the town. Neither has a film showing - but Cara is the face of a new ice cream launch and Rihanna is hosting a late-night party. Each country will also have a tent along the seafront, so you can expect an array of famous faces to be popping in to the soirees being held there, as well as those on the shoal of superyachts that will be fringing the festival. Soldiers patrolling in Cannes ahead of the opening of the festival Security at this year's Cannes is higher than ever. Which is not surprising given the recent attacks in France, including last summer's horror in nearby Nice, where a man drove a truck into a crowd celebrating Bastille Day. A row of 400 concrete barriers disguised as giant flowerpots have been installed to stop a similar vehicle attack during the festival. Police have invested in 160m of spiked chains that could stop a truck and have extra forces working during the festival. In addition, there are 550 security cameras - one for every 140 inhabitants of Cannes. A festival spokeswoman said the measures were to ""guarantee the festival-goers' optimal security"" while ""taking care not to disrupt"" the event. Kristen Stewart's short film is about ""heartbreak"" This year, we'll be seeing Kristen Stewart, Robin Wright and Vanessa Redgrave step behind the camera and turn their hands to directing. Twilight star Kristen has made a short film called Come Swim, which she has described as being about a man in his 30s in the throes of ""full-on heartbreak"". Robin Wright has also directed short film - The Dark of Night - about a woman seeking refuge from a storm in an isolated diner. And Redgrave is presenting Sea Sorrow, a documentary about the refugee crisis. The actress and activist says she was spurred into action by seeing images of the body of Syrian child Alan Kurdi washed up on a Turkish beach. As a side note - Jupiter's Moon, competing for the Palme d'Or, also looks at the refugee crisis. Okja, starring Tilda Swinton, is about a young girl trying to save her best friend - a massive animal - from being kidnapped As well as Top of the Lake, the other main television event is the long-awaited return of Twin Peaks, which is having its premiere at Cannes after 26 years off the air. Fans have been full of theories about what David Lynch is likely to have up his sleeve. It's been seen asa sign that Cannes is embracing television,external- although both Lynch and Campion have previously won the Palme d'Or. And then there's the Netflix controversy. The home-streaming giant has two feature films in competition - Okja starring Tilda Swinton, and Noah Baumbach's The Meyerowitz Stories, with Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller and Emma Thompson. But after concerns from the French film industry, the festival stepped in to announce that from next year, films wanting to compete at Cannes will have to be screened at French cinemas. Spanish director Pedro Almodovar is presiding over the Cannes jury There are 19 films in contention,externalfor the coveted Palme d'Or. One of the early favourites is Wonderstruck by Todd Haynes, director of Carol. Starring Julianne Moore and Michelle Williams, it tells the story of a young boy and young girl - 50 years apart - whose stories intertwine. And anticipation is high for Good Time, a bank-robber drama starring Jennifer Jason Leigh and Robert Pattinson, as well as The Beguiled and Okja. It's going to be a tough decision forjury president Pedro Almodovar and his fellow jurors, including Will Smith and Jessica Chastain. The 70th anniversary Palme d'Or Isabelle Huppert (third left) and British actor Toby Jones (second right) star in Happy End Lynne Ramsey (who directed We Need to Talk About Kevin) returns to the Croisette towards the end of the festival with You Were Never Really Here, starring Joaquin Phoenix as a war veteran trying to save a young girl from a sex trafficking ring. Then we have Austrian director Michael Haneke, who has already lifted the Palme d'Or twice - with The White Ribbon in 2009 and Amour in 2012. This year, he's presenting Happy End, starring Oscar nominee Isabelle Huppert, a family drama set in Calais with the refugee crisis unfolding on its doorstep. Can he make it a third trophy? A high heel row erupted at Cannes in 2015 With the champagne flowing and sleep in short supply, anything can happen. In the past, we've seenflat shoes apparently banned from the red carpet,Hollywood stars having their films booed, and world-famous director Lars von Trier being banned for saying he ""sympathised"" with Hitler. Expect colour, expect fashion, expect glamour, expect films to be lauded and panned in equal measure - but most of all, expect the unexpected.

"Experts are lining up to say that a laptop ban could make flying more dangerous Airports, airlines and the government are bracing themselves for a ban on laptops, tablets, cameras and e-readers going as hand luggage on flights between Europe and America. No-one is absolutely certain it will happen, but most people I've spoken to assume it's coming. In reality, the Americans will just tell everyone what they want and when they want it. I'm told that European governments don't get much say in the matter or much notice of any changes - in fact they're watching the media and Twitter just in case it's sprung on them. Any ban would hit Heathrow the hardest. Three-quarters of UK flights to the US go from Heathrow. That's 761 planes a week, by far the most from any European airport. This video can not be played David Crowder demonstrates the dangers of faulty batteries However, there is widespread concern that by tackling one threat, terrorism, the Americans could be fuelling another, even more serious problem. Fire. If lithium-ion batteries are damaged or short-circuited they makea hell of a bang. It could even be enough to bring down a plane. Captain John Cox is as knowledgeable as anyone you will meet when it comes to plane fires. The former pilot and member of the Royal Aeronautical Society has studied them for more than a decade and now travels the world advising operators, manufacturers and regulators. ""Bunching lots of electronic devices together into the same secure box in the hold is the worst possible thing you could do,"" he told me. ""Devices collected together will dramatically increase the ferocity of any fire."" Aircraft holds do have fire extinguishers and limited oxygen, but that doesn't help when it comes to lithium battery fires. ""The cargo hold extinguisher will put out the open flame but it will reignite. Lithium battery fires produce their own oxygen as a by-product of thermal runaway, and that keeps the fire going,"" says Mr Cox. Thermal runaway is the process whereby the fire spreads from one battery cell to the next. Once it gets going it's impossible to stop. And the more cells you have bunched together, the bigger the fire. Catching the fire early and stopping thermal runaway is critical. The best device for doing that remains an old fashioned, well-trained human being. Airline staff practise what to do: you put the battery into water if you can. Or wet towels. No-one can do that if it's in the hold. Kuwaiti activist Thamer Bourashed stows his laptop in hold baggage before boarding Steve Landells is the safety expert at the British Airline Pilots Association, ""Given the risk of fire from these devices when they are damaged or they short circuit, an incident in the cabin would be spotted earlier and this would enable the crew to react quickly before any fire becomes uncontainable,"" he says. ""If these devices are kept in the hold, the risk is that if a fire occurs the results can be catastrophic; indeed, there have been two crashes where lithium batteries have been cited in the accident reports."" Mr Cox says that balancing the different risks is complex and needs a thorough assessment from a range of experts. But along with many others in the industry, he's not confident that will happen. The feeling is that the people at the US Department for Homeland Security will take their decision in isolation from the safety people at the US Federation Aviation Administration. That's what happened when the current laptop ban on someflights from the Middle East was brought in. Passengers will no doubt support a ban if they are convinced it'll keep them safer. But the experts are lining up to say that a laptop ban could make flying more dangerous. US to discuss laptop flight ban with EU Laptop ban: What about the parents?

"Computer giant Apple is expanding its supply line of talented young people with digital skills, by doubling the intake of its European academy. Last year, the technology company opened an academy in Naples, in Italy, where students spend a year training to be developers, coders, app creators and start-up entrepreneurs. Places are awarded through open competition - withtests being held next month in Munich, Paris, London, Madrid, Rome and Naples,external- with no tuition fees, open to applicants from anywhere in the world and with courses taught in English. There will be 400 students recruited for the autumn, expected to be in the 18 to 30 age range, for courses run in partnership with a Naples university, the University of Federico II. The decision for a computer company to move so directly into education is about self-interest as much as philanthropy. There has been a long-running digital skills gap - and Apple are taking steps to grow their own talent. Computer apps, in the space of less than decade, have become a major source of revenue and jobs. Apple says there are now two million apps available on its online store - and that in Europe alone, the app economy sustains 1.2 million jobs. Apple's academy will double its intake to 400 students in the autumn But there have been repeated warnings of a mismatch between the digital skills needed for such new jobs and the qualifications of those looking for work. It means that unskilled workers are without employment and employers are left without the skilled workers that they need. In the UK, the British Chambers of Commerce recently complained that three out of four businesses were suffering from a ""shortage of digital skills"". The global ""ransomware"" computer hack last week once again raised concerns about the acute shortage of cyber-security skills in many countries. There have been plenty of warnings about this - and IBM's general manager for security, Marc van Zadelhoff, has called for a different approach to recruitment. IBM has an international network of university partnerships for cyber-security projects. But writing in the Harvard Business Review, Mr Van Zadelhoff said filling the skills gap would also mean re-training people without any experience in tech-related areas. Students will spend a year in Naples, learning digital skills for the app economy ""Why are we limiting security positions to people with four-year degrees in computer science, when we desperately need varied skills across so many different industries? ""Businesses should open themselves up to applicants whose non-traditional backgrounds mean they could bring new ideas to the position and the challenge of improving cyber-security,"" wrote Mr Van Zadelhoff. There is also a bigger political dimension to the skills needed for a modern economy - highlighted by the annualOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's Skills Outlook,external, published this month. The economic think tank's report for 2017 focuses on the polarising impact of globalisation - which has increasingly become a target for protesters on the right and left. More stories from theBBC's Global education series,externallooking at education from an international perspective, andhow to get in touch. You can join the debate at theBBC's Family & Education News Facebook page,external. The OECD analysis argues that whether a country is a winner or loser from globalisation will depend on the level of skills in the workforce. If countries have well-qualified, skilled populations, they will be the beneficiaries of globalisation, taking advantage of better jobs, improved productivity, widening markets and digital industries. It identifies South Korea and Poland as examples of countries moving up this value chain - and Estonia, Japan and New Zealand as countries successfully taking advantage of expanding technology sectors. Among major economies, Germany is seen as being more successful in developing skills than the United States. But the big concern is that across OECD countries there are 200 million people with poor skills in basic literacy and numeracy, deeply vulnerable to the forces of globalisation. The global cyber-attack highlighted the need for cyber-security skills These are people who have the reading skills of 10-year-olds - whose job chances are acutely at risk from outsourcing overseas or being replaced by technology. The OECD report identifies Greece as a country that has failed to respond to this challenge. But it also warns that the UK, Australia, Ireland and the United States ""need to watch out"" because the skills in the workforce are no longer ""well aligned"" with the needs of new technology-driven industries. While projects such as Apple's academy are picking the fruit from the top of the tree, the OECD is warning about the dangers of ignoring the reality of life in the low-hanging branches. Andreas Schleicher, the OECD's education director, says there is an urgent social and political need to equip people with training, if globalisation is going to avoid social division. ""Don't expect workers to accept losing their jobs through outsourcing or automation, if they don't feel prepared to get or create new ones,"" says Mr Schleicher.

"The Zedineks go shopping in Germany, saying the same goods are cheaper and better quality than at home Should we expect goods in identical packaging to have the same contents? When communism collapsed in Central and Eastern Europe, previously unobtainable goods flooded the market. Today, the region's shops and supermarkets offer broadly the same food and drink as in the West - a tangible and largely welcome result of global capitalism. But something is dawning on Czechs, Slovaks, Poles and Hungarians: the labels might be the same, but the contents might not be. In a German supermarket, Czech shopper Petr Zedinek holds up a can of tuna fish and leans in close, a conspiratorial gleam in his eye. ""A can of tuna fish,"" he says. ""Yes,"" I reply. I sense a larger point is coming. ""It costs â¬1."" (78p; $1.09) ""Yes."" ""In the Czech Republic it costs about â¬1.50."" ""Aha."" ""The fish here is good quality - whole chunks of it. Nothing like the mush they sell across the border."" Petr lobs several tins into one of the two shopping trolleys pushed by him and his 19-year-old daughter Klara. His wife Sarka is nearby. She looks for yoghurt. Petr steers me to a large refrigerator full of smoked meats. He delves in and retrieves a plastic-wrapped package of sausages to show me the tiny writing on the back. ""Bockwurst. Look at the percentage of meat."" I squint at the numbers: 87%. ""Try finding such sausages with 87% meat in a Czech supermarket,"" he says triumphantly, and tosses several packs into the trolley. I add one for myself. We've driven - Petr, Sarka, Klara and I - about 20 minutes from their home in Modlany, a village close to Teplice. We've come to a small supermarket in the German town of Altenberg, just across the border in Saxony. They make the trip about three times a month. When we finish, the boot of Petr's new Skoda Octavia estate is full. Sarka believes Czech consumers get a raw deal in Europe's food market And it's not just Petr Zedinek and his family. About half the cars in the car park bear Czech licence plates. Inside, the only language I hear is Czech; the only German-speaker is the cashier. In the 45 minutes we spend shopping, Petr bumps into one old schoolfriend and a Modlany neighbour. ""It does sound crazy, driving to another country to do your grocery shopping,"" says Sarka Zedinkova. ""But that's the way it is. And when you compare the products - identical packaging but something completely different hidden inside - I think it's a pretty sad state of affairs,"" she continues. ""Sometimes it seems to me that we're a kind of garbage can for the producers - what's left over, they send to the Czech Republic."" Under EU law, food companies can adapt their products to local tastes, even if the packaging is the same. In all cases the ingredients have to be clearly labelled. But the Zedineks - and hundreds, probably thousands more families - have uncovered what they believe amounts to a conspiracy by some of Europe's food wholesalers. It's not just a vague conviction that food in western Europe usually tastes better. They say identical products - sold in the same packaging under the same brand - are of much poorer quality in Central and Eastern Europe. Food producers are free to adapt their brands to suit local tastes ""Take this iced tea,"" says Czech Agriculture Minister Marian Jurecka, as he flicks through a PowerPoint presentation on his laptop, in an anteroom in the lower house of parliament. The page shows the logo of the sickly-sweet, tea-flavoured drink sold in Europe's supermarkets and petrol stations. ""The packaging on the bottles is identical. So it looks the same in the Czech Republic and Germany. But the Czech one had 40% less natural tea extract,"" he explains, ""and it was more expensive than the German one"". He clicks again. ""Or lunchmeat - the tin in Germany looks exactly the same as the Czech tin,"" the minister went on. ""But the one sold in Germany is made from pork, whereas the Czech one is reconstituted chicken."" The data is from a 2015 comparative study carried out by the University of Chemistry and Technology in Prague. Thirty students sniffed, prodded and tasted 24 products - coffee, cheese, margarine, chocolate etc - sold in identical packaging in Germany and the Czech Republic. The foods were then compared in the lab. Eight of the products - 35% - were demonstrably different in either quality or composition. Minister Jurecka is sceptical about the producers' claim to be catering for different regional tastes. It may not be illegal to sell different food under identical packaging. But it is, he says, immoral. So he and his colleagues from Slovakia and Hungary are gathering data to take to the European Commission. They want the law to be changed to force producers and distributors to stop the practice. The issue has become a priority for the Visegrad group of Central European countries - the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland. Not everyone believes it worthy of so much attention. One Czech commentator complained recently that while leaders in western Europe were focusing their energies on resolving the Syria conflict, or tackling the migrant crisis, governments in Central Europe were fretting over the nut content of spreads. So shouldn't politicians just ignore it and let the market decide? ""I guess the market is already deciding, with us driving across the border every week,"" says Petr Zedinek. ""But I think it's right the state should get involved. At least to some extent. To stop the customer being ripped off."" Does Cadbury chocolate taste different in different countries?

"Relations between Switzerland and Germany have been damaged by the Daniel M row The story could be straight out of a Graham Greene novel, or a James Bond film. The case of Daniel M, a Swiss man arrested by the Germans on charges of spying, has focused attention in Switzerland on the activities of the Swiss intelligence services, the banks and the often awkward relationship between Switzerland and Germany. Daniel M, now detained in Mannheim in south-west Germany, was once a police officer in Zurich, then a security specialist for Swiss banking giant UBS and finally, it is alleged, a spy for the Swiss Federal Intelligence Service (FIS). During the years of Daniel M's multifaceted career, Germany watched with growing irritation as its citizens squirreled their savings away in Swiss banks, in effect - thanks to Switzerland's famed banking secrecy laws - hiding their money from the German tax authorities. At the same time, the Swiss government, faced with globalisation, and Switzerland's need to have good trading relations with the European Union, began to realise that banking secrecy was no longer the economic advantage it may once have been. Former German finance minister Peer SteinbrÃ¼ck criticised the Swiss authorities' slow progress Methodically but very, very slowly, the Swiss government began to dismantle banking secrecy. New laws on money laundering - among the world's strictest - were approved and tax disclosure agreements were discussed with European neighbours. All the while the Swiss banks delayed and objected and Germany ratcheted up the pressure. In 2009, Peer SteinbrÃ¼ck, the then German finance minister, warned that if the Swiss did not behave, Germany might have to ""send in the cavalry"". Nothing could have been calculated to more infuriate the neutral Swiss, who insisted they would not be cowed by threats from what the Swiss sometimes call ""the big canton to the north"". Germany's ambassador to Berne was swiftly summoned for a dressing-down. But the process of killing off banking secrecy continued, helped by massive losses for big banks UBS and Credit Suisse in the 2008-2009 sub-prime mortgage crisis. There were also suggestions that those same banks were still aiding and abetting tax evasion, advising clients to invest in artwork or precious stones to disguise cash and even suggesting they hide diamonds in tubes of toothpaste. Daniel M had previously worked as a security specialist for Swiss banking giant UBS Meanwhile, Germany, impatient for its lost tax revenue, began to buy client information which had been stolen from Swiss banks. The state of North Rhine-Westphalia alone has spent millions of euros on at least 11 CDs containing information on German citizens with Swiss bank accounts. Again, this infuriated the Swiss. Government ministers painstakingly shepherding banking reform through parliament were angry that Germany - instead of waiting for the promised agreement on sharing banking information - had, in effect, walked in and helped itself. For some, it looked as if Mr SteinbrÃ¼ck's cavalry had actually charged. At some point, Switzerland's intelligence chiefs seem to have concluded that the Germans had gone far enough and decided to investigate the theft of data from Swiss banks. Who had stolen it, who was selling it and who was buying it on behalf of Germany? The intelligence service turned to Daniel M, now no longer working for UBS, because - and here is the bizarre twist - he was suspected of dealing with the Germans in stolen banking data. Long before his arrest in Frankfurt, Daniel M had already been arrested in Zurich as part of an investigation into the theft of bank data. What happened during that arrest? Was Daniel M ""turned"" by the Swiss authorities? Swiss defence minister Guy Parmelin said there had been no contact between Daniel M and the intelligence service ""since 2014"" The details are murky, but the Germans allege that, between at least 2012 and 2015, Daniel M - armed with 90,000 euros (Â£76,000) in cash and a prepaid mobile phone - was spying in Germany, hoping to bribe German officials for information, and even trying to plant a mole in North Rhine-Westphalia's finance ministry. Ironically, it appears the Swiss attorney general's office - which had not closed its case on Daniel M - actually gave Germany the information which led to his arrest in Frankfurt on 28 April. Meanwhile, FIS, the agency which is supposed to know everything, knew nothing until the arrest became public. Now it was Germany's turn to be outraged, and Switzerland's ambassador to Berlin's turn to face criticism. Swiss government ministers were once again squirming with frustration and embarrassment. While FIS chief Markus Seiler refused to confirm or deny Daniel M was an agent, Switzerland's defence minister Guy Parmelin told Swiss media there had been no contact between Daniel M and the intelligence service ""since 2014"". Now the case will end up in the courts. Daniel M has hired a high-profile Zurich lawyer, who has demanded that FIS contribute to his client's legal costs. FIS has not responded, leaving the lawyer to threaten that if Daniel M is ""hung out to dry"" by his former bosses in the intelligence service, he may use his court appearance to sing like a canary. Much more intrigue and drama is predicted, and relations between Germany and Switzerland, always a trifle sensitive, are on tenterhooks. The Blick newspaper rejected claims that the affair is ""old news"", insisting ""No way, minister!"" But meanwhile the everyday business between the two neighbours continues. Switzerland and Germanyactually signed that tax disclosure agreement back in 2015:,externalthere is no longer any point in stealing banking data, or spying on those who might buy it. The Swiss foreign minister Didier Burkhalter has suggested the spy scandal is an ""old story"" that should be forgotten. ""No way, minister!"" responded mass circulation Blick newspaper in a furious editorial. The Swiss want answers. Some ask whether their intelligence services were just bumblingly incompetent, or whether they could have been serving the interests of the banks even as elected officials strove to regulate them. Others, remembering that the Tunisian extremist responsible forBerlin's Christmas market attack in which 12 people died,had both a gun bought in Switzerland and a Swiss mobile, are asking why FIS does not concentrate on the more important matter of combating terrorism. The whole affair is now likely to be the subject of a parliamentary inquiry.

"Mohammad Amin, or Meeno, died after being arrested at a party in Saudi Arabia Mohammad Amin was a family man, with a wife, four sons and five daughters. But on 26 February, a contingent of Saudi police who broke up a party of transgender Pakistanis in Riyadh found him in women's clothes, wearing jewellery and make-up, and being addressed by others as Meeno Baji - the last name a customary title for an elder sister. Cross-dressing is not tolerated in Saudi Arabia, so Mohammad and 34 others were rounded up and thrown in Azizia prison. Mohammad died that night. Pakistani activists say he was beaten by policemen with clubs and hosepipes, causing his chronic heart condition to deteriorate. The Saudi authorities were quick to deny the allegations of mistreatment, saying he had a heart attack in custody. Pakistani officials followed suit by accusing him of indulging in ""illegal and immoral activities"". But Meeno's family, friends and some transgender rights activists paint a different picture of the person, and the events of that last night in Riyadh. Meeno was born Mohammad Amin in Barikot town in Swat in 1957 to a family of tenant farmers. He had three brothers and four sisters. At some point during his adolescent years he became a ladies' tailor with a shop in Barikot. Mohammad Amin worked as a tailor for many years But unlike most transgender women from Pakistan's rural hinterland who seek anonymity by leaving home, Mohammad stuck with his family. He married a woman from his tribe in the mid-1980s and a decade later he left for Saudi Arabia on a work visa as a ladies' tailor - a job he held for most of the rest of his life. We can only guess at his real sexual identity. Social taboos prevent his family and childhood friends from speaking openly. Transgender Pakistanis living in fear Transgender community cautiously welcomes marriage fatwa We know, however, that apart from tailoring, Meeno's favourite pastime was to hang out with the area's trans women who lived together and earned a living by dancing at wedding parties or occasional prostitution. These activities led to discussions at home. ""He was not a 'moorata' [local slang for trans woman], but he did keep their company which created occasional tensions in the family,"" says his eldest son, Sar Zameen, who is married with children and also works in Saudi Arabia, as a driver. ""His parents and siblings reprimanded him; we, his children, boycotted him for a while; my mother would argue with him often. ""We would tell him that you are giving everyone a bad name; say your prayers. But he would say he couldn't give up his friends. He was not an angry man, but such talk at home often landed him in a bad mood."" Sar Zameen speaks fondly of his father but says parts of his life remain a mystery Despite this, Sar Zameen remembers his father as a kind and loving person. He put Sar Zameen in an expensive school before he travelled to Saudi Arabia, at a time when he did not have much income. He also kept the house well supplied, and was often around to offer financial support when relatives or neighbours stumbled on bad luck. The family's only complaint, says Sar Zameen, was that ""he never told us how much money he had, though many of his friends knew"". One of those friends, a local transgender woman called Spogmai (not her real name), shines some light on this. ""Meeno spent a lot of money on looking fresh and attractive,"" she said. ""She got an expensive facelift done at a clinic in Rawalpindi, and also took a dozen skin-whitening injections. Besides, she had several laser hair removal jobs done on her face and body. She was a beauty."" Farzana Jan, a trans woman who works with a Peshawar-based transgender rights group, Blue Veins, met Meeno in the late 1990s during the latter's first trip home from Saudi Arabia. Farzana Jan was a dancer then, years before she became a rights activist. ""Meeno came to see me with three other friends. They were in men's clothes but their clean faces, manicured hands and made-up eyebrows gave them away. They were all from rural Swat, mostly tailors. ""They had brought me some gifts. Meeno introduced herself and said Ibrahim Ustad [a locally well-known trans woman who kept an open house for the transgender community in Swat's main city, Mingora] was her guru [guardian, in the transgender community]. ""They had heard that there was a new dancer on the Peshawar circuit, and so they had come to see me. They wanted me to dance for them. When they were leaving, Meeno promised that when she came the next time, she would bring me some fine maxi dresses."" Meeno brought Farzana Jan many precious gifts on her subsequent visits, she says. Farzana Jan, a transgender rights activist, first met Meeno in the late 1990s Those who knew Meeno more intimately say she had another, more secret life which others could guess at but never found out about for sure. Spogmai said that Meeno had a 30-year love affair with a man from her native town, until that man died in 2008. ""Gul Bacha [not his real name] was a 'real' man, with a family of his own, but they were both in love with each other,"" she says. They went to Saudi Arabia together, and lived together in Riyadh. When Gul died of heart failure in 2008, Meeno accompanied his body to Barikot and then did not return to Saudi Arabia for several years. A year after Gul's death, Meeno, then 54, was diagnosed with a heart condition, unusual in a family known for longevity. Spogmai believes Meeno took Gul's loss to heart and that, even though it was not apparent, Meeno's double life was taking its toll on her health. During those years, Meeno would spend a lot of time with her transgender friends. ""We had a niche for ourselves in a photographer's shop in Barikot bazaar. Or sometimes I would call her over to our place in Mingora,"" she said. ""All friends would sit together and chat or have singing sessions. Her health had taken away her voice. She could no longer sing as well as she used to, but she would try."" Meeno tried to keep herself busy tailoring clothes at home. Two of her sons were in Saudi Arabia, which meant family money was still coming in. But then she couldn't take life at home any more - she felt she would be more at peace with herself if she went abroad, says Spogmai. She departed in 2013. Spogmai says that in Riyadh Meeno tried some relationships, but none succeeded. When she came back to Pakistan on her last trip in the autumn of 2015, she told her friends jokingly: ""Your mother remarried, but the guy was not man enough, so we divorced."" She told them there was someone else she had her eye on, though. ""She told us, 'your mother will soon marry again'. 'In which lane this time,' we would quip back, suggesting she had a potential lover in every street of the town."" In February 2016, Meeno headed back to Riyadh for what turned out to be the last time. Farzana Jan, who is popular with the transgender community because of her social work, was kept in the loop by a transgender group who were planning a birthday party for one of the ""sisters"" at a guesthouse in Riyadh on 26 February 2017. On 24 February, she received a call. ""The birthday girl and another one were planning to adopt Meeno as their mother at the party and there was confusion over rituals. They wanted my advice,"" she says. ""They were not planning any music or dance, but some of them did wear women's clothing and jewellery and make-up."" Farzana Jan was alerted by text message to the arrests in Riyadh But then came terrible news. At about 0300 on 27 February, Farzana Jan was awoken by a WhatsApp message from an unidentified caller. It contained a number of pictures of people, some in dresses, their eyes blanked with a pink marker. ""I was puzzled. I replied, asking who this was, and who were the people in those pictures. I then received a voice message stating who the people were and what had happened. I looked at the pictures again, and the faces started to become alive and familiarâ¦"" A Riyadh-based newspaper carried a report of the arrests, but it was Farzana Jan who came out with the claim that the police had tortured everyone at the party and that at least two of them, including Meeno, had been bundled into hessian sacks and beaten with clubs. According to initial reports provided to Farzana Jan by her contacts in Riyadh, both had died, though no evidence of a second body ever emerged. Only Meeno's body was shipped back to Pakistan, in the second week of March. Some transgender rights activists who have been calling for Islamabad to lodge a protest with Riyadh advised Meeno's family to allow a post-mortem of the body in Pakistan but the family refused, thereby foregoing crucial medical evidence. One of those activists, Qamar Naseem of Blue Veins, received the body at Islamabad airport and says he had a chance to open the casket and look at Meeno's face. ""Her teeth were broken and a part of the torn upper gum was hanging loose in her mouth. I took some pictures of the face."" But in the absence of a post-mortem report, that has not impressed the authorities. Meanwhile, the Pakistani Senate has responded to pressure from activists to form a committee to liaise with the Saudi authorities and establish how Meeno died. But few expect a positive outcome - the two states have a ""special relationship"" that harbours no embarrassing spats over citizen's rights. The facts of Meeno's death may never fully be known. But what is clear is she spent her life torn between the necessity of being Mohammad Amin, the husband and father, and an enduring urge to be her other self.

"Online sites like Artfinder are enabling artists to market their works to bigger audiences You don't have to spend millions of pounds to buy an original piece of art. It's no longer just famous names who are selling their works. A growing number of art fairs and online marketplaces mean new artists starting out are also able to reach buyers well beyond their home markets. ""It's just a crazy time at the moment,"" says Alex Rotter, chairman of post-war and contemporary art at auction house Christie's, apologising for his late call. We manage to speak just days before he kicks off the auction house's New York sale of 26 contemporary art works from husband-and-wife property development duo Jerry and Emily Spiegel. This kind of single-owner collection ""gathered with one breath"", as Mr Rotter describes it, is rare. The sale includes famous works by Christopher Wool and Sigmar Polke. With these two pieces valued at $20m (Â£15.5m) each, the 26 works are expected to raise $100m in total. This Sigmar Polke raster dot painting is expected to sell for $20m While the collection is being sold in New York, the top pieces have already been on a mini-world tour - travelling to Hong Kong, London and Los Angeles in a bid to drum up international interest. ""If you commit to buying a painting worth thousands of dollars then you want to see it first,"" says Mr Rotter. Global art and antique sales totalled $57bn last year, down 11% on 2015, with the US dominating the marketplace, closely followed by the UK and China. On a practical level, this means that delicate and often precious paintings have to travel thousands of miles without being damaged. The value of Leonardo da Vinci's Lady with Ermine painting was considered so great that when it was sent from its Polish home to the US, it was reportedly given its own first-class plane seat, as well as an armed guard to make sure it reached its destination intact. While this kind of treatment is exceptional, valuable paintings are typically transported in expensive protective crates complete with detectors to monitor humidity and temperature levels. Paul West, whose landscapes are inspired by his Dorset roots, has sold several paintings overseas British artist Paul West says that when he secured his first sale through online marketplace Artfinder to a buyer in Australia, his initial reaction was a joyous ""yes"", followed by a sinking realisation that he now had to get the piece there safely. In the three years since he joined the website, Mr West has sold around 47 paintings, with almost a third of these to buyers in the US and Australia. He recommends lots of bubble wrap and masking tape, and to tape sponge onto the corners. So far his worst mishap has been a hold-up at customs, which meant a painting took a month rather than a week to reach its destination. For the 52-year-old, selling outside the UK has broadened his opportunities. ""Access to the global market is a massive plus. I was producing work I was pleased with, but apart from art fairs, it was quite hard to be seen,"" he says. Top artists may become famous, but most still struggle, says Artfinder founder Jonas Almgren Artfinder founder and chief executive Jonas Almgren set up the service in 2013. He wanted to provide independent artists such as Mr West, who weren't already represented by a gallery, with a place to sell their work. The online marketplace now features artists from 108 countries, with customers similarly global. Originally a Silicon Valley software engineer, Mr Almgren subsequently spent a decade working in high-end galleries in New York, where a painting under $10,000 was considered affordable. He says his experience taught him that most artists ""just didn't have a chance"" to succeed, and he wanted to change this. The firm charges a 30% commission on all sales, and to address the obvious issue that it's hard to buy something so visual online, funds free returns. Last year the firm sold Â£5m worth of paintings. This year's Affordable Art Fair in London's Hampstead featured a dog portrait booth in response to the rise in demand for professional dog portraiture The company has given him an insight into how global tastes differ. While landscape and abstract paintings are popular everywhere, the UK particularly likes paintings of cats and dogs, he says. In contrast, US buyers prefer portraits and typically buy bigger paintings, probably because they tend to have bigger homes. The pound's current weakness against the dollar also means that US buyers can afford to spend more on UK art. But the most important thing, says Mr Almgren, is that his firm tries to cater for all tastes. ""A gallery always has a very strong taste. We've taken that model and turned it upside down,"" he says. Rise Art uses technology to offer potential buyers recommendations based on what they've previously liked Rise Art had similar ambitions to shake up the existing market. Set up in 2011, the start-up focuses on online sales, with prices from Â£200 to Â£30,000. While online sales remain a small part of the overall global art market - less than 10% -  reports suggest it's a growing area. But founder and chief executive Scott Phillips admits that no matter how good the virtual images are, an artwork ""always looks better in the flesh"". To help buyers' confidence, the site enables them to rent artworks and live with a piece before committing. The firm is much more selective than Artfinder, accepting only 1% to 5% of the artists who apply to sell via the site. Rise Art also charges a higher commission of 40%. Rise Art also holds some ""real world"" exhibitions, such as this one in Hong Kong Mr Phillips says websites like his are part of a new, more sensitive wave of disruptive firms. Unlike eBay and Amazon, which, he says, have commoditised products and been ""a destructive power in some ways"", Rise Art ""celebrates creativity, giving artists a new vehicle for selling and showcasing their work"". While he's cagey on precise numbers, the firm now ships to 40 countries and revenue for the first three months of this year was 110% higher than a year ago. The Affordable Art Fair (AAF) has experienced similarly rapid growth. Since starting out in London's Battersea Park in 1999, it now holds fairs in more than 10 cities around the world. Affordable Art Fair founder Will Ramsay says you don't have to be rich to buy art Founder Will Ramsay says the motivation behind the business was to prove that ""you don't need to be a squillionaire to buy art"". While prices can be as high as Â£5,000 for a single painting, the AAF's average selling price in the UK is Â£600. The firm makes its money by charging the galleries for the space they rent at its fairs, as well as through ticket prices and sponsors. Recently, the firm has started online sales, an area Mr Ramsay sees as complementing the art fairs. He owns two televisions - one to watch the video art he has accumulated and the other to watch normal TV. He says the 130 pieces of art he has collected are ""memories through my life"". ""Don't buy because you think it may go up in value,"" he advises would-be collectors, ""but because you love it and want it on your wall at home.""

"My correspondence with Ian Brady began with a simple question: are you going to apply for parole? Given that he and Myra Hindley had committed the most shocking crimes of modern times, it was hard to imagine either of them would ever be released. The public would surely never accept that they were reformed characters who had paid their debt to society. Yet by 1985, the Moors Murderers had been behind bars for almost 20 years. Time was passing, and perhaps memories would start to fade. So the question of parole was not an idle enquiry. The families of the children they killed were becoming anxious about the possibility that one day they might be free to walk the streets again. Myra Hindley had already begun a long and ultimately futile attempt to win her freedom. She tried in vain to persuade a disbelieving world that she had been coerced into the crimes by Brady. The sullen face of the peroxide blonde, captured in the famous police photograph, continued to stare out from the pages of the tabloid newspapers as each twist of the story was reported. Brady's accomplice Myra Hindley died in 2002 ""She is a good woman,"" Lord Longford told me more than once, as he tried to advance her case for release. A more unpopular cause to champion, it would be hard to imagine. She was without doubt the most hated woman in Britain. Hindley died in prison in 2002, still dreaming of freedom. But back in 1985, little had been heard from Brady, and we could only guess at his intentions. Intrigued, I wrote to him and asked him if he was planning to apply for parole. I did not expect a reply, so the arrival of a letter from Gartree Prison, from prisoner number 605217, came as a shock. As I held it in my hands, unopened, all my memories of the Moors Murders came flooding back. Police searching on Saddleworth Moor in 1965 Merely to mention Brady's name was enough to make anyone alive in the 1960s shudder with horror. He and Hindley abducted and killed their young victims and buried four of them on the bleak moors, high above Manchester. I began my career as a journalist in the North West around that time, and needed no reminding of the story. The sight of police officers digging, searching for bodies, became an indelible memory for my generation. Along with the smiling faces of the children, captured in family snapshots, and the black and white police photographs of their killers - these images were burned into our minds. Few crimes have caused such revulsion, or cast such a long shadow. To many people, Ian Brady was the epitome of evil, a sadist who killed without conscience. If anything, his accomplice Myra Hindley was judged even more harshly, simply because she was a woman. So with all this in my mind, I felt uneasy as I opened the letter. It was short and came straight to the point: ""My position on parole has not altered. I take no part in the annual circus and never shall. It has always been my intention to choose the time and manner of my own death in prison. All I have sought in my twenty years in prison is an active, positive life - unsuccessfully."" Brady later told me he had been given a form to apply for parole, but had refused to sign it. When members of the parole review committee asked to see him, he said he would not talk to them. Brady thought the process was ""a political farce"", but it showed that parole was indeed a possibility. My story appeared on the BBC, and was followed up by the newspapers. And that was the end of it... or so I thought. Little did I know that Brady's brief note was to be the start of a correspondence that was to last more than 30 years. Every few weeks, a new letter would arrive. As the pile grew, they started to give me an insight into the mind of the writer. But ultimately they prompted more questions than answers. From beginning to end, Ian Brady told me only what he wanted me to know. I have often been asked how I could write to such a man. I had vivid memories of the crimes and I suppose I was curious to know more about Brady and what had driven him to kill. As a journalist, I was able to approach the correspondence with a degree of detachment, but at the same time, I could not forget who he was, or what he had done. I was clear in my own mind that he and Hindley should never be released. After Brady's initial letter, I assumed the correspondence would quickly come to an end. But he continued to write to me from his prison cell, letters that were sometimes written in a shaky hand. He seemed under stress, mentally and physically. Despite being a man who was 6ft (1.83m) tall, his weight had fallen to around 8st (50kg). That year, doctors concluded Brady was mentally ill and he was transferred from Gartree Prison - ""the garbage can"" as he described it - to Ashworth high security hospital on Merseyside, where he remained until his death. He was soon receiving drugs as part of his treatment, and his letters became more lucid and more legible. Ian Brady was jailed for three murders in 1966 They ran to many pages, initially on prison notepaper, then sheets of lined A4, the kind with very narrow spacing. They were always written with a ballpoint pen in a very neat hand, words precisely on the lines, with good grammar and correct spelling. He did at least have the benefit of going through the Scottish education system at a time when mastering the three Rs mattered. As I discovered, he was an avid letter-writer, with a wide circle of correspondents, although he wrote to few journalists on a regular basis. I think it helped that I worked for the BBC, rather than one of the tabloid newspapers that wrote endless accounts of his life behind bars. Brady catalogued their inventive efforts: ""The national media allege I organised a Christmas party for the ward. I organised no such party. I ate nothing whatsoever on Christmas Day. There was a ward barbecue this afternoon, hordes of strangers waiting to gawp at the performing monkey, but I didn't take the stage. Several national newspapers allege I invited the Yorkshire Ripper, who is even not in this hospital but Broadmoor. A newspaper falsely states that I go on trips outside. I am in my cell night and day and go nowhere at all."" Yet for all his hatred of the media, it was clear that he was very aware of his status as a high-profile prisoner, and I think he enjoyed the notoriety, and being the centre of attention. So while he railed against the stories about him that appeared on a regular basis in the tabloids, it became part of his wider battle against all those with power over his life. In writing his letters, he certainly knew that what he said was liable to be reported, and he chose his words carefully, with an eye to publication. His relentless character assassination of Myra Hindley undoubtedly caused her great damage as she campaigned for parole. What else did he write about? In large part his letters were a litany of complaints about his treatment at Ashworth - Trashworth in Brady's lexicon. It would not be fair on the staff to repeat his splenetic observations and unsubstantiated allegations, which covered page after page of A4. Writing about life behind bars, he displayed a deep anger, but also an acerbic humour. It was as if he had a special dictionary in his head, reserved for pouring scorn on all those in authority whom he hated. Peter Gould with some of Brady's letters I soon got the impression that battling against the authorities - whoever they happened to be - was an important part of his mechanism for coping with his loss of freedom and life within a highly-regulated institution. But the letters were more than just the paranoid rantings of a madman. I quickly discovered that he did not fit the popular stereotype of the sub-human monster, an image that most of us recognise instantly from crime thrillers on TV, and find strangely reassuring. We do not expect serial killers to live anything approaching normal lives when they are not committing their crimes. They are certainly not supposed to display intelligence or humour. So it was more than a little unsettling to discover that Brady was articulate and surprisingly well read, with a preference for classic literature rather than popular fiction. The Russian writer Dostoevsky, with his explorations of human psychology, was a particular favourite. Brady's letters were sprinkled with literary references that would send me searching through my bookshelves. His knowledge was nothing if not a testament to the education provided by prison libraries. He made sharp observations about politics and current affairs, revealing a close interest in the world outside, a world he knew he would never see again. He had nothing but contempt for the establishment in general, and politicians in particular: ""The Gulf - the Bore War. Thirty countries, including the most powerful in the world, against a third world Arab state, and they call it a victory. Politically, the UK is now to America what Italy was to the Germans; a servile lackey willing to bomb any country the Americans choose. The election... a non-event only of synthetic interest to the media in generating an appearance of democracy and choice, between two Tory parties."" He claimed not to be interested in reading newspapers, but little that was written about him escaped his notice. He also listened to radio news bulletins, and watched television. Several times he told me he had seen me reporting for TV news. Once, I was even talking about him. Fortunately, perhaps, he did not have access to the internet, as he would undoubtedly have seen it as a platform. A lot of the time, he just stayed in his room, read books, and continued his writing. Somewhere, waiting to surface, there is a memoir of his life. He once wrote a book, published in the US, intended to take the reader inside the mind of a serial killer. But significantly, it did not include any discussion of his own crimes. And in his letters to me, he was always reluctant to delve too deeply into the past, unless it was to confirm Hindley's active involvement in the murders. It was as if he was hiding behind a mask that prevented you getting into his head. But there were times when the mask slipped, and you saw hints of an inner turmoil. The Moors Murders victims were left to right, Keith Bennett, Lesley Ann Downey, Edward Evans, John Kilbride and Pauline Reade In 1986, following my correspondence with Brady, the mothers of two of his victims wrote to him. His reaction on receiving their letters was revealing: ""Although I've been given them, I've not been able to bring myself to read them yet. I'm afraid to read them, understand? I have to keep the mental blocks tightly shut and keep control."" The mother of Lesley Ann Downey wanted to visit him in prison. Her request was refused by the authorities, so Brady suggested I pass on a personal message. I was uncomfortably aware that I was becoming a go-between, a part of the story I was reporting: ""You can inform her of what I've told you. Remorse in this and other matters is axiomatic and painfully deep but I despise useless empty words and prefer positive action to balance part of the past."" To my knowledge, it was the only time he ever publicly expressed any regret for what he had done. Perhaps, as he suggests, it was just too difficult for him to confront the reality of his crimes. But he seemed to resent being put in a position where he was expected to express remorse. He was not going to jump through any hoops for the press. The ""positive action"" he refers to was his work in transcribing books into Braille for a school for the blind, something he did for many years. A small act of contrition, perhaps, but one you may not have read about in the papers. Brady and Hindley belatedly confessed to killing two additional children who disappeared in the 60s, and whose bodies had never been found. In 1987, the two killers were taken back to the moors, separately, to help the police to try to find their bodies. Brady found himself back in the media spotlight. ""We stepped onto the moor at dawn. Helicopters and private planes kept circling us and the police seemed determined they would not get any photos. Police kept surrounding me when a low-flying helicopter came at us. Of all hated papers, the Sun got a full-length one, sharp and clear! The moors had changed a lot in my eyes over the 20-odd years that had passed. Many of the changes were real, some imaginary. It was weird seeing the place again, all that space and vastness."" Eventually, the police managed to find the remains of Pauline Reade but, despite many hours of searching, the body of Keith Bennett is still lost on the moors. Was Brady genuine in his desire to help Winnie Johnson find her son? In his letters to me at the time, he seemed anxious for another chance to go back to Saddleworth and complete the search. After a second visit to the moors, in the depths of winter, he insisted that he could have found the boy's grave, given more time: ""The convoy reached the moor around 9am. It was five degrees below zero and covered in frost and ice. The police let me lead the way and go to any spots I wished. After an hour, I discovered the junction of streams I had been searching for. I felt relief and exhilaration, and we all stopped for another hot drink and a smoke. As daylight began to fade, I felt a deep instinct that I was close to something important, some aspect I had overlooked. The search area has now been greatly reduced to an area between a sheep pen and a junction of two streams. I felt a great relief and vindication that I had rectified the crucial mistake. I kept underlining that I know beyond doubt that I've found the area. I'd like to see 40 or 50 police searching the area I've pinpointed. Within 48 hours, the instinctive feeling experienced on the moor in fading light became concrete. I was lying on top of the bed in the dark. An image came into my mind. All along I had been searching purely for a triangular site. But now I was seeing something I had forgotten. I saw Myra walking out of the triangle, but when she reached the apex, she did not climb over it but turned to the right into a curved horn of earth which led upwards. I now have the full image of the site vividly in my head. I do not enjoy struggling through sub-zero wasteland, nor being made a spectacle for the media. The police owe me one last visit there. I owe it to the family involved; it is a debt. I have nothing to gain except inner peace, for the media will crucify me whether I succeed or fail."" Police searching Saddleworth Moor for Keith Bennett's body in 1986 Keith Bennett's mother, Winnie Johnson, travelled to the moors many times beforeher death in 2012, enjoying the peace and solitude. I went with her on one occasion. Looking out across the bleak moorland, she told me that to be there made her feel close to her lost son. It was heartbreaking to watch as she waited, year after year, hoping he would be found. But in the end, the details provided by Brady had not been sufficiently precise to locate the burial place. Did he really know? Winnie Johnson was convinced that he did. Hindley was clearly hoping the search would advance her campaign for parole, by demonstrating her contrition. Her lawyers would later go to the High Court to challenge the power of the home secretary to keep her locked up indefinitely. She did all she could to distance herself from the killings, claiming that she had been forced by Brady into becoming his accomplice. Few people were convinced. The truth is, she had ample opportunity to go to the police and inform on Brady back in the 60s but failed to do so. The case against her was always damning. She drove the car that she and Brady used to abduct children from the streets, and the vehicle was used to transport them to the moors for burial. Even back in the 60s, children were warned by their parents not to go off with strangers. But the presence of Hindley in the car with Brady when they stopped to offer the youngsters a lift must have seemed reassuring. A nice young couple, smiling and joking. Nothing to worry about. Myra Hindley on the Moors in a photograph taken by Ian Brady Criminologists have always been fascinated by the dynamics of the relationship between Brady and Hindley. If they had not met would the crimes have happened, committed by Brady alone? Some have suggested their relationship was a classic folie a deux, a shared psychosis in which a delusional belief is transferred from one person to another. What is clear is that there was some terrible chemistry, involving sex and sadism, that made it work. At their trial in 1966, Brady had seemed to be trying to protect Hindley from the full weight of the law. For several years, they wrote to each other from their prison cells. But the more Hindley tried to minimise her role in the killings in an effort to win her freedom, the more resentful he became. He challenged her claim that she had only taken part in the murders because she was afraid of him. His analysis of their partnership was devastating: ""Myra Hindley and I once loved each other. We were a unified force, not two conflicting entities. The relationship was not based on the delusional concept of folie a deux but on a conscious/subconscious emotional and psychological affinity. She regarded periodic homicides as rituals of reciprocal innervation, marriage ceremonies theoretically binding us ever closer. We experimented with the concept of total possibility. Instead of the requisite Lady Macbeth, I got Messalina. Apart, our futures would have taken radically divergent courses."" For those unfamiliar with ancient history, Messalina became the most powerful woman in the Roman Empire, notorious for her promiscuity, who plotted against her husband, the emperor Claudius. By casting Hindley in this role, Brady gives a clue to the bitterness he came to feel towards his former lover. He regarded himself and Hindley as equal partners in the murders, but she betrayed him and the secret life they had shared. He ridiculed her claims that she was an unwilling accomplice: ""Hindley has crafted a Victorian melodrama in which she portrays herself as being forced to murder serially. We both habitually carried revolvers and went for target practice on the moors. If I were mistreating her, she could have shot me dead at any time. For 30 years she said she was acting out of love for me; now she maintains she killed because she hated me - a completely irrational hypothesis. In character, she is essentially a chameleon, adopting whatever camouflage will suit and voicing whatever she believes the individual wishes to hear. She can kill, both in cold blood or in a rage."" Despite my contact with Brady, the families of the murdered children always received me with courtesy and kindness. Encouraged by my correspondence, some had begun writing to Brady themselves. They saw him as a means of keeping Hindley behind bars. Like so many others, they could not understand how a woman could have helped to abduct and murder children. And in fact, female serial killers are extremely rare. So the families of the children, and the man who killed them, came to form a strange alliance. The families also wanted Brady's help in finding the bodies of the children still missing. I urged him to help the police locate the graves, to allow the families the comfort of a proper burial. The police knew Brady was writing to me but did nothing to hinder the correspondence, perhaps hoping that the letters would reveal useful information. The detective in charge of the case told me: ""He trusts you."" Brady himself said he appreciated reporting that was ""balanced and unsensational"", although I must admit it was sometimes difficult to remain dispassionate. At around the time he was being taken back to the moors by the police, Brady told me that he was responsible for another five murders, or ""happenings"" as he called them. This was tantamount to a confession to a series of hitherto unknown crimes, so I passed the information to the police. With only sketchy details to go on, they were unable to confirm his claims. Did they really happen? Or were they just part of his fantasy world? It was yet another part of the story where the truth would never be known. The trips back to the moors were the only break from the monotony of Brady's daily life in Ashworth Hospital. But there was always something for him to complain about. In 1999, when he was moved to a new ward, he went on hunger strike. He recounted his daily existence: ""I've sat in my room, going nowhere, never having exercised in the open air for 25 years, using every available ""normal channel"" to right matters here these past 15 years, and throughout my 35 years of captivity. I've been taking only sugarless, milk-less tea or coffee, no food. I have no TV or radio and don't read newspapers, though I've been told of some reports. I simply sit writing or reading books most of the time."" When he continued to refuse food, the doctors fed him against his wishes, through a nasal tube. So he went to court, hoping to establish a legal right to end his life. In 2000, a hearing was held in Liverpool, behind closed doors. The tight security meant that the waiting media did not even get a glimpse of him as he enjoyed his day in court. But he got his story out. Brady was taken to Liverpool Crown Court for his 2000 right-to-die hearing Knowing the hearing would be held in private, he had sent me a 5,000-word document, setting out his case. Once again, Brady was the centre of attention, taking on the system. But his arguments failed to convince the judge, and the hospital was told it could continue to feed him, to keep him alive. Then in 2013, Brady finally got the public platform he craved. The media were able to observe him via a television relay as he gave evidence to a mental health tribunal at Ashworth. The picture that emerged was of a man who was paranoid and narcissistic. He wanted to be sent back to prison, where he might have been able to complete his hunger strike without medical intervention. Brady seemed to relish the occasion. He was back in the spotlight, back in the headlines. But once again the decision went against him. The panel ruled that he was mentally ill, and would have to remain in a secure hospital where his condition could be treated. Court sketch of Brady appearing at a mental health tribunal in 2013 During the hearing, Brady refused to answer a direct question about whether he would in fact kill himself if was sent back to prison. In his letters to me, however, he said his life had become meaningless and all he wanted was the opportunity to bring it to an end: ""I have had enough. My objective is to die and release myself from this once and for all. I am not interested in being kept alive artificially by force feeding. My death strike is rational and pragmatic. I am eager to leave this cesspit in a coffin."" Brady considered himself to possess superior intelligence. He found it difficult being surrounded by other patients who were all mentally ill, rather than being able to mix with the diverse characters he had encountered in the penal system: ""In prison I had intelligent company - train robbers, IRA and Arab terrorists, financiers, counterfeiters, gun-runners, drug lords, East End gangsters, ex-government ministers. I played John Stonehouse in the chess final at Wormwood Scrubs. Having spent the past years in the company of criminals and madmen, I have a very unusual circle of friends out there in the free world."" Did Brady ever look back over his life and contemplate how things might have been different? A few years ago, he let me see a letter he had written to his mother. To my surprise, it was a wistful memoir of the happy times they had spent together in his youth. It described in lyrical terms holidays spent in the Scottish Highlands, the sentiments quite at odds with his reputation as a tough kid from the Gorbals: ""When I close my eyes, I re-live childhood holidays in fascinating detail, many forgotten memories surfacing. Remember the low ceilings and oil lamps in the whitewashed Dunning cottage and the late-night cups of Oxo? The honking geese in the courtyard of the farm we stayed at in Tobermory? The red deer standing in the deep green gloom of the deciduous forest; the wildcat I surprised in the high heather hills behind the farm; the wooden bridge in the meadow beside the farm? Naturally I also bring to mind all the other holidays. The many tours up to Scotland by car, the vast spaces and bracing air of the Highlands... enough."" Enough, says Brady. After giving us a tantalising glimpse of happy days during his childhood, he firmly closes the door to the past. He ends the letter with a request to his mother to send me a copy. She was then aged about 90 and living in relative anonymity in Longsight, near the centre of Manchester. Surprisingly, perhaps, she never moved away from the city where her son committed his dreadful crimes. This unexpected glimpse into their life together was startling. Stories about Brady's childhood had painted a picture of a troubled boy who had grown up in a single-parent home, never knowing his real father. As Brady acknowledged himself, the reality of his childhood years seemed to contradict a widely-held view about the roots of violent crime, especially sexual crime: ""It is fashionable nowadays to blame one's faults on abuse as a child. I had a happy childhood."" Why had Brady wanted me to see the letter to his mother? Was he trying to show he was a man with human emotions like everyone else? It inevitably prompts the question of how someone capable of such feelings could become a cold-blooded predator who enticed children away from their homes and families, and then killed them with his bare hands. Saddleworth Moor The happy childhood did not last. As a delinquent youth, Brady got into scrapes with the law, before finding a job as an office clerk. It appeared to offer reasonable prospects, and perhaps the hope of a decent life. But fate took a hand. Working in the same office was a young typist called Myra Hindley. We will never know if things might have been different had they not met, but together they were deadly. Perhaps it was memories of his childhood holidays that drew him to the bleak moorland above Manchester. Just as the Scottish Highlands may have been a welcome relief from the tenements of Glasgow, so the empty landscape of Saddleworth may have offered an escape from the terraced houses and factories of industrial Manchester. Judging by the snapshots Brady took of himself and Hindley on the moors, it was somewhere that he felt happy. But it was also a place made special by the terrible secrets it held, secrets that bound the two of them together. Seeing them posing for the camera, they look like any other young couple who are in love. Until you realise that they include a shot of Hindley standing on the grave of one of their victims. This was the woman who would later claim that she was Brady's unwilling accomplice. The photographs, and a horrific tape recording of their victim Lesley Ann Downey, tell a different story. Given his love of open spaces, how much of a punishment was it for Brady to be confined within the walls of a prison or a high security hospital for so many years? At Ashworth, he refused his right to take exercise in the open air for many years. Another contradiction. Our lengthy correspondence has finally been ended by his death. It is easy to dismiss Brady as an evil monster, who does not deserve an ounce of pity. I have met the families of the children he killed, and seen how he shattered so many lives. They spent years living with the consequences of his crimes. As the mother of Lesley Ann Downey once told me, the families are the ones serving a life sentence. Lesley Ann Downey For nearly 50 years, Brady tormented them. His own life was effectively over when he was convicted at the age of just 28. It was only the abolition of the death penalty just before his trial that saved him from the hangman's noose. He survived, but it turned out to be a living death. I am left with a box full of letters, but I am still little the wiser about what drove him to kill. Ian Brady has finally gone to his grave, having found the death he craved for so long. Many of his secrets have gone with him. He remains the personification of dark forces that we struggle to understand. Â© 2025 BBC.

"In our series of letters from African journalists, novelist and writer Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani profiles the lawyer who brokered the release of 82 women captured by Nigeria's militant Islamist group Boko Haram. When 57-year-old Zannah Mustapha arrived for the handover of the 82 Chibok girls freed from Boko Haram after three years in captivity, a militant read out the girls' names from a list. One by one, the abducted schoolgirls, now women, lined up along the outskirts of a forest near Kumshe town, on the border between Nigeria and Cameroon. Each of them was covered from head to ankle in a dark-coloured hijab. ""I went ahead of the Red Cross. They [the militants] brought the girls to me,"" said Mr Mustapha, the lawyer from Borno state in north-east Nigeria. Mr Mustapha says the girls started singing for joy when they got into Red Cross vehicles He has been mediating between the government and militants for the release of the Chibok girls and for an end to the Boko Haram insurgency. In 2015, President Muhammadu Buhari told the media that his government was willing to negotiate with ""credible"" leaders of Boko Haram for the release of the girls. More than 200 of them were abducted a year earlier from the north-eastern town of Chibok, sparking global outrage. Previous attempts had failed, with different groups coming forward, each claiming to be the militants in possession of the missing schoolgirls. It was Mr Mustapha who succeeded in convincing the Nigerian authorities that this particular group should be taken for what they say, presidential spokesman Garba Shehu told me. The freed women will now have to rebuild their lives ""He had dealt with them in the past and they keep to their word,"" he said. Mr Mustapha's role as a mediator dates back to his founding the Future Prowess Islamic Foundation School in 2007, to provide free Islamic-based education to orphans and the poor. When the Boko Haram insurgency erupted in 2009, the school offered admission to the children of soldiers and government officials killed by the militants, as well as those of militants killed by the state. The 82 met the Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari after they were rescued Mr Mustapha then sought the assistance of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which began providing free meals to the pupils. He also encouraged parents to form an association which would reach out to other widows and convince them to send their children to his school. The ICRC soon extended its humanitarian services to the mothers, providing them free food and other items every month. ""This was at a time when the wives of Boko Haram militants were being arrested and their houses demolished, so Boko Haram saw me and the ICRC as neutral parties,"" Mr Mustapha said. What next for freed Chibok girls? What we know about the abductions The town that lost its girls Torment of a freed Boko Haram 'bride' During the previous government of President Goodluck Jonathan, former President Olusegun Obasanjo visited Maiduguri, the epicentre of the insurgency, to intervene in the escalating crisis. He then set up a group to discuss peace with Boko Haram. Mr Mustapha was included in it because of the relationship he had forged with the families of Boko Haram militants. After the Swiss ambassador to Nigeria paid a visit to the Future Prowess school in 2012, he arranged for Mr Mustapha to go to Zurich and Geneva to receive formal training as a mediator. ""We were already trying to negotiate peace with Boko Haram before the Chibok girls were kidnapped,"" Mr Mustapha said. The initial negotiation was for a batch of 20 Chibok girls to be released. But, as a sign of commitment to their relationship, Boko Haram added an extra woman, whom Mr Mustapha said was their gift to him, hence the number 21. The kidnapping provoked global outrage in 2014 including from Michelle Obama When they were released in October 2016, she was chosen by Boko Haram to read out the names of the other 20 women from a list. Mr Mustapha said the 21 women were lined up and asked by Boko Haram militants if they had been raped. They all said they were not. When a militant approached a woman who was carrying a baby, she said that she was pregnant at the time of her abduction, having got married a few weeks earlier. The baby girl in her arms, she said, was her husband's child. For some reason, Boko Haram, a group that has cultivated a reputation for brutality, wanted it to be known that it was only after the women ""agreed"" to get married that the militants had sexual relations with them. Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani: ""I felt that I have done something that is worth saying to the world that I have done this,"" Mr Mustapha said. This process of lining up the women, pointing at each one and asking the same question, was repeated at the beginning of May when 82 more women were released. One of about seven Boko Haram militants, who accompanied them, went from woman to woman asking: ""Throughout the time you were with us, did anyone rape you or touch you?"" Mr Mustapha said, adding that each of them replied in the negative. None of the second batch of 82 captives came with a child. But one had an amputated limb and was walking with crutches, an injury she sustained, according to what Mr Mustapha was told, during Nigerian military air strikes against Boko Haram. ""You are free today,"" Mr Mustapha announced to the 82 women after all the names were called out. ""They all smiled,"" he said. He believes that their subdued reaction was as a result of the presence of the militants, all armed with guns, some wearing army camouflage uniforms and boots. Mr Mustapha then took some photographs with the women. The militants also had their video camera on hand and recorded the event. ICRC vehicles eventually arrived. ""When I told them to go to the cars, they all ran,"" Mr Mustapha said. ""Immediately they entered the vehicles, they started singing for joy. Some shed tears."" Mr Mustapha has received a number of accolades for his work with Future Prowess School. He was a finalist for the 2016 Robert Burns humanitarian award, given to those who have ""saved, improved or enriched the lives of others or society as a whole, through self-sacrifice, selfless service, hands-on charitable or volunteer work, or other acts"". He was also given a 2017 Aurora Prize Modern Day Hero award, for those whose ""life and actions guarantee the safe existence of others"". However, he described handing over the 82 freed girls to the Nigerian government as ""the highest point in my life"". ""I felt that I have done something that is worth saying to the world that I have done this,"" he said.

"We know that almost three million extra people turned out to vote in the EU referendum. Saying who they are - and what happens if they reappear - is where it gets difficult. One of the most striking features of theJune 2016 referendum on EU membership- apart from the decision to leave itself - was the substantial increase in turnout. Broadly speaking, 2.9 million more people voted in the referendum, compared with theMay 2015 general election. Turnout in England in the referendum was the largest since the 1992 general election; and in Wales since the 1997 general election. Yet we know absolutely nothing about who these millions are. Their gender, age and socio-economic background are all a complete mystery. So too is how they voted. There was a clutch of on-the-day polls among people who had turned-out. But none of these questionnaires was designed to record the unexpected arrival of a great host of additional voters. What we do know, however, is where they appeared on referendum day. Across England, an additional 2.89 million voters crowded into polling stations - a seven point increase on the 2015 general election. In Wales the increase was six points; and in Northern Ireland it was just under five points. Only Scotland registered a small decrease, of just under four points. Among the nine English regions, the greatest increases in turnout mostly occurred in those that delivered the biggest majorities for Leave: Eastern, East Midlands, North East and West Midlands. The exception was the South East region, where the second largest increase - of 8.1% - sat alongside the smallest pro-Leave majority - of 3.6% - across the whole UK. We will never know whether that result reflected extra voters for Remain who narrowed the Leave majority, or extra Leave voters who thwarted a potentially narrow Remain victory there. The seats that could decide the election Where Britain's parties stand on Brexit How many people are registering to vote? Who won where you live, in 2015? Northern Ireland and London - which voted Remain alongside Scotland - saw comparatively small increases in voter turnout. However, the fact that extra voters were most apparent in Leave areas cannot be taken as proof that they were in favour of quitting the EU. Similarly, as tantalising a prospect as it may be, it is not possible to say that they would be more likely to vote for one party over another at an election. The real mystery is whether those additional voters in 2016 will come out again to vote in the 2017 general election - and what difference they could make. It is not known whether or not the extra voters helped the Leave campaign There is no guarantee that they will, given their opting out of the previous general election. Are they people who are totally dissatisfied with the political system and became serial non-voters but were unable to resist the chance to give the establishment a thoroughly good kicking at the referendum? If so, there seems little chance that they will appear again on 8 June 2017. On the other hand, some may be tempted to vote for the party they consider most likely to put the brakes on Brexit; others to support the party they think truly believes in the UK outside Europe. If only we knew a bit more about them. Are you one of the three million who voted in the EU referendum but didn't vote in the general election in 2015? Get in touch to tell us how you made your decision and whether you plan to vote in the election of 8 June.

"Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha purchased Leicester City in 2010 Leicester City owners King Power International have agreed to purchase OH Leuven, the Belgian club says. The second-tier club, located just east of capital city Brussels, narrowly avoided relegation this season. The club's board set a time limit in its search for investment and said King Power ""was the only bidder who made a clear and coherent proposal"". Its directors said the deal ""guarantees the future of the club, both financially and in sporting terms"". OH Leuven were relegated from Belgium's top tier in 2015-16 but said new ownership would provide ""sufficient financial resources to aspire to the earliest possible return"".

"Online sites like Artfinder are enabling artists to market their works to bigger audiences You don't have to spend millions of pounds to buy an original piece of art. It's no longer just famous names who are selling their works. A growing number of art fairs and online marketplaces mean new artists starting out are also able to reach buyers well beyond their home markets. ""It's just a crazy time at the moment,"" says Alex Rotter, chairman of post-war and contemporary art at auction house Christie's, apologising for his late call. We manage to speak just days before he kicks off the auction house's New York sale of 26 contemporary art works from husband-and-wife property development duo Jerry and Emily Spiegel. This kind of single-owner collection ""gathered with one breath"", as Mr Rotter describes it, is rare. The sale includes famous works by Christopher Wool and Sigmar Polke. With these two pieces valued at $20m (Â£15.5m) each, the 26 works are expected to raise $100m in total. This Sigmar Polke raster dot painting is expected to sell for $20m While the collection is being sold in New York, the top pieces have already been on a mini-world tour - travelling to Hong Kong, London and Los Angeles in a bid to drum up international interest. ""If you commit to buying a painting worth thousands of dollars then you want to see it first,"" says Mr Rotter. Global art and antique sales totalled $57bn last year, down 11% on 2015, with the US dominating the marketplace, closely followed by the UK and China. On a practical level, this means that delicate and often precious paintings have to travel thousands of miles without being damaged. The value of Leonardo da Vinci's Lady with Ermine painting was considered so great that when it was sent from its Polish home to the US, it was reportedly given its own first-class plane seat, as well as an armed guard to make sure it reached its destination intact. While this kind of treatment is exceptional, valuable paintings are typically transported in expensive protective crates complete with detectors to monitor humidity and temperature levels. Paul West, whose landscapes are inspired by his Dorset roots, has sold several paintings overseas British artist Paul West says that when he secured his first sale through online marketplace Artfinder to a buyer in Australia, his initial reaction was a joyous ""yes"", followed by a sinking realisation that he now had to get the piece there safely. In the three years since he joined the website, Mr West has sold around 47 paintings, with almost a third of these to buyers in the US and Australia. He recommends lots of bubble wrap and masking tape, and to tape sponge onto the corners. So far his worst mishap has been a hold-up at customs, which meant a painting took a month rather than a week to reach its destination. For the 52-year-old, selling outside the UK has broadened his opportunities. ""Access to the global market is a massive plus. I was producing work I was pleased with, but apart from art fairs, it was quite hard to be seen,"" he says. Top artists may become famous, but most still struggle, says Artfinder founder Jonas Almgren Artfinder founder and chief executive Jonas Almgren set up the service in 2013. He wanted to provide independent artists such as Mr West, who weren't already represented by a gallery, with a place to sell their work. The online marketplace now features artists from 108 countries, with customers similarly global. Originally a Silicon Valley software engineer, Mr Almgren subsequently spent a decade working in high-end galleries in New York, where a painting under $10,000 was considered affordable. He says his experience taught him that most artists ""just didn't have a chance"" to succeed, and he wanted to change this. The firm charges a 30% commission on all sales, and to address the obvious issue that it's hard to buy something so visual online, funds free returns. Last year the firm sold Â£5m worth of paintings. This year's Affordable Art Fair in London's Hampstead featured a dog portrait booth in response to the rise in demand for professional dog portraiture The company has given him an insight into how global tastes differ. While landscape and abstract paintings are popular everywhere, the UK particularly likes paintings of cats and dogs, he says. In contrast, US buyers prefer portraits and typically buy bigger paintings, probably because they tend to have bigger homes. The pound's current weakness against the dollar also means that US buyers can afford to spend more on UK art. But the most important thing, says Mr Almgren, is that his firm tries to cater for all tastes. ""A gallery always has a very strong taste. We've taken that model and turned it upside down,"" he says. Rise Art uses technology to offer potential buyers recommendations based on what they've previously liked Rise Art had similar ambitions to shake up the existing market. Set up in 2011, the start-up focuses on online sales, with prices from Â£200 to Â£30,000. While online sales remain a small part of the overall global art market - less than 10% -  reports suggest it's a growing area. But founder and chief executive Scott Phillips admits that no matter how good the virtual images are, an artwork ""always looks better in the flesh"". To help buyers' confidence, the site enables them to rent artworks and live with a piece before committing. The firm is much more selective than Artfinder, accepting only 1% to 5% of the artists who apply to sell via the site. Rise Art also charges a higher commission of 40%. Rise Art also holds some ""real world"" exhibitions, such as this one in Hong Kong Mr Phillips says websites like his are part of a new, more sensitive wave of disruptive firms. Unlike eBay and Amazon, which, he says, have commoditised products and been ""a destructive power in some ways"", Rise Art ""celebrates creativity, giving artists a new vehicle for selling and showcasing their work"". While he's cagey on precise numbers, the firm now ships to 40 countries and revenue for the first three months of this year was 110% higher than a year ago. The Affordable Art Fair (AAF) has experienced similarly rapid growth. Since starting out in London's Battersea Park in 1999, it now holds fairs in more than 10 cities around the world. Affordable Art Fair founder Will Ramsay says you don't have to be rich to buy art Founder Will Ramsay says the motivation behind the business was to prove that ""you don't need to be a squillionaire to buy art"". While prices can be as high as Â£5,000 for a single painting, the AAF's average selling price in the UK is Â£600. The firm makes its money by charging the galleries for the space they rent at its fairs, as well as through ticket prices and sponsors. Recently, the firm has started online sales, an area Mr Ramsay sees as complementing the art fairs. He owns two televisions - one to watch the video art he has accumulated and the other to watch normal TV. He says the 130 pieces of art he has collected are ""memories through my life"". ""Don't buy because you think it may go up in value,"" he advises would-be collectors, ""but because you love it and want it on your wall at home.""

"This video can not be played Why did Trump give information to the Russians? The reporter who broke the story explains. Donald Trump has once again found himself at the centre of a storm - this time for reportedly sharing ""codeword classified"" information with the Russian ambassador. The information, which related tothe use of laptops on aircraft, is understood to have been passed to the Americans by an ally who had apparently chosen not to share it with Moscow. Mr Trump said he ""had the absolute right"" to tell the Russians ""acts pertaining to terrorism and airline safety"". Any other government employee would probably have lost security clearance, or even be charged under espionage laws. But US presidents enjoy wide latitude in declassifying information under their powers, which means Mr Trump's alleged disclosure was not illegal. As Steven Aftergood, a government secrecy specialist with the Federation of American Scientists, toldthe New York Times,external: ""It is an expression of presidential authority, and that means that the president and his designees decide what is classified, and they have the essentially unlimited authority to declassify at will."" However, Mr Trump could have damaged an intelligence-sharing partnership if he revealed information without permission from the ally who provided it. Russia: The scandal Trump can't shake The verdict on Trump so far Could Trump be guilty of obstruction of justice? The BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner has said: ""There is a golden rule in the world of espionage that when one government supplies intelligence to another it must not be passed on to a third party without permission of the original supplier. ""The reason is simple: it could put the lives of their human informants at risk."" This video can not be played McMaster: 'Trump not even briefed on intel source or method' Eliot Cohen, a former senior State Department official under former President George W Bush,tweeted,external: ""If accidental, it would be a firing offence for anyone else. If deliberate, it would be treason"". However, it is thought that under the US constitution, Mr Trump would have to be helping a country that the US is at war with in order for it to be considered treason. Though US relations with Russia remain strained, the two countries are not at war. Article 3, Section 3 of the Constitution states: ""Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort."" Mr Trump would have to be actively ""levying war"" or providing ""aid and comfort"" to an enemy in order to build a treason case,UC Davis law professor Carlton Larson told Vox,external, but such prosecutions are difficult. This video can not be played When Trump slammed Clinton over classified material What Mr Trump did could theoretically be grounds for impeachment if Congress determined he had violated the presidential oath of office, but that would be a longshot. Mr Trump swore to ""faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States"" and to ""preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States"" to the best of his ability. By sharing highly sensitive information with an adversary foreign government, he could be considered in breach of executing his oath of office,the Lawfare blog pointed out.,external Congress, led by Mr Trump's Republican party, would have to agree that Mr Trump must be removed from office to trigger an impeachment trial. A majority of the House would have to vote for it and a two-thirds majority of the Senate would be required to agree to convict him. It's not unheard of for the White House to reveal classified details to foreign governments, according to David Priess, author of the President's Book of Secrets. President George W Bush had several foreign leaders join him for daily classified briefings, including British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and Russian President Vladimir Putin. But as Mr Priess explains, the CIA prepared special briefing material to ensure nothing was shared that would jeopardise US intelligence. In Mr Trump's case, however, the CIA did not appear to be alerted of his plan to reveal information, according to the Washington Post report. The information is understood to relate to so-called Islamic State, and had been shared by a third party Trump 'shared secret info with Russia' Trump/Comey: What's it all about?

"Canadian star Drake listed seven co-writers on his hit single One Dance For decades, songwriting duos dominated popular music: Lennon and McCartney; Jagger and Richards; Benny and Bjorn. Not any more. A newstudy by Music Week magazine,externalshows it now takes an average of 4.53 writers to create a hit single. The publication analysed the 100 biggest singles of 2016, and found that only four were credited to a single artist - Mike Posner'sI Took A Pill In Ibiza,external, Calvin Harris'sMy Way,external; andtwo,externalseparatehits,externalby rock band Twenty One Pilots. Ten years ago, the average number of writers on a hit single was 3.52, and 14 of the year's top 100 songs were credited to one person, including Amy Winehouse'sRehab,externaland Arctic Monkeys'When The Sun Goes Down,external. This video can not be played Amy Winehouse performs Rehab on Later... with Jools Holland in 2006 The best-selling song of 2016, Drake'sOne Dance,external, needed eight writers - but even that pales into insignificance compared to Mark Ronson's Uptown Funk, which took 13 people to create, leading Paul Gambaccini to brand it ""the most written song in history"". (To be fair, Uptown Funk originally listed a mere four writers, but others wereaddedwhen it was noticed the song bore a resemblance to The Gap Band's 1979 hit Ooops Upside Your Head.) Even solo singer-songwriters like Adele, Taylor Swift and Ed Sheeran, whose identities are deeply ingrained into their music, lean on co-writers; while rock band U2 have been working with hitmakers like Ryan Tedder, Paul Epworth and will.i.am on their new record, Songs of Experience. So why is this happening? Are songwriters increasingly lazy or lacking in talent? Or are they second-guessing themselves in the search for a hit? Just a few of the writers credited on Uptown Funk According to Mike Smith, managing director of music publishers Warner/Chappell UK, it is simply that the business of making music has changed. ""Think back 20 years and an artist would take at least two or three albums to really hone their craft as a songwriter,"" he told Music Week. ""There is a need to fast-forward that process [which means record labels will] bring in professional songwriters, put them in with artists and try to bring them through a lot faster."" Swedish star Tove Lo, who wrote tracks for Girls Aloud and Icona Pop before launching her own career, says ""writing camps"" helped her find her voice as a songwriter. ""Before I signed to Warner Chappell as a songwriter, I wrote by myself and I produced myself,"" she told the BBC. ""But I learned a lot from working with producers who had more of an idea. ""I was always so focused on melody and lyrics. And most of the songs I've written by myself - likeHabits,external- are three chords the whole way through. ""But the build-ups and dynamics, I didn't really know how to get there production wise. The Struts, who produced [my first] EP, they're really good at the dynamics. When I started working with them, I learned how to get that feeling."" This video can not be played MNEK explains how he made his new single At Night (I Think About You) Writing camps are where the music industry puts the infinite monkey theorem to the test, detaining dozens of producers, musicians and ""top-liners"" (melody writers) and forcing them to create an endless array of songs, usually for a specific artist. ""They love to give you a bit of a brief, like, 'This song should be uptempo, sassy, girl-meets-guy,'"" says British singer Dyo, a veteran of camps for X Factor contestants, who is up for an Ivor Novello award this week for her hit singleSexual,external. ""But I just ignore briefs. Briefs are corny. Everyone wants to write good songs. I'm all for writing good songs."" Pop singer RAYE, whose writing credits include Charli XCX and Jax Jones, adds: ""Some writing camps are very weird and factory-like. ""I remember the Rihanna writing camp - they booked out a massive studio, and they'd have a writer in each room, trying to churn out as many songs as they could. ""They're quite weird. There's a lot of pressure - but you do get songs."" Synth-pop band Chvrches avoided the temptation to work with co-writers All this unfettered creativity sounds idyllic, but there is a downside. If you have 13 writers on a song, each of them gets a slice of the royalties when it's purchased or played. And the money doesn't get shared equally, which means lesser-known writers who contribute a line or a lick to a hit song may only get 1% of the profits. And then there's the issue of homogenisation. If the world's biggest artists all employ the same writers, could your dad actually be right when he claims ""all music sounds the same these days""? For Scottish pop band, Chvrches, that's a real risk. ""People don't make albums any more,"" synth player Iain Cooktold BBC News in 2015. ""They make 11, 12 songs, and they put them out as an album but they feel like a greatest hits, or a playlist. ""And maybe out of those 10 or 11 songs, those co-writes that you do, there's a global number one. But it's not yours."" Singer Lauren Mayberry added: ""When I listen to our record, I listen to it and think, 'that has a strong identity.' ""That's something you can't say when it's a record full of co-writes. I think that would just dilute the identity of it."" Beyonce manages to create a sense of ownership, even when she collaborates with dozens of writers Crucially, an artist needs to stamp their identity on those writing sessions - a skill Beyonce perfected on her last two albums, which are intimate and autobiographical despite the huge volume of contributors. British songwriter MNEK, who is one of 13 people credited on Beyonce's hit singleHold Up,external, says the song is essentially a Frankenstein's Monster, stitched together from dozens of demos. ""She played me the chorus,""he told the BBC last year. ""Then I came back here [to my studio] and recorded all the ideas I had for the song. ""Beyonce snipped out the pieces she really liked and the end result was this really great, complete song.""
