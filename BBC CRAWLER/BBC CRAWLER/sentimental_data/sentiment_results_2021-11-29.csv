"Dramatic video of what appears to be an F-35 jet crashing off the Royal Navy aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth has been posted on social media. The footage shows a pilot ejecting as the Â£100m aircraft falls into the sea. A UK F-35 jet crashed soon after take-off earlier this month while the carrier was conducting flying operations in the Mediterranean. The MoD said it was too soon to comment on the footage and efforts were ongoing to recover the aircraft. The footage - shared on Twitter - is extraordinary, and appears to show an F-35 jet approaching the ski jump of an aircraft carrier as it prepares  to take off. Allow Twitter content?

Instead of gaining speed, the jet slows down as it reaches the ramp and the aircraft topples into the ocean. The video - which appears to have been recorded from one of the carrier's own surveillance  cameras - then shows a  pilot ejecting from the aircraft. Seconds after the jet disappears from view, a parachute can be seen floating down towards the sea just in front of the 65,000-tonne ship. Investigation after UK F-35 fighter crashes in sea Earlier this month, the Ministry of Defence confirmed that a crash had taken place and said the pilot was recovered safely. In a statement on Monday night, the MoD said it was aware of a video circulating online but said it was too soon to comment on the potential causes of the incident. That investigation is still continuing - as are efforts to recover the aircraft. It has been speculated that the crash might have been caused by an engine cover being mistakenly left on the jet. There is also now likely to be another investigation into how this sensitive video was released online. The aircraft are Britain's most advanced and expensive jets. They can land vertically, similar to the Harrier Jump Jet, and combine radar-evading stealth technology with supersonic speeds. Jets from HMS Queen Elizabeth previously participated in missions over Iraq and Syria. The F-35s are operated by the renowned 617 Squadron, known as the ""Dambusters"". Built by the US firm Lockheed Martin, the UK's F-35s are the B variant of the jet and are flown by pilots from the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy, based at RAF Marham in Norfolk.

"Rebecca and Paul Murray were grateful for warm food in Torphins After three nights without electricity, residents in the parts of Scotland worst affected by Storm Arwen are growing weary. In Torphins, Aberdeenshire, people are struggling to keep warm in sub-zero temperatures and are grateful for the hot food handed out by local good Samaritans. Among them are Paul and Rebecca Murray, a father and his daughter, who are relying on the heat provided by a single gas heater. ""It's been pretty horrific,"" Rebecca told BBC Scotland. ""The power went off on Friday. I live in a little council house and I'm a single mum of a three-year-old. In our house you can see our breath. ""Thankfully I could go round to my mum and dad's house and they've got a gas heater, but aside from that we just had nothing."" Thousands facing fourth day without power Hundreds of seal pups killed in Storm Arwen Storm Arwen wind damage and snow in pictures Paul and Rebecca have no phone signal to contact anyone and on Sunday there was no water. ""It's absolutely terrifying,"" Rebecca said. They've not been told by their energy provider when the power will be restored. ""I don't think they know themselves,"" said Paul. ""They're just trying their best to get it put back on."" Fiona Fyfe is worried about the possibility of a fourth night without power Fiona Fyfe said she was initially told the power would be restored on Friday night, but it has been repeatedly postponed. Energy firm SSEN has now told her they hope to get her power back by 22:00 on Monday. ""I don't think we can go another night without power,"" she said. ""It's been really, really cold. We're lucky, we've got a stove and lots of logs but obviously with more snow, it's just maddening, absolutely maddening."" She said that food in her freezer is starting to defrost and she has to walk to the main road to get signal on her phone. Andrew Hutcheon is among those dishing out hot food and drinks in Torphins. He runs Cafe 83 in Kemnay. ""Yesterday back in Kemnay, we didn't have any power, the signal was down so we decided to throw the barbeque on, find some hot water, get some heat into people and get a feed into them,"" he said ""It's a bit of dire situation but everyone who's coming to us is more upbeat because obviously they're getting some hot food and hot drinks."" He said the crews working to restore power have an ""unbelievable"" task ahead of them. ""Over the years we've obviously had a bit of wind but it's never been anything like this - the amount of trees that are down in the forest, I've never seen anything like that,"" he said ""Coupled with the freezing weather and the snow, it's not ideal."" Debbie Martin said the dirty dishes are piling up as they have no way to wash them properly Meanwhile in Aberfeldy, in Perth and Kinross, Debbie Martin has bought a second-hand generator after recently switching to fully-electric heating. She has been told she could be without power until 11:00 on Tuesday because it is still too dangerous to remove trees which have fallen on to power lines. She told the BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme: ""You can't do the things you would normally do. ""You can't brush your teeth because your toothbrush is flat. You have to drive round in the car to charge your phone. ""To boil the kettle, I've been putting it on the log burner stove and it's been taking an hour and a half."" Boiling a kittle on her wood-burning stove takes 90 minutes ""When you get a power cut, you just assume that it's going to come back on in an hour or two, but obviously it hasn't,"" Debbie said. She said it's been ""really difficult to get information"" from her energy provider SSE. ""Everything in our house is electric. We've got an electric heating system, an electric cooker,"" she added. ""We bought a second-hand generator in Dundee yesterday, so we've gone round a couple of neighbours' houses to get their phones and iPads charged because people can't contact relatives."" Kenny Anderson, from Castle Fraser in Aberdeenshire, is used to power cuts having lived in rural north-east Scotland all his life. But he says the damage wreaked by Storm Arwen is the worst he has known in more than two decades. He told the BBC: ""Our power went off at four o'clock on Friday afternoon. We're a bit lucky in that we've got a gas hob because we get two or three power cuts a year. ""They only usually last a few hours, or maybe a day. So this is the longest one we have had in 23 years."" ""I was brought up in Glenlivet in the 60s and 70s and I don't remember power cuts ever lasting more than a day or two.""

"Hot food and drink is being provided in Torphins Thousands of people have spent a fourth night without power in the wake of Storm Arwen. The north-east of Scotland remains the worst hit, with police declaring a major incident in the area due the widespread disruption. Areas of Moray, Angus, Perthshire, Dumfries and Galloway and the Borders are also affected. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said the complexity of the recovery ""cannot be underestimated"". Energy provider SSEN said the storm had caused ""catastrophic damage"", three times greater than that caused by the Beast from the East in 2018. How people are coping with the lengthy power cuts It said on Monday evening thatpower had been restored to 103,000 customers, but 17,000 remained without,external. About 9,500 homes in Killin, Perthshire, and Alford and Aboyne in Aberdeenshire had been reconnected on Monday morning. A further 7,000 properties in Braemar, Ballater, Torphins, Comrie and other areas were reconnected throughout the day. However SSEN warned that some places would not see power restored before Tuesday - and some localised faults would take even longer to repair. It advised customers in this situation to make alternative arrangements if possible. Rest centres were set up and hot food and drinks are being supplied to people, many of whom have been without electricity since Friday afternoon. Power lines were brought down by trees, including in Ballater Aberdeenshire Council chief executive Jim Savege told the BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandit had been a ""pretty tough"" time for the area. He said schools would be closed on Monday and Tuesday and they would be checked for storm damage. Vaccination clinics in Aberdeenshire were also cancelled on Monday. The Scottish government's resilience room, chaired by the deputy first minister, met on Monday afternoon. Mr Swinney urged people in need of support to contact their local council. He said: ""It is good to see that some progress is being made across the country as power is restored. ""While we are hopeful for a further recovery as soon as possible, the scale and complexity of the situation cannot be underestimated. ""Many people are still without power and water, and that's why local authorities and partners are stepping up welfare support in affected areas for those who need it."" On Monday evening, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said his thoughts were with those still facing disruption. He added: ""The situation in the north-east of Scotland is among the most concerning and, while forecasts are improving, we are on standby to provide further assistance to the Scottish government."" SSEN engineers are pictured just north of Kirriemuir Mark Rough, director of customer operations at SSEN, said: ""Storm Arwen has resulted in some of the most significant and challenging conditions experienced in the north of Scotland in decades, resulting in catastrophic damage to several overhead circuits with multiple instances of damage which need to be repaired before power can be restored. ""The damage caused by Storm Arwen is at least three times greater than we experienced from the Beast from the East storm in 2018, demonstrating the scale of challenge our teams have faced."" SSEN has been working to restore power in the following locations: Aberdeenshire: Braemar, Ballater, Kintore, Fyvie, Rothienorman, New Deer, Dyce, Methlick, Tarland, Blackburn, Forgue, Hatton, Cuminestown, Dunecht, St. Cyrus and Fettercairn Moray: Duffus, Alvah, Deskford, Collieston, Boyndie, Dufftown Angus: Maryton, Monikie and Edzell Perthshire: Milnathort, Grange, Braco and Glencarse Elsewhere, SP Energy Networks - which covers central and southern Scotland - said on Monday afternoon that it still had about 4,500 homes without supplies. The areas most badly hit are in the Borders, Dumfriesshire, Fife and the Lothians. It said the damage to the network was some of the worst it had experienced in more than 15 years and apologised to anyone affected. The company added it would be offering accommodation to vulnerable customers if it could not restore supplies overnight. A number of schools in Dumfries and Galloway have been shut due to heating or power failures. They are all expected to reopen on Tuesday. Scottish Borders Council has set up drop-in centres to provide soup, meals and hot drinks in Duns, Innerleithen, Hawick and Earlston. Scottish Water said it was continuing work to restore water supplies to customers across several areas in Aberdeenshire, Tayside and Perth, where about 1,500 properties remained without. The main areas were Aberchirder, Lumsden, Rhynie, Lumphanan, Torphins, Fortingall and Fearnan. Network Rail Scotland said signalling issues been restored on the East Coast Mainline and it was working with operators to reintroduce impacted services. Meanwhile, hundreds of seal pups werekilled at a nature reserve in the Scottish Bordersduring Storm Arwen. The National Trust for Scotland (NTS) - which operates the site at St Abb's Head - said there were 224 dead pups in the water at a bay at Pettico Wick, with more washing ashore. Forestry and Land Scotland has urged people not to visit its forests until checks for the level of damage and safety assessments have been carried out. A queue for hot food and drinks at a welfare van following a power cut in Aboyne, Aberdeenshire. In the Aberdeenshire village of Kemnay a local cafÃ© took hot drinks, soup and mince pies to a nearby care home. ""The power's been off since four o'clock on Friday,"" said Andy Hutcheon, manager of Cafe 83. ""Many of the care home residents are our customers and they've been huddled in the reception trying to stay warm. They were delighted to see us."" The cafÃ© also set up a barbeque outside for any other locals who needed a drink or food. ""There's no heating and no-one has a phone signal - so it's been pretty dire,"" he added. Across the UK, three men were killed by falling trees during the storm, which triggered the Met Office's highest red level storm warning. The 35-year-old driver of a pick-up truck was fatally injured on Friday afternoon in Aberdeenshire. Have you been experiencing a power cut since Storm Arwen?

"Labour's top team walked to Tuesday's shadow cabinet meeting Sir Keir Starmer has appointed Yvette Cooper shadow home secretary, in a wide-ranging reshuffle of Labour's top team. In other moves, David Lammy has been promoted to shadow foreign secretary, replacing Lisa Nandy. Ms Nandy takes a new role scrutinising Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove. News of the appointments came several hours after the reorganisation began on Monday morning, during a speech by Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner. Ms Rayner appeared to be blindsided by the news and told reporters she didn't know the details of the reshuffle or the timing of it. A source close to the Labour leader said Ms Rayner was told a reshuffle would be taking place on Monday. Speaking to the BBC, Ms Nandy said: ""The gaffer picks the team, that's how it goes and that's how it has always gone... frankly, I couldn't care less about the circus of who's in, and who's out, who's up, who's down, who knew, who didn't."" The new Labour shadow cabinet met on Tuesday morning. Dodds out in Labour's post-election reshuffle Reshuffle delay leaves questions over Starmer team Ms Cooper replaces Nick Thomas-Symonds, who takes over as shadow international trade secretary from Emily Thornberry. Elsewhere, Ed Miliband retains his role over climate change policy, but loses his shadow business secretary role to Jonathan Reynolds. Wes Streeting is promoted to shadow health secretary, handing him a key role in scrutinising the government's response to the pandemic. The 38-year old, who recentlyrecovered from cancer surgery, replaces Jonathan Ashworth, who becomes shadow work and pensions secretary. Louise Haighleaves her post as shadow Northern Ireland secretary, replacing Jim McMahon as shadow transport secretary. It comes after she made headlines earlier this month when she said Labour should be neutral if there was an Irish unity referendum. She will be replaced in the role by Peter Kyle, who is promoted from his former role as shadow minister for schools. Sir Keir said the reshuffle would give him a ""smaller, more focused shadow cabinet that mirrors the shape of the government we are shadowing"". ""I look forward to working with the new team to show we are once again a serious party of government,"" the Labour leader added. The reorganisation is the second big shake-up of Sir Keir's shadow ministerial team since he took over as Labour leader last year. His first, after May's national and local elections, triggered an internal row when Sir Keir attempted to remove Ms Rayner from her roles as party chair and national campaign co-ordinator. Sir Keir cannot remove her from her main role as deputy leader, as she was elected into this position by party members. Although Ms Rayner eventually lost both roles, she was given two new shadow cabinet titles following a backlash inside the party. Technically Lisa Nandy's move from the Foreign Office brief is a demotion. But Starmer's team says they want her to be more prominent and visible in taking on Michael Gove on ""levelling up"" - the promise to equalise opportunity across the country, and the government's main mantra. A bigger job goes to David Lammy, replacing her in taking on Liz Truss. Along with the return of Yvette Cooper to the front bench as shadow home secretary, the hope is that this reshuffle combines making the best of Labour's experience and the young, bright things of the future. It's certainly likely to create some SW1 box office face-offs between Yvette Cooper and her counterpart Priti Patel. Read more from Laura Ms Cooper, who will now face Home Secretary Priti Patel across the despatch box, previously held the role of shadow home secretary for over four years under Mr Miliband, when he was Labour leader. First elected in the 1997 Labour landslide, she held several ministerial positions under former PMs Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. The reshuffle was criticised by former shadow chancellor John McDonnell, a key ally of former leader Jeremy Corbyn. He tweeted: ""Reviving the careers of former Blairite ministers and simply reappointing existing shadow cabinet ministers to new posts does give the impression of Christmas Past, not Christmas Future."" In other confirmed moves: Bridget Phillipson is promoted, replacing Kate Green as new shadow education secretary Emily Thornberry will become shadow attorney-general Jo Stevens moves from shadow culture secretary to become Welsh secretary, replacing Nia Griffith Lucy Powell becomes new culture secretary, with Ms Nandy taking over her former role on housing policy Jim McMahon becomes shadow environment secretary, replacing Luke Pollard Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting 'I have nothing to go back to' - BBC reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Trump avoids prison or fine in hush-money case sentencing LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"Supermarket giant Asda said it has chartered its own cargo ship to ensure shelves are fully stocked with key festive products this year. It said the move would prevent a shortage of toys, clothing and gifts during the busy Christmas period. Asda blamed supply chain problems that have hit other retailers and made it harder to source goods from abroad. John Lewis in the UK and Costco and Walmart in the US have all chartered ships to protect their stock. It comes as Asda reported that like-for-like sales fell by 0.7% in the three months to 30 September compared with the same period last year. ""This is the first time Asda has chartered its own ship and we have done so to navigate the industry-wide supply chain challenges and to make sure there is enough stock on the shelves for customers this Christmas,"" a spokesman told the BBC. John Lewis charters ships to save Christmas What's in short supply and why? He said the ship has 350 containers carrying a range of products including festive decorations, party and celebration supplies, toys, gifts and clothing. The boat set sail from China and will arrive in the UK in early December. Asda has struggled with shortages of some foods this year due to the national driver shortage. But it said it was taking measures to protect its Christmas food ranges, including stocking more turkeys and pigs in blankets in store compared to last year. It is also keeping extra stock in depots such as mince pies, confectionary, Christmas cakes and puddings, and has recruited 15,000 temporary staff to work during the busy Christmas period. Like other retailers, Asda faced shortages of some goods in October due to the national driver shortage In September, John Lewis said it was chartering a fleet of extra ships, along with a number of other businesses, to make sure it has Christmas stock on time. Boss Sharon White blamed a shortage of shipping containers which had made it tough - and expensive - to get a space on cargo ships travelling from various parts of the world. Asda - which was recently bought by the billionaire Issa brothers - said the fall in quarterly sales reflected unusually high demand in the same period last year when people were eating more meals at home due to Covid curbs. However, its rivals Tesco and Sainsbury's have both reported higher sales in the third quarter. Asda said customer habits that emerged in the pandemic had remained, with demand for its online delivery service still 80% higher than pre-pandemic levels. It added that the lockdown trend of customers treating themselves to premium own-label products had also continued. What's in short supply and why? Ros Atkins Onâ¦ Global supply chain disruption.

"Geograph volunteers have captured many of Britain's remotest locations, such as St Kilda When Anne Burgess isn't skiing or flying a glider, you are likely to find her roaming around some of Scotland's remotest locations, camera and map in hand. The retired tourism officer from Fochabers in Moray is one of an army of volunteers whose mission is to capture and document rural and urban locations and share free-to-use images with the public. They form a unique online community project calledGeograph,external, a charity which aims to collect ""geographically representative"" photographs and information about every square kilometre of Britain and Ireland. A steam train pictured in Worcestershire Since 2005, more than 13,000 contributors have submitted seven million pictures covering 281,000 Ordnance Survey (OS) grid squares. They include landmarks, landscapes and urban environments - everything from cemeteries and castles to monuments and old factories - even motorways, railways and dilapidated housing estates. Many of the volunteers, including Anne, happily describe themselves as ""map nerds"", poring over OS maps in order to find new and tough-to-reach locations. But photography is also an essential part of the project. Anne says in the past 16 years, she has submitted more than 40,000 images to the Geograph website. ""I've been taking photos all my life,"" she says. ""There are so many wonderful places around Scotland and you can find plenty of interesting things to photograph almost anywhere."" Anne Burgess has submitted tens of thousands of pictures to the Geograph website There's a competitive element to the process too, as contributors earn points (but not prizes) for their efforts. The highest number of points are awarded to those who find grid squares which have never been covered. Each member of the Geograph family has his or her own reason for being part of the project. Devon-based journalist Lewis Clarke says he likes ""to document history and changes in the landscape"". Lewis Clarke is pictured out and about on his quest to chase grid squares for the Geograph site Since 2009, he's uploaded more than 80,000 images, ranging from the M5 motorway to rolling countryside and city scenes. He's even captured a number of fires and floods during his time. ""Geograph is definitely not a collection of pretty photos - albeit there are many photos uploaded which are very impressive - but it is a place to record history. ""I enjoy taking photos for future generations, of places which will soon become developed and construction sites."" Lewis Clarke took this image of the Mayfield lavender fields in Surrey He adds: ""I've had people get in touch from across the globe asking if they can use images of mine in textbooks, for displays, in media online, and most recently on an episode of the BBC'sSaving Lives at Sea. ""In my mind, it proves that every image you take may have some use to somebody somewhere, even if you're never quite sure what it is at the time."" The Hurlstone Point Gull Hole in Somerset Lewis admits that he gets some stick from family and friends for his hobby. ""My mum compares my obsession with trying to grab (grid) squares as nerdy, and akin to trainspotting. ""When in Germany taking photos out of a car windscreen for the German equivalent site, my friend had to explain to our international friends that I was doing it because 'I was a bit weird'."" Fabian Musto says Geograph has helped him deal with autism and social anxiety Fabian Musto, who joined four years ago at the age of 13, says Geograph has brought him a sense of contentment. ""Geograph has helped me deal with autism and social anxiety, since walking in tranquil countryside places makes me feel at ease as I find it difficult to cope in loud and busy environments,"" the Herefordshire resident explains. ""After completing a walk in the countryside or a trip to castles and churches, I feel happy to look back on my photographs and treasure memories of the visits for a long time."" A shopping precinct in Leominster An avenue to an Elan Valley aqueduct in Herefordshire Chemistry teacher Richard Webb, a Geograph veteran, says anyone joining the project would be contributing to a national archive and helping to provide a major resource, especially for education. ""Geography covers a lot of things and overlaps with our courses in many ways - agriculture, petrochemicals, industrial planning, the environment,"" he says. ""It is a particularly good resource when covering other subjects. Usually you can find relevant and often local images quickly for any subject."" A stunning view of Green Kaims in Aberdeenshire Scotland-based Richard, who acts as a moderator of the Geograph site, says contributors share certain things in common, including an enjoyment of the outdoors lifestyle - and a love of maps. ""Almost all contributors are into maps in some way. You have to be comfortable with the national grid and reading maps to find contributing easy, which explains why it is a bit of a niche activity. ""However technology has made that aspect a lot less daunting."" Gannets seen flying around the Bass Rock in the Firth of Forth A beach on Ulva in the Inner Hebrides Richard is among the most travelled of the Geograph community, having visited sites as far apart as the Bass Rock in the Firth of Forth, Foula in the Shetland islands, County Mayo in Ireland and ""the far flung corners of England while travelling to cross-channel ferries"". He adds: ""Mostly my pictures are taken in places where I would be anyway doing outdoor stuff - hills, wilder places and the coast - especially islands. ""When I go out deliberately to take photos, I am usually drawn to urban and industrial areas where there are so many interesting subjects."" Richard Webb has documented housing estates, including flats at Greendykes in Edinburgh before they were demolished Geograph has so far mapped about 85% of Britain and Ireland's grid squares - some many times over the years - although there are places that have proved to be inaccessible, such as military sites. Richard explains: ""I don't think there are any uncrackable grid squares. ""I have managed a fair few awkward ones myself. Frustratingly enough, I have visited several undocumented squares at Porton Down but was not allowed to photograph them. ""Surely someone on the inside could send in a close-cropped bit of rabbit-mown grassland to us without any security implications?"" He adds: ""Most of the remaining unvisited squares are reasonably accessible - it just requires commitment to travel to them.""

"Dramatic video of what appears to be an F-35 jet crashing off the Royal Navy aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth has been posted on social media. The footage shows a pilot ejecting as the Â£100m aircraft falls into the sea. A UK F-35 jet crashed soon after take-off earlier this month while the carrier was conducting flying operations in the Mediterranean. The MoD said it was too soon to comment on the footage and efforts were ongoing to recover the aircraft. The footage - shared on Twitter - is extraordinary, and appears to show an F-35 jet approaching the ski jump of an aircraft carrier as it prepares  to take off. Allow Twitter content?

Instead of gaining speed, the jet slows down as it reaches the ramp and the aircraft topples into the ocean. The video - which appears to have been recorded from one of the carrier's own surveillance  cameras - then shows a  pilot ejecting from the aircraft. Seconds after the jet disappears from view, a parachute can be seen floating down towards the sea just in front of the 65,000-tonne ship. Investigation after UK F-35 fighter crashes in sea Earlier this month, the Ministry of Defence confirmed that a crash had taken place and said the pilot was recovered safely. In a statement on Monday night, the MoD said it was aware of a video circulating online but said it was too soon to comment on the potential causes of the incident. That investigation is still continuing - as are efforts to recover the aircraft. It has been speculated that the crash might have been caused by an engine cover being mistakenly left on the jet. There is also now likely to be another investigation into how this sensitive video was released online. The aircraft are Britain's most advanced and expensive jets. They can land vertically, similar to the Harrier Jump Jet, and combine radar-evading stealth technology with supersonic speeds. Jets from HMS Queen Elizabeth previously participated in missions over Iraq and Syria. The F-35s are operated by the renowned 617 Squadron, known as the ""Dambusters"". Built by the US firm Lockheed Martin, the UK's F-35s are the B variant of the jet and are flown by pilots from the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy, based at RAF Marham in Norfolk.

"This video can not be played The appearance of the Omicron variant sparked Mark Drakeford's concern The first minister has urged people to ""think carefully"" about whether to meet vulnerable relatives over Christmas. Mark Drakeford said people must ""take precautions"" amid concerns over the Omicron variant of coronavirus. A senior official said it was inevitable it would be found in Wales. It comes as Welsh ministers are considering whether further restrictions are needed, but Mr Drakeford said there were no plans to close businesses. On Monday he and Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called for everyone arriving in the UK to have to isolate for eight days. But that was rejected by Downing Street. Six Omicron cases were found in Scotlandon Monday, taking the UK total to 11. Four of the cases in Scotland were identified in Lanarkshire, as well as two in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde areas. Overseas travellers to Wales to require PCR tests How worrying is the new Covid variant? Omicron: Will new measures against variant work? Two cases in Nottingham and Essex have been linked to travel to southern Africa. The third person confirmed to have the new variant is no longer in the UK, but had visited Westminster. Early evidence suggests Omicron has a higher re-infection risk than previous variants, but it is not yet known how it impacts the effectiveness of vaccines. Boosters should be offered to over-18s tohelp stop a possible Covid wave driven by the Omicron variant, UK government advisers have said. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) wants the minimum gap between the second dose and booster to be cut to three months. It said boosters should be given to the most vulnerable first. The JCVI wants those aged 12-15 to be invited for a second jab three months after their first. It recommended severely immunosuppressed people should be offered a fourth dose of the vaccine as a booster. They are currently receiving three jabs. In a statement Health Minister Eluned Morgan backed the advice. ""All individuals who are eligible for a booster will automatically receive an invitation to attend an appointment when it is their turn,"" she said, adding that there will be a ""significant number of vaccination appointments issuing over the coming weeks"". Recent Covid figures in Wales show a continuing downward trend, with cases at 490 per 100,000 people over the past seven days. Nine more deaths were reported on Monday, bringing the total to 6,391. There were 567 patients with Covid in hospital beds in Wales on Friday, down from 653 the previous week, with 47 patients being ventilated in critical care beds - down from 57. Wales' chief medical officer said Omicron took off very quickly in South Africa, in a population which had a fairly high degree of immunity Ms Sturgeon and Mr Drakeford wrote to the prime minister on Monday calling for an emergency Cobra meeting as soon as possible. ""The emergence of Omicron poses a potential threat to the UK,"" they said. ""We need to work collectively - and effectively - as four nations to take all reasonable steps to control the ingress of the virus to the country and then to limit its spread."" They said the day eight PCR test for travellers arriving in the UK should be reinstated, ""requiring isolation for that whole period"". The pair also called for business support schemes to be funded by the UK government's Treasury ""in the event more interventionist measures are required"". ""We do not want to be in a position again where our public health interventions are negatively impacted by a lack of financial support, but can be switched on as required for England,"" they said. Downing Street responded saying it does not have plans to introduce the requirement for passengers to take a PCR test on day eight as well as day two on their return to the UK. The prime minister's spokesman said: ""We believe the approach we've taken is the proportionate one to the evidence we currently have available. ""Introducing further isolation and testing requirements would have a detrimental effect on the travel industry and those planning to go travelling."" He added ministers were not planning to change their approach with regards to the furlough scheme either. The Welsh government is considering whether further restrictions are needed - but there are no plans to close businesses Health Minister Eluned Morgan told BBC Radio Cymru's Dros Frecwast programme that ministers would discuss whether Wales will need stricter measures ""over the next few days"", including whether to close schools earlier for Christmas. Mark Drakeford later said that there are no plans to close businesses - despite the call for financial support from the Treasury. He said people should approach Christmas ""in the way that we've advised all the way through"". ""Christmas should be different this year. Christmas should be better this year. ""That doesn't mean that people should neglect those simple things that we can do in our own lives, that still help to protect ourselves and others. ""Those simple precautions: think about vulnerable people, if members of your family are particularly likely to suffer from coronavirus - think carefully about whether you visit them or involve them in your plans. ""Take a lateral flow test if you're going to visit somewhere where you might be at risk or others are at risk wear masks in crowded public places."" Dr Atherton said it is a ""matter of buying time"" with the new variant, saying it was a case of when not if the variant will be identified. ""Our best line of defence against this still is vaccines and social distancing, those things that we know keep us safe because they can reduce the transmission of this new variant in the community whilst we understand the implications of it."" ""My expectation is that this will probably take off, we will see cases in Wales - we haven't seen any yet but I do expect us to see cases, they will probably increase. ""And my anxiety is also about January and February next year, because it does take time for these things to take off."" ""The Omicron variant does give us further cause for concern and the reason for that is that there's so much that's unknown. ""We don't know whether it will lead to more harm than the Delta variety and if it does then hospital rates could go up. So we just need to be cautious for the moment, not to throw caution to the wind"". Face coverings and social distancing are the best things people can do to keep themselves safe, Wales' chief medical officer says Ten countries in southern Africa are now on the UK's travel red list,meaning that until further notice, any British or Irish residents arriving in the UK after recently visiting any of those countries will have to quarantine in an approved hotel for 10 days. Residents from the countries themselves will not be allowed into the UK until the red list status changes. Under new measures, which came into force at 04:00 GMT, everyone entering the UK from abroad must take a PCR test and isolate, pending a negative result. Masks will also be made compulsory again in shops and on public transport in England. Face coverings are already mandatory in shops, health and social care settings and on public transport in Wales.

"Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey is stepping down as chief executive of the company. He will be replaced by the current chief technical officer, Parag Agrawal, Twitter said. Mr Dorsey, who co-founded Twitter in 2006, has been serving as chief executive of both Twitter and payment firm Square. ""It's finally time for me to leave"" he wrote in a statement, saying the company was ""ready to move on."" Mr Dorsey said he had ""deep"" trust in his replacement. ""I'm deeply grateful for his skill, heart, and soul. It's his time to lead,"" he said. Mr Agrawal joined Twitter in 2011, and has been the firm's head of technology since 2017. Mr Dorsey challenged corporate conventions with his nose-ring, long beard, and a wellness regime including yoga and eating only one meal a day. But he came under pressure from investors, who felt Twitter was not getting the focus it needed while he was also running Square. On Sunday, Mr Dorsey tweeted, apparently unprompted: ""I love Twitter."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. In a separate message to the official corporate statement,Mr Dorsey tweeted,external: ""Not sure anyone has heard but I resigned from Twitter."" ""There's a lot of talk about the importance of a company being 'founder-led'. Ultimately I believe that's severely limiting and a single point of failure,"" he wrote in an attached email he sent to staff. He added that he would leave the board after his term expires. ""Why not stay or become chair? I believe it's really important to give Parag the space he needs to lead."" Twitter's share price jumped as rumours of Mr Dorsey's departure emerged, first reported by CNBC. But by mid-afternoon shares were trading just under their value at the end of last week. Victoria Scholar, investment analyst at Interactive Investor, said the development had not come as a surprise to Twitter's board members ""who have reportedly been preparing to say goodbye to Dorsey since last year"". The change was being seen ""as a way for Twitter to turn over a new leaf and take bigger risks"", she said. Perhaps Mr Dorsey's most daring move was to ban former President Donald Trump from the platform, following the riots at the Capitol building. It provoked strong criticism from Mr Trump's supporters. ""People tend to conflate Jack Dorsey with Twitter censorship, but my sense is he's actually done what he could these past few years to keep the platform relatively open,"" tweeted Mike Solana, head of the private equity firm Founders Fund. ""Things will be worse without him, not better. Godspeed, bird king,"" he added. In a way, Jack Dorsey typifies the Silicon Valley chief executive. He's a multi-billionaire - and has founded two hugely successful companies - Twitter and Square. Yet he dresses in tie-dye t-shirts and sports a beard like a wizard. He's a hippie at heart, with high ideals for how technology can change the world for good. He genuinely believes, for example, that Bitcoin has the ability to create ""world peace"". And with Twitter, he certainly has changed the world. In particular it revolutionised how politicians communicate with voters - and how news is communicated with the public. Perhaps the best known user of Twitter was Donald Trump. The populist US president used the platform as a key way of bypassing traditional media. The decision to remove him from the platform after the Capitol Hill riots was undoubtedly the most controversial moment of Jack Dorsey's time. The nature of his departure is also interesting. He is extricating himself from the company, even giving up his board seat. That's very different to say, Jeff Bezos, who retains much influence at Amazon despite stepping down as boss earlier this year. Mr Dorsey claims this is his decision. But at a multi-billion dollar company, there could well be more at play behind the scenes. He is in his mid-40s, and still has lofty ambitions to change the world. With his track record, he may well do so again. The 45-year-old co-founded the company with Biz Stone, Evan Williams and Noah Glass in 2006. Mr Dorsey has, however, become the face of the company,having sent the earliest tweets on the serviceand due to his long tenure as chief executive. He left the role of Twitter chief in 2008 and founded the digital payments app Square, which has also grown into a multi-billion dollar company. Jack Dorsey's Square in Australia's biggest buyout Jack Dorsey's first ever tweet sells for $2.9m However,he was brought back to helm Twitter in 2015after then-chief executive Dick Costolo stepped down. The role has seen him appear in televised inquiries before US politicians to be quizzed about his platform and its potential role in the spread of disinformation - something Twitter has been repeatedly accused of acting too slowly on in recent years. Like other social media sites it has alsobeen accused of political biason both sides of the US political divide. This video can not be played ""Who put you in charge of what the media are allowed to report?"": Twitter's Jack Dorsey is quizzed by Senator Ted Cruz Calls for his departure came in 2020 from Elliott management, an investment firm which owns a significant amount of Twitter's shares. The firm reportedly felt that a full-time chief executive with only one company to run would be better for Twitter's fortunes. Twitter: Five anti-vaccine strikes and you are out Twitter works with news sites to tackle disinformation But the two sides later came to an agreement which saw Mr Dorsey remain in his post. Reacting to the news of Mr Dorsey's resignation, Elliott said the new management team were ""the right leaders for Twitter at this pivotal moment for the company"". The change in leadership comesalongside several other changes to Twitter's board,external, including the appointment of Bret Taylor, an existing Twitter board member and veteran of Google and Salesforce, as the new chairman. ""I want to thank Jack for his visionary leadership and unrelenting dedication to Twitter since its founding,"" Mr Taylor said. ""Jack returned to Twitter and turned the Company around at the most critical time. The progress since then has been nothing short of incredible.

"Labour's top team walked to Tuesday's shadow cabinet meeting Sir Keir Starmer has appointed Yvette Cooper shadow home secretary, in a wide-ranging reshuffle of Labour's top team. In other moves, David Lammy has been promoted to shadow foreign secretary, replacing Lisa Nandy. Ms Nandy takes a new role scrutinising Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove. News of the appointments came several hours after the reorganisation began on Monday morning, during a speech by Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner. Ms Rayner appeared to be blindsided by the news and told reporters she didn't know the details of the reshuffle or the timing of it. A source close to the Labour leader said Ms Rayner was told a reshuffle would be taking place on Monday. Speaking to the BBC, Ms Nandy said: ""The gaffer picks the team, that's how it goes and that's how it has always gone... frankly, I couldn't care less about the circus of who's in, and who's out, who's up, who's down, who knew, who didn't."" The new Labour shadow cabinet met on Tuesday morning. Dodds out in Labour's post-election reshuffle Reshuffle delay leaves questions over Starmer team Ms Cooper replaces Nick Thomas-Symonds, who takes over as shadow international trade secretary from Emily Thornberry. Elsewhere, Ed Miliband retains his role over climate change policy, but loses his shadow business secretary role to Jonathan Reynolds. Wes Streeting is promoted to shadow health secretary, handing him a key role in scrutinising the government's response to the pandemic. The 38-year old, who recentlyrecovered from cancer surgery, replaces Jonathan Ashworth, who becomes shadow work and pensions secretary. Louise Haighleaves her post as shadow Northern Ireland secretary, replacing Jim McMahon as shadow transport secretary. It comes after she made headlines earlier this month when she said Labour should be neutral if there was an Irish unity referendum. She will be replaced in the role by Peter Kyle, who is promoted from his former role as shadow minister for schools. Sir Keir said the reshuffle would give him a ""smaller, more focused shadow cabinet that mirrors the shape of the government we are shadowing"". ""I look forward to working with the new team to show we are once again a serious party of government,"" the Labour leader added. The reorganisation is the second big shake-up of Sir Keir's shadow ministerial team since he took over as Labour leader last year. His first, after May's national and local elections, triggered an internal row when Sir Keir attempted to remove Ms Rayner from her roles as party chair and national campaign co-ordinator. Sir Keir cannot remove her from her main role as deputy leader, as she was elected into this position by party members. Although Ms Rayner eventually lost both roles, she was given two new shadow cabinet titles following a backlash inside the party. Technically Lisa Nandy's move from the Foreign Office brief is a demotion. But Starmer's team says they want her to be more prominent and visible in taking on Michael Gove on ""levelling up"" - the promise to equalise opportunity across the country, and the government's main mantra. A bigger job goes to David Lammy, replacing her in taking on Liz Truss. Along with the return of Yvette Cooper to the front bench as shadow home secretary, the hope is that this reshuffle combines making the best of Labour's experience and the young, bright things of the future. It's certainly likely to create some SW1 box office face-offs between Yvette Cooper and her counterpart Priti Patel. Read more from Laura Ms Cooper, who will now face Home Secretary Priti Patel across the despatch box, previously held the role of shadow home secretary for over four years under Mr Miliband, when he was Labour leader. First elected in the 1997 Labour landslide, she held several ministerial positions under former PMs Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. The reshuffle was criticised by former shadow chancellor John McDonnell, a key ally of former leader Jeremy Corbyn. He tweeted: ""Reviving the careers of former Blairite ministers and simply reappointing existing shadow cabinet ministers to new posts does give the impression of Christmas Past, not Christmas Future."" In other confirmed moves: Bridget Phillipson is promoted, replacing Kate Green as new shadow education secretary Emily Thornberry will become shadow attorney-general Jo Stevens moves from shadow culture secretary to become Welsh secretary, replacing Nia Griffith Lucy Powell becomes new culture secretary, with Ms Nandy taking over her former role on housing policy Jim McMahon becomes shadow environment secretary, replacing Luke Pollard Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting 'I have nothing to go back to' - BBC reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Trump avoids prison or fine in hush-money case sentencing LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"Labour's top team walked to Tuesday's shadow cabinet meeting Sir Keir Starmer has appointed Yvette Cooper shadow home secretary, in a wide-ranging reshuffle of Labour's top team. In other moves, David Lammy has been promoted to shadow foreign secretary, replacing Lisa Nandy. Ms Nandy takes a new role scrutinising Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove. News of the appointments came several hours after the reorganisation began on Monday morning, during a speech by Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner. Ms Rayner appeared to be blindsided by the news and told reporters she didn't know the details of the reshuffle or the timing of it. A source close to the Labour leader said Ms Rayner was told a reshuffle would be taking place on Monday. Speaking to the BBC, Ms Nandy said: ""The gaffer picks the team, that's how it goes and that's how it has always gone... frankly, I couldn't care less about the circus of who's in, and who's out, who's up, who's down, who knew, who didn't."" The new Labour shadow cabinet met on Tuesday morning. Dodds out in Labour's post-election reshuffle Reshuffle delay leaves questions over Starmer team Ms Cooper replaces Nick Thomas-Symonds, who takes over as shadow international trade secretary from Emily Thornberry. Elsewhere, Ed Miliband retains his role over climate change policy, but loses his shadow business secretary role to Jonathan Reynolds. Wes Streeting is promoted to shadow health secretary, handing him a key role in scrutinising the government's response to the pandemic. The 38-year old, who recentlyrecovered from cancer surgery, replaces Jonathan Ashworth, who becomes shadow work and pensions secretary. Louise Haighleaves her post as shadow Northern Ireland secretary, replacing Jim McMahon as shadow transport secretary. It comes after she made headlines earlier this month when she said Labour should be neutral if there was an Irish unity referendum. She will be replaced in the role by Peter Kyle, who is promoted from his former role as shadow minister for schools. Sir Keir said the reshuffle would give him a ""smaller, more focused shadow cabinet that mirrors the shape of the government we are shadowing"". ""I look forward to working with the new team to show we are once again a serious party of government,"" the Labour leader added. The reorganisation is the second big shake-up of Sir Keir's shadow ministerial team since he took over as Labour leader last year. His first, after May's national and local elections, triggered an internal row when Sir Keir attempted to remove Ms Rayner from her roles as party chair and national campaign co-ordinator. Sir Keir cannot remove her from her main role as deputy leader, as she was elected into this position by party members. Although Ms Rayner eventually lost both roles, she was given two new shadow cabinet titles following a backlash inside the party. Technically Lisa Nandy's move from the Foreign Office brief is a demotion. But Starmer's team says they want her to be more prominent and visible in taking on Michael Gove on ""levelling up"" - the promise to equalise opportunity across the country, and the government's main mantra. A bigger job goes to David Lammy, replacing her in taking on Liz Truss. Along with the return of Yvette Cooper to the front bench as shadow home secretary, the hope is that this reshuffle combines making the best of Labour's experience and the young, bright things of the future. It's certainly likely to create some SW1 box office face-offs between Yvette Cooper and her counterpart Priti Patel. Read more from Laura Ms Cooper, who will now face Home Secretary Priti Patel across the despatch box, previously held the role of shadow home secretary for over four years under Mr Miliband, when he was Labour leader.

"Supermarket giant Asda said it has chartered its own cargo ship to ensure shelves are fully stocked with key festive products this year. It said the move would prevent a shortage of toys, clothing and gifts during the busy Christmas period. Asda blamed supply chain problems that have hit other retailers and made it harder to source goods from abroad. John Lewis in the UK and Costco and Walmart in the US have all chartered ships to protect their stock. It comes as Asda reported that like-for-like sales fell by 0.7% in the three months to 30 September compared with the same period last year. ""This is the first time Asda has chartered its own ship and we have done so to navigate the industry-wide supply chain challenges and to make sure there is enough stock on the shelves for customers this Christmas,"" a spokesman told the BBC. John Lewis charters ships to save Christmas What's in short supply and why? He said the ship has 350 containers carrying a range of products including festive decorations, party and celebration supplies, toys, gifts and clothing. The boat set sail from China and will arrive in the UK in early December. Asda has struggled with shortages of some foods this year due to the national driver shortage. But it said it was taking measures to protect its Christmas food ranges, including stocking more turkeys and pigs in blankets in store compared to last year. It is also keeping extra stock in depots such as mince pies, confectionary, Christmas cakes and puddings, and has recruited 15,000 temporary staff to work during the busy Christmas period. Like other retailers, Asda faced shortages of some goods in October due to the national driver shortage In September, John Lewis said it was chartering a fleet of extra ships, along with a number of other businesses, to make sure it has Christmas stock on time. Boss Sharon White blamed a shortage of shipping containers which had made it tough - and expensive - to get a space on cargo ships travelling from various parts of the world. Asda - which was recently bought by the billionaire Issa brothers - said the fall in quarterly sales reflected unusually high demand in the same period last year when people were eating more meals at home due to Covid curbs. However, its rivals Tesco and Sainsbury's have both reported higher sales in the third quarter. Asda said customer habits that emerged in the pandemic had remained, with demand for its online delivery service still 80% higher than pre-pandemic levels. It added that the lockdown trend of customers treating themselves to premium own-label products had also continued. What's in short supply and why? Ros Atkins Onâ¦ Global supply chain disruption.

"Hot food and drink is being provided in Torphins Thousands of people have spent a fourth night without power in the wake of Storm Arwen. The north-east of Scotland remains the worst hit, with police declaring a major incident in the area due the widespread disruption. Areas of Moray, Angus, Perthshire, Dumfries and Galloway and the Borders are also affected. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said the complexity of the recovery ""cannot be underestimated"". Energy provider SSEN said the storm had caused ""catastrophic damage"", three times greater than that caused by the Beast from the East in 2018. How people are coping with the lengthy power cuts It said on Monday evening thatpower had been restored to 103,000 customers, but 17,000 remained without,external. About 9,500 homes in Killin, Perthshire, and Alford and Aboyne in Aberdeenshire had been reconnected on Monday morning. A further 7,000 properties in Braemar, Ballater, Torphins, Comrie and other areas were reconnected throughout the day. However SSEN warned that some places would not see power restored before Tuesday - and some localised faults would take even longer to repair. It advised customers in this situation to make alternative arrangements if possible. Rest centres were set up and hot food and drinks are being supplied to people, many of whom have been without electricity since Friday afternoon. Power lines were brought down by trees, including in Ballater Aberdeenshire Council chief executive Jim Savege told the BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandit had been a ""pretty tough"" time for the area. He said schools would be closed on Monday and Tuesday and they would be checked for storm damage. Vaccination clinics in Aberdeenshire were also cancelled on Monday. The Scottish government's resilience room, chaired by the deputy first minister, met on Monday afternoon. Mr Swinney urged people in need of support to contact their local council. He said: ""It is good to see that some progress is being made across the country as power is restored. ""While we are hopeful for a further recovery as soon as possible, the scale and complexity of the situation cannot be underestimated. ""Many people are still without power and water, and that's why local authorities and partners are stepping up welfare support in affected areas for those who need it."" On Monday evening, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said his thoughts were with those still facing disruption. He added: ""The situation in the north-east of Scotland is among the most concerning and, while forecasts are improving, we are on standby to provide further assistance to the Scottish government."" SSEN engineers are pictured just north of Kirriemuir Mark Rough, director of customer operations at SSEN, said: ""Storm Arwen has resulted in some of the most significant and challenging conditions experienced in the north of Scotland in decades, resulting in catastrophic damage to several overhead circuits with multiple instances of damage which need to be repaired before power can be restored. ""The damage caused by Storm Arwen is at least three times greater than we experienced from the Beast from the East storm in 2018, demonstrating the scale of challenge our teams have faced."" SSEN has been working to restore power in the following locations: Aberdeenshire: Braemar, Ballater, Kintore, Fyvie, Rothienorman, New Deer, Dyce, Methlick, Tarland, Blackburn, Forgue, Hatton, Cuminestown, Dunecht, St. Cyrus and Fettercairn Moray: Duffus, Alvah, Deskford, Collieston, Boyndie, Dufftown Angus: Maryton, Monikie and Edzell Perthshire: Milnathort, Grange, Braco and Glencarse Elsewhere, SP Energy Networks - which covers central and southern Scotland - said on Monday afternoon that it still had about 4,500 homes without supplies. The areas most badly hit are in the Borders, Dumfriesshire, Fife and the Lothians. It said the damage to the network was some of the worst it had experienced in more than 15 years and apologised to anyone affected. The company added it would be offering accommodation to vulnerable customers if it could not restore supplies overnight. A number of schools in Dumfries and Galloway have been shut due to heating or power failures. They are all expected to reopen on Tuesday. Scottish Borders Council has set up drop-in centres to provide soup, meals and hot drinks in Duns, Innerleithen, Hawick and Earlston. Scottish Water said it was continuing work to restore water supplies to customers across several areas in Aberdeenshire, Tayside and Perth, where about 1,500 properties remained without. The main areas were Aberchirder, Lumsden, Rhynie, Lumphanan, Torphins, Fortingall and Fearnan. Network Rail Scotland said signalling issues been restored on the East Coast Mainline and it was working with operators to reintroduce impacted services. Meanwhile, hundreds of seal pups werekilled at a nature reserve in the Scottish Bordersduring Storm Arwen. The National Trust for Scotland (NTS) - which operates the site at St Abb's Head - said there were 224 dead pups in the water at a bay at Pettico Wick, with more washing ashore. Forestry and Land Scotland has urged people not to visit its forests until checks for the level of damage and safety assessments have been carried out. A queue for hot food and drinks at a welfare van following a power cut in Aboyne, Aberdeenshire. In the Aberdeenshire village of Kemnay a local cafÃ© took hot drinks, soup and mince pies to a nearby care home. ""The power's been off since four o'clock on Friday,"" said Andy Hutcheon, manager of Cafe 83. ""Many of the care home residents are our customers and they've been huddled in the reception trying to stay warm. They were delighted to see us."" The cafÃ© also set up a barbeque outside for any other locals who needed a drink or food. ""There's no heating and no-one has a phone signal - so it's been pretty dire,"" he added. Across the UK, three men were killed by falling trees during the storm, which triggered the Met Office's highest red level storm warning. The 35-year-old driver of a pick-up truck was fatally injured on Friday afternoon in Aberdeenshire. Have you been experiencing a power cut since Storm Arwen?

"Alex Clarke found a flight from South Africa - but says UK quarantine hotels are full Travellers and airlines are scrambling to rearrange plans as the latest Covid restrictions cause travel turmoil for people trying to return to the UK. Passengers criticised airlines and government for a lack of information on returning from ""red list"" countries. One told the BBC he had found a return flight from South Africa but now cannot get a quarantine hotel in the UK. Alex Clarke, from near Reading, said a lack of hotel space meant he might have to re-arrange his return again. ""I should have landed back in the UK this morning,"" he told the BBC. ""My flight was cancelled but I managed to book another for Friday. Now that's been cancelled. ""I found return flights via Dubai and Amsterdam, but they have now been closed off. I now have a return booked for Thursday, but the website that books quarantine hotels says everything is booked."" What are the UK's new travel rules? How do you detect Omicron? Latest news on Covid Omicron variant Australia delays reopening over Omicron variant Cases of the new Covid variant - Omicron - were first recorded in South Africa last week. There are concerns it could be more infectious and less responsive to vaccines. As a result, Covid rules are being strengthened once more. The government has added 10 southern African countries - including South Africa where Mr Clarke is stuck - to the UK's travel red list. The only people allowed to enter the UK from these countries are UK or Irish nations, or UK residents. They will have to pay for and self-isolate in a pre-booked government-approved hotel for 10 days. Mr Clarke, who has been staying with friends while his wife and two young children remained at home in the UK, had travelled from Cape Town to Johannesburg when he thought he had secured an alternative flight. He estimates the extra airline, hotel and UK quarantine costs will be about Â£4,000. He said: ""There has been absolutely no communication from British Airways or the UK government on getting back to the UK. ""In the one email received from BA, the helpline that BA set up went to a call centre and the person in the phone had no idea that flights to the UK had been suspended or cancelled."" When he telephoned again later, he was directed to BA's website. Meanwhile, another traveller, Mike Haswell, from Cardiff, told the BBC on Sunday how he had been struggling to return from Malawi, where he was working. He reached Ethiopia, where ground staff at Addis Ababa airport refused to let UK nationals onto the flight to the UK. Mr Haswell said he and about 30 other UK passengers have been stuck at the airport for 18 hours and still did not know when a flight would be available. If your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to a full refund and you can choose to receive that refund in cash rather than as a voucher. An airline should refund the money within seven days, although some people have waited longer. A package holiday should be refunded, in full, within 14 days. Read more here Meanwhile, Virgin Atlantic has said it will operate its first flight from Johannesburg to London on Wednesday.  The airline has not flown from South Africa since last Friday morning. All passengers will arrive into Heathrow Terminal 4, which is being reinstated as an arrival facility for red list countries and passengers. They will then go to a managed hotel quarantine facility, as per the new guidance. A Heathrow spokesperson said: ""We are reopening Terminal 4 as a dedicated arrivals facility for red list countries on Wednesday 1 December. In the meantime, there will be no direct flights arriving from affected areas."" As well as adding more countries to the UK's red list, the government has said that from 04:00 GMT on Tuesday, 30 November, anyone entering the UK will require aPCR test within 48 hours of arrivaland will need to self-isolate until they have a negative result. However, Willie Walsh, the head of the IATA airline trade body and formerly the boss of IAG, the group that owns BA, Iberia and Aer Lingus,told the BBC that the latest developments exposed the lack of a sensible testing regime and risk-based approach. ""I'm very disappointed to see this knee-jerk reaction by governments to the latest development,"" he said. ""It's clear that these measures have been completely ineffective in the past but impose huge hardship on people who are trying to connect with families and friends, and clearly massive financial damage to the tourism and airline industry."" Mr Walsh said the failure of similar restrictions to prevent a second coronavirus wave in the UK after being implemented in May last year demonstrates they ""do not have any long-term benefits"" and are ""not the answer"". ""I think sensible testing regimes which have been proven to be effective could be introduced which would enable people to continue travelling in a safe environment,"" he added. Tim Alderslade, the chief executive of Airlines UK, which represents UK-based carriers, also said the government could do more. ""The situation is developing rapidly, and hopefully as more data emerges emergency border restrictions can be reversed quickly - and applied only where they will make a material difference,"" he said. ""In the meantime, we urge ministers to make mandatory PCR tests free of charge for impacted passengers, many of whom are now in the invidious position of having less than 48 hours to arrange extra testing whilst overseas."" Transport Secretary Grant Shappstweeted,externalthat the changes were ""targeted measures to provide confidence and protection"", and they would be reviewed in three weeks ""to ensure they are working effectively"".

"Nicola Sturgeon delivers her SNP conference speech after briefing Scotland on the new Covid-19 variant Omicron She told her party's members in a virtual address that the pandemic posed ""big and very real challenges ahead over the winter months"" At a briefing earlier, she said six Omicron cases had been identified in Scotland. Those who have tested positive are not in hospital and there is no indication the variant is widespread in Scotland Scotland's Chief Medical Officer Gregor Smith adds that there is no evidence globally that anyone has died from the Omicron strain, but it is still ""too early"" to know for sure The first minister calls for travel rules to be tightened and adds that she has written to the PM asking for tougher measures such as requiring arrivals to the UK to isolate for eight days She says she is not asking the public at this time to put their Christmas holiday plans on hold Ms Sturgeon asks the public to take lateral flow tests before they go shopping or socialise. She urges everyone: ""Make sure we don't let our guard slip."" BBC Scotland News It's been a hectic morning and early afternoon, rounded off by Nicola Sturgeon giving her keynote speech to the SNP conference. Before that, the first minister gave an update on the latest Covid developments and the new Omicron variant. So, in case you missed that or need to catch up, here's what we learned from the Covid briefing.  In her keynote speech to the SNP conference, Nicola Sturgeon announced an extra Â£30m for GPs to help them increase primary care services and a doubling of the Scottish Child Payment to Â£20 a week from next April. That's it for our live coverage on Monday 29 November. We'll continue to bring you more analysis across the BBC Scotland News website. For now, stay safe and have a good afternoon.  Reality Check The evidence does support
this claim by Nicola Sturgeon. According toUK government statistics,external, vaccination uptake in Scotland for the first dose (as a percentage
of the population over the age of 12) is at 90.8%, while in England this is
88.2%. In Scotland, uptake for the second dose is 82.5% with 80.2% in England. The booster roll-out â which Ms Sturgeon says she will accelerate further in
the face of the new Omicron variant â is at 34.1%, while Englandâs uptake is
30.%, only just above that of Wales. Meanwhile Northern Ireland's uptake is lowest for all three doses. A total of 1,629,572 in
Scotland have received a booster according to Public Health Scotland - 14,772,591
have in England. Reality Check Nicola Sturgeon said she was âproudâ that NHS staff in Scotland
have been awarded the highest pay rise in the UK. In May, Scotland's nurses, paramedics and allied health
professionals, as well as domestic staff, porters, healthcare support staff and
other frontline health workers were offered a 4% rise, backdated to 1 December
2020. But this does not cover doctors and dentists, who were offered a
3% rise. In July, NHS workers in England were offered a 3% pay rise. This rise was for most NHS staff including nurses, paramedics, consultants,
dentists and salaried GPs and was backdated to April 2021. A similar increase
was offered in Wales. It was later reported in August that NHS workers in Northern
Ireland would also be offered a 3% increase. Independence is not unusual, Ms Sturgeon says, with more than 100 countries taking that route in the past 60 years. ""The
fact is, independence is the normal state of affairs for countries the world
over,"" she says. ""With
all the resources and talents we have available to us, I simply do not believe
that Scotland canât match, perhaps even surpass, the success of Denmark,
Norway, Ireland, Austria and the many other prosperous independent countries
that are all around us."" Ms Sturgeon outlines her argument for Scottish independence. Scotland's ambitions for a higher standard of living, good jobs for the future, a clean environment, better health and sustainable public services, are being undermined by the current Westminster government,  she says. ""Boris Johnsonâs government is actively eroding
the power of our democratically-elected Scottish Parliament,"" she adds. Ms Sturgeon slams the ending of the universal credit uplift as ""cruel and shocking"". She says the move will push 60,000 Scottish families and 20,000
children into poverty. But she is ""determined
to lift children out of poverty."" The Scottish Child Payment - which currently provides low income families with Â£10 per week for every
child under six - is to be doubled. From the beginning of the new financial year in April, it will increase to Â£20. By the end of next year, it will be extended to all children in low income families under the age of 16. Ms Sturgeon calls it ""the boldest
and most ambitious anti-poverty measure anywhere in the UK"".  The SNP was looking to the future with its journey to net zero carbon emissions, and had a co-operation agreement with the Scottish Green Party to ""raise the bar of
achievement higher"", Ms Sturgeon says. ""We recognise that working with others who
also want to move Scotland forward will help us all achieve more,"" she adds. Ms Sturgeon says the SNP is laying the foundations for a stronger
future. Her proudest moment as first minister is her ""transformational support for children"", the FM says. She adds that 200,000 baby boxes have now been delivered in Scotland to give every child an equal start in life. She outlines the doubling of state-funded early years education and childcare. And she says the provision of nursery care for two, three and four-year-olds means they are entitled to the same number of hours
in early years settings as older children get in school. Ms Sturgeon goes on to highlight her party's introduction of a new
social security system and says it was designed to tackle child poverty - the
root cause of the poverty-related attainment gap in education - at its heart.  Ms Sturgeon praises GPs for delivering medical care amid increasing demand. She announces funding of Â£30m, to be delivered in December and April, to help GPs further increase primary care services in
their communities. GPs will be able to target investment where it is most needed and help patients get treatment as close to home
as possible, Ms Sturgeon says. The heaviest burden of the virus has fallen on NHS and social care staff, who are under more pressure than ever before and are exhausted, Ms Sturgeon tell party members. ""Words will never, ever express my gratitude to them,"" she says, adding that she was proud that Scottish NHS staff had the highest pay rise in the UK. She says a national care service is at the heart of the SNP's reforms, and will be a ""fitting legacy from the trauma of Covid"". She says the SNP government has committed an additional Â£300m for winter support and immediate recruitment of 1,000 NHS staff. Ms Sturgeon is speaking as figures revealed Covid-19 cases in Scotlandremained relatively stable during October. There were still about 2,500 cases a day being confirmed - but the number of detected infections didn't seem to be rising or falling significantly. The seven-day average began to go up into the first half of November, reaching about 3,000 cases a day, but in recent days had begun to fall again. A sustained fall in cases in the run-up to Christmas would have been a welcome sight to ministers. The fear now will be that the Omnicron variant will reverse the trend - as the Alpha variant did this time last year and Delta did in the spring. The SNP leader says that if someone could be vaccinated right now, but has chosen not to be, then ""you are putting your own life at risk"". and risking the lives of everyone you come in contact with. She cites WHO statistics released last week which said that, in Scotland, without vaccines about 32,000 people over 60 would have died this year. She says that 86% of these deaths were prevented by vaccines - around 27,000 people are alive today who would not be if we did not have vaccines. She urges people to get first, second and booster doses as ""a gift for those you love"". Ms Sturgeon then asks people to test themselves on every occasion they plan to mix with people outside their homes. If the test is positive, she says, ""Do not go"".  Ms Sturgeon says Covid cases in Scotland had been declining before the Omicron variant was detected, but we ""must not drop our guard"". She says all of us must ""redouble our efforts"" to prevent the spread of the virus during the winter months. The Scottish government will not shy away from taking difficult decisions, she adds. Addressing her party virtually, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says she really hopes members can meet in person again in spring. She says holding a conference online is a ""mere inconvenience"" compared to the sacrifices made by so many over the past two years. ""We have come so far, and while it has not been easy, a spirit of solidarity with a compassion has helped us through,"" she says. This needs to be harnessed again as the Omicron variant could bring a ""winter that might be tougher than most of us have ever experienced,"" Ms Sturgeon says.  Focus now moves on to Nicola Sturgeon's keynote speech at the Scottish National Party's conference. The first minister is making the address on the last day of the four-day virtual event. You can watch it by clicking on the tab above. Reaction is arriving to the first minister's briefing on the Omicron variant. But what did we learn from her statement and media questions?  Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent Scientists have swiftly started a detailed review
of positive cases in Scotland. They are looking for what's called an S-gene drop out which is a feature of the new Omicron variant. The chief medical officer Gregor Smith told the briefing they started to see this drop out appear on 16 November and they are now carrying out genomic sequencing, with public health teams also
asking some people to re-test. It's all part of the efforts to build up a
picture of when the new variant arrived and how it might be spreading. The first minister says she is very concerned about the potential for more pressure on the NHS as winter approaches. This underlines the ""necessity of doing everything we can to keep this virus in general under control, but (also) this variant in particular"", Ms Sturgeon says. She is hoping to get a UK four-nations agreement on travel restrictions ""because we know from travel patterns that that is the only thing that will be properly effective"". The possibility of increased travel restrictions has been a hot topic during the briefing. Ms Sturgeon says that countries are detecting cases ""by the hour"" and the travel restrictions are broad-based because we cannot be certain which countries have the variant. She says this blanket approach may change as more becomes clear. Dr Gregor Smith adds that we still do not know if incubation period and symptoms are different with the new variant and this approach gives confidence that everything is being done to reduce the risk. The FM says she cannot confirm if the six confirmed cases are known to each other. Connor GilliesBBC Scotland news correspondent Nicola Sturgeonâs proposal to strengthen quarantine rules
for all UK arrivals has been met by anger among some in the aviation industry. Ms Sturgeon has written to the prime minister calling for passengers to
self-isolate for eight days amid the Omicron strain. The first minister fears two
days is not long enough as the incubation period for the virus is longer. The
Scottish government says it is better to be cautious. If the plans go ahead, it
could mean some families changing their Christmas arrangements. Aviation

"Geograph volunteers have captured many of Britain's remotest locations, such as St Kilda When Anne Burgess isn't skiing or flying a glider, you are likely to find her roaming around some of Scotland's remotest locations, camera and map in hand. The retired tourism officer from Fochabers in Moray is one of an army of volunteers whose mission is to capture and document rural and urban locations and share free-to-use images with the public. They form a unique online community project calledGeograph,external, a charity which aims to collect ""geographically representative"" photographs and information about every square kilometre of Britain and Ireland. A steam train pictured in Worcestershire Since 2005, more than 13,000 contributors have submitted seven million pictures covering 281,000 Ordnance Survey (OS) grid squares. They include landmarks, landscapes and urban environments - everything from cemeteries and castles to monuments and old factories - even motorways, railways and dilapidated housing estates. Many of the volunteers, including Anne, happily describe themselves as ""map nerds"", poring over OS maps in order to find new and tough-to-reach locations. But photography is also an essential part of the project. Anne says in the past 16 years, she has submitted more than 40,000 images to the Geograph website. ""I've been taking photos all my life,"" she says. ""There are so many wonderful places around Scotland and you can find plenty of interesting things to photograph almost anywhere."" Anne Burgess has submitted tens of thousands of pictures to the Geograph website There's a competitive element to the process too, as contributors earn points (but not prizes) for their efforts. The highest number of points are awarded to those who find grid squares which have never been covered. Each member of the Geograph family has his or her own reason for being part of the project. Devon-based journalist Lewis Clarke says he likes ""to document history and changes in the landscape"". Lewis Clarke is pictured out and about on his quest to chase grid squares for the Geograph site Since 2009, he's uploaded more than 80,000 images, ranging from the M5 motorway to rolling countryside and city scenes. He's even captured a number of fires and floods during his time. ""Geograph is definitely not a collection of pretty photos - albeit there are many photos uploaded which are very impressive - but it is a place to record history. ""I enjoy taking photos for future generations, of places which will soon become developed and construction sites."" Lewis Clarke took this image of the Mayfield lavender fields in Surrey He adds: ""I've had people get in touch from across the globe asking if they can use images of mine in textbooks, for displays, in media online, and most recently on an episode of the BBC'sSaving Lives at Sea. ""In my mind, it proves that every image you take may have some use to somebody somewhere, even if you're never quite sure what it is at the time."" The Hurlstone Point Gull Hole in Somerset Lewis admits that he gets some stick from family and friends for his hobby. ""My mum compares my obsession with trying to grab (grid) squares as nerdy, and akin to trainspotting. ""When in Germany taking photos out of a car windscreen for the German equivalent site, my friend had to explain to our international friends that I was doing it because 'I was a bit weird'."" Fabian Musto says Geograph has helped him deal with autism and social anxiety Fabian Musto, who joined four years ago at the age of 13, says Geograph has brought him a sense of contentment. ""Geograph has helped me deal with autism and social anxiety, since walking in tranquil countryside places makes me feel at ease as I find it difficult to cope in loud and busy environments,"" the Herefordshire resident explains. ""After completing a walk in the countryside or a trip to castles and churches, I feel happy to look back on my photographs and treasure memories of the visits for a long time."" A shopping precinct in Leominster An avenue to an Elan Valley aqueduct in Herefordshire Chemistry teacher Richard Webb, a Geograph veteran, says anyone joining the project would be contributing to a national archive and helping to provide a major resource, especially for education. ""Geography covers a lot of things and overlaps with our courses in many ways - agriculture, petrochemicals, industrial planning, the environment,"" he says. ""It is a particularly good resource when covering other subjects. Usually you can find relevant and often local images quickly for any subject."" A stunning view of Green Kaims in Aberdeenshire Scotland-based Richard, who acts as a moderator of the Geograph site, says contributors share certain things in common, including an enjoyment of the outdoors lifestyle - and a love of maps. ""Almost all contributors are into maps in some way. You have to be comfortable with the national grid and reading maps to find contributing easy, which explains why it is a bit of a niche activity. ""However technology has made that aspect a lot less daunting."" Gannets seen flying around the Bass Rock in the Firth of Forth A beach on Ulva in the Inner Hebrides Richard is among the most travelled of the Geograph community, having visited sites as far apart as the Bass Rock in the Firth of Forth, Foula in the Shetland islands, County Mayo in Ireland and ""the far flung corners of England while travelling to cross-channel ferries"". He adds: ""Mostly my pictures are taken in places where I would be anyway doing outdoor stuff - hills, wilder places and the coast - especially islands. ""When I go out deliberately to take photos, I am usually drawn to urban and industrial areas where there are so many interesting subjects."" Richard Webb has documented housing estates, including flats at Greendykes in Edinburgh before they were demolished Geograph has so far mapped about 85% of Britain and Ireland's grid squares - some many times over the years - although there are places that have proved to be inaccessible, such as military sites. Richard explains: ""I don't think there are any uncrackable grid squares. ""I have managed a fair few awkward ones myself. Frustratingly enough, I have visited several undocumented squares at Porton Down but was not allowed to photograph them. ""Surely someone on the inside could send in a close-cropped bit of rabbit-mown grassland to us without any security implications?"" He adds: ""Most of the remaining unvisited squares are reasonably accessible - it just requires commitment to travel to them.""

"Nicola Sturgeon delivers her SNP conference speech after briefing Scotland on the new Covid-19 variant Omicron She told her party's members in a virtual address that the pandemic posed ""big and very real challenges ahead over the winter months"" At a briefing earlier, she said six Omicron cases had been identified in Scotland. Those who have tested positive are not in hospital and there is no indication the variant is widespread in Scotland Scotland's Chief Medical Officer Gregor Smith adds that there is no evidence globally that anyone has died from the Omicron strain, but it is still ""too early"" to know for sure The first minister calls for travel rules to be tightened and adds that she has written to the PM asking for tougher measures such as requiring arrivals to the UK to isolate for eight days She says she is not asking the public at this time to put their Christmas holiday plans on hold Ms Sturgeon asks the public to take lateral flow tests before they go shopping or socialise. She urges everyone: ""Make sure we don't let our guard slip."" BBC Scotland News It's been a hectic morning and early afternoon, rounded off by Nicola Sturgeon giving her keynote speech to the SNP conference. Before that, the first minister gave an update on the latest Covid developments and the new Omicron variant. So, in case you missed that or need to catch up, here's what we learned from the Covid briefing.  In her keynote speech to the SNP conference, Nicola Sturgeon announced an extra Â£30m for GPs to help them increase primary care services and a doubling of the Scottish Child Payment to Â£20 a week from next April. That's it for our live coverage on Monday 29 November. We'll continue to bring you more analysis across the BBC Scotland News website. For now, stay safe and have a good afternoon.  Reality Check The evidence does support
this claim by Nicola Sturgeon. According toUK government statistics,external, vaccination uptake in Scotland for the first dose (as a percentage
of the population over the age of 12) is at 90.8%, while in England this is
88.2%. In Scotland, uptake for the second dose is 82.5% with 80.2% in England. The booster roll-out â which Ms Sturgeon says she will accelerate further in
the face of the new Omicron variant â is at 34.1%, while Englandâs uptake is
30.%, only just above that of Wales. Meanwhile Northern Ireland's uptake is lowest for all three doses. A total of 1,629,572 in
Scotland have received a booster according to Public Health Scotland - 14,772,591
have in England. Reality Check Nicola Sturgeon said she was âproudâ that NHS staff in Scotland
have been awarded the highest pay rise in the UK. In May, Scotland's nurses, paramedics and allied health
professionals, as well as domestic staff, porters, healthcare support staff and
other frontline health workers were offered a 4% rise, backdated to 1 December
2020. But this does not cover doctors and dentists, who were offered a
3% rise. In July, NHS workers in England were offered a 3% pay rise. This rise was for most NHS staff including nurses, paramedics, consultants,
dentists and salaried GPs and was backdated to April 2021. A similar increase
was offered in Wales. It was later reported in August that NHS workers in Northern
Ireland would also be offered a 3% increase. Independence is not unusual, Ms Sturgeon says, with more than 100 countries taking that route in the past 60 years. ""The
fact is, independence is the normal state of affairs for countries the world
over,"" she says. ""With

"More than 17 million UK customers have now used a buy now pay later (BNPL) company to make an online purchase, company data shows. The payment method is also set to have its biggest Christmas yet, experts say. BNPL firms allow people to manage their shopping, either by postponing their bill for a short while, or splitting it into more manageable chunks over time, interest free. But critics say users too easily end up in debt and tougher rules are needed. The biggest provider in the UK, Klarna, has seen its customer base double to 15 millionsince early 2020. The market's other main players, Clearpay and LayBuy, are also expanding fast. Growth is fastest among users in their 40s and 50s, showing BNPL is no longer just a millennial and Gen Z trend. A recent survey,externalfor Citizens Advice found that almost one in 10 people were planning to use BNPL to help with Christmas shopping. Kate Hobson from Citizens Advice urged consumers ""not to spend more than they can afford"". ""If you're considering using buy now pay later, make sure you understand what you're signing up for, how you'll make the repayments and what will happen if you can't pay on time,"" she added. The main players in the market, however, feel they offer consumers a hassle-free means to pay for purchases without interest. It is also much cheaper than a credit card if late payment fees aren't incurred, they add. Buy Now Pay Later: 'I'm stressed over debt' Charities sound alarm over buy-now-pay-later debt Klarna, which launched in the UK in 2014, charges no interest or fees if payments are on time and claims around 40% of users repay money early. The servicelaunched a ""pay now"" optionand updated its terms ahead of an expected crackdown on the sector. Platform Clearpay stresses it does not report late paying users to credit agencies, and maintains that many of its users are in fact better with their money than they are given credit for. ""There are misperceptions that young people are bad at saving and investing money, however a report by Accenture on Clearpay users has shown that young people are more cautious with money than older people,"" a spokesperson said. LayBuy saw transactions grow 500% between 2019 and 2020 and the company reported a 56% spike in transactions last November, as Christmas shopping commenced. The family-run business, which was the first to run affordability checks on users, has since listed on the Australian Stock Exchange. Millions of shoppers use buy now pay later services to spread the cost of their online shopping throughout the year. Like any kind of credit, if you keep on top of it, it can be a sensible way of making sure you're not hit with a big bill at one point of the year. But of course it also makes it more tempting to spend more than you would do otherwise, especially with fewer credit checks. At this time of year, with so many different credit options available and other bills due for payment, lots of customers can get stuck in a real quagmire. It's always important to check the terms and conditions before you sign up - figure out what you are expected to pay back and when, don't just clip 'Pay Later' and hope for the best. If you do get into difficulties then flag it up quickly, most of the companies can arrange repayment plans with you which are more manageable if you contact them. And of course get advice from a debt charity directly if you are feeling stuck. The Treasury is consulting on how to regulate the BNPL sector, and the Financial Conduct Authority will publish proposals some time next year. A Treasury spokesperson said it was taking a ""proportionate approach"". ""Buy now pay later can be a helpful way to manage your finances so it's important that regulation is balanced and proportionate, ensuring that customers are given appropriate protections."" But many charities want action to be taken sooner, arguing that many consumers could be pushed into borrowing more than they can afford this Christmas. Debt charity Christians Against Poverty recognises BNPL can be ""attractive"", especially at Christmas, but it worries users could lose track of spending. ""We're particularly concerned about those consumers who turn to credit like BNPL as a means of keeping on top of essentials, like bills or the weekly food shop,"" said spokesman Jonathan Shaw. ""Add to this the additional pressure to spend at Christmas and consumers can be left in an even more financially difficult situation."" Growth in the sector shows no sign of slowing down. Established money brands Paypal and Monzo are poised to enter the market, and BNPL technology is evolving so that some brands can be used to make any purchase on any site.

About 9,500 homes in Killin, Perthshire, and Alford and Aboyne in Aberdeenshire had been reconnected on Monday morning. A further 7,000 properties in Braemar, Ballater, Torphins, Comrie and other areas were reconnected throughout the day. However SSEN warned that some places would not see power restored before Tuesday - and some localised faults would take even longer to repair. It advised customers in this situation to make alternative arrangements if possible. Rest centres were set up and hot food and drinks are being supplied to people, many of whom have been without electricity since Friday afternoon. Power lines were brought down by trees, including in Ballater Aberdeenshire Council chief executive Jim Savege told the BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandit had been a ""pretty tough"" time for the area. He said schools would be closed on Monday and Tuesday and they would be checked for storm damage. Vaccination clinics in Aberdeenshire were also cancelled on Monday. The Scottish government's resilience room, chaired by the deputy first minister, met on Monday afternoon. Mr Swinney urged people in need of support to contact their local council. He said: ""It is good to see that some progress is being made across the country as power is restored. ""While we are hopeful for a further recovery as soon as possible, the scale and complexity of the situation cannot be underestimated. ""Many people are still without power and water, and that's why local authorities and partners are stepping up welfare support in affected areas for those who need it."" On Monday evening, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said his thoughts were with those still facing disruption. He added: ""The situation in the north-east of Scotland is among the most concerning and, while forecasts are improving, we are on standby to provide further assistance to the Scottish government."" SSEN engineers are pictured just north of Kirriemuir Mark Rough, director of customer operations at SSEN, said: ""Storm Arwen has resulted in some of the most significant and challenging conditions experienced in the north of Scotland in decades, resulting in catastrophic damage to several overhead circuits with multiple instances of damage which need to be repaired before power can be restored. ""The damage caused by Storm Arwen is at least three times greater than we experienced from the Beast from the East storm in 2018, demonstrating the scale of challenge our teams have faced."" SSEN has been working to restore power in the following locations: Aberdeenshire: Braemar, Ballater, Kintore, Fyvie, Rothienorman, New Deer, Dyce, Methlick, Tarland, Blackburn, Forgue, Hatton, Cuminestown, Dunecht, St. Cyrus and Fettercairn Moray: Duffus, Alvah, Deskford, Collieston, Boyndie, Dufftown Angus: Maryton, Monikie and Edzell Perthshire: Milnathort, Grange, Braco and Glencarse Elsewhere, SP Energy Networks - which covers central and southern Scotland - said on Monday afternoon that it still had about 4,500 homes without supplies. The areas most badly hit are in the Borders, Dumfriesshire, Fife and the Lothians. It said the damage to the network was some of the worst it had experienced in more than 15 years and apologised to anyone affected. The company added it would be offering accommodation to vulnerable customers if it could not restore supplies overnight. A number of schools in Dumfries and Galloway have been shut due to heating or power failures. They are all expected to reopen on Tuesday. Scottish Borders Council has set up drop-in centres to provide soup, meals and hot drinks in Duns, Innerleithen, Hawick and Earlston. Scottish Water said it was continuing work to restore water supplies to customers across several areas in Aberdeenshire, Tayside and Perth, where about 1,500 properties remained without. The main areas were Aberchirder, Lumsden, Rhynie, Lumphanan, Torphins, Fortingall and Fearnan. Network Rail Scotland said signalling issues been restored on the East Coast Mainline and it was working with operators to reintroduce impacted services. Meanwhile, hundreds of seal pups werekilled at a nature reserve in the Scottish Bordersduring Storm Arwen. The National Trust for Scotland (NTS) - which operates the site at St Abb's Head - said there were 224 dead pups in the water at a bay at Pettico Wick, with more washing ashore. Forestry and Land Scotland has urged people not to visit its forests until checks for the level of damage and safety assessments have been carried out. A queue for hot food and drinks at a welfare van following a power cut in Aboyne, Aberdeenshire. In the Aberdeenshire village of Kemnay a local cafÃ© took hot drinks, soup and mince pies to a nearby care home. ""The power's been off since four o'clock on Friday,"" said Andy Hutcheon, manager of Cafe 83. ""Many of the care home residents are our customers and they've been huddled in the reception trying to stay warm. They were delighted to see us."" The cafÃ© also set up a barbeque outside for any other locals who needed a drink or food. ""There's no heating and no-one has a phone signal - so it's been pretty dire,"" he added. Across the UK, three men were killed by falling trees during the storm, which triggered the Met Office's highest red level storm warning. The 35-year-old driver of a pick-up truck was fatally injured on Friday afternoon in Aberdeenshire. Have you been experiencing a power cut since Storm Arwen?

"This video can not be played The appearance of the Omicron variant sparked Mark Drakeford's concern The first minister has urged people to ""think carefully"" about whether to meet vulnerable relatives over Christmas. Mark Drakeford said people must ""take precautions"" amid concerns over the Omicron variant of coronavirus. A senior official said it was inevitable it would be found in Wales. It comes as Welsh ministers are considering whether further restrictions are needed, but Mr Drakeford said there were no plans to close businesses. On Monday he and Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called for everyone arriving in the UK to have to isolate for eight days. But that was rejected by Downing Street. Six Omicron cases were found in Scotlandon Monday, taking the UK total to 11. Four of the cases in Scotland were identified in Lanarkshire, as well as two in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde areas. Overseas travellers to Wales to require PCR tests How worrying is the new Covid variant? Omicron: Will new measures against variant work? Two cases in Nottingham and Essex have been linked to travel to southern Africa. The third person confirmed to have the new variant is no longer in the UK, but had visited Westminster. Early evidence suggests Omicron has a higher re-infection risk than previous variants, but it is not yet known how it impacts the effectiveness of vaccines. Boosters should be offered to over-18s tohelp stop a possible Covid wave driven by the Omicron variant, UK government advisers have said. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) wants the minimum gap between the second dose and booster to be cut to three months. It said boosters should be given to the most vulnerable first. The JCVI wants those aged 12-15 to be invited for a second jab three months after their first. It recommended severely immunosuppressed people should be offered a fourth dose of the vaccine as a booster. They are currently receiving three jabs. In a statement Health Minister Eluned Morgan backed the advice. ""All individuals who are eligible for a booster will automatically receive an invitation to attend an appointment when it is their turn,"" she said, adding that there will be a ""significant number of vaccination appointments issuing over the coming weeks"". Recent Covid figures in Wales show a continuing downward trend, with cases at 490 per 100,000 people over the past seven days. Nine more deaths were reported on Monday, bringing the total to 6,391. There were 567 patients with Covid in hospital beds in Wales on Friday, down from 653 the previous week, with 47 patients being ventilated in critical care beds - down from 57. Wales' chief medical officer said Omicron took off very quickly in South Africa, in a population which had a fairly high degree of immunity Ms Sturgeon and Mr Drakeford wrote to the prime minister on Monday calling for an emergency Cobra meeting as soon as possible. ""The emergence of Omicron poses a potential threat to the UK,"" they said. ""We need to work collectively - and effectively - as four nations to take all reasonable steps to control the ingress of the virus to the country and then to limit its spread."" They said the day eight PCR test for travellers arriving in the UK should be reinstated, ""requiring isolation for that whole period"". The pair also called for business support schemes to be funded by the UK government's Treasury ""in the event more interventionist measures are required"". ""We do not want to be in a position again where our public health interventions are negatively impacted by a lack of financial support, but can be switched on as required for England,"" they said. Downing Street responded saying it does not have plans to introduce the requirement for passengers to take a PCR test on day eight as well as day two on their return to the UK. The prime minister's spokesman said: ""We believe the approach we've taken is the proportionate one to the evidence we currently have available. ""Introducing further isolation and testing requirements would have a detrimental effect on the travel industry and those planning to go travelling."" He added ministers were not planning to change their approach with regards to the furlough scheme either. The Welsh government is considering whether further restrictions are needed - but there are no plans to close businesses Health Minister Eluned Morgan told BBC Radio Cymru's Dros Frecwast programme that ministers would discuss whether Wales will need stricter measures ""over the next few days"", including whether to close schools earlier for Christmas. Mark Drakeford later said that there are no plans to close businesses - despite the call for financial support from the Treasury. He said people should approach Christmas ""in the way that we've advised all the way through"". ""Christmas should be different this year. Christmas should be better this year. ""That doesn't mean that people should neglect those simple things that we can do in our own lives, that still help to protect ourselves and others. ""Those simple precautions: think about vulnerable people, if members of your family are particularly likely to suffer from coronavirus - think carefully about whether you visit them or involve them in your plans. ""Take a lateral flow test if you're going to visit somewhere where you might be at risk or others are at risk wear masks in crowded public places."" Dr Atherton said it is a ""matter of buying time"" with the new variant, saying it was a case of when not if the variant will be identified. ""Our best line of defence against this still is vaccines and social distancing, those things that we know keep us safe because they can reduce the transmission of this new variant in the community whilst we understand the implications of it."" ""My expectation is that this will probably take off, we will see cases in Wales - we haven't seen any yet but I do expect us to see cases, they will probably increase. ""And my anxiety is also about January and February next year, because it does take time for these things to take off."" ""The Omicron variant does give us further cause for concern and the reason for that is that there's so much that's unknown. ""We don't know whether it will lead to more harm than the Delta variety and if it does then hospital rates could go up. So we just need to be cautious for the moment, not to throw caution to the wind"". Face coverings and social distancing are the best things people can do to keep themselves safe, Wales' chief medical officer says Ten countries in southern Africa are now on the UK's travel red list,meaning that until further notice, any British or Irish residents arriving in the UK after recently visiting any of those countries will have to quarantine in an approved hotel for 10 days. Residents from the countries themselves will not be allowed into the UK until the red list status changes. Under new measures, which came into force at 04:00 GMT, everyone entering the UK from abroad must take a PCR test and isolate, pending a negative result. Masks will also be made compulsory again in shops and on public transport in England. Face coverings are already mandatory in shops, health and social care settings and on public transport in Wales.

"The Hay Festival normally attracts hundreds of thousands of literary fans to Powys ""How can you not have a library in the town of books?"" After growing up in an area with a globally renowned literature festival, 11-year-old Thomas now has dreams of becoming an author. But despite some 300,000 book fans visitingHay Festivaleach year, council cutsalmost left the Welsh border community without a library. The threats sparked such an outcry that a five-year campaign to save it was launched by residents. Thomas says David Walliams' books ""crack him up"" while Maisy's favourite is A Foal Called Storm by Helen Peters ""I think it would be a cool job to be when I am older, but I am not sure what I would write about yet,"" Thomas said. He's a frequent library user and talks from authors who visit his school during the festival have inspired him to put pen to paper. But he was ""thunderstruck"" when he heard the library faced closure. Hay Library was moved to Hay-on-Wye Primary School in June 2018 due to size and council budgetary challenges Every year since 1988 - Covid permitting, of course - everyone from presidents to celebrities flock to the quiet Powys town to talk about books. Its normal population of 1,500 temporarily swells to about 100,000. Former US President Bill Clinton, who visited in 2001, famously described it as the ""Woodstock of the mind"". But In 2016, Powys councilthreatened to close 10 rural libraries, including Hay's to make budget cuts. Books 'open blind boy Ted's eyes to world' Overdue library book returned 73 years late For 10-year-old Maisy, taking away the library would ultimately take away ""lots of opportunities"". For her, the library is ""excellent"" because ""there's always a book for everyone"". But the library, which has been there since 1947, has inspired not only the younger generation. Tom Hatherill says his first trip to the library as a child was ""awe inspiring"" ""Books are an integral part"" of 83-year-old Tom Hatherill, who's from Hay. ""It's in my blood,"" he said. ""It's important for the youngsters and elderly people because we were brought up to be book readers. To take it from us would be a big loss."" Tom did not know what a library was until his mates introduced him in 1947. Since then he has fallen in love with the ""real gem of a place"" - he currently has three Hay Public Library books on the go. He found the proposal to shut the library ""ridiculous"" when attending one of the first meetings in 2016. Hay-on-Wye Library Supporters' first campaign meeting took place in the library in October 2016 Librarian launched books on tape after going blind Old and rare books among 400,000 destroyed in fire Following that meeting, a group of 25 members soon turned into 400 after leafleting, public meetings and demonstrations in the town to campaign against the library's closure. After keeping the threat at bay for years, Hay-on-Wye Library Supporters (HOWLS) ""couldn't believe it"" when plans were announced to slash Powys' rural library service by Â£200,000 in 2019. It meant all rural libraries in Powys could be closed and Hay's newly-built library, now homed in a primary school, faced becoming an empty room of books with no librarian once again. The author of His Dark Materials trilogy Philip Pullman called the plan ""a disgrace to civilisation"" and ""an act of destructive folly""at Hay Festival in 2018. The public outcry of support prompted an extensive rethink by the council after the proposal failed to win backing by just one vote. Opening hours and staffing at the library were threatened and it could not afford to run on volunteers alone, says Anita Wright ""It's been a fight to keep our library open,"" said Anita Wright, chair of HOWLS. She said the community had been ""outraged"", adding: ""If you're a single mum you can go in there to meet other parents at story time and we've had a number of homeless people go in there and seek support from a librarian over the years."" With the town no longer having a community centre and registrar's office, Anita said the library was ""not just a place you can borrow a book, it's a community hub"", adding: ""It's the last outward facing part of our local council."" ""I wasn't going to let them take that from us,"" Anita said. So this time, HOWLS changed strategy. A 170 'Hands Off Hay Library' sticker campaign launched by Michael Eccles was a ""blistering success"", he says It set up HayPublicLibrary.org Community Interest Company (CIC) with the aim to negotiate a five-year contract with Powys to keep its loved library open. After conducting consultations with libraries in the county, Councillor Rachel Powell found that Hay's CIC was a potential resolution to saving libraries locally. Hay Library lends about 17 books an hour, with 340 borrowed a week. Hay is filled with book shops, but only has one public library Michael Eccles, founder and director of the CIC, said the cuts were confusing considering it cost Powys just 2.23% of its combined library budget to run, ranks the fourth cheapest library to run in the county and has the lowest cost per loan. In negotiations, Michael said it became more evident to everyone from these statistics that Hay was an ""extremely good"" library to arrange a legally binding contract with to keep it alive. Hay Festival contributes Â£5,000 a year to the town's public library ""I don't know... all I know is we've got the basis for looking forward,"" said Anita. The contract has an option to extend if the town raises Â£25,000 over the next five years, but supporters are aiming to top that. Michael sees the future of the library as a place not only to lend books, but to develop networks that look after ""the resilience and security of our local community"". He said, in light of the climate crisis, he plans to use the library to facilitate welfare security, food security and more. Ms Powell said: ""This has only been successful due to those members behind it, whose shared vision and willingness to work with the local authority in collaboration, has ensured the future of Hay Library is secured.""

"Efforts to create so-called green jobs need to intensify if the UK government is to achieve its target of two million roles by 2030, according to a report. Jobs linked to the green economy accounted for 1.2% of all advertised roles in the year to July 2021, consultancy PwC said. That equates to just 124,600 new jobs. Boosting green job creation is part of the government's ""green industrial revolution"" plans. In November 2020,the government announcedÂ£4bn would be spent as part of its plans to create two million green jobs by 2030. Green jobs: The new generation of workers making it work for them COP26: Leaders agree global plan to boost green technology The COP 26 summit held in Glasgow a year later has put the issue into sharp focus again. But there are concerns that the green jobs transition could pose some risks, as it will have an impact on traditional jobs, especially in polluting industries. In September,the Trade Union Congress (TUC) warnedup to 660,000 jobs could be at risk if the UK fails to reach its net-zero target as quickly as other nations. The simplest answer is a job that directly contributes to tackling climate change, although many think it should also cover roles that indirectly support that ambition. Growing sectors where one might find more green jobs being advertised include low-carbon farming, heating without emissions, and wind turbine maintenance. In its research, PwC said jobs that support the green economy indirectly should also be considered green. Such roles might include environmental advisers or experts in environmental or sustainability research and education. PwC's report said work was needed to ensure the move to a net-zero economy does not add to regional inequalities. It found that Wales, Northern Ireland and Yorkshire and the Humber lagged behind other parts of the UK in terms of transitioning to a greener economy. Scotland and London were the top performers, according to the research. PwC ranked areas in terms of how they performed in job creation, the benefits of green jobs, the loss of ""sunset jobs"", the carbon intensity of employment, and green workplaces. They hunted for online job ads that mentioned things like sustainability and environment - there had to be a number of mentions. Wind turbine maintenance is among the sectors providing green job opportunities Kevin Ellis, PwC chairman and senior partner, said: ""Jobs are getting greener and this is cause for optimism, but evidence is needed on the level and distribution of these opportunities. ""Left unchecked, green employment will grow in the most fertile spots, but not necessarily where they're needed most. ""By acting now, we have a massive opportunity to rebalance the economy and ensure a fair transition."" A government spokesman told the BBC: ""As this data shows, hundreds of thousands of green jobs are being created across the country, and our landmark Net Zero Strategy sets out how the UK will accelerate this growth, unlocking Â£90bn in private investment. ""Our plans will see the majority of new green jobs to be created and supported outside London and the south east, with our shift to a low carbon economy providing an unprecedented opportunity to attract new, future-proof businesses in our industrial heartlands.""
