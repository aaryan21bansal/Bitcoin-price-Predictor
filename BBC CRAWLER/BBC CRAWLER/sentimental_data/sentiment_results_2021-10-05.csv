"In future platforms such as TikTok will have Ofcom keeping a close eye over how they enforce policies Ofcom has laid out the measures it will require video-sharing platforms to take to better protect users. The VSPs, including TikTok, Snapchat, Vimeo and Twitch, must take ""appropriate measures"" to protect users from  content related to terrorism, child sexual abuse and racism. A third of users have seen hateful content on such sites, Ofcom says. The regulator will fine VSPs that breach the guidelines or - in serious cases - suspend the service entirely. The VSPs will have to: provide and effectively enforce clear rules for uploading content make the reporting and complaints process easier restrict access to adult sites with robust age-verification Ofcom promised a report next year into whether those in scope - and there are 18 in total - were taking the appropriate steps. Specific legal criteria determine whether a service meets the definition of a VSP and whether it falls within UK jurisdiction. YouTube is expected to fall under the Irish regulatory regime but it will come in scope of the Online Safety Bill, which has a much broader remit to tackle online harms on the big technology platforms, such as Twitter, Facebook and Google, once that becomes law. Ofcom said one of its main priorities in the coming year would be to work with VSPs to reduce the risk of child sexual abuse material being uploaded.

"Fresh tensions surfaced last week over the number of fishing licences issued to French fishermen France has intensified pressure on the UK over post-Brexit fishing rights, warning bilateral co-operation could be at risk. The government in Paris is angry that the UK granted 12 licences out of 47 bids for smaller vessels to fish in its territorial waters. French Prime Minister Jean Castex has accused the UK of not respecting its Brexit deal commitments on fishing. ""Britain does not respect its own signature,"" he told French MPs. ""Month after month, the UK presents new conditions and delays giving definitive licences... this cannot be tolerated."" The prime minister warned that all bilateral agreements with the UK could be at risk if the European Commission did not take a tougher stance on the UK government. No details were given, but the two countries have a raft of agreements covering defence, security and border controls as well as energy and trade. The UK's Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has said the government's approach has been reasonable and fully in line with its commitments. Speaking at the Conservative party conference, the UK's Brexit minister rejected French claims that the UK was in breach of the Brexit trade deal. Lord Frost insisted that 98% of EU applications to fish in British waters had been granted, adding that the UK had been ""extremely generous"". The Commission said it was in constant contact with UK authorities to ensure all licence applications were dealt with as soon as possible. ""The UK has published its methodology and we are now discussing the differences with the British and Jersey authorities regarding the rights of the boats involved."" BBC Brussels correspondent Jessica Parker says there is little sense that the Commission is poised to act, with post-Brexit relations in a delicate state as the EU prepares solutions for fixing the controversial Northern Ireland Protocol. Fresh tensions surfaced last week between Britain and France over post-Brexit fishing rights. France was infuriated last week by the relatively small number of licences granted to smaller vessels, when Sea Minister Annick Girardin spoke of French fishing being ""taken hostage"" for political ends. The UK said it would consider further evidence to support remaining bids for fishing rights. France on Tuesday repeated its threat to cut the UK off from energy supplies. A UK government document in July said that 47% of the country's electricity imports were from France. French Europe Minister ClÃ©ment Beaune told Europe 1 radio: ""The UK depends on our energy exports, they think they can live alone while also beating up on Europe and, given that it doesn't work, they engage in aggressive one-upmanship."" The Channel island of Jersey became a flashpoint for tensions last May, when French fishermenstaged a protest outside the port of St Helierand two Royal Navy ships were sent to patrol the area. At the time Ms Girardinthreatened to cut off Jersey's electricity supply- 95% of which is delivered by three underwater cables from France. EXPLAINER:Who really owns UK fishing rights? French fishermen complained about being prevented from operating in British waters because of difficulties in obtaining licences. Under an agreement with the EU, French boat operators must show a history of fishing in the area to receive a licence for Jersey's waters. But it has been claimed additional requirements were added without notice.

"Oliver Dowden was speaking at a Conservative conference fringe meeting ""People need to get off their Pelotons and back to their desks,"" Conservative Party Chairman Oliver Dowden has said. The ex-culture secretary said civil servants working from home should ""lead by example"" by returning to the office. A union representing civil servants said his comments were an ""insult"" to thousands of dedicated government workers. Boris Johnson is expected to repeat the ""get back to work"" message in his Tory conference speech on Wednesday. It comes after top civil servant Sarah Healey said she preferred working from home because she could spend more time on her Peloton exercise bicycle. According to the Daily Mail,external, Ms Healey, who is the permanent secretary at Mr Dowden's former department, told a conference last month: ""I have a Peloton and I can just get on my bike whenever I have a teeny bit of time. ""That has been a huge benefit to my well-being, the lack of travelling time eating into my day."" Will work-from-home rules change again in England? Peloton cuts price of bike as sales growth slows Mr Dowden, who was moved from the Department of Culture, Media and Sport in last month's cabinet reshuffle, said: ""I like my permanent secretary at DCMS enormously, Sarah Healey, but I am disagreeing with her on this one. ""I think people need to get off their Pelotons and get back to their desks."" Sales of Pelotons surged during lockdown Speaking at Daily Telegraph fringe event at the Conservative Party conference, Mr Dowden said: ""People really want the government to lead by example - they want civil servants to get back to work as well. We've got to start leading by example on that."" He said there were currently ""more desks occupied"" at Conservative Party headquarters than in his former department. The government has clashed with trade unions for changing its advice to civil servants working from home andsuggesting staff were being ""lazy"". The First Division Association, which represents senior civil servants, accused Mr Dowden of ""hypocrisy"" and pandering to the party faithful, with his latest comments. ""As the civil service, the broader public sector and thousands of companies in the private sector already know, what you deliver is far more important than where it's delivered from,"" FDA general secretary Dave Penman said. ""The pandemic has driven a quiet revolution in working practices that has seen innovation and reform from both the public and private sectors. ""Yet despite the incredible feats performed, ministers continue to want to stand in the way of progress and reform for the sake of a quick headline."" The ""vast majority of staff want hybrid working"", said the FDA leader, and it was key to the government's plan to move civil service jobs out of London. ""The hypocrisy of ministers - who are happy to bank the savings in office space delivered by hybrid working but decry the practice for the party faithful - is frankly insulting to the dedication, professionalism and commitment of hundreds of thousands of public servants,"" he added. In a statement, the Cabinet Office said civil servants have been working hard to deliver the government's priorities ""from home and the workplace"" since the pandemic began. ""Like other employers, the civil service continues to follow the latest government guidance and is gradually increasing the numbers of staff in the workplace,"" it added. Sales of Peloton exercise bikes - which cost Â£1,750 plus monthly subscriptions to online classes - surged during lockdown, although they have slowed down in recent months.

"The secret owners of more than 1,500 UK properties bought using offshore firms have been uncovered by a BBC investigation. The details are featured in the Pandora Papers leak of offshore financial documents and list property with an estimated value in excess of Â£4bn. The owners include high-profile foreign politicians, individuals accused of corruption and UK political donors. Ministers say they will bring in a new law when they have parliamentary time. Successive Conservative governments have pledged to introduce legislation making it compulsory to name those owning property via foreign companies in a bid to stamp out money-laundering. Among the revelations: Retail magnateSir Philip Green and his wife went on a buying spreeof London property while the couple's recently sold High Street empire teetered on the verge of collapse TheQatari ruling family purchased two of London's most expensive homes through offshore companies,external, saving millions of pounds in tax Ukrainian billionaire Gennadiy Bogolyubov, who is under investigation by the FBI and had hundreds of millions in assets frozen in a fraud case, owns more than Â£400m of UK property A Â£40m London office block is owned by the son of sanctioned Russian oligarch Mikhail Gutseriev The BBC worked with theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ),,externalthe Guardian, Finance Uncovered and other media outlets to identify in the leaked files the individuals behind overseas companies that owned property in England and Wales. A simple guide to the Pandora Papers leak Your guide to nine years of finance leaks World leaders deny wrongdoing after Pandora leaks Owning real estate through an offshore firm is legal, and there is no suggestion of wrongdoing in simply using a foreign company to purchase property. However, the UK government recently raised its own assessment of the money laundering risk for the property market from ""medium"" to ""high"". The greatest level of risk is where there are ""difficulties in determining the ultimate beneficial owners"", according to aHome Office report,externalin December 2020. It comes as a number of world leaders - including the King of Jordan and the ruling family of Azerbaijan - havefeatured in the Pandora Papers leakafter buying property in the UK using offshore companies. The wife of retail tycoon Sir Philip Green purchased multi-million-pound prime London real estate as BHS, the department store chain they had owned, headed for collapse. Her identity as the buyer of properties in London was hidden because they were bought through anonymous companies based in the British Virgin Islands, a tax haven. The purchases included a Â£15m apartment in Mayfair and a new home for their daughter near Buckingham Palace, bought for Â£10.6m in 2016. The buying spree took place in the months after the Greens sold BHS for a token sum to a one-time bankrupt who had no retail experience. The chain collapsed, leading to the loss of 11,000 jobs and vacant sites in town centres. The downfall also led to an outcry when it emerged the business had left a black hole of up to Â£571m in its pension fund. Through their lawyers, both Sir Philip and Lady Green declined to answer detailed questions, suggesting that these were private matters. The Pandora Papers leak also reveals the property portfolio of the Qatari ruling family owned through another cross-border network of companies. The royal Al-Thani family purchased two properties on one of the world's most expensive terraces, overlooking Regent's Park in London. They were bought through offshore companies, saving millions of pounds in tax. BBC analysis found numerous other properties owned by members of the family through these structures, estimated to be worth over Â£650m. The Qatari government did not respond to questions about the BBC's findings. Gennadiy Bogolyubov is a Ukrainian billionaire who is under investigation by the FBI for money laundering. He and his business partner are accused of defrauding the bank they founded of more than Â£1bn. Court documents included in the Pandora Papers reveal him to be the ultimate owner of a collection of UK properties likely to be worth over Â£400m, including a building on Trafalgar Square. They are held via a network of companies, some offshore, that hide the identity of the owners. Mr Bogolyubov is the co-founder of PrivatBank, Ukraine's largest lender. The bank was nationalised in 2016 after regulators found a $5.5bn hole in its balance sheets. PrivatBank has been pursuing Mr Bogolyubov and his business partner Igor Kolomoisky through court action in England and the US, trying to reclaim more than $3bn relating to the money lost during their leadership. In 2020 the US Department of Justice sought to seize commercial properties in Texas, Ohio and Kentucky from the pair, suspecting that they were ""acquired using funds misappropriated from Privatbank"". The court cases are ongoing. Mr Bogolyubov's assets are currently subject to a worldwide freeze, secured in court by PrivatBank in 2017. In 2016 he decided to leave the country and settle in Switzerland, partly for ""tax reasons"". Lawyers for Mr Bogolyubov declined to comment as legal action is ongoing. Mikhail Gutseriev is a Russian oligarch who was sanctioned by the UK in August for his close relationship with Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko.  The Pandora Papers reveal that his son owns a multi-million pound office block through a secret offshore company, purchased for more than Â£40m. Mr Gutseriev is the founder of Safmar Group, a Russian conglomerate with interests in oil, coal, property and retail. Following the crackdown on human rights and democracy in Belarus in 2020, the UK and EU have recently brought in sanctions against President Lukashenko, along with Mr Gutseriev and other close associates. The British government has accused the Belarusian regime of continuing to ""crush democracy and violate human rights"". It described Mr Gutseriev as ""a prominent Russian businessman who is one of the main private investors in Belarus and a longstanding associate of Alexander Lukashenko"". It added that he had ""provided support for the government of Belarus, including through use of his business interests"". Mr Gutseriev is no longer involved in Safmar, which is now part-owned by his son, Said, a British citizen. Said Gutseriev's representatives told the BBC he did not have ""any business links with his father"".His lavish wedding made headlines in 2016 - it featured performances by Jennifer Lopez and Enrique Iglesias and was reported to have cost $1bn. Plans for a register of foreign companies owning UK property were first announced in 2016 by then Prime Minister David Cameron, so that ""corrupt individuals and countries will no longer be able to move, launder and hide illicit funds through London's property market, and will not benefit from our public funds"". Draft legislation was published two years later and ""progress"" on changing the law was promised in the 2019 Queen's Speech. Earlier this year, following the G7 summit, the government reiterated its commitment to create a public register of overseas entities who own UK real estate. However, the law has still not been introduced to Parliament and was not listed as one of the government's legislative priorities at this year's Queen's Speech. Labour MP Margaret Hodge told the BBC that when in government David Cameron and his Chancellor George Osborne ""promised us that they would create a public register of beneficial ownership here in the UK... but we've been waiting since 2016 for that promise to be enacted"". She added: ""It's ready, it's sitting there, it's not complicated... but it has yet to emerge... so it's a scandal that that's not happened."" The government says it is cracking down on money laundering with tougher laws and enforcement, and that it will introduce a register of offshore companies owning UK property when parliamentary time allows. The UKproperty holdings of the King of Jordanand theruling family of Azerbaijanwere exposed by BBC Panorama on Sunday. Lawyers for King Abdullah said he used his personal wealth to buy the homes and there was nothing improper about him using offshore firms to do so. Other revelations from the Pandora Papers highlight further links between foreign leaders and offshore ownership of UK property. The family of Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta, which has dominated the country's politics since independence,secretly owned offshore companies for decades. One of these firms bought an apartment in central London, according to Land Registry records. The company was set up by Ngina Kenyatta, the president's mother, and her two daughters Kristina and Anna. In 2018, Mr Kenyatta told the BBC Hardtalk programme that his family's wealth was known to the public, and as president he had declared his assets as required by law. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky participated in a network of offshore companies, co-owned with his long-time friends and TV business partners,the Guardian revealed on Sunday.,external These firms held assets including apartments near London's Regent's Park. A number of world leaders havereleased statements denying wrongdoingafter featuring in the leak. Closer to home, major political donors to the Conservatives have invested in properties through offshore companies. Mohammed Amersi, bought two properties using offshore companies:a Mayfair townhouse and a country home in Gloucestershire. He was revealed by Panorama to have been involved in one of Europe's biggest corruption scandals. He denies any wrongdoing. Lubov Chernukhin has given more than Â£1.8m to the party since 2012.The Pandora Papers leak revealed the scale of the secret offshore wealth she shares with her husband, a former Russian minister. It includes a house near Regent's Park in London now worth about Â£38m, and a mansion in Oxfordshire bought for Â£10m. The properties were secretly acquired through a network of offshore companies. Mrs Chernukhin's lawyers say she is a British citizen and is entitled to do as she wishes with her money Russian businessman Victor Fedotov's companieshave given Â£900,000 to MPs. He purchased a Hampshire manor house through a network of offshore companies. Files in the Pandora Papers suggest he made millions from a project that became mired in allegations of corruption. Mr Fedotov's lawyers said ""there is no evidence whatsoever"" he behaved improperly. The BBC searched for information about donors to all of the political parties among the Pandora Papers documents but the stories that emerged from the files were about Conservative donors. The Pandora Papers is a leak of almost 12 million documents and files exposing the secret wealth and dealings of world leaders, politicians and billionaires. The data was obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in Washington DC and has led to one of the biggest ever global investigations. More than 600 journalists from 117 countries have looked at the hidden fortunes of some of the most powerful people on the planet. BBC Panorama and the Guardian have led the investigation in the UK.

"The government says vulnerable households across the country ""will be able to access a new Â£500m support fund to help them with essentials"" A Â£20-a-week increase to universal credit (UC), brought in to help people on low incomes struggling through the Covid pandemic, is being withdrawn from Wednesday. The government has always said the extra money was going to be temporary, but MPs, pressure groups and charities have argued it should be kept in place to help those who are struggling. We asked three women how the reduction will affect their lives. Universal credit: End of the Â£20 boost explained Harriet Duffy had to stop work after being hit by a car Although the reduction in Harriet Duffy's UC payment is imminent, she can barely think about the financial impact. ""I feel overwhelmed,"" she says. ""I literally just take each day as it comes. It's been daunting."" She's been on UC since February last year. When hit by a car while cycling, Harriet fractured her leg, and was forced to leave her twin jobs as a door-to-door charity helper and call centre worker. The Â£20 uplift made a ""phenomenal difference"", she says. ""People have come to rely on it."" And the money has been all the more important in the last few months. Harriet now has a four-month-old son. ""We are currently in temporary accommodation. I'm in a hotel until the 18th, but after that I've not got a clue where I am going to be. ""The accommodation has no access to laundry facilities - I'm using launderettes and living off microwave meals. This all comes at an expense. Losing that extra bit of income will be devastating."" For a start, Harriet says she won't be able to do basic things, like go to the launderette as often. With a baby, that could be a problem. She'd like to go back to work, but with such a young baby ""it's just not possible"". ""I'm completely aware this [uplift] hasn't always been part of UC and was only supposed to be temporary,"" she says when asked for a message to the government. ""But a lot people have become reliant on it during this time."" Nicola Flower says the Â£20-a-week uplift helped pay for heating during her cancer treatment For Nicola Flower, from Cornwall, the uplift in universal credit has helped her stay warm by paying for heating bills during her cancer treatment. She told the BBC she has had to shield for a year due to the coronavirus pandemic and is still waiting for an operation. ""I had no choice but to go on it [universal credit],"" she said. ""It was a godsend because I wouldn't have managed otherwise. I have never been on benefits before in my life. I have always done three jobs."" Nicola, who worked as a seamstress, in a supermarket and as a cleaner, said the she knew the Â£20 uplift was ""an extra"", but added with fuel prices and gas prices rising, she could do with the money. ""When I was going through my treatment I was quite ill and I needed the heating on day and night so it allowed me to pay for that, otherwise I don't know what I would have done to be quite honest,"" she said. ""I would have gone into debt."" ""I was quite ill, especially with the chemotherapy,"" she adds. She also suffers issues with her joints and fears the problem could get worse when it gets colder. ""I will need the heating on to keep my joints warm."" Nicola said she knows she ""physically"" cannot go back to doing three jobs and isn't sure if she could go back to two. ""If I had to go back to doing one job, my lifestyle would have to change dramatically,"" she said. ""I have no options at the moment, I'm not fit to go back to work."" She said the government had ""not got a clue how the average person manages, lives, survives"". ""I don't think half of them know how much a pint of milk is,"" she added. Deirdre McCausland says she is concerned about how the reduction in UC will affect her children Deirdre McCausland was a secondary school teacher in England before moving to Northern Ireland. She thought she could get a job but ""fell into the benefits trap"". Deirdre said the Â£20-a-week UC uplift made a ""massive"" difference to her. Her daughter may not have been able to go to grammar school without the extra cash. ""It got to the point where if I hadn't had the Â£20 extra, I was contemplating putting her into a school where perhaps it was closer and the uniform was cheaper,"" she said. Deirdre's daughter needs to get the bus, but doesn't qualify for a weekly bus pass. ""As you can imagine, the money [Â£20] goes a long way,"" Deirdre says. Her daughter wants to pursue a career in music, and the money is helping to pay for her piano and guitar lessons. ""That's what she wants to do in later life, and I may have to take something away from her. It will gall me to have to say to her: 'I need to make cutbacks',"" Deirdre says. The reduction ""will have a massive impact on my children"", she adds. ""When government is deciding these things, they don't speak to real people with real experiences. They don't realise the impact that will have on children."" She says there is a ""domino effect"" which means a reduction in benefits leads to debt, effects on adult and child mental health, and it perpetuates poverty. A government spokesman said: ""We've always been clear that the uplift to Universal Credit was temporary. ""It was designed to help claimants through the economic shock and financial disruption of the toughest stages of the pandemic, and it has done so.

"The Scottish government has announced a Â£300m funding package to help the health services get through the ""extremely challenging"" winter ahead. The plan includes the hiring of extra support workers, cash for care at home services and a pay rise for care staff. Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said it was ""vital"" to maximise the capacity of the NHS as winter approaches. But opposition parties claimed the plans were a ""sticking plaster"" for a health service facing crisis. And the GMB union said the pay rise for social care staff did not go far enough, calling for a ""substantial"" increase in the basic rate of pay to Â£15 per hour. Shortage of carers fuelling hospital crisis 'There are so many calls and not enough ambulances' Doctors are exhausted, says BMA chief Scotland's health services are already under severe pressure in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, with demand ""extremely high"" and the NHS on an emergency footing. Mr Yousaf warned MSPs that the NHS was ""under more pressure than it has been at any point in the pandemic"", adding that ""quite frankly it is likely to get worse"" in the coming months. The minister announced a multi-year funding package worth more than Â£300m for hospital and community care services, which includes the recruitment of 1,000 additional support staff in the NHS. It also includes Â£40m for ""step down"" care, which enables hospital patients to temporarily move into care homes or get extra help at home, and Â£60m to maximise the capacity of care at home services. Social care workers will be given a pay rise to a minimum of Â£10.02 per hour, while Â£4m will be invested in ""staff wellbeing"" - with a focus on the physical and emotional needs of workers. Humza Yousaf told MSPs that the pressure on health services was only likely to increase during winter Mr Yousaf said the measures would help reduce delays in patient discharge from hospitals and reduce pressure on unpaid carers. He said: ""This significant new investment will help get people the care they need as quickly as possible this winter. Bolstering the caring workforce by increasing their numbers, providing them with additional support, and increasing the wages of social care staff. ""Our NHS, social care staff and social work staff have been remarkable throughout the pandemic and today's additional investment will help support them to deliver care to people across Scotland this winter."" The GMB union said the promised pay rise ""isn't nearly enough"" to tackle an ""understaffing crisis in social care"". Calling for a Â£15 per hour minimum, GMB Scotland Secretary Louise Gilmour said: ""To transform social care for the people who need it and the people who deliver it, particularly as we roll-out a national care service, then we must go further."" At Holyrood, opposition parties welcomed the extra funding but also said ministers must go further. Scottish Conservative public health spokeswoman Sue Webber said there was a ""growing crisis"" in the NHS even before the winter, with long waiting times at A&E departments and queues at vaccination clinics. ""While I really welcome the Â£300m outlined today in investment in our NHS and comments around investing in our workforce, we continue to need to see urgent action now."" Meanwhile Labour's deputy leader Jackie Baillie said the plan ""feels like a sticking plaster for a much more profound problem"". She said supermarket checkout workers were paid more than social care staff, adding: ""You will not retain or recruit staff if you continue to pay the low wages.""

"Covid passes will be required in nightclubs in Wales, under the plans Mandatory Covid passes in nightclubs and large events will be introduced in Wales as planned on 11 October after Welsh ministers won a knife-edge Senedd vote. The measures were agreed with 28 politicians voting for and 27 voting against. It came despite politicians in the opposition uniting against the plans. The public will be expected to show evidence of being fully vaccinated or having a recent negative Covid test. Conservative Vale of Clwyd Member of the Senedd (MS) Gareth Davies did not take part in the vote, with the Tories citing ""technical difficulties"" for what happened. Nightclub industry representatives said it was a ""shambles"". If all opposition MSs had taken part the government would have lost in a tie, with the Tories, Lib Dems and Plaid opposed to the scheme. Health Minister Eluned Morgan told MSs not supporting the law ""will be an act of gross irresponsibility"", but Plaid Cymru had said it was open to exploitation. Protesters had gathered outside the Senedd's buildings on Tuesday evening, chanting ""shame on you"", following the result. What is a Covid pass and how do I get one? Covid pass breaches 'should not be police priority' Wales to introduce Covid passes from next month Ahead of the vote, Conservative MS Darren Millar could be heard telling Presiding Officer Elin Jones: ""I'm sorry we still have a member who is desperately trying to get into Zoom."" Ms Jones replied that she would still hold the vote: ""We have made every opportunity possible for that named member to get in, including sharing my personal phone."" Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies, who is ill, was also not present but Labour had agreed for one of their MSs not to vote in return. The Senedd is sitting in a hybrid format - with some MSs attending in person in the 60-person chamber and some joining via Zoom. The Welsh Conservatives said: ""A number of members across political groups experienced technical difficulties with the voting system this evening, which demonstrates why the hybrid Parliament in Wales must come to an end. ""We reaffirm our view that such significant votes should be held in person on the floor of the Senedd and Welsh Conservatives remain steadfastly opposed to the introduction of Covid passports."" However Plaid Cymru's Rhun ap Iorwerth in a tweet defended the hybrid system: ""Unless there's very good reason and/or with advance approval... I think you should be able to vote only from your offices at home/Senedd/constituency."" ""Not e.g. party conference,"" he added. Night Time Industries Association Wales, which represents 100 venues in Wales and is opposed to the plans, called for an ""urgent revote"". It said it was a ""democratic outrage that one MS who wanted to vote, and who would've voted against the proposals, could not, due to a mere technical error. This shambles will cause even more uncertainty for our businesses."" Presiding Officer, Elin Jones, later said in a statement: ""I gave every opportunity for the member to be present - including providing ICT support - but the member was unable to be contacted. ""For members to vote in the Senedd, they must be present, either in the chamber or on Zoom. ""It is a member's responsibility to give themselves sufficient time to secure their Zoom connection in time for voting, just as it is for any member travelling to the Senedd to vote."" People opposed to vaccine passports took part in a protest on the Senedd steps on Tuesday Hundreds gathered on the Senedd steps on Tuesday to protest against the measures. Following the decision protests moved to the front of Senedd office building TÅ· Hywel, and near the complex's car park exit, with security personnel and two armed police officers deployed on the other side of the barrier. Tory MS Sam Kurtz said he was ""stuck in my TÅ· Hywel office as protestors shout 'shame on you' and block us from leaving. To be fair, I'm as frustrated as them"". Plaid revealed in a Senedd debate on Tuesday afternoon that it would vote against the government. Rhun ap Iorwerth said the regulations proposed by the Welsh government had raised ""more questions than they provide answers"". ""There is insufficient evidence and little detail on how it will work in practice. In particular, the rapid test loophole, which represents a fudge on the part of the government, makes the system open to exploitation. ""We've asked many questions and haven't been given the assurances we've sought. And it's for that reason that we feel unable to support these regulations today."" Plaid called for ministers to withdraw the vote and said it would ""contribute to discussions on how something more robust could be brought forward, better evidenced, and with clarity on implication"". Welsh Lib Dem Jane Dodds said: ""Today's vote sets a dangerous precedent for bad law-making here in Wales and an unnecessary government overreach into our civil liberties without any evidence they will make us all safer."" During the debate on Tuesday Eluned Morgan said the Welsh government had not taken the decision to introduce such measures ""lightly"". ""We are taking these measures to support venues to stay open and enable events to continue taking place through a potentially very difficult and challenging autumn and winter,"" she said. The Welsh government is using a web-based system, rather than an app. Ms Morgan said she was currently aware that the Covid pass shows it is valid in England. ""This is unfortunate and reflects the fact that we share the infrastructure with the UK government."" She said the wording will change before it becomes mandatory, and promised an app which will include a pass would be available ""early in 2022"". Proof of vaccination has already been required for some large events Welsh Conservative health spokesman Russell George said the implementation of Covid passes had been a ""complete disaster"" in Scotland. He said the use of them at the Labour Party conference in Brighton had also been ""plagued with problems"". He warned bringing in Covid passes in Wales risked turning the nation into a ""two-tiered society"" and ""undermines freedom of choice"". Mr George told the Senedd the Welsh government's own technical advisory cell had warned such a policy could ""backfire"". But the Welsh government hopes the passes will help prevent super-spreader events. Deputy chief medical officer Chris Jones said officials are ""keen to try to minimise the risk of these events while enabling them to continue so life can return to normal with some degree of protection"". Anyone who is over 16 and has been fully vaccinated in Wales or England, or has had a negative lateral flow test result within the past 48 hours, can get a pass. Under the Welsh government plan they would be compulsory for anyone over 18 to enter: Nightclubs Indoor no-seating events with more than 500 people Outdoor no-seating events with more than 4,000 people Any event with more than 10,000 people, including sport Users who want to show a negative test will have to self-certify their result - leading to concerns they could be faked. To prevent this, the Welsh governmentplans to make it illegal to fake a negative test. Large events could also be allowed to check passes at random, rather than check every person who attends.

"This video can not be played Watch: ""The buck stops with Mark"" A former Facebook employee has told US politicians that the company's sites and apps harm children's mental health and stoke division in society. Frances Haugen, a 37-year-old former product manager turned whistleblower, heavily criticised the company at a hearing in the Senate. Facebook has faced growing scrutiny and increasing calls for its regulation. Founder Mark Zuckerberg hit back, saying the latest accusations were at odds with the company's goals. In a letter to staff, he said many of the claims were ""illogical"" and pointed to Facebook's efforts to fight harmful content. ""We care deeply about issues like safety, well-being and mental health,"" he said in the letter, made public on his Facebook page,external. ""It's difficult to see coverage that misrepresents our work and our motives."" Facebook is the world's most popular social media site. The company says it has 2.7 billion monthly active users. Hundreds of millions of people also use the company's other products, including WhatsApp and Instagram. But it has been criticised on several fronts - from failing to protect users' privacy to not doing enough to halt the spread of disinformation. Facebook down: Zuckerberg apologises for outage Six hours without WhatsApp Ms Haugen told CBS News on Sunday that she had shared a number of internal Facebook documents with the Wall Street Journal in recent weeks. Using the documents, the WSJ reported that research carried out by Instagram showed the app could harm girls' mental health. This was a theme Ms Haugen continued during her testimony on Tuesday. ""The company's leadership knows how to make Facebook and Instagram safer, but won't make the necessary changes because they have put their astronomical profits before people,"" she said. She criticised Mark Zuckerberg for having wide-ranging control, saying that there is ""no one currently holding Mark accountable but himself."" This video can not be played Facebook's Monika Bickert says commissioning research into issues shows the company is prioritising safety above profit And she praisedthe massive outage of Facebook services on Monday, which affected users around the world. ""Yesterday we saw Facebook taken off the internet,"" she said. ""I don't know why it went down, but I know that for more than five hours, Facebook wasn't used to deepen divides, destabilise democracies and make young girls and women feel bad about their bodies."" The answer, she told senators, was congressional oversight. ""We must act now,"" she said. Mr Zuckerberg, in his letter, said the research into Instagram had been mischaracterised and that many young people had positive experiences of using the platform. But he said ""it's very important to me that everything we build is safe and good for kids"". On Monday's outage, he said the deeper concern was not ""how many people switch to competitive services or how much money we lose, but what it means for the people who rely on our services to communicate with loved ones, run their businesses, or support their communities"". Frances Haugen said the company repeatedly prioritised profits over its users safety Both Republican and Democratic senators on Tuesday were united in the need for change at the company - a rare topic of agreement between the two political parties. ""The damage to self-interest and self-worth inflicted by Facebook today will haunt a generation,"" Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal said. ""Big Tech now faces the Big Tobacco jaw-dropping moment of truth,"" he added, a reference to how tobacco firms hid the harmful effects of their products. Fellow Republican Dan Sullivan said the world would look back and ask ""What the hell were we thinking?"" in light of the revelations about Facebook's impact on children. In a statement issued after the hearing, Facebook said it did not agree with Ms Haugen's ""characterisation of the many issues she testified about"". But it did agree that ""it's time to begin to create standard rules for the internet."" ""It's been 25 years since the rules for the internet have been updated, and instead of expecting the industry to make societal decisions that belong to legislators, it is time for Congress to act,"" the statement read. Zuckerbergrattled Mark Zuckerberg's blog is lengthy and thoughtful. He doesn't name Frances Haugen - but he has clearly been rattled. His main argument is that the research she leaked has been misrepresented by both her and the media. He argues that the negative internal research has been cherry-picked and positive conclusions brushed over. Interestingly, he thinks this episode could have a chilling effect on internal research in companies - worried that bad conclusions might one day be leaked. But there is of course a simple come back to this. Release the data. Facebook and other social media companies don't have to do internal research; they could let their data be analysed independently. To be fair to Facebook, the company does give researchers some access. However, only Facebook has the full spectrum of user metrics needed to fully analyse its effect on society. His arguments too are at times overly simplified. Why would we want to make people angry, he asks. I'm sure he doesn't. But it's been proven over and over again that social media that provokes any emotion, whether it be laughter, love or anger gets more engagement. Zuckerberg believes passionately that Facebook is a force for good. It's becoming harder and harder to find people on Capitol Hill who think that.

"An inquiry will be launched into ""systematic failures"" that allowed Wayne Couzens to continue to be a police officer, Priti Patel announced. The home secretary said the public ""have a right to know"" why he remained in the Metropolitan Police despite concerns about his behaviour. Couzens kidnapped, raped and murdered Sarah Everard while he was a serving officer, using his police warrant card. He has since been linked to allegations of indecent exposure. The Met has faced mounting questions over its policies and procedures in the wake of Ms Everard's murder. It was revealed Couzens - who worked as an armed officer in the Met's parliamentary and diplomatic protection team - was linked to several alleged incidents of indecent exposure, including in the days before  Ms Everard's abduction in March. The questions facing the Met Police How a police officer planned murder PM does not support making misogyny a hate crime Speaking at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester, Ms Patel said: ""We need answers as to why this was allowed to happen. ""I can confirm today there will be an inquiry, to give the independent oversight needed, to ensure something like this can never happen again."" The Home Office said the inquiry would be in two parts, with the first examining Couzens' behaviour and establishing a definitive account of his conduct in the lead up to his conviction for Ms Everard's murder. It said the second part would address specific issues, such as vetting procedures, standards, discipline and workplace behaviour. This video can not be played Priti Patel: ""It is abhorrent that a serving police officer was able to abuse his position of power"" The exact nature of the inquiry is still unclear. The Home Office said it would initially be non-statutory but could be converted to a statutory one if required. If statutory, the inquiry would have the legal power to call witnesses and limit the government's control over how it operated. The person who would lead the inquiry and its terms of reference would be confirmed ""in due course"". Policing minister Kit Malthouse pointed out the first option - a non-statutory inquiry - was much quicker to put in place but stressed it would not begin until the separate Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) inquiry was complete. On BBC Radio 4's PM, he acknowledged his surprise on finding out that examining social media postings had only became a part of the police vetting procedure a year ago. The modern world was moving fast, he said. The vetting ""net"" has to be as tight as possible, with a regard for recruits' right to privacy while ensuring they were ""the right people with the right values"", he added. Jamie Klingler, co-founder of the campaign group Reclaim These Streets, set up after Sarah Everard's murder, insisted the inquiry needed to be statutory and judge-led - and needed to include women. ""It seems really specific about Wayne Couzens and not about the system that allowed a Wayne Couzens to happen,"" she told the BBC. ""It's not admitting that there is systemic misogyny within the force that allowed this to happen, and by not doing so it's pushing it under the carpet rather than exposing [it] at all levels."" Couzens, 48, killed Ms Everard, 33, after stopping her on a street in Clapham, south London. He was sentencedto a whole-life prison term last week. Speaking earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said hedid not support calls to make misogyny a hate crime, saying there was ""abundant"" existing legislation to tackle violence against women. He told BBC Breakfast that ""widening the scope"" of what you ask the police to do would just increase the problem - but recruiting and promoting more female officers would help change the culture within forces. There is an air of crisis in British policing as it faces a significant moment of reckoning. Never have leaders felt that public trust is so lowthey have had to advise women to consider fleeing if they are uncomfortablewhen confronted by one of their own officers. This is the aftershock of the appalling crimes of Wayne Couzens, who kidnapped, raped and murdered Sarah Everard while working for the Metropolitan Police. Despite repeated attempts to force Home Secretary Priti Patel's hand, she has very publicly backed Met Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick by renewing her contract last month. But questions now confront policing - and the difficulty its chiefs and ministers are having in answering them is why the crisis feels too deep. Was Couzens' ability to pull on the uniform a failure of the system? Is there a wider cultural problem? And how should police leaders and the government respond? Read more from Dominichere. Met Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick, who has rejected calls to resign, confirmed on Mondaythere would be a separate independent reviewinto the force's standards and culture. Speaking to the BBC, Dame Cressida said Ms Everard's murder had made ""everyone in the Met furious and we depend on public trust"". ""In this country policing is done by consent and undoubtedly the killing of Sarah and other events has damaged public trust,"" she said, adding she was determined to rebuild it. Labour's Yvette Cooper, chairwoman of the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said it was important the inquiry looked at how allegations of violence against women and girls were handled by police officers, as well as Couzens' conduct and the culture within the police. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said the inquiry ""must leave no stone unturned"" and should address reports of ""widespread cultural issues"". Speaking earlier at the Conservative Party conference, Justice Secretary Dominic Raab said making communities safer and allowing women to walk home feeling safe at night was his ""number one priority"". The Met Police said 650 more police officers would patrol hotspot areas in London over the next six months, with 150 of these working in local wards as ""Bobbies on the beat"".

"This video can not be played Influencers react to Monday's social media outage. Facebook has apologised after it stopped working for users around the world for several hours on Monday. WhatsApp and Instagram - which are owned by the company - were also down. In a nutshell, Facebook's systems stopped talking to the wider internet. It was as if ""someone had pulled the cables from their data centres all at once and disconnected them from the internet"", explained web infrastructure firmCloudflare,external. Facebook's explanation was a little more technical. It said ""configuration changes on the backbone routers that co-ordinate network traffic between our data centres caused issues that interrupted this communication"". This had a ""cascading effect... bringing our services to a halt"". Zuckerberg apologises for six-hour Facebook outage The internet breaks down into hundreds of thousands of networks. Big firms like Facebook have their own larger networks - known as autonomous systems. When you want to visit Facebook (or Instagram or WhatsApp), the back-end system that allows computers to connect with their network uses theBorder Gateway Protocol (BGP)- a kind of postal service for the internet. In order to direct people to the websites they want to visit, BGP looks at all of the available paths that data could travel and picks the best route. On Monday Facebook suddenly stopped providing the information the system needed to function. It meant nobody's computers had any way of connecting to Facebook or its other sites. The failure of such key internet players had a knock-on effect on individuals and businesses across the globe. Downdetector, which tracks outages, said some 10.6 million problems were reported around the world - the largest number ever recorded. For many, losing access to Facebook's services was just an inconvenience. But for some small businesses in the developing world without other reliable ways to communicate with customers, it may have been a serious problem. Likewise, some organisations where staff are still working remotely after the pandemic, now rely on WhatsApp to keep colleagues in touch. A flurry of reports began around 16:45 BST on Monday that Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp weren't working. At first, this caused the usual jokes about how people would cope, andjibes,externalfrom rivals such as Twitter. But it soon became clear that this was a more serious issue - with reports of mayhem at Facebook's California headquarters. Sheera Frenkel, a tech reporter for the New York Times, told the BBC part of the reason it took so long to fix was because ""the people trying to figure out what this problem was couldn't even physically get into the building"" to work out what had gone wrong. We don't yet know whether the issue was due to a software bug or simple human error. However, the conspiracy theories are already circulating - deliberate foul play from a Facebook insider being just one of many. Facebook's apology, rather embarrassingly, was posted on rival network Twitter. Mike Proulx - an analyst for research company Forrester - says the incident raises questions about the way Facebook brought lots of its technical operations together in recent years. He says it made them more efficient but means that if one thing goes wrong there can be ""a cascading effect, like old-school Christmas lights where one goes out, they all go out"". Facebook has experienced outages before but they've generally been fixed within an hour or so. A longer and more disruptive blackout like this one demonstrates the problem of so much of the world's communications being concentrated in Silicon Valley. And this in turn raises questions whether the working of the internet should be in the hands of just a few big companies. Perhaps the biggest issue for Facebook itself will have been the effect it had on its revenue and stock price. The shutdown meant ads weren't served for over six hours across its platforms. According to some, the outage could have wiped as much as $6bn (Â£4.4bn) from Mr Zuckerberg's personal wealth, with its shares dropping nearly 5%. Others estimate that the loss of revenue to the company could amount to more than $60m. And this blow to Facebook's reputation comes at a difficult time. A whistle-blower responsible for leaking many internal documents, takes the stand at a US Senate hearing today. It is also under scrutiny from regulators around the world who have questioned whether it's responding appropriately to issues such as misinformation, hate speech and handling user data, or whether - as the whistleblower says - it's putting ""growth over safety"". Now its technical abilities are also in question.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson tells Laura Kuenssberg he is ""not worried"" about a jobs gap and rising prices in the UK. Boris Johnson is famous for looking publicly on the bright side. Making people laugh, making people feel good, is part of what successful politicians do. His optimism is what defines his public persona. It's also what fuels accusations that he isn't serious about the country's problems and would rather crack a joke than crack a problem. Don't doubt though for a moment that Boris Johnson is deadly serious about power and holding on to it. PM: I'm not worried over jobs gap and price rises Are workers' salaries now rising? Sunak delivers reassurance to Tory faithful There is concern in some corners of government, including among some cabinet ministers, that Number 10 is brushing away concerns about the economy too easily. In our interview with the prime minister this morning he said he's ""not worried"" about the squeeze on supply chains, labour shortages or inflation. Speaking earlier he said there was no crisis. And he's trying to use this moment to argue that what we are seeing are merely the birth pangs of a new economic model. Business will sort things out quickly, he believes, it's down to the market to fix it, rather than government to ""patch and mend"". But talk to some of his colleagues, some of whom made their own warnings about specific economic pinch points before the summer, and you don't quite hear the same. When the prime minister displays a disregard for Westminster's conventions or politesse it's one thing. But running the risk of looking like you don't understand everyday concerns is another. The polls right now suggest that the government is not being punished for queues at the pump or empty shelves. Johnson loyalists credit his political appeal that seems to defy natural gravity. But if prices continue to creep up and disruption continues, those feelings could turn. You can't just tell people to cheer up if their gas bill is going up, their weekly shop costs more and they are losing Â£20 a week from universal credit. After what they consider asuccessful first big foreign trip, and dominance in the polls, Downing Street is in a bullish mood. But confidence can tip into complacency - a sentiment that few voters would reward.

"This video can not be played Asked about rising prices and inflation, Boris Johnson says he believes that ""supply will match demandâ. Boris Johnson is ""not worried"" about the current jobs gap and rising prices in the UK, saying supply chains will sort themselves out ""rapidly"". The PM told the BBC that the economy was facing the ""stresses and strains"" of a post-Covid recovery. But he said the country was ""moving to a new approach"", with companies paying higher wages for UK workers, rather than relying on low paid immigration. And he claimed government schemes, like the hardship fund, would help people. Mr Johnson also said he was not worried about inflation as he believed ""supply would match demand"". PM does not support making misogyny a hate crime Have these eight election promises been met? Earlier, the prime minister denied there was a crisis in the UK, despite a shortage of HGV drivers disrupting fuel deliveries and leaving some shelves empty, and a range of industries warning there was a lack of skilled workers as a result of both the pandemic and Brexit. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the country was at a ""turning point"" and the UK's ""world leading"" logistics industry would fix the issues. The PM also said on BBC Breakfast that only 127 HGV drivers had applied for temporary visas offered by the government to help tackle the shortage. The department for business said 27 drivers had been identified, but have not confirmed what the prime minister's number of 127 was referring to. The Road Haulage Association said a three month visa ""simply wasn't attractive enough for European truckers to give up their current jobs for a short term contract - perhaps only weeks long -  with all the hassle, including short term rents, that would be involved."" In an interview with the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg at the Conservative Party conference, Mr Johnson was asked about appeals from industry for help to fill vacancies and concerns from the public about prices - in a week when a weekly Â£20 top-up to universal creditclaimed by 5.8 million peopleis due to end. He said the government was ""giving all the protections that we can"" to consumers through schemes like the winter hardship fund and increasing the warm homes allowance. But he focused on the UK moving away from the ""tired, failed approach"" of relying on low skilled and low paid workers from abroad, saying the long term effects would be higher wages, better working conditions and a rise in productivity. Analysis: Business and government trade blows in blame game Universal credit cut 'not too late to be reversed' The PM added: ""Some people who have been writing to me maybe worried about this, but I'm not worried about this because, actually, I think it will be good for their businesses to invest in people."" Laura Kuenssberg raised the issue of public sector staff, saying 2.5 million people were dealing with pay freezes rather than reaping the benefits of any wage rises. But Mr Johnson said the government had ""done everything we can to increase people's pay"" but ""times have been very, very tight"". He added: ""What you have got to do as the government is look at the long term, and look at how you can make the investments now that will bear down on costs."" Boris Johnson says he's ""not worried"" about the squeeze on supply chains, labour shortages or inflation. He's trying to use this moment to argue that what we are seeing is merely the birth pangs of a new economic model.

Mr Johnson said companies in control of supplying goods will ""manage"" any issues, rather than the government ""stepping in to patch and mend every bit of our supply chains"". He added: ""The government can't magic-up changes to their systems overnight. ""People need to recognise that we can't simply continue with models which have basically held this country back and held our economy back."" And when it came to inflation - the rate at which prices are rising - Mr Johnson dismissed the worries of some economists. ""I think that people have been worried about inflation for a long time [but] it hasn't materialised,"" he said. ""What you're seeing stresses and strains that are caused by the global economy coming back to life and supply will match demand.""

"""Get Brexit done"" was the central theme of the Conservatives' 2019 manifesto. During his last week in office, Boris Johnson talked about his record in government - highlighting policies on police recruitment and broadband. He became prime minister and won a landslide victory in 2019 and made a series of pledges to voters. Delivering on them was made harder by the Covid pandemic, but how did he get on? The Conservatives promised this for England and Wales by March 2023. Latest figures,external, up to 30 June 2022, show an extra 13,790 police officers recruited. That means the government is two-thirds of the way there with one year to go. But that rise still hasn't made up for police numbers falling by20,545 between March 2010 and March 2019,external- under Conservative-led governments. The Conservatives promised this for England by March 2025. Latest figures,externalshow 319,846 full-time equivalent NHS nurses and health visitors in May 2022. That is up 23,753 since December 2019, leaving 26,247 posts to fill. On GPs,there were 35,257 full-time equivalents in post in July 2022,external. That's up by just 738since the end of December 2019,external. If you exclude locums (doctors who temporarily fill a rota gap) and trainees, GP numbers have actually decreased by 314 since December 2019. In November 2021, the then Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""I'm not going to pretend we're on track when we're not."" This 2019 pledge was to be met ""over the next 10 years"". In August 2021, the government came up with several definitions for what it said constituted a ""new"" hospital: A whole new hospital on a new site or current NHS  land A major new clinical building on an existing site or a new wing of an existing hospital A major refurbishment and alteration of all but building frame or main structure In December 2021,analysis by BBC Reality Check, found that of the 40 hospital projects announced by the government: 22 were rebuilding projects 12 were new wings within existing hospitals three involved rebuilding non-urgent care hospitals three were entirely new hospitals When asked for an update, on 7 June 2022, a Department of Health spokesperson told us that one of the 40 hospitals ""opened for patients last year and a further six are in construction"". This manifesto pledge was to be met by ""the mid-2020s"". In 2019-20, there were 242,700 net additional dwellings, which fell to 216,490 in 2020-21. Net additional dwellings includes houses converted to flats, commercial buildings switching to domestic use, as well as new builds. It also factors in demolished houses. What's happened to the government's housebuilding target? The prime minister was asked about the pledge on 9 June 2022 and said: ""I can't give you a cast iron guarantee that we're going to get to a number in a particular year."" This was achieved in a literal sense as the UK left the EU on 31 January 2020. Britain departed from the EU's single market and customs union 11 months later, after agreeing a basic free trade deal with the EU. But if this election slogan implied Brexit would be done and dusted, this has clearly not happened. A huge amount remains unresolved, from Northern Ireland to financial services. Alarge number of trade dealshave been signed around the world (most to replace the ones the UK already had as an EU member) but a deal with the US hasn't happened. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which makes economic judgements for the government,predicts,externalthat leaving the EU will reduce the UK's imports and exports by about 15% in the long term, with about a 4% hit to productivity. Supporters of Brexit say sovereignty has been restored, and unwanted regulations can now be cut. This was not possible while the UK was in the EU because of rules giving citizens the freedom to live and work in all EU countries. After Brexit, the government did launch this system. EU citizens wishing to live and work in the UK now have to apply for a visa via a points-based system (PBS), the same as citizens from the rest of the world. The process has not been all plain sailing. Leaving the EU single market is one of the factors thatcontributed to an HGV driver shortage,because EU drivers can no longer come and go as they please. The government hadto introduce 5,000 temporary visasfor this sector. How does the new UK points-based immigration system work? How serious is the shortage of lorry drivers? This manifesto pledge was broken. In September 2021, the government announced that workers, the self-employed and employers would pay 1.25p more National Insurance (NI) in the pound from April 2022. But, because of cost of living pressures, the government later reduced the impact of this by announcing that from 6 July 2022 the point at which employees would start paying NI would increase to Â£12,570. This means that in the 12 months from April 2022, anyone earning less than about Â£34,000 will pay less NI than they did last year. Anybody earning more than that will pay more. The government says the money from the NI rise will go initially towards easing pressure on the NHS. A proportion will then be moved into the social care system - which Mr Johnson pledged, in 2019, to ""fix"". Social Care: Will people still have to sell their homes? What's the new Health and Social Care tax and how will it affect me? In 2021, the government unveiled its plan to cap the costs that people in England pay for social care. From October 2023, this will be set at a maximum of Â£86,000 for care during their lifetime. But the long-awaited reform of funding does not fix other problems such as the shortage of care workers.Research in May 2022estimated that 500,000 adults in England were waiting for social care, up from 294,000 a year ago. The triple lock means the state pension increases each year at whichever of these is highest: CPI inflation (the rate at which prices are rising as measured by theConsumer Prices Index) average wages or 2.5% The 2019 Conservative manifesto said it would stay for the duration of this Parliament. But this promise was broken on 7 September 2021 whenthe government announced it was suspending the triple lock for a yearand blamed the pandemic. What is the triple lock and why has it been 'suspended'? The government says it will return in April 2023. This manifesto pledge has also been broken. The UK's annual aid budget has beenreduced to 0.5%,externalof GNI (gross national income) - a cut of about Â£4bn. Again, the government blamed the pandemic - saying cutting aid spending would help restore the public finances. It said the 2015 legislation, which introduced the 0.7% target, referred to ""fiscal circumstances"" which governments may refer to, if they fail to meet it. Who stands to lose out from UK aid cuts? This 2019 manifesto pledge was scaled back the following year. In apolicy paper,externalreleased by HM Treasury in November 2020, the target had changed to ""a minimum of 85% gigabit capable coverage by 2025"". There has been considerable progress though. Gigabit coverage has gone from 10% to 70% since July 2019, according to government figures. As well as pledges, Boris Johnson has made claims about his government's record during the pandemic. The UK was the first country to approve a Covid vaccine - on 2 December 2020. Its vaccine rollout began on 8 December 2020 - weeks before the EU's. The UK vaccine programme was the fastest in Europe until May 2021. After that, EU countries caught up, if you look at doses per 100 people in a country's population. The prime minister has repeatedly talked about the UK having the fastest-growing economy in the G7, which is a club of major, developed economies. Whether this is true depends onwhich period,externalyou are looking at. For the whole of 2020, the UK economy contracted by 9.3%, which was the biggest decline in GDP in the G7 For the whole of 2021, it grew by 7.4%, which was the biggest growth in the G7 The IMF predicts,externalthat in 2022 the UK will have 3.7% growth, the joint second highest in the G7 (behind Canada) The OECD,externalforecasts that the UK will have zero growth in 2023, and will be the slowest growing economy in the G7 If you look at growth since before the pandemic, the UK is in third place in the G7 with 0.7% growth Update: This piece was first published on 4 October 2021 and has been updated several times since then to add pledges and update figures.

"Lilly Hanrahan was 21 months old when she was murdered by Sean Sadler Authorities' failure to share details about a man before he murdered a girl in his partner's care ""contributed"" to her death. The Probation Service admitted error following a serious case review over toddler Lilly Hanrahan, killed in Birmingham in 2017. The probe highlighted a catalogue of missed chances to check on killer Sean Sadler's presence in her life. Sadler, 32, was jailed in March for at least 20 years. Babysitting Lilly in the Northfield area of the city, he threw and violently shook her, causing a brain injury that led to her death. He had also attacked the 21-month-old about a week before the fatal assault. But despite authorities being aware of Lilly since her mother became unable to care for her, chances to monitor the adults in her life were missed, the review found. Information about Sadler going unshared by the Probation Service was said by the investigation to be a key ""omission"". A Probation Service spokesperson has apologised for ""failure"" which she said ""contributed"" to Lilly's death. The report, published on Tuesday, said Lilly had been hospitalised as a baby and, due to her mother's substance misuse, was placed in the care of her maternal grandmother. But in 2016 the woman informed authorities she felt unable to manage the toddler. A special guardianship order (SGO) was made in September of that year, with another woman, unnamed in the report, appointed. Her first biological child was fathered by Sadler. During her assessment prior to appointment as guardian, she said there had been no contact with him since becoming pregnant. By 2017, they were in a new relationship, with Sadler murdering Lilly in November of that year. Sean Sadler told authorities he was in a relationship with Lilly's guardian two months before he murdered the toddler, but no action was taken The SGO assessment, the review concluded, could have ""made inquiries of previous partners"" and ""also have explored [the guardian's] family dynamics more closely"", although the report added that had those components been completed, it was unlikely the SGO would not have been made. The review found a catalogue of additional issues. Had a supervision order been in place, it concluded, there would have been a requirement for the guardian to inform the local authority about her new partner. Sadler, the report added, had a history of mental health problems. Following a conviction for battery and criminal damage, he began to be supervised by the Probation Service, and in September 2017, two months before Lilly died, he disclosed he was in a new relationship with a woman whom he used to see when he was younger. But, the report said, information about the risks posed by him was not shared by the Probation Service with the guardian or children's social services, as required by procedure. ""Had [the Probation Service] done so, Children's Social Care would have been alerted and safeguarding processes put in place,"" the review said. It added: ""Indeed, this omission may well have had very serious consequences for Lilly, and may be the single omission that could have made a difference."" Additionally, notes from 25 January 2017 in the children's social work team suggested that visits were taking place to see Lilly and the guardian, but no records of those visits exist, and the case was closed on 22 March 2017. From October to 14 November 2017, Lilly's guardian and her nursery reported seeing bruises on her, but no safeguarding concerns were identified. Two days later, Lilly was found collapsed, and died on 22 November. Latest news and updates from the West Midlands Babysitter jailed for murder Of Lilly's guardian, the review said: ""She told us that she blames herself completely for the death of Lilly: that she should have been more suspicious of her then partner, should not have taken his word, should not have allowed him to babysit for Lilly, should have seen the pattern in the bruises. ""She also blames the police for not informing her about her then partner's convictions. ""In fact, probation had a duty to inform her. She said, that had she known, she would have immediately taken steps to distance herself from him."" Sarah Chand, head of West Midlands Probation Service, said:""My heartfelt sympathies remain with Lilly's family and I would like to apologise to them for the failure by probation which contributed to her death. ""Since this horrific crime, we have recruited more staff, work more closely with social services and continue to conduct visits to offenders' homes to better protect children and partners from domestic violence."" Andy Couldrick, chief executive of Birmingham Children's Trust, which manages children's care in the city, said the trust ""acknowledged"" the shortcomings in the report and offered its ""deepest"" condolences. ""In this case, services were involved for six months following the [SGO], and there were no issues or concerns being raised that suggested our involvement needed to continue,"" he said. ""When Mr Sadler became reattached to the family, children's services' involvement had ended. ""If children's services had been alerted by Probation, or by the services that were made aware of unexplained bruising to the child, then of course children's services would have become involved once more with the family."" He added the ""robustness and rigour"" of services, including support following the issuing of an SGO, had been improved. Penny Thompson CBE, independent chair of Birmingham Safeguarding Children Partnership, said Lilly's death was ""profoundly sad"". She added: ""I offer condolences to her family and loved ones. I know they continue to feel her loss intensely."" Following the review, she said she wanted to highlight the importance of adult-oriented services sharing information with those supporting children, and the importance of professionals having ""open and curious minds"".

"The body of Sarah Everard was found hidden in woodland Met Police officer Wayne Couzens has been sentenced to a whole-life term for the murder of Sarah Everard, in a case that sparked national outrage and calls for more action to tackle violence against women. Couzens admitted the kidnap, rape and murder of the 33-year-old marketing executive when he appeared in court several months ago. But it was only during his sentencing that the full details of his crimes emerged. In full: Sarah Everard's family on their loss Does following the 'rules' keep women safe? Ms Everard was walking home from a friend's house in Clapham, south London, at about 21:30 BST on 3 March when she was abducted. Couzens' choice of victim was random, but the attack was planned. In his sentencing remarks, Lord Justice Fulford said there had been ""significant planning and premeditation"" by Couzens. The police officer had ""long planned to carry out a violent sexual assault on a yet-to-be-selected victim"" who he intended to coerce into his custody, noted the judge. Couzens spent at least a month travelling to London from Deal, Kent, where he lived, to research how best to carry out his crimes. Several days before the attack, he booked a hire car, which he would use for the abduction, as well as a roll of self-adhesive film advertised as a carpet protector on Amazon. After finishing a 12-hour shift at the US embassy that morning, Couzens, a parliamentary and diplomatic protection officer, went out ""hunting"" for a lone, young woman to kidnap and rape, the prosecution said. CCTV footage played in court showed Couzens and Ms Everard beside a vehicle on Poynders Road in Clapham The court heard how Couzens used the knowledge he had gained from working on Covid patrols in January and his Metropolitan Police-issue warrant card to trick his victim under the guise of a fake arrest for breaching coronavirus guidelines. The 48-year-old, who had been a police officer since 2002, handcuffed her before bundling her into the car and driving away. The abduction was witnessed by a couple travelling past in a car - but they believed they had seen an undercover police officer carrying out a legitimate arrest, so did not intervene. The whole kidnapping took less than five minutes. Couzens then drove to Dover in Kent, where he transferred Ms Everard to his own car, before travelling to a remote rural area nearby. It was there that he raped and murdered his victim - strangling her with his police belt. By 02:31 Couzens had left the scene and was spotted at a service station buying drinks. He visited the site where Ms Everard's body was dumped twice, leaving just before dawn. The next day, as the search for her escalated, Couzens bought petrol, which he used to burn her body inside a fridge. He also purchased two green rubble bags, which he used to dump the remains in a pond near an area of woodland he owned in Hoads Wood, Ashford. A week after she disappeared, Ms Everard's body was found in a woodland stream, just metres from land owned by Couzens. This video can not be played A CCTV timeline shows key evidence used to arrest and prosecute Wayne Couzens Meanwhile, Couzens returned to normal life, carrying out mundane activities like calling a vet about his dog. Days later, he even took his wife and two children on a family trip to the woods where he had burnt his victim's body. However, on the 8 March, the day he was due to return to work, he reported in sick. The following day he was arrested at his home in Deal. In a brief police interview, he told a false story about being threatened by an Eastern European gang, claiming they had demanded he deliver ""another girl"" after he had underpaid a prostitute a few weeks before. He then claimed he kidnapped Ms Everard, drove out of London and handed her over to three men in a van in a layby in Kent, while she was alive and uninjured. But after Ms Everard's body was discovered in a pond just 130 metres from land owned by Couzens, he was charged. This video can not be played In video from a police interview at his home on 9 March, Couzens denies knowing Sarah Everard Couzens has since been sacked by the Met, but the force is still facing questions over whether chances were missed to prevent his predatory behaviour. After Ms Everard's murder, the police watchdog announced it was probing alleged failures by the Met to investigate two indecent exposure incidents linked to Couzens in February. The Independent Office for Police Conduct is also investigating alleged failures by Kent Police to investigate a flashing incident linked to Couzens in 2015. Couzens transferred to the Met in 2018, from the Civil Nuclear Constabulary, where he had worked since 2011. Two years later he began working for the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command as an authorised firearms officer at diplomatic premises around central London. Wayne Couzens admitted murder, kidnap and rape In July, appearing by video link from Belmarsh high security jail, Couzens pleaded guilty to murder at the Old Bailey. On Wednesday he appeared in court again - this time in person - for a two-day sentencing hearing. There, he faced Ms Everard's mother, father and sister, who described to the court the torment of losing their loved one in such horrendous circumstances.

"Covid passes will be required in nightclubs in Wales, under the plans Mandatory Covid passes in nightclubs and large events will be introduced in Wales as planned on 11 October after Welsh ministers won a knife-edge Senedd vote. The measures were agreed with 28 politicians voting for and 27 voting against. It came despite politicians in the opposition uniting against the plans. The public will be expected to show evidence of being fully vaccinated or having a recent negative Covid test. Conservative Vale of Clwyd Member of the Senedd (MS) Gareth Davies did not take part in the vote, with the Tories citing ""technical difficulties"" for what happened. Nightclub industry representatives said it was a ""shambles"". If all opposition MSs had taken part the government would have lost in a tie, with the Tories, Lib Dems and Plaid opposed to the scheme. Health Minister Eluned Morgan told MSs not supporting the law ""will be an act of gross irresponsibility"", but Plaid Cymru had said it was open to exploitation. Protesters had gathered outside the Senedd's buildings on Tuesday evening, chanting ""shame on you"", following the result. What is a Covid pass and how do I get one? Covid pass breaches 'should not be police priority' Wales to introduce Covid passes from next month Ahead of the vote, Conservative MS Darren Millar could be heard telling Presiding Officer Elin Jones: ""I'm sorry we still have a member who is desperately trying to get into Zoom."" Ms Jones replied that she would still hold the vote: ""We have made every opportunity possible for that named member to get in, including sharing my personal phone."" Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies, who is ill, was also not present but Labour had agreed for one of their MSs not to vote in return. The Senedd is sitting in a hybrid format - with some MSs attending in person in the 60-person chamber and some joining via Zoom. The Welsh Conservatives said: ""A number of members across political groups experienced technical difficulties with the voting system this evening, which demonstrates why the hybrid Parliament in Wales must come to an end. ""We reaffirm our view that such significant votes should be held in person on the floor of the Senedd and Welsh Conservatives remain steadfastly opposed to the introduction of Covid passports."" However Plaid Cymru's Rhun ap Iorwerth in a tweet defended the hybrid system: ""Unless there's very good reason and/or with advance approval... I think you should be able to vote only from your offices at home/Senedd/constituency."" ""Not e.g. party conference,"" he added. Night Time Industries Association Wales, which represents 100 venues in Wales and is opposed to the plans, called for an ""urgent revote"". It said it was a ""democratic outrage that one MS who wanted to vote, and who would've voted against the proposals, could not, due to a mere technical error. This shambles will cause even more uncertainty for our businesses."" Presiding Officer, Elin Jones, later said in a statement: ""I gave every opportunity for the member to be present - including providing ICT support - but the member was unable to be contacted. ""For members to vote in the Senedd, they must be present, either in the chamber or on Zoom. ""It is a member's responsibility to give themselves sufficient time to secure their Zoom connection in time for voting, just as it is for any member travelling to the Senedd to vote."" People opposed to vaccine passports took part in a protest on the Senedd steps on Tuesday Hundreds gathered on the Senedd steps on Tuesday to protest against the measures. Following the decision protests moved to the front of Senedd office building TÅ· Hywel, and near the complex's car park exit, with security personnel and two armed police officers deployed on the other side of the barrier. Tory MS Sam Kurtz said he was ""stuck in my TÅ· Hywel office as protestors shout 'shame on you' and block us from leaving. To be fair, I'm as frustrated as them"". Plaid revealed in a Senedd debate on Tuesday afternoon that it would vote against the government. Rhun ap Iorwerth said the regulations proposed by the Welsh government had raised ""more questions than they provide answers"". ""There is insufficient evidence and little detail on how it will work in practice. In particular, the rapid test loophole, which represents a fudge on the part of the government, makes the system open to exploitation. ""We've asked many questions and haven't been given the assurances we've sought. And it's for that reason that we feel unable to support these regulations today."" Plaid called for ministers to withdraw the vote and said it would ""contribute to discussions on how something more robust could be brought forward, better evidenced, and with clarity on implication"". Welsh Lib Dem Jane Dodds said: ""Today's vote sets a dangerous precedent for bad law-making here in Wales and an unnecessary government overreach into our civil liberties without any evidence they will make us all safer."" During the debate on Tuesday Eluned Morgan said the Welsh government had not taken the decision to introduce such measures ""lightly"". ""We are taking these measures to support venues to stay open and enable events to continue taking place through a potentially very difficult and challenging autumn and winter,"" she said. The Welsh government is using a web-based system, rather than an app. Ms Morgan said she was currently aware that the Covid pass shows it is valid in England. ""This is unfortunate and reflects the fact that we share the infrastructure with the UK government."" She said the wording will change before it becomes mandatory, and promised an app which will include a pass would be available ""early in 2022"". Proof of vaccination has already been required for some large events Welsh Conservative health spokesman Russell George said the implementation of Covid passes had been a ""complete disaster"" in Scotland. He said the use of them at the Labour Party conference in Brighton had also been ""plagued with problems"". He warned bringing in Covid passes in Wales risked turning the nation into a ""two-tiered society"" and ""undermines freedom of choice"". Mr George told the Senedd the Welsh government's own technical advisory cell had warned such a policy could ""backfire"". But the Welsh government hopes the passes will help prevent super-spreader events. Deputy chief medical officer Chris Jones said officials are ""keen to try to minimise the risk of these events while enabling them to continue so life can return to normal with some degree of protection"". Anyone who is over 16 and has been fully vaccinated in Wales or England, or has had a negative lateral flow test result within the past 48 hours, can get a pass. Under the Welsh government plan they would be compulsory for anyone over 18 to enter: Nightclubs Indoor no-seating events with more than 500 people Outdoor no-seating events with more than 4,000 people Any event with more than 10,000 people, including sport Users who want to show a negative test will have to self-certify their result - leading to concerns they could be faked. To prevent this, the Welsh governmentplans to make it illegal to fake a negative test. Large events could also be allowed to check passes at random, rather than check every person who attends.

"Whistleblower Frances Haugen, 37, a former product manager on Facebook's civic integrity team, testified at an internet safety hearing on Capitol Hill Facebook's leaders know how to make their products safer but won't, she said ""They have put their immense profits before people,"" she told senators Democrats and Republicans expressed their concern about the impact Facebook and Instagram have on teen mental health Facebook has rejected Haugen's claims, saying it has spent significant sums of money on safety and other measures The highly anticipated testimony comes a day after an unrelated Facebook outage, which saw services down for six hours and affected billions of users globally You can watch the hearing live at the top of this page Edited by Ritu Prasad and Marianna Brady This video can not be played 'The buck stops with Mark ' - Haugen blasts Facebook's aversion Today's testimony by whistleblower Frances Haugen will likely keep Facebook in the hot seat for a while. That's a wrap on our live coverage - thanks for joining us. You can follow updates to this storyhere. Here's a recap of what happened today:  Today's reporting was brought to you by Ritu Prasad, Jessica Murphy, Marianna Brady, Sam Cabral, Holly Honderich, Bernd Debussman and David Molloy. With the hearing wrapped, we've got a final rebuttal from Facebook. The social media giant has condemned Haugen as a former employee that ""worked for the company for less than two years, had no direct reports, [and] never attended a decision-point meeting"". ""We don't agree with her characterisation on the many issues she testified about,"" the company's Director of Policy Communications Lena Pietsch wrote in a statement, pointing out that at least six times Haugen told senators that she did not work directly on the subject of their question. The one-paragraph response ends with a call to lawmakers to work harder to regulate the internet. ""We agree on one thing; it's time to begin to create stand rules for the internetâ¦ Instead of expecting the industry to make societal decisions that belong to legislators, it is time for Congress to act.""

Chelsea BaileyDigital producer, BBC News Emily Washburn identifies as ""social media sober"" after deleting all of her online profiles nearly a year ago. Washburn told BBC News she created an Instagram account when she was 15 and now regrets spending her most formative years online. ""[As a teen] I really relied on having that constant access to my account as a sort of failsafe for when I was feeling particularly low about myself so that I could have people bring me back up again,"" she said. Facebookâsown internal research shows,externalthat Instagram can fuel depression and anxiety, especially among teen girls. Nearly 30% of teens surveyed by Facebook said the app made dissatisfaction with their bodies worse. Executives at the social media giant insist they are taking steps to protect the platformâs youngest users and that data from these surveys should not be scaled to represent all users on Instagram. But for Washburn, deleting the apps was the first step to regaining control of her life. âI think I wrote at one point, it was like an IV drip of poison. It just accrued a little bit every day,â she said. ""The more I've reflected on it, the more I realised that social media is designed to be addictive. It gets better at addicting people every day.â Social media experts have said for years that apps may be harmful and addictive to some users. In 2018, BBC Panorama spoke to an engineer who helped develop the ""infinite scroll"". ""If you don't give your brain time to catch up with your impulses,"" the man says, ""you just keep scrolling."" Read more on how social media affects our behaviour.  Shayan SardarizadehBBC Monitoring disinformation specialist The Stop the Steal movement during the presidential election alleged widespread voter fraud Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic and in
the run-up to the US election, conspiracy movements and extremist groups used
Facebook to amplify their message to as large an audience as possible, recruit
new members and organise offline events. The so-called Stop the Steal movement alleging election fraud, which included individuals involved in the 6 January Capitol riots, had a huge reach on Facebook. BBC Monitoringâs research identified 78 Stop the Steal groups on the platform
with hundreds of thousands of members just a week after the election. Of those,
60 were still accessible even a week after the attack on the
Capitol. Militia groups such as the Boogaloo Bois and
major conspiracy movements like QAnon attracted hundreds of thousands of users
on Facebook, and were removed only a few weeks before the US
election. Facebook was also a source of many viral
misleading claims about Covid-19. Followers of major anti-vaccination Instagram
accounts increased nearly five-fold in 2020 and top anti-vaccination Facebook
pages grew by 19%. The company announced it would start taking action against
anti-vaccine content this year. Critics also claim most of Facebookâs
attempts at controlling the growth of misinformation and extremism are focused
on English language content and more specifically, content posted in the US, as
thatâs where most of the pressure on its leadership comes from. The company has repeatedly defended itself
from such claims, saying it has taken extensive measures to keep its platform
safe and remove violent movements. As our North America reporter Anthony Zurcher mentioned in his earlier post, the political answer to the Facebook problem may end up being breaking the company apart. Politicians around the world have suggested this in order to improve competition and safety of users. But despite her critical testimony, Frances Haugen has said she opposes chopping up the social giant. She said Facebook is aware of the harms its platform causes but ""did not set out"" to cause them. The algorithms will ""continue to be dangerous even if theyâre broken up,"" she said. Haugen also acknowledged that the company has ""invested more than any other platform"" on issues of safety - even if they are often unwilling to ask ""basic questions"". Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter, Washington DC At last, Republicans and Democrats in Congress have something they can agree on â Facebook and the threat they believe it poses. During Frances Haugenâs whistleblower testimony on Tuesday, senators on the left and the right expressed concern that the social media giant is too big and too powerful. They had different examples in mind, of course. Democrat Amy Klobuchar worried that the companyâs algorithms promoted the kind of extremist views that instigated the 6 January attack on the US Capitol. Republican Ted Cruz highlighted what he saw as Facebookâs censorship of conservative viewpoints. Others focused on evidence Facebook ignored its own research that Instagram adversely affected the mental health of teenage girls. Facebookâs best hope at this point may be that their opponents fracture apart over the best measures to address these concerns; that political gravity, in the end, reasserts itself. Their executives have a limited amount of time to respond, however, if they want to avoid the political consensus becoming that the answer to the Facebook problem is the same one applied to Bell telephone in the 1980s â breaking the company apart. David MolloyTechnology reporter Earlier, Senator Dan Sullivan raised an old chestnut for social media companies - do they provide a platform for Americaâs rivals, such as China? Haugen said she worked with Facebook's threat intelligence group, and ""directly worked on tracking Chinese participation on the platform"" as well as Iranian government espionage. ""This is definitely a thing that is happening,"" she said. ""I believe Facebookâs consistent understaffing of the counter-espionage information operations and counter-terrorism teams is a national security issue."" Asked if sheâs saying Americaâs adversaries are using Facebook to push their interests at the expense of Americaâs, she replied: âYes, Facebookâs very aware that this is happening.â And, giving senators food for thought (leading to suggestions of investigating it separately), she added: ""I have strong national security concerns about how Facebook operates today."" With that, senators have ended their questioning and Frances Haugen has left the room after around four hours of testimony. As the hearing nears its end, Senator Blumenthal says Haugen has sent a ""profound
message"" to the nation that individuals can make a difference. ""You have crystalized, in a way,
our consciousness,"" he said. ""You have been a catalyst for change in a way we
havenât seen."" With a slight hint of emotion in his voice, Senator Blumenthal also said he
believes that ""other whistleblowers"" are likely to come forward. ""I think youâre leading by
example,"" she said. ""Youâre showing them thereâs a path to make this industry
more responsible and more caring about kids."" Blumenthal added that ""a lot of
parents are watching"" what happens with Facebook. ""Since a lot of teens and âtweensâ
will be going home tonightâ¦to endure the bullying, to feel insecure about
themselves,"" he said. James ClaytonNorth America technology reporter, San Francisco Silicon Valley is an extremely intimidating place to be a whistleblower. Big Tech has the money to buy very expensive - and often aggressive - lawyers. There is also a culture of secrecy in many large tech companies. That can be because companies donât want their trade secrets to be spilled. But it goes further than that here. It is a very brave thing to stick your head above the parapet like this. Often companies will use Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) to spook employees into staying silent. Thatâs why Frances Haugenâs testimony is so important. There have been other whistleblowers before her, but the sheer scale and size of this leak is difficult for Facebook to push back on. And of course, the criticism is so much more powerful when the whistleblower has a name - and can directly explain what she saw inside Facebook. Despite her misgivings about her
former employer, whistleblower Frances Haugen says she still has ""empathy"" for Facebook and CEO Mark Zuckerberg. ""I think they feel a little trapped
and isolated,"" she told the hearing. In the case of Instagram, she said
that ""there are real questions about where Instagram would have to come in and
think hard about their product and what their product is about"". ""I donât think
those answers are obvious. Thatâs why we need to collaborate.â Instagram, she said, is about ""bodies"" and ""lifestyles"". She compared the platform negatively to ""fun"" TikTok and a
number of other social media platforms. In response to a question about
whether Facebook was trying to mitigate the problems allegedly caused by the platforms, Haugen
said that ""with the set of incentives they were working with, they did the best
they could"". ""Unfortunately, those incentives
are not sustainable and not acceptable in our society."" Chelsea BaileyDigital producer, BBC News Rikki Schlott Let's hear now from one of the teens affected by the technology being discussed in today's hearing. ""My generation, we were so immersed in this technology that I truly believe it's rewired our brains,"" says Rikki Schlott. Schlott created an Instagram account when she was 11 and had thousands of followers by the time she was 16. Many of them were strangers or older men from around the world. She spent her weekends scouring her town for the perfect Instagram spot and thought nothing of routinely editing her photos to  cover her ""teenage flaws"" like acne. âMy sense of self was developing in this kind of bizarre duality between Instagram Rikki and real-life Rikki,â she said. âLooking back, I'm missing a lot of photos of just being a kid and just being authentic and real.â As a member of Generation Z, Schlott told the BBC she feels Instagramâs algorithm matured with her, and that the company treated her generation like âguinea pigs.â Toward the end of high school, she said she had an epiphany and decided to take a step back from the apps. She now encourages others to do the same. ""All of these realisations that we're having about the statistics, and the real shortcomings of these social media platforms can really be a moment for young people to take some personal control over their lives and reclaim their autonomy from these companies and from these platforms."" More now from inside the hearing room. Republican Senator Dan Sullivan says he believes the
world will look back and wonder ""what the hell were we thinking?"" following
these latest revelations about Facebook and Instagramâs impact on kids. While Haugen didnât agree or disagree
with Senator Sullivanâs statement, she reiterated that Facebookâs own research shows that
Facebook is making children ""unhappy"". ""If Instagram is such a positive
force, we would have seen a golden age of teenage mental health in the last 10
years,"" she said. ""Weâve seen the opposite. Weâve seen escalating rates of
suicide and depression amongst teenagersâ¦in part driven by the social media
phenomenon."" Teenagers are saying ""âI am unhappy
when I use Instagram and I canât stopâ,â she added. ""Thatâs so sad."" As we noted before, Facebook is responding live to today's congressional testimony. In statements to BBC News, a company spokesperson addressed a few key points raised by Haugen in her testimony: Claim: Instagram is 'toxic' for teen girls Facebook's response: The spokesperson said that the company's leaked internal research ""like external research on these issues, found teens report having both positive and negative experiences with social media"". The company also addressed its findings in ablog post,externalby its head of research, Pratiti Raychoudhury. She wrote that ""many teens we heard from feel that using Instagram helps them when they are struggling with the kinds of hard moments and issues teenagers have always faced"". Claim:Facebook harms democracy Facebook's response: The company says it did not end safeguards it had in place for the 2020 US election as Haugen has suggested. A company spokesperson told the BBC they were ""proud"" of the work the company did to protect the election. ""We
spent more than two years preparing for the 2020 election withmassive investments,external, more than 40 teams across
the company, and over 35,000 (now 40,000) people working on safety and security,"" they said. They referenced ""specific
on-platforms signals and information from our ongoing, regular engagement with
law enforcement"" that continued - with adjustments - through the 6 January insurrection at the US Capitol. Claim: Facebook prioritises profit and growth over safety Facebook's response: ""Protecting
our community is more important than maximizing our profits,"" said the spokesperson. They pointed out major investments the company has made in recent years to work on safety issues. ""To
say we turn a blind eye to feedback ignores these investments, including the
40,000 people working on safety and security at Facebook and our investment of
$13bn since 2016."" David MolloyTechnology reporter Senators keep mentioning Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg - but where is he? Over the weekend, amid the controversies facing his company, Facebook's chief posted a video of a family sailing trip - something lawmakers have mentioned with scorn a few times already. The reality is that Zuckerberg is rarely directly involved in dealing with controversies, usually delegating the task of writing blog posts or appearing in front of regulators to other senior staff. For example,Facebookâs head of global safety testifying to this same panel last week. The company is big enough to have dedicated experts for almost every area. But Zuckerberg hasappeared before politicians before- though on one occasion, theSenate issued a subpoenato make sure he did, and he famouslydeclined to do so in front of UK lawmakers. A big part of Haugen's argument is that the only people who really understand Facebook's inner workings are its employees. ""Facebook has a culture that emphasises that insularity is the path forward,"" she told the members at the hearing earlier. ""That if information is shared publicly, it will be misunderstood,"" she says. If you follow Haugen's logic, this inward-looking culture is precisely why Congressional oversight of the social media giant is needed, some say. And we're back to business in the hearing room after that short break. (Remember, you can watch live at the top of this page.) Haugen is arguing that regulation may even make Facebook ""more profitable
over the long-term"". In response to questions from
Democratic Senator John Hickenlooper, Haugen says ""if it wasnât as toxic, less people could quit it"" - though that isn't something we can test. Haugen also continued her comparisons between Facebook and the tobacco industry. ""Only about 10% of people who
smoke ever get lung cancer,â she said. âSo [at Facebook] thereâs the idea that
20% of your users can be facing serious mental health issues and thatâs not a
problem."" We've been hearing from Frances Haugen all morning. Here's what you need to know about the former Facebook employee taking centre stage today. Who is she? The 37-year-old unveiled herself on Sunday as the person behind a series of surprise leaks of internal Facebook documents. Haugen told CBS News she had left Facebook earlier this year after becoming exasperated with the company. Why? She was a product manager on the civic integrity team until it was disbanded a month after the 2020 presidential election. ""Like, they basically said, âOh good, we made it through the election...We can get rid of Civic Integrity now.â Fast forward a couple months, we got the insurrection."" Facebook's Integrity chief has since contested this, saying it wasn't disbanded but ""integrated into a larger Central Integrity team"". What did she do? Before she left the company, Haugen copied a series of internal memos and documents. She has shared them with the Wall Street Journal, which has been releasing the material in batches over the last three weeks - sometimes referred to as the Facebook Files. Haugen says these documents prove the tech giant repeatedly prioritised ""growth over safety"". David MolloyTechnology reporter Much of Haugenâs testimony has been heard before. A national TV interview, a month of news stories based on leaked documents, and her own prepared testimony all painted a picture of how this would go. But unlike nearly any other high-profile political circus, it seems both sides of the aisle are unified - both on their praise for their witness and their views on the tech giant. Haugen is polished and poised. She does not know the answer to everything but is sharing insights and opinions from inside a very secretive company. And it appears to be working. One of the last senators to quiz her before the recess was Senator Ed Markey, who called Haugen âa 21st century American heroâ. Not exactly the tough grilling facedby the heads of the tech firms when they are summoned to similar hearings. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Watch: ""The buck stops with Mark"" A former Facebook employee has told US politicians that the company's sites and apps harm children's mental health and stoke division in society. Frances Haugen, a 37-year-old former product manager turned whistleblower, heavily criticised the company at a hearing in the Senate. Facebook has faced growing scrutiny and increasing calls for its regulation. Founder Mark Zuckerberg hit back, saying the latest accusations were at odds with the company's goals. In a letter to staff, he said many of the claims were ""illogical"" and pointed to Facebook's efforts to fight harmful content. ""We care deeply about issues like safety, well-being and mental health,"" he said in the letter, made public on his Facebook page,external. ""It's difficult to see coverage that misrepresents our work and our motives."" Facebook is the world's most popular social media site. The company says it has 2.7 billion monthly active users. Hundreds of millions of people also use the company's other products, including WhatsApp and Instagram. But it has been criticised on several fronts - from failing to protect users' privacy to not doing enough to halt the spread of disinformation. Facebook down: Zuckerberg apologises for outage Six hours without WhatsApp Ms Haugen told CBS News on Sunday that she had shared a number of internal Facebook documents with the Wall Street Journal in recent weeks. Using the documents, the WSJ reported that research carried out by Instagram showed the app could harm girls' mental health. This was a theme Ms Haugen continued during her testimony on Tuesday. ""The company's leadership knows how to make Facebook and Instagram safer, but won't make the necessary changes because they have put their astronomical profits before people,"" she said. She criticised Mark Zuckerberg for having wide-ranging control, saying that there is ""no one currently holding Mark accountable but himself."" This video can not be played Facebook's Monika Bickert says commissioning research into issues shows the company is prioritising safety above profit And she praisedthe massive outage of Facebook services on Monday, which affected users around the world. ""Yesterday we saw Facebook taken off the internet,"" she said. ""I don't know why it went down, but I know that for more than five hours, Facebook wasn't used to deepen divides, destabilise democracies and make young girls and women feel bad about their bodies."" The answer, she told senators, was congressional oversight. ""We must act now,"" she said. Mr Zuckerberg, in his letter, said the research into Instagram had been mischaracterised and that many young people had positive experiences of using the platform. But he said ""it's very important to me that everything we build is safe and good for kids"". On Monday's outage, he said the deeper concern was not ""how many people switch to competitive services or how much money we lose, but what it means for the people who rely on our services to communicate with loved ones, run their businesses, or support their communities"". Frances Haugen said the company repeatedly prioritised profits over its users safety Both Republican and Democratic senators on Tuesday were united in the need for change at the company - a rare topic of agreement between the two political parties. ""The damage to self-interest and self-worth inflicted by Facebook today will haunt a generation,"" Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal said. ""Big Tech now faces the Big Tobacco jaw-dropping moment of truth,"" he added, a reference to how tobacco firms hid the harmful effects of their products. Fellow Republican Dan Sullivan said the world would look back and ask ""What the hell were we thinking?"" in light of the revelations about Facebook's impact on children. In a statement issued after the hearing, Facebook said it did not agree with Ms Haugen's ""characterisation of the many issues she testified about"". But it did agree that ""it's time to begin to create standard rules for the internet."" ""It's been 25 years since the rules for the internet have been updated, and instead of expecting the industry to make societal decisions that belong to legislators, it is time for Congress to act,"" the statement read. Zuckerbergrattled Mark Zuckerberg's blog is lengthy and thoughtful. He doesn't name Frances Haugen - but he has clearly been rattled. His main argument is that the research she leaked has been misrepresented by both her and the media. He argues that the negative internal research has been cherry-picked and positive conclusions brushed over. Interestingly, he thinks this episode could have a chilling effect on internal research in companies - worried that bad conclusions might one day be leaked. But there is of course a simple come back to this. Release the data. Facebook and other social media companies don't have to do internal research; they could let their data be analysed independently. To be fair to Facebook, the company does give researchers some access. However, only Facebook has the full spectrum of user metrics needed to fully analyse its effect on society. His arguments too are at times overly simplified. Why would we want to make people angry, he asks. I'm sure he doesn't. But it's been proven over and over again that social media that provokes any emotion, whether it be laughter, love or anger gets more engagement. Zuckerberg believes passionately that Facebook is a force for good. It's becoming harder and harder to find people on Capitol Hill who think that.

"Fresh tensions surfaced last week over the number of fishing licences issued to French fishermen France has intensified pressure on the UK over post-Brexit fishing rights, warning bilateral co-operation could be at risk. The government in Paris is angry that the UK granted 12 licences out of 47 bids for smaller vessels to fish in its territorial waters. French Prime Minister Jean Castex has accused the UK of not respecting its Brexit deal commitments on fishing. ""Britain does not respect its own signature,"" he told French MPs. ""Month after month, the UK presents new conditions and delays giving definitive licences... this cannot be tolerated."" The prime minister warned that all bilateral agreements with the UK could be at risk if the European Commission did not take a tougher stance on the UK government. No details were given, but the two countries have a raft of agreements covering defence, security and border controls as well as energy and trade. The UK's Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has said the government's approach has been reasonable and fully in line with its commitments. Speaking at the Conservative party conference, the UK's Brexit minister rejected French claims that the UK was in breach of the Brexit trade deal. Lord Frost insisted that 98% of EU applications to fish in British waters had been granted, adding that the UK had been ""extremely generous"". The Commission said it was in constant contact with UK authorities to ensure all licence applications were dealt with as soon as possible. ""The UK has published its methodology and we are now discussing the differences with the British and Jersey authorities regarding the rights of the boats involved."" BBC Brussels correspondent Jessica Parker says there is little sense that the Commission is poised to act, with post-Brexit relations in a delicate state as the EU prepares solutions for fixing the controversial Northern Ireland Protocol. Fresh tensions surfaced last week between Britain and France over post-Brexit fishing rights. France was infuriated last week by the relatively small number of licences granted to smaller vessels, when Sea Minister Annick Girardin spoke of French fishing being ""taken hostage"" for political ends. The UK said it would consider further evidence to support remaining bids for fishing rights. France on Tuesday repeated its threat to cut the UK off from energy supplies. A UK government document in July said that 47% of the country's electricity imports were from France. French Europe Minister ClÃ©ment Beaune told Europe 1 radio: ""The UK depends on our energy exports, they think they can live alone while also beating up on Europe and, given that it doesn't work, they engage in aggressive one-upmanship."" The Channel island of Jersey became a flashpoint for tensions last May, when French fishermenstaged a protest outside the port of St Helierand two Royal Navy ships were sent to patrol the area. At the time Ms Girardinthreatened to cut off Jersey's electricity supply- 95% of which is delivered by three underwater cables from France. EXPLAINER:Who really owns UK fishing rights? French fishermen complained about being prevented from operating in British waters because of difficulties in obtaining licences. Under an agreement with the EU, French boat operators must show a history of fishing in the area to receive a licence for Jersey's waters. But it has been claimed additional requirements were added without notice.

"Oliver Dowden was speaking at a Conservative conference fringe meeting ""People need to get off their Pelotons and back to their desks,"" Conservative Party Chairman Oliver Dowden has said. The ex-culture secretary said civil servants working from home should ""lead by example"" by returning to the office. A union representing civil servants said his comments were an ""insult"" to thousands of dedicated government workers. Boris Johnson is expected to repeat the ""get back to work"" message in his Tory conference speech on Wednesday. It comes after top civil servant Sarah Healey said she preferred working from home because she could spend more time on her Peloton exercise bicycle. According to the Daily Mail,external, Ms Healey, who is the permanent secretary at Mr Dowden's former department, told a conference last month: ""I have a Peloton and I can just get on my bike whenever I have a teeny bit of time. ""That has been a huge benefit to my well-being, the lack of travelling time eating into my day."" Will work-from-home rules change again in England? Peloton cuts price of bike as sales growth slows Mr Dowden, who was moved from the Department of Culture, Media and Sport in last month's cabinet reshuffle, said: ""I like my permanent secretary at DCMS enormously, Sarah Healey, but I am disagreeing with her on this one. ""I think people need to get off their Pelotons and get back to their desks."" Sales of Pelotons surged during lockdown Speaking at Daily Telegraph fringe event at the Conservative Party conference, Mr Dowden said: ""People really want the government to lead by example - they want civil servants to get back to work as well. We've got to start leading by example on that."" He said there were currently ""more desks occupied"" at Conservative Party headquarters than in his former department. The government has clashed with trade unions for changing its advice to civil servants working from home andsuggesting staff were being ""lazy"". The First Division Association, which represents senior civil servants, accused Mr Dowden of ""hypocrisy"" and pandering to the party faithful, with his latest comments. ""As the civil service, the broader public sector and thousands of companies in the private sector already know, what you deliver is far more important than where it's delivered from,"" FDA general secretary Dave Penman said. ""The pandemic has driven a quiet revolution in working practices that has seen innovation and reform from both the public and private sectors. ""Yet despite the incredible feats performed, ministers continue to want to stand in the way of progress and reform for the sake of a quick headline."" The ""vast majority of staff want hybrid working"", said the FDA leader, and it was key to the government's plan to move civil service jobs out of London. ""The hypocrisy of ministers - who are happy to bank the savings in office space delivered by hybrid working but decry the practice for the party faithful - is frankly insulting to the dedication, professionalism and commitment of hundreds of thousands of public servants,"" he added. In a statement, the Cabinet Office said civil servants have been working hard to deliver the government's priorities ""from home and the workplace"" since the pandemic began. ""Like other employers, the civil service continues to follow the latest government guidance and is gradually increasing the numbers of staff in the workplace,"" it added. Sales of Peloton exercise bikes - which cost Â£1,750 plus monthly subscriptions to online classes - surged during lockdown, although they have slowed down in recent months.

The Met Office says the amount of rain from extremely wet days has increased by 17%. It also said ""a shift to more intense individual storms and fewer weak storms is likely as temperatures increase."" I remember reporting on severe flash flooding in Brixton more than 15 years ago and I was told then it was a one in a 1,000 year event. Now in London these very localised, severe, rainfalls seem to happen every few weeks or months. Cities like London are now having to prepare for flash flooding events in the future. Transport systems in particular are vulnerable. Better drainage, materials that can absorb rain and better flood protections are all being planned. But it all comes at a cost. Commuters faced disruption as flooding at Gloucester Road and Aldgate led to parts of the District, Circle and Metropolitan lines to close.

"More than half of new pet owners are aged 16 to 34 Insurers are increasingly covering claims for treatment of distressed dogs as their owners return to work, analysis shows. Market analysts Defaqto said 44% of dog insurance policies now included full cover for behaviour compared to 30% in February last year. This means insurers would cover the cost of behavioural therapy recommended by a vet to treat an animal's emotional distress, perhaps owing to separation. Pet ownership rose during the pandemic. Of an estimated 12 million dogs in the UK, about 3.2 million were acquired as puppies during the Covid crisis. Many were bought by young people to help with companionship and exercise while working from home during lockdowns. More people trying to give up lockdown dogs Pandemic pooches prepare to be home alone Dog welfare charity, Dogs Trust, has warned that an increasing number of owners are trying to hand over dogs for adoption since coronavirus restrictions were lifted. The RSPCA has also said that dogs could face separation anxiety that made them distressed. Indicators include destructive behaviour, unwanted toileting or reports of howling and barking. In some cases anxious dogs may tremble, whine or pace around, as well as excessive salivation, self-mutilation, repetitive behaviour and vomiting. Some pets might require professional help that can cost thousands of pounds. Brian Brown, consumer finance expert at Defaqto, said insurers had increased their cover. ""However, there is no excuse for not training and socialising a dog properly and insurers will not pay claims where this is the case,"" he said. ""If your dog is showing signs of distress, seek advice straight away. Many insurers offer free vet helplines where you can get advice over the phone, even if you don't have to make a claim. If you find you don't have insurance cover, speak to the animal charities to get advice.""

"This video can not be played Influencers react to Monday's social media outage. Facebook's founder Mark Zuckerberg has apologised for the ""disruption"" caused after its social media services went down for almost six hours - impacting more than 3.5bn users worldwide. The billionaire said sorry,externalafter an internal technical issue took Facebook, Messenger, Whatsapp and Instagram offline at about 16:00 GMT on Monday. The scramble to bring it back online eventually succeeded at around 22:00. But it is likely to increase scrutiny of the social media giant's reach. For hours, potentially billions of people found themselves without the social media tools they relied upon to keep in touch with friends and family. Others reportedly found they could not access services which required a Facebook login. Meanwhile, businesses around the world, which use social media to connect with customers, were faced with the prospect of an unexpected financial hit. Mr Zuckerberg himself was thought to have lost an estimated $6bn (Â£4.4bn) from his personal fortune at one point as Facebook shares plummeted, according to the business website Fortune's tracking software. Downdetector, which tracks outages, said some 10.6 million problems were reported around the world - the largest number it had ever recorded. Facebook weakens democracy, says ex-employee Facebook down: What went wrong? Six hours without WhatsApp In a blog post published on Tuesday,external, Facebook explained that during a routine maintenance job, its engineers had issued a command that unintentionally took down all the connections in its network, ""effectively disconnecting Facebook data centres globally"". Santosh Janardhan, the company's infrastructure vice-president, added that Facebook's program audit tool had a bug and failed to stop the command that caused the outage. The outage also caused employees to lose access to internal tools, including those used by Facebook employees to correct such issues, the company said. Those tools included Facebook's internal email and even employee work passes. Some reports suggest that Facebook headquarters was in ""meltdown"". Even ""the people trying to figure out what this problem was"" couldn't access the building, New York Times technology reporter Sheera Frenkel told the BBC. Facebook has said it is working to understand what happened so it can ""make our infrastructure more resilient"". Tech experts have described the issue as being akin to the social media giant falling off the internet's map, so it could not be found. The company said there was ""no evidence that user data was compromised"". The outage comes at a particularly difficult time for the company, which is finding itself increasingly under pressure over its reach and impact on society. On Sunday, former Facebook employee Frances Haugen told CBS newsthe company had prioritised ""growth over safety"".

"Computer analysis of the Earth's climate is important for informing efforts to tackle global warming Three scientists have been awarded the 2021 Nobel Prize in Physics for their work to understand complex systems, such as the Earth's climate. Syukuro Manabe, Klaus Hasselmann and Giorgio Parisi were announced as the winners at an event in Stockholm. Research by Manabe and Hasselmann led to computer models of the Earth's climate that can predict the impact of global warming. The winners will share the prize money of 10 million krona (Â£842,611). It is incredibly difficult to predict the long-term behaviour of complex physical systems such as the climate. Computer models that anticipate how it will respond to rising greenhouse gas emissions have therefore been crucial for understanding global warming as a planetary emergency. A really simple guide to climate change What will climate change look like near me? Four ways climate change links to extreme weather Indeed, the award comes as world leaders are preparing for a critical UN climate conference, known as COP26, to be held in Glasgow this November. Asked about the timing, Prof Parisi said: ""We have to act now in a very fast way and not with a strong delay."" The climate models that have built on the winners' research form a crucial part of the evidence on which leaders at COP26 will base their decisions. Japan-born Syukuro Manabe, 90, who is senior meteorologist at Princeton University in New Jersey, demonstrated how increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could lead to increased temperatures at the surface of the Earth. In the 1960s, he led the development of physical models of the climate. Roughly a decade later, Klaus Hasselmann, 89, from the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany, created a computer model that linked together weather and climate. His work answered the question of why climate models can be reliable despite weather being changeable and chaotic. L-R: Syukuro Manabe, Klaus Hasselmann and Giorgio Parisi On a superficial level, the original work carried out by Prof Parisi, who is currently at the Sapienza University of Rome, seems to bear little relation to climate change. It was concerned with a metal alloy called spin glass, in which iron atoms were randomly mixed into a grid of copper atoms. Even though there are only a few iron atoms, they change the material's magnetic properties in a radical and very puzzling manner. But the Nobel Committee saw spin glass as a microcosm for the complex behaviour of the Earth's climate. Complex systems, on atomic and planetary scales, may share certain features, such as being chaotic and disordered, with behaviour that seems to be governed by chance. Parisi, who is 73, found that hidden rules influence the apparently random behaviour of solid materials - and worked out a way to describe them mathematically. Prof John Wettlaufer, a physicist at Yale University in New Haven, US, explained: ""What emerged from the committee's work was the duality between the study of Earth's climate - which is complex on scales from millimetres to the size of the planet - and Giorgio Parisi's work. The Italian physicist was ""building from the disorder and fluctuations of complex systems at [the level of] their microscopic constituents"", Prof Wettlaufer said. The work of Syukuro Manabe, on the other hand, ""is taking the components of individual processes and knitting them together to predict the behaviour of a complex physical system"". Prof Hasselmann's work encompassed both the microscopic and macroscopic worlds, added the physicist from Yale. ""Even though we've divided the prize between the climate part and the disorder part, they really are linked,"" he explained. Dr Martin Juckes, head of atmospheric science and research and deputy head of the UK's Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA), said: ""It is fantastic to see the work of climate scientists rewarded with the Nobel prize in physics today. The problems of complexity in climate systems, compounded by threats of the climate crisis, continue to challenge climate scientists today."" This year's physics laureates were announced during a news conference at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. One half of the 10 million krona goes to Manabe and Hasselmann, while the other goes to Parisi. The Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel founded the prizes in his will, written a year before his death in 1896. A total of 218 individuals have now won the physics prize since it was first awarded in 1901. Only four of these laureates have been women. One physicist, John Bardeen, won the prize twice - in 1956 and 1972.

"A fresh pay offer is expected to be made to ScotRail workers in a bid to end six months of industrial action, the Scottish government has said. The rail operator has cancelled numerous services followinga pay dispute with train conductors. ScotRrail engineers have now also voted to take part in a series of strikes during Glasgow's COP26 event. However, the government said it was hopeful ""an appropriate and fair pay increase"" could be agreed. Rail services across Scotland have been disrupted for months by industrial action, with disagreements over pay and planned cuts in the wake of reduced passenger numbers as a result of the pandemic. Transport Minister Graeme Dey told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme that the unions and management were being ""actively encouraged"" to seek a resolution. Strikes and cuts: What is going on at ScotRail? ScotRail engineers vote for industrial action Disruption as ScotRail conductors go on strike He said: ""We need to step back from some of the rhetoric that has been dominating the agenda of late and focus on trying to get a suitable outcome to this. ""But we are in a challenging position, financially. To put this in perspective, prior to the pandemic we were spending circa Â£1.1bn a year on Scotland's railways. We are currently spending north of Â£1.5bn. That isn't sustainable, so we have got significant challenges."" He said the government was encouraging the company and staff to consider where efficiency savings could be made, in part, to fund a pay increase. He added: ""I understand that later today the unions and ScotRail are meeting and a fresh offer is likely to be tabled. It's one I hope that the unions will view in the spirit that it is going to be made and consider settling these disputes."" The Unite union has said engineers will stage a series of strikes in the coming weeks due to the ""reckless"" actions of management at Abellio, the Dutch-based company which runs the ScotRail franchise. The protest is also in response to ""the failure by Abellio ScotRail to make a meaningful pay offer"", despite repeated industrial action since 24 September, the union said. The planned 24-hour strikes will take place between 18-19 October, 1-2 November, 10-11 November and 12-13 November. A number of rail depots, workplaces and stations will be affected by the strike action, including Glasgow Queen Street, Glasgow Central, Edinburgh Waverley and Perth. Several of the dates clash with the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow which will see world leaders in the city from 31 October to 12 November. Unite's engineering members at ScotRail voted by 78% in support of strike action in a 68.4% ballot turnout. Meanwhile, 92% supported taking industrial action short of a strike. Pat McIlvogue, Unite's industrial officer, said: ""Unite has been left with no choice but to resolutely respond to the reckless behaviour displayed by Abellio ScotRail management."" He said that while discussions had been taking place, there had been no pay offer or movement by the company to date. ""The talks have been spun out and cynically used as a delaying tactic to avoid the national embarrassment of having strike action during the COP26 climate change conference which is being held in Glasgow. ""Well, these tactics have spectacularly backfired because our engineering members will now hold several 24-hour stoppages in the coming weeks."" Mr McIlvogue insisted that union members had made exhaustive attempts to engage Abellio ScotRail and called on the Scottish government to intervene to bring the dispute to an end. Abellio posteda pre-tax loss of Â£64.5m in the 12 months to 31 March 2020. In December 2019, the company was stripped of the contract to run ScotRail services by the Scottish government amid criticism of performance levels. The Scottish government announced in April that the franchise would be taken over by a public sector body from the end of March next year. A ScotRail spokesman said it would ""continue to engage with the rail trade unions to find an agreement on pay and conditions"" but that the financial situation it faced was ""stark"". The spokesman added: ""To build a more sustainable and greener railway for the future and reduce the burden on the taxpayer, we need to change. ""All of us in the railway - management, staff, trade unions, suppliers and government - need to work together to modernise the railway so that it is fit for the future.""

"Itâs day three of the Pandora Papers, a huge leak of 12 million files that expose the secret wealth and offshore dealings of the rich and powerful James Oliver, who led the investigation for BBC Panorama, and Fergus Shiel, International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) managing editor answered your questions Earlier the BBC uncovered the secret owners of swathes of UK property bought using offshore firms The wife of retail magnate Sir Philip Green went on a buying spree of London property while the couple's recently sold High Street empire teetered on the verge of collapse The Qatari ruling family purchased two of London's most expensive homes through offshore companies, saving millions in tax Ukrainian billionaire Gennadiy Bogolyubov, who has had his assets frozen in a fraud case, owns more than Â£400m of UK property Watch the full BBC Panorama investigation on BBC iPlayer or at the top of this page By Pandora Papers reporting team We're going to wrap up our live coverage of the Pandora Papers here. Over the last three days we've unpicked one of the biggest financial leaks in history and have seen 35 current and former world leaders - and hundreds more public officials - named in the files. There's undoubtedly been a lot to take in. If you've still got questions:  Thanks for joining us. We're nearing the end of our live coverage of the Pandora Papers, so let's have a recap of what we've learned from one of the world's biggest ever financial leaks. On Sunday we heard how:  On Monday, we heard more aboutpolitical party donorsin the UK:  And today:  The BBC was one of more than 140 news organisations to investigate the papers, so do check out other media outlets for dozens more stories. We've got through lots of your questions on the Pandora Papers this afternoon - thank you for sending such good ones in. If there are things you still want to know, we've gota simple guide to the leak. The final question comes from Joshua Page Joshua gets straight to the point. Here's what the reporters have to say on that: Fergus Shiel, ICIJ: Much better still, we can give you the greatest hits. Unlike Sam in Cheers, you donât have to stay up all weekend reading War And Peace to impress your love interest. Weâll give you the best bits to wow them. James Oliver, BBC Panorama: I donât think anyone has read every page of the Pandora Papers or ever will, but I suspect there are more stories to be found. Fergus ShielManaging Editor, International Consortium of Investigative Journalists Yes and no. ICIJ has shared data and details about the use of companies in secrecy jurisdictions by more than 50 politicians inthe Power Players feature,external. ICIJ also plans to incorporate some of the data from the Pandora Papers into the publicly-availableOffshore Leaks database,external. We've had plenty of questions asking why many of these revelations matter if the offshore activity is not illegal Fergus ShielManaging Editor, International Consortium of Investigative Journalists This isnât simply about alleged criminality, although there are many fugitives, convicted and accused felons in the documents. The offshore system offers secrecy, which provides an opportunity to hide assets from authorities, creditors and other claimants as well as public scrutiny. The system allows wealthy people to follow another countryâs financial regulations while not requiring them to live there. The offshore financial system can drain trillions from treasuries, worsen wealth disparities and protect those who cheat and steal while depriving their victims of recourse. Studies have estimated that the worldâs ultra-wealthy own the bulk of the $11 trillion dollar realm of offshore companies. More than 130 billionaires on the Forbes Magazine list turn up in the Pandora Papers. More than a dozen of those billionaires have faced serious questions regarding the sources of their wealth, typically arising from those offshore assets. James OliverBBC Panorama Itâs very early to say for sure what the impact will be. What we do know is that previous leaks and our coverage have had a real impact, not only directly by prompting criminal investigations, government inquiries, the resignations of prime ministers and other politicians, but also less directly. The fact is laws have changed. For example, stashing your money offshore to evade tax in the UK is harder than it was ten years ago when we did an undercover investigation of offshore service providers in the UK. Question from an anonymous reader Fergus ShielManaging Editor, International Consortium of Investigative Journalists Itâs too early to predict the impacts. On the positive side, authorities in the Czech Republic, Panama, India, Estonia, Mexico, Spain and Brazil have already promised investigations. Unhappily, ICIJ and our partners in numerous countries are facing very real attacks. Following the Panama Papers, governments reclaimed more than $1bn in tax. But the sad reality is that the secret economy is booming. Retail magnate Sir Philip Green has now responded to our earlier story on the Pandora Papers. We revealed that his wife, Tina Green,went on a buying spree of London propertywhile the couple's recently sold High Street empire teetered on the verge of collapse. Through their lawyers, both Sir Philip and Lady Green declined to answer detailed questions from the BBC, suggesting that these were private matters. When contacted by the PA news agency about the claims, Sir Philip said: ""I do not own or have never owned any offshore real estate."" Fergus ShielManaging Editor, International Consortium of Investigative Journalists ICIJ and its partners have sent out hundreds, possibly thousands of comment requests to the subjects of our stories. Not one has questioned the authenticity of the documents. Some have questioned our interpretation of them or of events surrounding them. But no-one has questioned the documents. ICIJ works with the best investigative journalists in the world. Complaints of bias are frequent but unfounded. We've had a few questions on this theme... James OliverBBC Panorama One of the first questions we ask on a project like this with millions of documents is whether or not they are genuine. But even once weâre satisfied thatâs the case thereâs an ongoing process to make sure that our information is good. That ends with putting what weâve discovered to the people concerned. As for the political question I can tell you that searches were done in relation to all the main political parties in the UK. But what party a politician is from is not the issue, the key question for me as a journalist is whether or not there is something that itâs in the public interest to investigate. Frederik Obermaier (L) and Bastian Obermayer were the leading lights of the Panama Papers investigation We've been answering your questions on the Pandora Papers, but it's not the first whistleblower-led investigation to rock the finance world in recent years. We've taken a look at some others below. FinCEN Files 2020 In September 2020 theFinCEN Files exposed the failure of major global banksto stop money laundering and financial crime. They also revealed how the UK is often the weak link in the financial system and how London is awash with Russian cash. Paradise Papers 2017 A huge batch of leaked documents mostly from offshore law firm Appleby, along with corporate registries in 19 tax jurisdictions, revealed the financial dealings of politicians, celebrities, corporate giants and business leaders. The documents contained details about investments made bythe Queen's private estate, a tax avoidance schemeused by three stars of BBC sitcom Mrs Brown's Boysand showed thatFormula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton avoided tax on his Â£16.5m luxury jet. Panama Papers 2016 An anonymous source leaked encrypted documents from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca. It sells anonymous offshore companies that help the owners hide their business activities. Overall the financial dealings of a dozen current and former world leaders, more than 120 politicians and public officials and countless billionaires, celebrities and sports stars were exposed. The Pandora Papers, with almost 12 million files, is the biggest of them all. Patrick Stillman's question was about whether the real issue isn't around the enforcement of existing tax laws but the laws themselves Fergus ShielManaging Editor, International Consortium of Investigative Journalists In an era of widening authoritarianism and inequality, the Pandora Papers investigation provides an unequaled perspective on how money and power operate in the 21st Century. In most countries, itâs not illegal to have assets offshore or to use shell companies to do business across national borders so we are not accusing people of that. But these affairs often amount to shifting profits from high-tax countries, where they are earned, to companies that exist only on paper in low-tax jurisdictions. Using offshore shelters is especially controversial for political figures, because they can be used to keep politically unpopular or even illicit activities from public view. Among the many names in the documents are some accused of massive fraud, sex crimes and child abuse, VAT scams, card-skimming, narco-trafficking, official and sports corruption, sanctions-busting, arms dealing and even murder. Question from Patrick Stillman James OliverBBC Panorama The Pandora Papers reveal important stories that involve both legal and illegal behaviour and sometimes behaviour that lies somewhere in between. The project raises questions about both enforcement and the law. You can introduce a law requiring offshore companies that own UK property to declare the identity of the person who ultimately owns it - something the government has said it will do - but unless there is scrutiny of the information given and penalties for not doing it, or giving false information, it is questionable how effective it will be. So itâs about both the law itself, and enforcement. A question from Twitter Fergus ShielManaging Editor, International Consortium of Investigative Journalists In the context of the US, this is perhaps the most significant offshore leak because it provides unprecedented insights into the trusts industry. The US is more interested in forcing other countries to share information about Americans banking offshore than in sharing information about money moving through US bank accounts, companies and trusts. What the documents show are tycoons and others linked to money laundering, corruption and worker exploitation choosing the US over the worldâs traditional tax havens. There are several big US names in the documents. The absence of US politicians is perhaps best explained by the geography of the 14 providers. We have very few documents from the Caymans, where many more Americans have traditionally parked their wealth. Question from an anonymous reader James OliverBBC Panorama As far as we are concerned we redact documents for a number of reasons, but usually because the information is not relevant to demonstrate the validity of the evidence. For example, the name of someone whoâs on an email chain, but has nothing to do with the story we are telling. As to giving people notice, if, for example, we are making serious allegations against someone we have to give them an opportunity to respond. Thatâs fair but it's also a crucial part of our journalism, to check the evidence we have and whether we are right or not. Kevin Todd's question was about the source of the leak Fergus ShielManaging Editor, International Consortium of Investigative Journalists ICIJ never comments on its sources. We can say that we obtained the information over months in batches and that we privately named the source Aladdin. Question from Kevin Todd James OliverBBC Panorama Thatâs really one for Fergus. But what I can say is that we do know where the information came from. Fourteen companies providing offshore services around the world. I think thatâs one of the things that makes this project so important. On previous projects I worked on, like the Panama Papers and Offshore Leaks, we had a relatively narrow insight through documents originating with one or two firms. This leak is global. Journalists Fergus Shiel and James Oliver will be answering your questions Thank you for submitting your questions about the Pandora Papers - plenty of you wanted to know more about the documents, whether you can see them and what impact they may have around the world. We've put them toJames Oliver, who led the investigation for BBC Panorama, and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) managing editorFergus Shiel. We'll post their responses here over the next couple of hours. Today we've been hearing about the secret owners of hundreds of properties in the UK. Let's look a little closer at Gennadiy Bogolyubov. He's a Ukrainian oligarch under investigation by the FBI for alleged money laundering. Via offshore companies he owns multiple properties in the UK, which were frozen in a court case. This commercial building he owns in Trafalgar Square was valued at Â£275m. It now contains a Prezzo and a Waterstones This property in Londonâs Belgravia, home to numerous foreign embassies, was valued at Â£62.5m in 2016 The property also contains two addresses down this mews He also owns a large block of offices in Knightsbridge valued at Â£75m near Hyde Park Lawyers for Mr Bogolyubov declined to comment as legal action is ongoing.

"Francois Devaux, head of a victims' association, welcomed the release of the damning report Some 216,000 children - mostly boys - have been sexually abused by clergy in the French Catholic Church since 1950, a damning new inquiry has found. The head of the inquiry said there were at least 2,900-3,200 abusers, and accused the Church of showing a ""cruel indifference towards the victims"". Pope Francis ""felt pain"" on hearing about the inquiry's finding, a Vatican statement said. One of those abused said it was time the Church reassessed its actions. FranÃ§ois Devaux, who is also the founder of the victims' associationLa Parole LibÃ©rÃ©e(Freed speech), said there had been a ""betrayal of trust, betrayal of morale, betrayal of children"". The inquiry found the number of children abused in France could rise to 330,000, when taking into account abuses committed by lay members of the Church, such as teachers at Catholic schools. For Mr Devaux it marked a turning point in France's history: ""You have finally given institutional recognition to victims of all the Church's responsibility - something that bishops and the Pope have not yet been prepared to do."" According to the Vatican statement, the Pope learnt about the report after he met visiting French bishops in the last few days. ""His first thoughts are for the victims, with a deep sadness for their wounds and gratitude for their courage in coming forward,"" it read. ""His thoughts also turn to the Church in France, and that, in recognising these terrible events and united by the suffering of the Lord for his most vulnerable children, it can take the path of redemption."" Pope Francis said he felt ""deep sadness"" for the victims after hearing about the inquiry, a statement said The report's release follows a number of abuse claims and prosecutions against Catholic Church officials worldwide. The independent inquiry was commissioned by the French Catholic Church in 2018. It spent more than two-and-a-half years combing through court, police and Church records and speaking to victims and witnesses. Most cases assessed by the inquiry are thought to be too old to prosecute under French law. The report, which is nearly 2,500 pages long, said the ""vast majority"" of victims were boys, many of them aged between 10 and 13. It said the Church had not only failed to prevent abuse but had also failed to report it, at times knowingly putting children in contact with predators. ""There was a whole bunch of negligence, of deficiency, of silence, an institutional cover-up,"" the head of the inquiry, Jean-Marc SauvÃ©, told reporters on Tuesday. He said that until the early 2000s, the Church had shown ""deep, total and even cruel indifference"" towards victims. In March, a service took place at the Cathedral of Lucon in France after the unveiling of a plaque in tribute to child victims of sexual abuse by priests ""The victims are not believed, are not listened to. When they are listened to, they are considered to have perhaps contributed to what they had happen to them,"" he explained. He added that sexual abuse within the Catholic Church continued to be a problem. While the commission found evidence of as many as 3,200 abusers - out of a total of 115,000 priests and other clerics - it said this was probably an underestimation. ""The Catholic Church is, after the circle of family and friends, the environment that has the highest prevalence of sexual violence,"" the report said. Olivier Savignac, head of victims associationParler et Revivre(Speak out and Live again), was abused at the age of 13 by the director of a Catholic holiday camp in the south of France. He told the Associated Press news agency that before the abuse, he had thought of the priest as ""someone who was good, a caring person who would not harm me"". ""We keep this, it's like a growing cyst, it's like gangrene inside the victim's body and the victim's psyche,"" he said. The inquiry found that about 60% of the men and women who were abused had gone on to ""encounter major problems in their emotional or sexual lives"". This was over 70 years and more than half the cases were before 1970. But still - for many French this will be the moment they wake up to the sheer scale of the phenomenon of Church sexual abuse.  What was once anecdotal and prurient is suddenly a defining feature of society. The burden of the report is that ad-hoc expressions of repentance and a bit of tinkering with ecclesiastical structures are no longer good enough. There has to be recognition that sexual abuse of youngsters by priests was systematic.  It was the Church - not rogue individuals - that was responsible. Many in the Church will be horrified by what they discover. Many will welcome the moment as a catharsis.  As Sister Veronique Margron, president of the Conference of Religious Orders, put it: ""If the Church must tremble, well let it tremble."" Only a handful of the cases covered by the inquiry had prompted any disciplinary action, let alone criminal prosecutions. But while most cases are now too old to prosecute via the courts, the inquiry called on the Church to take responsibility for what happened, including by providing compensation to the victims. It noted that while financial compensation would not address the trauma that victims had endured, it was ""nonetheless indispensable as it completes the recognition process"". It also made a series of recommendations about how to prevent abuse, including training priests and other clerics, and fostering policies to recognise victims. ""We expect clear and concrete responses by the Church,"" a group of six victims' associations said. The president of the Bishops' Conference of France, who co-requested the report, said the numbers of victims and their experiences were ""beyond what we could imagine"". ""I express my shame, my fear, my determination to act with them [the victims] so that the refusal to see, the refusal to hear, the desire to hide or mask the facts, the reluctance to denounce them publicly, disappears,"" Archbishop Eric de Moulins-Beaufort said. The French Church has previously announced a plan for ""financial contributions"" to victims, beginning next year. Earlier this year,Pope Francis changed the Roman Catholic Church's lawsto explicitly criminalise sexual abuse, in the biggest overhaul of the criminal code for nearly 40 years.

"Whistleblower Frances Haugen, 37, a former product manager on Facebook's civic integrity team, testified at an internet safety hearing on Capitol Hill Facebook's leaders know how to make their products safer but won't, she said ""They have put their immense profits before people,"" she told senators Democrats and Republicans expressed their concern about the impact Facebook and Instagram have on teen mental health Facebook has rejected Haugen's claims, saying it has spent significant sums of money on safety and other measures The highly anticipated testimony comes a day after an unrelated Facebook outage, which saw services down for six hours and affected billions of users globally You can watch the hearing live at the top of this page Edited by Ritu Prasad and Marianna Brady This video can not be played 'The buck stops with Mark ' - Haugen blasts Facebook's aversion Today's testimony by whistleblower Frances Haugen will likely keep Facebook in the hot seat for a while.

Here's a recap of what happened today:  Today's reporting was brought to you by Ritu Prasad, Jessica Murphy, Marianna Brady, Sam Cabral, Holly Honderich, Bernd Debussman and David Molloy. With the hearing wrapped, we've got a final rebuttal from Facebook. The social media giant has condemned Haugen as a former employee that ""worked for the company for less than two years, had no direct reports, [and] never attended a decision-point meeting"". ""We don't agree with her characterisation on the many issues she testified about,"" the company's Director of Policy Communications Lena Pietsch wrote in a statement, pointing out that at least six times Haugen told senators that she did not work directly on the subject of their question. The one-paragraph response ends with a call to lawmakers to work harder to regulate the internet. ""We agree on one thing; it's time to begin to create stand rules for the internetâ¦ Instead of expecting the industry to make societal decisions that belong to legislators, it is time for Congress to act.""

Chelsea BaileyDigital producer, BBC News Emily Washburn identifies as ""social media sober"" after deleting all of her online profiles nearly a year ago. Washburn told BBC News she created an Instagram account when she was 15 and now regrets spending her most formative years online. ""[As a teen] I really relied on having that constant access to my account as a sort of failsafe for when I was feeling particularly low about myself so that I could have people bring me back up again,"" she said. Facebookâsown internal research shows,externalthat Instagram can fuel depression and anxiety, especially among teen girls. Nearly 30% of teens surveyed by Facebook said the app made dissatisfaction with their bodies worse. Executives at the social media giant insist they are taking steps to protect the platformâs youngest users and that data from these surveys should not be scaled to represent all users on Instagram. But for Washburn, deleting the apps was the first step to regaining control of her life. âI think I wrote at one point, it was like an IV drip of poison. It just accrued a little bit every day,â she said. ""The more I've reflected on it, the more I realised that social media is designed to be addictive. It gets better at addicting people every day.â Social media experts have said for years that apps may be harmful and addictive to some users. In 2018, BBC Panorama spoke to an engineer who helped develop the ""infinite scroll"". ""If you don't give your brain time to catch up with your impulses,"" the man says, ""you just keep scrolling."" Read more on how social media affects our behaviour.  Shayan SardarizadehBBC Monitoring disinformation specialist The Stop the Steal movement during the presidential election alleged widespread voter fraud Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic and in
the run-up to the US election, conspiracy movements and extremist groups used
Facebook to amplify their message to as large an audience as possible, recruit
new members and organise offline events. The so-called Stop the Steal movement alleging election fraud, which included individuals involved in the 6 January Capitol riots, had a huge reach on Facebook. BBC Monitoringâs research identified 78 Stop the Steal groups on the platform
with hundreds of thousands of members just a week after the election. Of those,
60 were still accessible even a week after the attack on the
Capitol. Militia groups such as the Boogaloo Bois and
major conspiracy movements like QAnon attracted hundreds of thousands of users
on Facebook, and were removed only a few weeks before the US
election. Facebook was also a source of many viral
misleading claims about Covid-19. Followers of major anti-vaccination Instagram
accounts increased nearly five-fold in 2020 and top anti-vaccination Facebook
pages grew by 19%. The company announced it would start taking action against
anti-vaccine content this year. Critics also claim most of Facebookâs
attempts at controlling the growth of misinformation and extremism are focused
on English language content and more specifically, content posted in the US, as
thatâs where most of the pressure on its leadership comes from. The company has repeatedly defended itself
from such claims, saying it has taken extensive measures to keep its platform
safe and remove violent movements. As our North America reporter Anthony Zurcher mentioned in his earlier post, the political answer to the Facebook problem may end up being breaking the company apart. Politicians around the world have suggested this in order to improve competition and safety of users. But despite her critical testimony, Frances Haugen has said she opposes chopping up the social giant. She said Facebook is aware of the harms its platform causes but ""did not set out"" to cause them. The algorithms will ""continue to be dangerous even if theyâre broken up,"" she said. Haugen also acknowledged that the company has ""invested more than any other platform"" on issues of safety - even if they are often unwilling to ask ""basic questions"". Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter, Washington DC At last, Republicans and Democrats in Congress have something they can agree on â Facebook and the threat they believe it poses. During Frances Haugenâs whistleblower testimony on Tuesday, senators on the left and the right expressed concern that the social media giant is too big and too powerful. They had different examples in mind, of course. Democrat Amy Klobuchar worried that the companyâs algorithms promoted the kind of extremist views that instigated the 6 January attack on the US Capitol. Republican Ted Cruz highlighted what he saw as Facebookâs censorship of conservative viewpoints. Others focused on evidence Facebook ignored its own research that Instagram adversely affected the mental health of teenage girls. Facebookâs best hope at this point may be that their opponents fracture apart over the best measures to address these concerns; that political gravity, in the end, reasserts itself. Their executives have a limited amount of time to respond, however, if they want to avoid the political consensus becoming that the answer to the Facebook problem is the same one applied to Bell telephone in the 1980s â breaking the company apart. David MolloyTechnology reporter Earlier, Senator Dan Sullivan raised an old chestnut for social media companies - do they provide a platform for Americaâs rivals, such as China? Haugen said she worked with Facebook's threat intelligence group, and ""directly worked on tracking Chinese participation on the platform"" as well as Iranian government espionage. ""This is definitely a thing that is happening,"" she said. ""I believe Facebookâs consistent understaffing of the counter-espionage information operations and counter-terrorism teams is a national security issue."" Asked if sheâs saying Americaâs adversaries are using Facebook to push their interests at the expense of Americaâs, she replied: âYes, Facebookâs very aware that this is happening.â And, giving senators food for thought (leading to suggestions of investigating it separately), she added: ""I have strong national security concerns about how Facebook operates today."" With that, senators have ended their questioning and Frances Haugen has left the room after around four hours of testimony. As the hearing nears its end, Senator Blumenthal says Haugen has sent a ""profound
message"" to the nation that individuals can make a difference. ""You have crystalized, in a way,
our consciousness,"" he said. ""You have been a catalyst for change in a way we
havenât seen."" With a slight hint of emotion in his voice, Senator Blumenthal also said he
believes that ""other whistleblowers"" are likely to come forward. ""I think youâre leading by
example,"" she said. ""Youâre showing them thereâs a path to make this industry
more responsible and more caring about kids."" Blumenthal added that ""a lot of
parents are watching"" what happens with Facebook. ""Since a lot of teens and âtweensâ
will be going home tonightâ¦to endure the bullying, to feel insecure about
themselves,"" he said. James ClaytonNorth America technology reporter, San Francisco Silicon Valley is an extremely intimidating place to be a whistleblower. Big Tech has the money to buy very expensive - and often aggressive - lawyers. There is also a culture of secrecy in many large tech companies. That can be because companies donât want their trade secrets to be spilled. But it goes further than that here. It is a very brave thing to stick your head above the parapet like this. Often companies will use Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) to spook employees into staying silent. Thatâs why Frances Haugenâs testimony is so important. There have been other whistleblowers before her, but the sheer scale and size of this leak is difficult for Facebook to push back on. And of course, the criticism is so much more powerful when the whistleblower has a name - and can directly explain what she saw inside Facebook. Despite her misgivings about her
former employer, whistleblower Frances Haugen says she still has ""empathy"" for Facebook and CEO Mark Zuckerberg. ""I think they feel a little trapped

Chelsea BaileyDigital producer, BBC News Rikki Schlott Let's hear now from one of the teens affected by the technology being discussed in today's hearing. ""My generation, we were so immersed in this technology that I truly believe it's rewired our brains,"" says Rikki Schlott. Schlott created an Instagram account when she was 11 and had thousands of followers by the time she was 16. Many of them were strangers or older men from around the world. She spent her weekends scouring her town for the perfect Instagram spot and thought nothing of routinely editing her photos to  cover her ""teenage flaws"" like acne. âMy sense of self was developing in this kind of bizarre duality between Instagram Rikki and real-life Rikki,â she said. âLooking back, I'm missing a lot of photos of just being a kid and just being authentic and real.â As a member of Generation Z, Schlott told the BBC she feels Instagramâs algorithm matured with her, and that the company treated her generation like âguinea pigs.â Toward the end of high school, she said she had an epiphany and decided to take a step back from the apps. She now encourages others to do the same. ""All of these realisations that we're having about the statistics, and the real shortcomings of these social media platforms can really be a moment for young people to take some personal control over their lives and reclaim their autonomy from these companies and from these platforms."" More now from inside the hearing room. Republican Senator Dan Sullivan says he believes the
world will look back and wonder ""what the hell were we thinking?"" following
these latest revelations about Facebook and Instagramâs impact on kids. While Haugen didnât agree or disagree
with Senator Sullivanâs statement, she reiterated that Facebookâs own research shows that
Facebook is making children ""unhappy"". ""If Instagram is such a positive
force, we would have seen a golden age of teenage mental health in the last 10
years,"" she said. ""Weâve seen the opposite. Weâve seen escalating rates of
suicide and depression amongst teenagersâ¦in part driven by the social media
phenomenon."" Teenagers are saying ""âI am unhappy

In statements to BBC News, a company spokesperson addressed a few key points raised by Haugen in her testimony: Claim: Instagram is 'toxic' for teen girls Facebook's response: The spokesperson said that the company's leaked internal research ""like external research on these issues, found teens report having both positive and negative experiences with social media"".

Claim:Facebook harms democracy Facebook's response: The company says it did not end safeguards it had in place for the 2020 US election as Haugen has suggested. A company spokesperson told the BBC they were ""proud"" of the work the company did to protect the election. ""We

Over the weekend, amid the controversies facing his company, Facebook's chief posted a video of a family sailing trip - something lawmakers have mentioned with scorn a few times already. The reality is that Zuckerberg is rarely directly involved in dealing with controversies, usually delegating the task of writing blog posts or appearing in front of regulators to other senior staff.

But Zuckerberg hasappeared before politicians before- though on one occasion, theSenate issued a subpoenato make sure he did, and he famouslydeclined to do so in front of UK lawmakers. A big part of Haugen's argument is that the only people who really understand Facebook's inner workings are its employees.

She was a product manager on the civic integrity team until it was disbanded a month after the 2020 presidential election. ""Like, they basically said, âOh good, we made it through the election...We can get rid of Civic Integrity now.â Fast forward a couple months, we got the insurrection.""

"Sarah-Jane has sickle-cell disease, lives with constant pain and needs a blood transfusion every six weeks The first new sickle-cell treatment in 20 years will help keep thousands of people out of hospital over the next three years, NHS England has said. Sickle-cell disease is incurable and affects 15,000 people in the UK. And the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence said the hope of reducing health inequalities for black people, who are predominantly affected and often have poorer health outcomes due to a number of social factors, made the drug worth recommending. It called it ""an innovative treatment"". The drug, crizanlizumab, made by Novartis, is injected into a vein and can be taken on its own or alongside standard treatment and regular blood transfusions. And in a trial, patients taking the crizanlizumab had a sickle-cell crisis 1.6 times a year on average, compared with nearly three times a year normally. These painful episodes, which can require hospital treatment and lead to other health complications, are caused by by sickle-shaped red blood cells blocking the small blood vessels . But because the trial was small and lasted only a year, it remains unknown how long the benefits last for - and that makes it difficult to judge how cost-effective crizanlizumab is. Nevertheless, NICE, which recommends treatments in England and Wales, is recommending its use for over-16s, albeit under a special arrangement rather than routinely, on the NHS. And additional data on the treatment will be collected through clinical trials. The charity Sickle Cell Society said the new treatment brought ""new hope"" for people living with the world's most common genetic blood condition. NHS chief executive Amanda Pritchard said: ""The moment that a new drug comes that is approved to be used, our job is to make sure that we can do a deal to ensure it's affordable and get it out as quickly as possible."" Sarah-Jane has to rely on a whole range of medication to manage her sickle-cell disease, including very strong painkillers Diagnosed at birth, Sarah-Jane Nkrumah, 27, had her first crisis aged six months and has chronic pain in her joints. ""Every day is pain,"" she says. ""I don't remember the last time I had zero pain."" Sarah-Jane prefers to take breaks from taking painkillers -  but some days cannot get out of bed. ""You just have to try and manage it,"" she says. ""I don't have a choice. ""It's all about having a lot of mental strength and support."" And every six weeks, she has a blood transfusion to boost her energy levels. ""I feel weak and exhausted leading up to them and refreshed and stronger afterwards,"" she says. ""Thanks to donors, I get a chance to live another day."" Sarah-Jane had to give up her ambition to become a nursery teacher because it put her at risk of serious infection. ""Now, I have found my true purpose and love spreading awareness of sickle-cell disease,"" she says. Meindert Boysen, deputy chief executive and director of the Centre for Health Technology Evaluation, at NICE, said: ""Treatment for sickle-cell disease has been limited for years and there has been a lack of treatments for patients whose lives are affected by the condition. ""Crizanlizumab... has shown the potential to improve hundreds of lives and we are delighted to be able to recommend it as the first new treatment for sickle cell disease in two decades."" It is inherited from both parents, who pass on a particular gene It is possible to carry the gene without having the disease Nearly 300 babies are born with it each year in the UK A simple blood test will show whether someone has it Children with sickle cell are at greater risk of stroke Other symptoms can include serious infections, anaemia and tiredness Source: Sickle Cell Society / NHS UK Sickle cell disease - NHS About Sickle Cell Â» Sickle Cell Society Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting 'I have nothing to go back to' - BBC reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Trump avoids prison or fine in hush-money case sentencing LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"Whistleblower Frances Haugen, 37, a former product manager on Facebook's civic integrity team, testified at an internet safety hearing on Capitol Hill Facebook's leaders know how to make their products safer but won't, she said ""They have put their immense profits before people,"" she told senators Democrats and Republicans expressed their concern about the impact Facebook and Instagram have on teen mental health Facebook has rejected Haugen's claims, saying it has spent significant sums of money on safety and other measures The highly anticipated testimony comes a day after an unrelated Facebook outage, which saw services down for six hours and affected billions of users globally You can watch the hearing live at the top of this page Edited by Ritu Prasad and Marianna Brady This video can not be played 'The buck stops with Mark ' - Haugen blasts Facebook's aversion Today's testimony by whistleblower Frances Haugen will likely keep Facebook in the hot seat for a while.

Here's a recap of what happened today:  Today's reporting was brought to you by Ritu Prasad, Jessica Murphy, Marianna Brady, Sam Cabral, Holly Honderich, Bernd Debussman and David Molloy. With the hearing wrapped, we've got a final rebuttal from Facebook. The social media giant has condemned Haugen as a former employee that ""worked for the company for less than two years, had no direct reports, [and] never attended a decision-point meeting"". ""We don't agree with her characterisation on the many issues she testified about,"" the company's Director of Policy Communications Lena Pietsch wrote in a statement, pointing out that at least six times Haugen told senators that she did not work directly on the subject of their question. The one-paragraph response ends with a call to lawmakers to work harder to regulate the internet. ""We agree on one thing; it's time to begin to create stand rules for the internetâ¦ Instead of expecting the industry to make societal decisions that belong to legislators, it is time for Congress to act.""

Chelsea BaileyDigital producer, BBC News Emily Washburn identifies as ""social media sober"" after deleting all of her online profiles nearly a year ago. Washburn told BBC News she created an Instagram account when she was 15 and now regrets spending her most formative years online. ""[As a teen] I really relied on having that constant access to my account as a sort of failsafe for when I was feeling particularly low about myself so that I could have people bring me back up again,"" she said. Facebookâsown internal research shows,externalthat Instagram can fuel depression and anxiety, especially among teen girls. Nearly 30% of teens surveyed by Facebook said the app made dissatisfaction with their bodies worse. Executives at the social media giant insist they are taking steps to protect the platformâs youngest users and that data from these surveys should not be scaled to represent all users on Instagram. But for Washburn, deleting the apps was the first step to regaining control of her life. âI think I wrote at one point, it was like an IV drip of poison. It just accrued a little bit every day,â she said. ""The more I've reflected on it, the more I realised that social media is designed to be addictive. It gets better at addicting people every day.â Social media experts have said for years that apps may be harmful and addictive to some users.

Read more on how social media affects our behaviour.  Shayan SardarizadehBBC Monitoring disinformation specialist The Stop the Steal movement during the presidential election alleged widespread voter fraud Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic and in
the run-up to the US election, conspiracy movements and extremist groups used
Facebook to amplify their message to as large an audience as possible, recruit
new members and organise offline events. The so-called Stop the Steal movement alleging election fraud, which included individuals involved in the 6 January Capitol riots, had a huge reach on Facebook. BBC Monitoringâs research identified 78 Stop the Steal groups on the platform
with hundreds of thousands of members just a week after the election. Of those,
60 were still accessible even a week after the attack on the
Capitol. Militia groups such as the Boogaloo Bois and
major conspiracy movements like QAnon attracted hundreds of thousands of users
on Facebook, and were removed only a few weeks before the US
election. Facebook was also a source of many viral
misleading claims about Covid-19. Followers of major anti-vaccination Instagram
accounts increased nearly five-fold in 2020 and top anti-vaccination Facebook
pages grew by 19%. The company announced it would start taking action against
anti-vaccine content this year. Critics also claim most of Facebookâs
attempts at controlling the growth of misinformation and extremism are focused
on English language content and more specifically, content posted in the US, as
thatâs where most of the pressure on its leadership comes from. The company has repeatedly defended itself
from such claims, saying it has taken extensive measures to keep its platform
safe and remove violent movements. As our North America reporter Anthony Zurcher mentioned in his earlier post, the political answer to the Facebook problem may end up being breaking the company apart. Politicians around the world have suggested this in order to improve competition and safety of users. But despite her critical testimony, Frances Haugen has said she opposes chopping up the social giant. She said Facebook is aware of the harms its platform causes but ""did not set out"" to cause them. The algorithms will ""continue to be dangerous even if theyâre broken up,"" she said. Haugen also acknowledged that the company has ""invested more than any other platform"" on issues of safety - even if they are often unwilling to ask ""basic questions"". Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter, Washington DC At last, Republicans and Democrats in Congress have something they can agree on â Facebook and the threat they believe it poses. During Frances Haugenâs whistleblower testimony on Tuesday, senators on the left and the right expressed concern that the social media giant is too big and too powerful. They had different examples in mind, of course. Democrat Amy Klobuchar worried that the companyâs algorithms promoted the kind of extremist views that instigated the 6 January attack on the US Capitol. Republican Ted Cruz highlighted what he saw as Facebookâs censorship of conservative viewpoints. Others focused on evidence Facebook ignored its own research that Instagram adversely affected the mental health of teenage girls. Facebookâs best hope at this point may be that their opponents fracture apart over the best measures to address these concerns; that political gravity, in the end, reasserts itself. Their executives have a limited amount of time to respond, however, if they want to avoid the political consensus becoming that the answer to the Facebook problem is the same one applied to Bell telephone in the 1980s â breaking the company apart. David MolloyTechnology reporter Earlier, Senator Dan Sullivan raised an old chestnut for social media companies - do they provide a platform for Americaâs rivals, such as China? Haugen said she worked with Facebook's threat intelligence group, and ""directly worked on tracking Chinese participation on the platform"" as well as Iranian government espionage. ""This is definitely a thing that is happening,"" she said. ""I believe Facebookâs consistent understaffing of the counter-espionage information operations and counter-terrorism teams is a national security issue."" Asked if sheâs saying Americaâs adversaries are using Facebook to push their interests at the expense of Americaâs, she replied: âYes, Facebookâs very aware that this is happening.â And, giving senators food for thought (leading to suggestions of investigating it separately), she added: ""I have strong national security concerns about how Facebook operates today."" With that, senators have ended their questioning and Frances Haugen has left the room after around four hours of testimony. As the hearing nears its end, Senator Blumenthal says Haugen has sent a ""profound
message"" to the nation that individuals can make a difference. ""You have crystalized, in a way,
our consciousness,"" he said. ""You have been a catalyst for change in a way we
havenât seen."" With a slight hint of emotion in his voice, Senator Blumenthal also said he
believes that ""other whistleblowers"" are likely to come forward. ""I think youâre leading by
example,"" she said. ""Youâre showing them thereâs a path to make this industry
more responsible and more caring about kids."" Blumenthal added that ""a lot of
parents are watching"" what happens with Facebook. ""Since a lot of teens and âtweensâ
will be going home tonightâ¦to endure the bullying, to feel insecure about
themselves,"" he said. James ClaytonNorth America technology reporter, San Francisco Silicon Valley is an extremely intimidating place to be a whistleblower. Big Tech has the money to buy very expensive - and often aggressive - lawyers. There is also a culture of secrecy in many large tech companies. That can be because companies donât want their trade secrets to be spilled. But it goes further than that here. It is a very brave thing to stick your head above the parapet like this. Often companies will use Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) to spook employees into staying silent. Thatâs why Frances Haugenâs testimony is so important. There have been other whistleblowers before her, but the sheer scale and size of this leak is difficult for Facebook to push back on. And of course, the criticism is so much more powerful when the whistleblower has a name - and can directly explain what she saw inside Facebook. Despite her misgivings about her
former employer, whistleblower Frances Haugen says she still has ""empathy"" for Facebook and CEO Mark Zuckerberg. ""I think they feel a little trapped
and isolated,"" she told the hearing. In the case of Instagram, she said
that ""there are real questions about where Instagram would have to come in and
think hard about their product and what their product is about"". ""I donât think
those answers are obvious. Thatâs why we need to collaborate.â Instagram, she said, is about ""bodies"" and ""lifestyles"". She compared the platform negatively to ""fun"" TikTok and a
number of other social media platforms. In response to a question about
whether Facebook was trying to mitigate the problems allegedly caused by the platforms, Haugen
said that ""with the set of incentives they were working with, they did the best
they could"". ""Unfortunately, those incentives
are not sustainable and not acceptable in our society.""

"This video can not be played Influencers react to Monday's social media outage. Facebook's founder Mark Zuckerberg has apologised for the ""disruption"" caused after its social media services went down for almost six hours - impacting more than 3.5bn users worldwide. The billionaire said sorry,externalafter an internal technical issue took Facebook, Messenger, Whatsapp and Instagram offline at about 16:00 GMT on Monday. The scramble to bring it back online eventually succeeded at around 22:00. But it is likely to increase scrutiny of the social media giant's reach. For hours, potentially billions of people found themselves without the social media tools they relied upon to keep in touch with friends and family. Others reportedly found they could not access services which required a Facebook login. Meanwhile, businesses around the world, which use social media to connect with customers, were faced with the prospect of an unexpected financial hit. Mr Zuckerberg himself was thought to have lost an estimated $6bn (Â£4.4bn) from his personal fortune at one point as Facebook shares plummeted, according to the business website Fortune's tracking software. Downdetector, which tracks outages, said some 10.6 million problems were reported around the world - the largest number it had ever recorded. Facebook weakens democracy, says ex-employee Facebook down: What went wrong? Six hours without WhatsApp In a blog post published on Tuesday,external, Facebook explained that during a routine maintenance job, its engineers had issued a command that unintentionally took down all the connections in its network, ""effectively disconnecting Facebook data centres globally"". Santosh Janardhan, the company's infrastructure vice-president, added that Facebook's program audit tool had a bug and failed to stop the command that caused the outage. The outage also caused employees to lose access to internal tools, including those used by Facebook employees to correct such issues, the company said. Those tools included Facebook's internal email and even employee work passes. Some reports suggest that Facebook headquarters was in ""meltdown"". Even ""the people trying to figure out what this problem was"" couldn't access the building, New York Times technology reporter Sheera Frenkel told the BBC. Facebook has said it is working to understand what happened so it can ""make our infrastructure more resilient"". Tech experts have described the issue as being akin to the social media giant falling off the internet's map, so it could not be found. The company said there was ""no evidence that user data was compromised"". The outage comes at a particularly difficult time for the company, which is finding itself increasingly under pressure over its reach and impact on society. On Sunday, former Facebook employee Frances Haugen told CBS newsthe company had prioritised ""growth over safety"". She told a US Senate committee that she believed the company's sites and apps ""harm children, stoke division and weaken our democracy"".

"Fuel supplies to petrol stations in London and the south-east of England are improving but still remain behind the rest of the country, retailers say. The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) said 64% of forecourts in those areas had both types of fuel compared to 86% of sites nationally. Supplies have increased in recent days after the military was deployed amid a shortage of fuel tanker drivers. The government is offering 300 short-term visas to overseas lorry drivers. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said 127 foreign drivers had applied for visas aimed at tackling shortages, however, the Department for Business said only 27 drivers had been identified. It has not confirmed what Mr Johnson's number was referring to. The Times reported,externalthat just 27 people from the European Union had applied to be tanker drivers. The PRA, which represents independent forecourts across the UK, said ""steady deliveries and stabilising demand"" had led to improvements in stocks across the country. Gordon Balmer, PRA executive director, said 15% of sites in London and the south-east of England still had no fuel, down from 20% on Monday. ""Whilst there has been a significant reduction in dry sites, these areas are still lagging behind in having both grades of fuel available compared to the rest of the UK,"" he said. Nationally, the percentage of dry sites increased from 8% to 11% on Tuesday, the PRA said. ""Members are reporting they are now receiving deliveries from military drivers using commercial tankers, however further action must be taken to address the needs of disproportionately affected areas."" Besides fuel drivers, the government is offering a further 4,700 temporary visas in total for foreign food lorry drivers, which will last from late October to the end of February, in an attempt to avoid other supply chain issues. It is not yet known how many people have applied to this scheme. Mr Johnson said the slow rate of visa applications was a ""fascinating illustration of the problem"", which he added was a ""global"" issue, thought he admitted there was a ""particular problem in the UK"". What's happening about petrol shortages? Why is there an HGV driver shortage? He said working in road haulage ""should be a great job"", but added that there had been an underinvestment in facilities and pay conditions. He dismissed the suggestion that the problem was anything to do with Brexit. He noted the ""supply chain problem is linked to recovery"" and said other parts of the world were also affected. ""Imagine the UK has been in deep freeze and the pipes are unfreezing right now - stresses and strain of the economy waking up,"" Mr Johnson said. The Road Haulage Association (RHA) said the small number of visa applications was the ""proof in the pudding"" that short-term visas were ""not going to be attractive"". A spokesman for the trade body said that for visas to be an attractive proposition to overseas lorry drivers, they needed to last 12 months. ""The reality is that we have to assume these drivers from abroad are already in employment elsewhere. If visas are only three months... it's unlikely there is going to be much take up,"" he added. Livia Spera, general secretary of the European Transport Workers' Federation, said she was ""not surprised"" drivers were not ""rushing to sign up for visas"". ""We already predicted and warned that short-term measures such as visas wouldn't work,"" she added. Ms Spera said there was ""no quick fix"" to the problem. She said increasing driver wages and improving working conditions was the ""only answer to the crisis"". In response to the prime minister's comments on roadside facilities, the RHA's Rod McKenzie said it was a ""false premise"" that a trade body could deal with the issue alone. ""The majority of hauliers are small companies, less than 10 lorries,"" he said. ""It requires government commitment to facilitate the development of commercial sites. ""Government departments however have consistently ignored industry calls to press for cleaner and safer facilities on our roads."" Trade bodies have estimated the UK currently has a shortage of about 90,000 HGV drivers, which has been caused by several factors, including the coronavirus pandemic, Brexit and an ageing workforce. The shortages have started to affect supply chains in recent months, with some supermarkets struggling to stock certain products and petrol stations being unable to stock enough fuel to meet demand. The government has said temporary visas are not a long-term solution and has urged firms to invest in a UK workforce. Mr Johnson said the UK economy could not ""go back to the failed model where you mainline low-wage, low-skilled labour"". ""It's time for investing in people and skills."" No fuel at 20% of forecourts in the South East Visas for foreign lorry drivers extended Why is there an HGV driver shortage?

"The research will track 8,000 children born this year over their first five years The Duchess of Cambridge has visited researchers looking at whether children born during the pandemic will have been affected in the long-term by the pressures on their families. The University College London study will consider issues such as job worries, parents feeling isolated and a widening gap between rich and poor. The duchess has highlighted the importance of children's early years. ""Our early childhoods shape our adult lives,"" she said. ""Knowing more about what impacts this critical time is fundamental to understanding what we as a society can do to improve our future health and happiness,"" she said, visiting the university's Centre for Longitudinal Studies. The Children of the 2020s study will track the progress of 8,000 babies born in England this year - following their development and well-being in their first five years. The idea is to see how the earliest experiences might reverberate through later life - not just from the pandemic, although this will have been such an early shaping influence. The Duchess of Cambridge heard from lead researcher Pasco Fearon ""It's a really important part of the story for us to understand how it's impacted this generation of children,"" said lead Prof Pasco Fearon. Children growing up in the wake of the pandemic could be living in families where parents have been under pressure in the lockdowns. ""Relationships could have been put under strain,"" he said. Parents might have faced financial worries about ""insecure patterns of work"" and during lockdown been lonely and isolated from wider families. There might be other issues, such as too much screen time for children, too, the expert in children's social and emotional development suggested. Kate warns of lockdown loneliness for parents Duchess launches early years foundation The pandemic makes the big divides even wider Mothers faced particular stresses in the pandemic, UCL researchers have previously found, taking on a disproportionate amount of extra family responsibilities, including teaching older children sent home from school. There has been a pattern in education studies of a polarising impact of the pandemic - of the most advantaged children getting further ahead and the most disadvantaged falling behind. ""Inequalities are always there but we expect to see the gaps getting wider,"" Prof Fearon said. And the study will see how and when this happens in early development, such as in language, social skills and readiness to start school, and look for opportunities to intervene. ""We want to show the crucial role of parents - and to get a national conversation going,"" Prof Fearon said. ""What are the big forces that are influencing how children get on in life in the early years and beyond?"" he said. The Duchess of Cambridge, who launched her Royal Foundation Centre for Early Childhood earlier this year, is highlighting the particular value of long-term tracking studies.

"There is an air of crisis in British policing this weekend as it faces a great moment of reckoning. Never have leaders felt that public trust is so low they have had to advise women to consider fleeing if they are uncomfortable when confronted by one of their own officers. But that is the aftershock of the appalling crimes of Wayne Couzens, who raped and murdered Sarah Everard while working for the Metropolitan Police, after kidnapping her in a fake arrest. He was sentenced this week to awhole-life term in prison. So what happens now? Well first there is no sign that ministers are going to make Dame Cressida Dick, the commissioner of the Met and the UK's top officer, take the blame. Despite repeated attempts to force Home Secretary Priti Patel's hand, she has very publicly backed Dame Cressida by renewing her contract last month. But questions now confront policing - and the difficulty its chiefs and ministers are having in answering them is why the crisis feels too deep. Was Couzens' ability to pull on the uniform a failure of the system? Is there a wider cultural problem? And how should police leaders and the government respond? Clearly, society is not filled with homicidal sex offenders. But the fact is they do exist and it's unarguable that they use deception to get themselves into positions of trust. In that context, Couzens' ability to hide undetected within policing is similar to the dreadful story ofthe Soham murders,externalalmost 20 years ago - in which a suspected sex offender was able to work as a school caretaker. This video can not be played Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick says the force has been ""shamed"" and ""rocked"" by the case Couzens, we now know, has been the subject of three allegations of indecent exposure - including reports he drove into McDonald's naked from the waist down. The first allegation of what has long been downplayed as ""flashing"" occurred in 2015 when he was in the Civil Nuclear Constabulary, guarding the Dungeness power station on the English Channel. The police watchdog is still investigating what Kent Police knew about Couzens before he was able to transfer to the neighbouring Metropolitan force in London. Scotland Yard says its vetting systems did not fail - but admits the system did not pick up this incident. An investigation continues into how far an officer had got in establishing that Couzens was the suspect. Police must take harassment more seriously - Patel What should you do if you are stopped by police? This question of how officers are vetted is now a very live issue - not just because of ""missed opportunities"" from previous allegations - but also whether the system is set up to screen out candidates who may have a propensity to violence. But the focal point is quickly moving beyond whether vetting systems are technically good enough to root out dodgy candidates - to whether there is a permissive sexist culture that allows them to remain in the police. This video can not be played ""You have little power to say no"" - Women react to the Met's safety advice following the Everard case When I was a trainee reporter in Humberside more than 20 years ago and our newsroom got a tip of some kind of violence in the town, I'd call the police control room. ""Nah, just a domestic,"" the bored duty sergeant would reply. And that response, say critics, is the first part of the problem. For too long police forces have downplayed or ignored the everyday violence and misogyny that men inflict on women. Just last month, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary said there was an epidemic of violence against women and girls that deserved the same resources and focus as terrorism. So why is it not a bigger priority? Sue Fish, the former chief constable of Nottinghamshire, says there is a significant minority in uniform who are ""actively deviant"" - misogynistic officers who are abusing power - some of whom are in turn involved in domestic and sexual abuse. In 2016, she ordered her force to start recording misogyny as a hate crime - and the Law Commission, which advises ministers on major legal reforms will soon publish its own proposals on the issue. But Ms Fish's point is reinforced by the fact that the police watchdog is not just investigating what was known about Couzens -but also five other officers who were in a Whatsapp groupthat shared allegedly misogynistic and discriminatory messages. Sue Fish says she has seen nothing from either the prime minister or Dame Cressida Dick that shows they understand how pervasive this culture is. Wayne Couzens (right) is believed to have shown Sarah Everard his police warrant card The Victims Commissioner Dame Vera Baird QC - a former police and crime commissioner and career criminal justice expert - also says sexism is rife in policing. ""There is no doubt whatsoever that, particularly for female victims, faith in the police has collapsed,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour. ""We did a survey a year ago which showed that only 5% of rape complainants thought they could get justice by going to the police. This is the worst it has been - but it is not a new thing. ""Probably innate sexism runs through the police more deeply than it runs through society. ""There is no critical mass of female officers to change the culture. The culture remains male-dominated. ""I have heard people say that 'you can be gay, you can be black, you can be a woman. As long as you behave like a straight white male'."" Police boss urged to quit over comments on women Gross misconduct probe into Couzens WhatsApp group The BBC understands recruitment data shows the number of women applying this year to join the police has been rising - and so chiefs know that their response to Sarah Everard's murder will be critical to maintaining that progress. Maggie Blyth, Hampshire's deputy chief constable, is about to become the first senior officer to co-ordinate a national strategy on violence against women and girls. She's told the BBC that there is work to be done to regain the trust that has been lost - but this is also an opportunity that has to be seized. Back in the summer, Dame Cressida Dick wanted to emphasise that Wayne Couzens was a shocking but exceptional case. But as he begins a whole life sentence, the dreadful crime has become British policing's third major crisis of trust in just over three decades. The first was the 1989 Hillsborough disaster - in which innocent football fans were blamed for their own deaths amid a police cover-up of mistakes. The second was the 1993 murder of Stephen Lawrence, leading to the devastating public inquiry conclusion that the Met Police was institutionally racist. History shows that the response to both of these awful events was, for too long, driven by denial, dither and delay. But ultimately there had to be recognition of the injustice. And that's why the response to Sarah Everard's death will tell us so much about the future direction of British police.

"An inquiry will be launched into ""systematic failures"" that allowed Wayne Couzens to continue to be a police officer, Priti Patel announced. The home secretary said the public ""have a right to know"" why he remained in the Metropolitan Police despite concerns about his behaviour. Couzens kidnapped, raped and murdered Sarah Everard while he was a serving officer, using his police warrant card. He has since been linked to allegations of indecent exposure. The Met has faced mounting questions over its policies and procedures in the wake of Ms Everard's murder. It was revealed Couzens - who worked as an armed officer in the Met's parliamentary and diplomatic protection team - was linked to several alleged incidents of indecent exposure, including in the days before  Ms Everard's abduction in March. The questions facing the Met Police How a police officer planned murder PM does not support making misogyny a hate crime Speaking at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester, Ms Patel said: ""We need answers as to why this was allowed to happen. ""I can confirm today there will be an inquiry, to give the independent oversight needed, to ensure something like this can never happen again."" The Home Office said the inquiry would be in two parts, with the first examining Couzens' behaviour and establishing a definitive account of his conduct in the lead up to his conviction for Ms Everard's murder. It said the second part would address specific issues, such as vetting procedures, standards, discipline and workplace behaviour. This video can not be played Priti Patel: ""It is abhorrent that a serving police officer was able to abuse his position of power"" The exact nature of the inquiry is still unclear. The Home Office said it would initially be non-statutory but could be converted to a statutory one if required. If statutory, the inquiry would have the legal power to call witnesses and limit the government's control over how it operated. The person who would lead the inquiry and its terms of reference would be confirmed ""in due course"". Policing minister Kit Malthouse pointed out the first option - a non-statutory inquiry - was much quicker to put in place but stressed it would not begin until the separate Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) inquiry was complete. On BBC Radio 4's PM, he acknowledged his surprise on finding out that examining social media postings had only became a part of the police vetting procedure a year ago. The modern world was moving fast, he said. The vetting ""net"" has to be as tight as possible, with a regard for recruits' right to privacy while ensuring they were ""the right people with the right values"", he added. Jamie Klingler, co-founder of the campaign group Reclaim These Streets, set up after Sarah Everard's murder, insisted the inquiry needed to be statutory and judge-led - and needed to include women. ""It seems really specific about Wayne Couzens and not about the system that allowed a Wayne Couzens to happen,"" she told the BBC. ""It's not admitting that there is systemic misogyny within the force that allowed this to happen, and by not doing so it's pushing it under the carpet rather than exposing [it] at all levels."" Couzens, 48, killed Ms Everard, 33, after stopping her on a street in Clapham, south London. He was sentencedto a whole-life prison term last week. Speaking earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said hedid not support calls to make misogyny a hate crime, saying there was ""abundant"" existing legislation to tackle violence against women. He told BBC Breakfast that ""widening the scope"" of what you ask the police to do would just increase the problem - but recruiting and promoting more female officers would help change the culture within forces. There is an air of crisis in British policing as it faces a significant moment of reckoning. Never have leaders felt that public trust is so lowthey have had to advise women to consider fleeing if they are uncomfortablewhen confronted by one of their own officers. This is the aftershock of the appalling crimes of Wayne Couzens, who kidnapped, raped and murdered Sarah Everard while working for the Metropolitan Police. Despite repeated attempts to force Home Secretary Priti Patel's hand, she has very publicly backed Met Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick by renewing her contract last month. But questions now confront policing - and the difficulty its chiefs and ministers are having in answering them is why the crisis feels too deep. Was Couzens' ability to pull on the uniform a failure of the system? Is there a wider cultural problem? And how should police leaders and the government respond? Read more from Dominichere. Met Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick, who has rejected calls to resign, confirmed on Mondaythere would be a separate independent reviewinto the force's standards and culture. Speaking to the BBC, Dame Cressida said Ms Everard's murder had made ""everyone in the Met furious and we depend on public trust"". ""In this country policing is done by consent and undoubtedly the killing of Sarah and other events has damaged public trust,"" she said, adding she was determined to rebuild it. Labour's Yvette Cooper, chairwoman of the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said it was important the inquiry looked at how allegations of violence against women and girls were handled by police officers, as well as Couzens' conduct and the culture within the police. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said the inquiry ""must leave no stone unturned"" and should address reports of ""widespread cultural issues"". Speaking earlier at the Conservative Party conference, Justice Secretary Dominic Raab said making communities safer and allowing women to walk home feeling safe at night was his ""number one priority"".

"The Pandora Papers is a leak of almost 12 million documents that reveals hidden wealth, tax avoidance and, in some cases, money laundering by some of the world's rich and powerful. More than 600 journalists in 117 countries have been trawling through the files from 14 sources for months, finding stories that are being published this week. The data was obtained by theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ),externalin Washington DC, which has been working with more than 140 media organisations on its biggest ever global investigation. BBC Panorama and the Guardian have led the investigation in the UK. The Pandora Papers leak includes 6.4 million documents, almost three million images, more than a million emails and almost half-a-million spreadsheets. Stories revealed so far include: the owners of more than 1,500 UK properties bought using offshore firms, including individuals accused of corruption the Qatari ruling family whoavoided Â£18.5m tax on a London super-mansion Sir Philip and Lady Green went on a property spreeafter off-loading the BHS retail chain which went on to collapse the prominent Tory donor who wasinvolved in one of Europe's biggest corruption scandals the King of Jordan's Â£70m spending spreeon properties in the UK and US through secretly-owned companies Azerbaijan's leading family'shidden involvement in property deals in the UK worth more than Â£400m the Czech prime minister'sfailure to declare an offshore investment companyused to purchase two French villas for Â£12m how the family of Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta'ssecretly owned a network of offshore companies for decades The files expose how some of the most powerful people in the world - including more than 330 politicians from 90 countries - use secret offshore companies to hide their wealth. Lakshmi Kumar from US think-tank Global Financial Integrity explained that these people ""are able to funnel and siphon money away and hide it,"" often through the use of anonymous companies. The Pandora Papers reveal complex networks of companies that are set up across borders, often resulting in hidden ownership of money and assets. For example, someone may have a property in the UK, but own it via a chain of companies based in other countries, or ""offshore"". These offshore countries orterritoriesare where: it's easy to set up companies there are laws that make it difficult to identify owners of companies there is low or no corporation tax The destinations are often called tax havens or secrecy jurisdictions. There is no definitive list of tax havens, but the most well known destinations include British Overseas Territories such as the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands, as well as countries such as Switzerland and Singapore. Loopholes in the law allow people to legally avoid paying some taxes by moving their money or setting up companies in tax havens, but it is often seen as unethical. The UK government says tax avoidance ""involves operating within the letter, but not the spirit, of the law"". There are also a number of legitimate reasons people may want to hold money and assets in different countries, such as protection from criminal attacks or guarding against unstable governments. Although having secretive offshore assets is not illegal, using a complex network of secret companies to move around money and assets is the perfect way to hide the proceeds of criminality. There have been repeated calls for politicians to make it harder to avoid tax or hide assets, particularly following previous leaks such asthe Panama Papers. But Mr Ryle said the Pandora Papers show that ""the people that could end the secrecy offshoreâ¦ are themselves benefiting from it. So there's no incentive for them to end it"". All you need to do is set up a shell company in one of the countries or jurisdictions with high levels of secrecy. This is a company that exists in name only, with no staff or office. It costs money though. Specialist firms are paid to set up and run shell companies on your behalf. These firms can provide an address and names of paid directors, therefore leaving no trail of who is ultimately behind the business. It is impossible to say for sure, but estimates have ranged from $5.6 trillion to $32 trillion, according to the ICIJ. The International Monetary Fund has said the use of tax havens costs governments worldwide up to $600bn in lost taxes each year. Ms Kumar said it is detrimental to the rest of society: ""The ability to hide money has a direct impact on your life... it affects your child's access to education, access to health, access to a home."" The UK has been criticised for allowing property to be owned by anonymous companies overseas. The government published draft legislation in 2018 that would require the ultimate owners of UK properties to be declared. But it is still waiting to be presented to MPs. A 2019 parliamentary report said the UK system attracts people ""such as money launderers, who may wish to use property to conceal illicit funds"". It said criminal investigations are often ""hindered"" because police cannot see who ultimately owns properties. The government recently raised the risk of money laundering through property from ""medium"" to ""high"". It says it's cracking down on money laundering with tougher laws and enforcement, and that it will introduce a register of offshore companies owning UK property when parliamentary time allows. The Pandora Papers is a leak of almost 12 million documents and files exposing the secret wealth and dealings of world leaders, politicians and billionaires. The data was obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in Washington DC and has led to one of the biggest ever global investigations.

"The financial secrets of hundreds of world leaders, politicians and celebrities has been exposed in another huge leak of financial documents. Dubbed the Pandora Papers it features almost 12 million files from companies providing offshore services in tax havens around the world. The data was obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) in Washington DC, which has organised the biggest ever global investigation, spanning 117 countries and involving more than 600 journalists. In the UK the investigation has been led by BBC Panorama and the Guardian. The files are the latest in a series of whistleblower-led investigations that have rocked the world of finance in recent years. So let's round up the other major leaks of the past decade. In September 2020 theFinCEN Files exposed the failure of major global banksto stop money laundering and financial crime. They also revealed how the UK is often the weak link in the financial system and how London is awash with Russian cash. The files included more than 2,000 suspicious activity reports (SARs), filed by financial institutions to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Agency, or FinCEN, a part of the US Treasury Department. They also include 17,641 records obtained through Freedom of Information (FOI) requests and other sources. They were obtained by BuzzFeed News which shared them with the ICIJ and 400 journalists around the world, including BBC Panorama, which led the investigation in the UK. A huge batch of leaked documents mostly from offshore law firm Appleby, along with corporate registries in 19 tax jurisdictions, which revealed the financial dealings of politicians, celebrities, corporate giants and business leaders. Who was named?The documents contained details about investments made bythe Queen's private estate, a tax avoidance schemeused by three stars of BBC sitcom Mrs Brown's Boysand showed thatFormula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton avoided tax on his Â£16.5m luxury jet. They also revealed how Apple protected its low-tax regimeby using the Channel Island of Jerseyand thatPrince Charles campaigned to alter climate-change agreementswithout disclosing his private estate had an offshore financial interest in what he was promoting. Who leaked the data?The BBC does not know the identity of the source. The 13.4 million records were passed to German newspaper SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung and then shared with the ICIJ.Panoramaled research for the BBC as part of a global investigation involving nearly 100 other media organisations, including theGuardian,external, in 67 countries. A confidential settlement was later reachedbetween the BBC, the Guardian and Appleby over the reporting of the leaked documents, which Appleby said were taken by hackers. The Guardian and BBC said the reports were in the public interest but did not give more detail about the settlement. Until Pandora this leak was seen as the daddy of them all in data size. If you thought the Wikileaks dump of sensitive diplomatic cables in 2010 was a big deal, this carried 1,500 times more data. SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung's ""brothers"". Despite surnames that sound exactly the same, these two leading lights of the Panama Papers investigation, Frederik Obermaier (L) and Bastian Obermayer, are not related The Panama Papers came about after an anonymous source contacted reporters at German newspaperSÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung,externalin 2015 and supplied encrypted documents from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca. It sells anonymous offshore companies that help the owners hide their business dealings. Overwhelmed by the scale of the dump, which eventually grew to 2.6 terabytes of data, the SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung called in theICIJ,external, which led to the involvement of about 100 other partner news organisations, including the BBC's Panorama. After more than a year of scrutiny, the ICIJ and its partners jointly published the Panama Papers on 3 April 2016,with the database of documents going online a month later. Who was named?Where do we start? A few of the news partners focused on how associates of Russian President Vladimir Putin shuffled cash around the globe. Not that the Russians cared much.The prime ministers of Iceland and Pakistan came to far stickier ends, the former quitting and the latter being thrown out of office by the Supreme Court. Overall the financial dealings of a dozen current and former world leaders, more than 120 politicians and public officials and countless billionaires, celebrities and sports stars were exposed. Who leaked the data?John Doe. Yes, we know. It's not a real name. In US crime series it is mostly used to label anonymous victims butMr (or Ms) Doe's manifesto, released a month after publication, reveals a self-styled revolutionary,external. The real identity is still unknown. Five months after the Panama Papers, the ICIJ published revelations from the Bahamas corporate registry. The 38GB cache revealed the offshore activities of ""prime ministers, ministers, princes and convicted felons"", it said.Former EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes admitted an ""oversight"" in failing to disclose her interest in an offshore company. This ICIJ investigation,involving hundreds of journalists from 45 countries,external,including BBC Panorama, went public in February 2015. It focused on HSBC Private Bank (Suisse), a subsidiary of the banking giant, and so lifted the lid on dealings in a country where banking secrecy is taken for granted. The leaked files covered accounts up to the year 2007, linked with more than 100,000 individuals and legal entities from more than 200 countries. The ICIJ said the subsidiary had served ""those close to discredited regimes"" and ""clients who had been unfavourably named by the United Nations"". HSBC admitted that the ""compliance culture and standards of due diligence"" at the subsidiary at the time were ""lower than they are today"". Who was named?The ICIJ said HSBC had profited from ""arms dealers, bag men for Third World dictators, traffickers in blood diamonds and other international outlaws"". It also cited those close to the regimes of former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, former Tunisian President Ben Ali and Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad. Leaker in chief HervÃ© Falciani - indicted, held, released Who leaked the data?Actually, we know this one.The ICIJ investigation was based on data originally leaked by the French-Italian software engineer and whistleblower HervÃ© Falciani, though the ICIJ got it later from another source. From 2008 onwards he passed information on HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) to French authorities, who in turn passed them to other relevant governments. Mr Falciani was indicted in Switzerland. He was held in detention in Spain but was later released and now lives in France. Or LuxLeaks for short.Another extensive ICIJ investigation,external, which revealed its findings in November 2014. It centred on how professional services company PricewaterhouseCoopers helped multinational companies gain hundreds of favourable tax rulings in Luxembourg between 2002 and 2010. The ICIJ said multinationals had saved billions by channelling money through Luxembourg, sometimes at tax rates of less than 1%. One address in Luxembourg was home to more than 1,600 companies, it said. The leak of documents was first exposed in 2012after a joint investigation between Panorama and France2which lifted the lid on the tax agreements of UK pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline and media company Northern & Shell. Who was named?Pepsi, IKEA, AIG and Deutsche Bank were among those named. A second tranche of leaked documents said the Walt Disney Co and Skype had funnelled hundreds of millions of dollars in profits through Luxembourg subsidiaries. They and the other firms denied any wrongdoing. Jean-Claude Juncker had been PM of Luxembourg when it enacted many of its tax avoidance rules. He had been appointed president of the European Commission just a few days before the leak came out. He said he had not encouraged avoidance. This video can not be played Jean-Claude Juncker says he is ""politically responsible for what happened"" Eurosceptics went to town and pushed a censure motion against him and his commission. It was rejected. But the EU did investigate, and by 2016 had proposed a yet-to-be realised common tax scheme for the EU. Who leaked the data?Frenchman Antoine Deltour, a former PricewaterhouseCoopers employee, was the main man, saying he had acted in the public interest. Another PwC employee, Raphael Halet, helped him. (L-R) Edouard Perrin, Raphael Halet and Antoine Deltour The pair, along with journalist Edouard Perrin, were all charged in Luxembourg after a PwC complaint.A first verdictwas later revisited, watering down sentences, withDeltour given a six-month suspended jail term which was later quashed. Halet received a small fine and Mr Perrin was acquitted. This was about a tenth of the size of the Panama Papers but was seen as the biggest exposÃ© of international tax fraud ever when the ICIJ and its news partners went public in November 2012 and April 2013. Some 2.5 million files revealed the names of more than 120,000 companies and trusts in hideaways such as the British Virgin Islands and the Cook Islands. BBC Panoramaexposed a flourishing tax evasion industry in the UKin an undercover investigation based on the files. Who was named?The usual suspects. A mix of politicians, government officials and their families, with the Russians notable, but also those in China, Azerbaijan, Canada, Thailand, Mongolia and Pakistan. The Philippines - in the form of the family of late strongman Ferdinand Marcos - get a dishonourable mention. To be fair, the ICIJ does point out that the leaks are not necessarily evidence of illegal actions. Who leaked the data?The ICIJ cites ""two financial service providers, a private bank in Jersey and the Bahamas corporate registry"" as the sources, but says nothing more other than it was ""data obtained"". The Pandora Papers is a leak of almost 12 million documents and files exposing the secret wealth and dealings of world leaders, politicians and billionaires.

"Russia's Vladimir Putin (left), Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev (centre) and the King of Jordan (right) are all linked to the files Several world leaders have denied wrongdoing after featuring in a huge leak of financial documents from offshore companies. Dubbed the Pandora Papers, the 12 million files constitute the biggest such leak in history. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Jordan's King Abdullah II bin Al-Hussein are among some 35 current and former leaders linked to the files. Both have issued statements saying they have done nothing wrong. Jordan's royal palace said it was ""not unusual nor improper"" that King Abdullah owned property abroad. Leaked documents showthe leader secretly spent more than Â£70m ($100m) on a property empirein the UK and US since taking power in 1999. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov meanwhile questioned the reliability of the ""unsubstantiated"" information, after it detailed hidden wealth linked to President Putin and members of his inner circle. ""For now it is just not clear what this information is and what it is about,"" he told reporters, adding that ""we didn't see any hidden wealth of Putin's inner circle in there"". LIVE: Follow reactions to the leak A simple guide to the Pandora Papers leak How the world is reporting leaks on powerful leaders The data was obtained by theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ),externalin Washington DC, which has been working with more than 140 media organisations on its biggest ever global investigation. BBC Panorama and the Guardian have led the investigation in the UK. This video can not be played 'One rule for the rich, another for ordinary people' Other leaders linked to the leak include: Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis, who allegedly failed to declare an offshore investment company used to purchase two villas for Â£12m in the south of France Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, who - along with six members of his family - has been linked to 13 offshore companies Chile's President SebastiÃ¡n PiÃ±era, a billionaire businessman, who is accused of selling a copper and iron mine in an environmentally sensitive area to a childhood friend,as detailed in Spain's El Pais newspaper,external AndAzerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev, whose family and close associates have allegedly been secretly involved in property deals in the UK worth more than Â£400m In a tweet thread, the Czech prime minister said the allegations are an attempt to influence elections scheduled for this week and insisted he has ""never done anything wrong or illegal"". Mr Kenyatta said the investigation ""will go a long way in enhancing the financial transparency and openness that we require in Kenya and around the globe"", and promised to ""respond comprehensively"" to the leak once he returned from a state visit abroad. The Pandora Papers show no evidence that the Kenyatta family stole or hid state assets in their offshore companies. And a statement from Mr PiÃ±era's office said he denied taking part in or having any information on the sale of the Dominga mining project. President Aliyev and his family did not respond to attempts to contact them,according to The Guardian,external.

"An inquiry will be launched into ""systematic failures"" that allowed Wayne Couzens to continue to be a police officer, Priti Patel announced. The home secretary said the public ""have a right to know"" why he remained in the Metropolitan Police despite concerns about his behaviour. Couzens kidnapped, raped and murdered Sarah Everard while he was a serving officer, using his police warrant card. He has since been linked to allegations of indecent exposure. The Met has faced mounting questions over its policies and procedures in the wake of Ms Everard's murder. It was revealed Couzens - who worked as an armed officer in the Met's parliamentary and diplomatic protection team - was linked to several alleged incidents of indecent exposure, including in the days before  Ms Everard's abduction in March. The questions facing the Met Police How a police officer planned murder PM does not support making misogyny a hate crime Speaking at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester, Ms Patel said: ""We need answers as to why this was allowed to happen. ""I can confirm today there will be an inquiry, to give the independent oversight needed, to ensure something like this can never happen again."" The Home Office said the inquiry would be in two parts, with the first examining Couzens' behaviour and establishing a definitive account of his conduct in the lead up to his conviction for Ms Everard's murder. It said the second part would address specific issues, such as vetting procedures, standards, discipline and workplace behaviour. This video can not be played Priti Patel: ""It is abhorrent that a serving police officer was able to abuse his position of power"" The exact nature of the inquiry is still unclear. The Home Office said it would initially be non-statutory but could be converted to a statutory one if required. If statutory, the inquiry would have the legal power to call witnesses and limit the government's control over how it operated. The person who would lead the inquiry and its terms of reference would be confirmed ""in due course"". Policing minister Kit Malthouse pointed out the first option - a non-statutory inquiry - was much quicker to put in place but stressed it would not begin until the separate Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) inquiry was complete. On BBC Radio 4's PM, he acknowledged his surprise on finding out that examining social media postings had only became a part of the police vetting procedure a year ago. The modern world was moving fast, he said. The vetting ""net"" has to be as tight as possible, with a regard for recruits' right to privacy while ensuring they were ""the right people with the right values"", he added. Jamie Klingler, co-founder of the campaign group Reclaim These Streets, set up after Sarah Everard's murder, insisted the inquiry needed to be statutory and judge-led - and needed to include women. ""It seems really specific about Wayne Couzens and not about the system that allowed a Wayne Couzens to happen,"" she told the BBC. ""It's not admitting that there is systemic misogyny within the force that allowed this to happen, and by not doing so it's pushing it under the carpet rather than exposing [it] at all levels."" Couzens, 48, killed Ms Everard, 33, after stopping her on a street in Clapham, south London. He was sentencedto a whole-life prison term last week. Speaking earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said hedid not support calls to make misogyny a hate crime, saying there was ""abundant"" existing legislation to tackle violence against women. He told BBC Breakfast that ""widening the scope"" of what you ask the police to do would just increase the problem - but recruiting and promoting more female officers would help change the culture within forces. There is an air of crisis in British policing as it faces a significant moment of reckoning. Never have leaders felt that public trust is so lowthey have had to advise women to consider fleeing if they are uncomfortablewhen confronted by one of their own officers. This is the aftershock of the appalling crimes of Wayne Couzens, who kidnapped, raped and murdered Sarah Everard while working for the Metropolitan Police. Despite repeated attempts to force Home Secretary Priti Patel's hand, she has very publicly backed Met Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick by renewing her contract last month. But questions now confront policing - and the difficulty its chiefs and ministers are having in answering them is why the crisis feels too deep. Was Couzens' ability to pull on the uniform a failure of the system? Is there a wider cultural problem? And how should police leaders and the government respond? Read more from Dominichere. Met Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick, who has rejected calls to resign, confirmed on Mondaythere would be a separate independent reviewinto the force's standards and culture. Speaking to the BBC, Dame Cressida said Ms Everard's murder had made ""everyone in the Met furious and we depend on public trust"". ""In this country policing is done by consent and undoubtedly the killing of Sarah and other events has damaged public trust,"" she said, adding she was determined to rebuild it. Labour's Yvette Cooper, chairwoman of the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said it was important the inquiry looked at how allegations of violence against women and girls were handled by police officers, as well as Couzens' conduct and the culture within the police. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said the inquiry ""must leave no stone unturned"" and should address reports of ""widespread cultural issues"". Speaking earlier at the Conservative Party conference, Justice Secretary Dominic Raab said making communities safer and allowing women to walk home feeling safe at night was his ""number one priority"". The Met Police said 650 more police officers would patrol hotspot areas in London over the next six months, with 150 of these working in local wards as ""Bobbies on the beat"".

"Francois Devaux, head of a victims' association, welcomed the release of the damning report Some 216,000 children - mostly boys - have been sexually abused by clergy in the French Catholic Church since 1950, a damning new inquiry has found. The head of the inquiry said there were at least 2,900-3,200 abusers, and accused the Church of showing a ""cruel indifference towards the victims"". Pope Francis ""felt pain"" on hearing about the inquiry's finding, a Vatican statement said. One of those abused said it was time the Church reassessed its actions. FranÃ§ois Devaux, who is also the founder of the victims' associationLa Parole LibÃ©rÃ©e(Freed speech), said there had been a ""betrayal of trust, betrayal of morale, betrayal of children"". The inquiry found the number of children abused in France could rise to 330,000, when taking into account abuses committed by lay members of the Church, such as teachers at Catholic schools. For Mr Devaux it marked a turning point in France's history: ""You have finally given institutional recognition to victims of all the Church's responsibility - something that bishops and the Pope have not yet been prepared to do."" According to the Vatican statement, the Pope learnt about the report after he met visiting French bishops in the last few days. ""His first thoughts are for the victims, with a deep sadness for their wounds and gratitude for their courage in coming forward,"" it read. ""His thoughts also turn to the Church in France, and that, in recognising these terrible events and united by the suffering of the Lord for his most vulnerable children, it can take the path of redemption."" Pope Francis said he felt ""deep sadness"" for the victims after hearing about the inquiry, a statement said The report's release follows a number of abuse claims and prosecutions against Catholic Church officials worldwide. The independent inquiry was commissioned by the French Catholic Church in 2018. It spent more than two-and-a-half years combing through court, police and Church records and speaking to victims and witnesses. Most cases assessed by the inquiry are thought to be too old to prosecute under French law. The report, which is nearly 2,500 pages long, said the ""vast majority"" of victims were boys, many of them aged between 10 and 13. It said the Church had not only failed to prevent abuse but had also failed to report it, at times knowingly putting children in contact with predators. ""There was a whole bunch of negligence, of deficiency, of silence, an institutional cover-up,"" the head of the inquiry, Jean-Marc SauvÃ©, told reporters on Tuesday. He said that until the early 2000s, the Church had shown ""deep, total and even cruel indifference"" towards victims. In March, a service took place at the Cathedral of Lucon in France after the unveiling of a plaque in tribute to child victims of sexual abuse by priests ""The victims are not believed, are not listened to. When they are listened to, they are considered to have perhaps contributed to what they had happen to them,"" he explained. He added that sexual abuse within the Catholic Church continued to be a problem. While the commission found evidence of as many as 3,200 abusers - out of a total of 115,000 priests and other clerics - it said this was probably an underestimation. ""The Catholic Church is, after the circle of family and friends, the environment that has the highest prevalence of sexual violence,"" the report said. Olivier Savignac, head of victims associationParler et Revivre(Speak out and Live again), was abused at the age of 13 by the director of a Catholic holiday camp in the south of France. He told the Associated Press news agency that before the abuse, he had thought of the priest as ""someone who was good, a caring person who would not harm me"". ""We keep this, it's like a growing cyst, it's like gangrene inside the victim's body and the victim's psyche,"" he said. The inquiry found that about 60% of the men and women who were abused had gone on to ""encounter major problems in their emotional or sexual lives"". This was over 70 years and more than half the cases were before 1970. But still - for many French this will be the moment they wake up to the sheer scale of the phenomenon of Church sexual abuse.  What was once anecdotal and prurient is suddenly a defining feature of society. The burden of the report is that ad-hoc expressions of repentance and a bit of tinkering with ecclesiastical structures are no longer good enough. There has to be recognition that sexual abuse of youngsters by priests was systematic.  It was the Church - not rogue individuals - that was responsible. Many in the Church will be horrified by what they discover. Many will welcome the moment as a catharsis.  As Sister Veronique Margron, president of the Conference of Religious Orders, put it: ""If the Church must tremble, well let it tremble."" Only a handful of the cases covered by the inquiry had prompted any disciplinary action, let alone criminal prosecutions. But while most cases are now too old to prosecute via the courts, the inquiry called on the Church to take responsibility for what happened, including by providing compensation to the victims. It noted that while financial compensation would not address the trauma that victims had endured, it was ""nonetheless indispensable as it completes the recognition process"". It also made a series of recommendations about how to prevent abuse, including training priests and other clerics, and fostering policies to recognise victims. ""We expect clear and concrete responses by the Church,"" a group of six victims' associations said. The president of the Bishops' Conference of France, who co-requested the report, said the numbers of victims and their experiences were ""beyond what we could imagine"". ""I express my shame, my fear, my determination to act with them [the victims] so that the refusal to see, the refusal to hear, the desire to hide or mask the facts, the reluctance to denounce them publicly, disappears,"" Archbishop Eric de Moulins-Beaufort said. The French Church has previously announced a plan for ""financial contributions"" to victims, beginning next year. Earlier this year,Pope Francis changed the Roman Catholic Church's lawsto explicitly criminalise sexual abuse, in the biggest overhaul of the criminal code for nearly 40 years.

"Courts will get new powers to stop disruptive activists attending protests, the home secretary has said. In a Tory conference speech, Priti Patel said new orders would stop the ""small minority of offenders"" intent on ""causing disruption"". A Tory source said they will target people with a ""history of disruption"", or those likely to commit crime. Climate activists blocking roads have previously been warned they couldface fines and up to six months in prison. Protests from Insulate Britain have continued in recent days, despite three court injunctions banningactivists blocking the M25, and other major roads in London,external. Why is Insulate Britain blocking roads? On Tuesday the High Court heard that more than 100 protesters associated with the group have now been served with injunctions. The group has apologised for disruption - but added that ""the reality of our situation"" on climate change has to be faced. Thieves and burglars to be fitted with GPS tags 'Sobriety ankle tags' rolled out across England Patel pledges to crack down on motorway protests In her conference speech in Manchester, Ms Patel unveiled plans to increase the maximum sentence for disruption of a motorway. She also announced a new criminal offence for interfering with critical national infrastructures such as roads, railways and newspaper printing presses. Police are also expected to be given wider stop and search powers allowing officers to inspect activists for ""lock on"" equipment used to prevent them from being moved. The new measures to be announced by Ms Patel are to be included in the Police, Crime, Courts and Sentencing Bill currently going through Parliament. Ms Patel said the actions of climate activists, who in recent weeks have blocked the M1, M4 and M25, ""amounted to some of the most self-defeating environmental protests this country has ever seen."" ""Freedom to protest is a fundamental right our party will forever fight to uphold. But it must be within the law,"" she added. Insulate Britain activists blocking a motorway junction near Heathrow Airport The campaign by Insulate Britain has been running for over three weeks and has led to hundreds of arrests. The group wants the government to insulate all UK homes by 2030 to help cut carbon emissions. On Tuesday, the High Court heard that 111 activists associated with the group had been served with injunctions. A hearing on the injunctions has been adjourned to next week, after government lawyers argued all three should be dealt with together. Speaking outside the court, an Insulate Britain spokesman said the group ""wishes to profoundly apologise for the disruption caused over the past three weeks."" He added: ""We cannot imagine undertaking such acts in normal circumstances. But we believe that the reality of our situation has to be faced."" On Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson described Insulate Britain activists as ""irresponsible crusties"". He told LBC: ""There are some people who call those individuals legitimate protesters."" He added: ""They are not. I think they are irresponsible crusties who are basically trying to stop people going about their day's work and doing considerable damage to the economy."" This video can not be played Motorist: ""I need to go to the hospital, please let me pass. This isn't OK... how can you be so selfish?"" On Monday,Insulate Britain activists were confronted by angry drivers as they blocked more London roads, including the entrance to the Blackwall Tunnel, Wandsworth Bridge, Arnos Grove and the Hanger Lane gyratory. In a video captured by LBC, a motorist told demonstrators she was desperate to see her 81-year-old mother in hospital, asking them: ""How can you be so selfish?"" In other footage shared by Talk Radio, angry motorists at Wandsworth Bridge were filmed dragging protesters out of the road, where an ambulance appeared to be blocked. But in an open letter to Ms Patel, Insulate Britain said: ""You can throw as many injunctions at us as you like, but we are going nowhere."" One activist told BBC News: ""We have tried lobbying, we have tried targeting political leaders, government departments, people have been doing this for two, three, four, five decades, without any success at all. ""We know through history that disruptive direct actions work. The government are forcing our hand because they are not taking the biggest threat to humanity seriously."" Members of Insulate Britain held banners outside the Royal Courts of Justice earlier Meanwhile, Dominic Raab used his first speech as the new justice secretary to promise Â£183m with the aim of doubling the number of offenders in England and Wales on electronic tags by 2025. He told delegates this included an expansion in the ""game-changing"" use ofalcohol-monitoring ankle tagson offenders, to see if they breach court-ordered drinking bans. Mr Raab, who was also made deputy prime minister in last month'scabinet reshuffle, also pledged Â£90m to pay for more hours of community payback by offenders. Referencing the ""harrowing"" murder of Sarah Everard, he also vowed to make tackling violence against women and girls his ""number one priority"".

"This video can not be played Asked about rising prices and inflation, Boris Johnson says he believes that ""supply will match demandâ. Boris Johnson is ""not worried"" about the current jobs gap and rising prices in the UK, saying supply chains will sort themselves out ""rapidly"". The PM told the BBC that the economy was facing the ""stresses and strains"" of a post-Covid recovery. But he said the country was ""moving to a new approach"", with companies paying higher wages for UK workers, rather than relying on low paid immigration. And he claimed government schemes, like the hardship fund, would help people. Mr Johnson also said he was not worried about inflation as he believed ""supply would match demand"". PM does not support making misogyny a hate crime Have these eight election promises been met? Earlier, the prime minister denied there was a crisis in the UK, despite a shortage of HGV drivers disrupting fuel deliveries and leaving some shelves empty, and a range of industries warning there was a lack of skilled workers as a result of both the pandemic and Brexit. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the country was at a ""turning point"" and the UK's ""world leading"" logistics industry would fix the issues. The PM also said on BBC Breakfast that only 127 HGV drivers had applied for temporary visas offered by the government to help tackle the shortage. The department for business said 27 drivers had been identified, but have not confirmed what the prime minister's number of 127 was referring to. The Road Haulage Association said a three month visa ""simply wasn't attractive enough for European truckers to give up their current jobs for a short term contract - perhaps only weeks long -  with all the hassle, including short term rents, that would be involved."" In an interview with the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg at the Conservative Party conference, Mr Johnson was asked about appeals from industry for help to fill vacancies and concerns from the public about prices - in a week when a weekly Â£20 top-up to universal creditclaimed by 5.8 million peopleis due to end. He said the government was ""giving all the protections that we can"" to consumers through schemes like the winter hardship fund and increasing the warm homes allowance. But he focused on the UK moving away from the ""tired, failed approach"" of relying on low skilled and low paid workers from abroad, saying the long term effects would be higher wages, better working conditions and a rise in productivity. Analysis: Business and government trade blows in blame game Universal credit cut 'not too late to be reversed' The PM added: ""Some people who have been writing to me maybe worried about this, but I'm not worried about this because, actually, I think it will be good for their businesses to invest in people."" Laura Kuenssberg raised the issue of public sector staff, saying 2.5 million people were dealing with pay freezes rather than reaping the benefits of any wage rises. But Mr Johnson said the government had ""done everything we can to increase people's pay"" but ""times have been very, very tight"". He added: ""What you have got to do as the government is look at the long term, and look at how you can make the investments now that will bear down on costs."" Boris Johnson says he's ""not worried"" about the squeeze on supply chains, labour shortages or inflation. He's trying to use this moment to argue that what we are seeing is merely the birth pangs of a new economic model. But talk to some of his colleagues - some of whom made their own warnings about specific economic pinch points before the summer - and you don't quite hear the same. When the prime minister displays a disregard for Westminster's conventions or politesse it's one thing. But running the risk of looking like you don't understand everyday concerns is another. The polls right now suggest that the government is not being punished for queues at the pump or empty shelves. Johnson loyalists credit his political appeal that seems to defy natural gravity. But if prices continue to creep up and disruption continues, those feelings could turn. Downing Street is in a bullish mood, but confidence can tip into complacency - a sentiment that few voters would reward. Read more from Laura here. Mr Johnson said companies in control of supplying goods will ""manage"" any issues, rather than the government ""stepping in to patch and mend every bit of our supply chains"". He added: ""The government can't magic-up changes to their systems overnight. ""People need to recognise that we can't simply continue with models which have basically held this country back and held our economy back."" And when it came to inflation - the rate at which prices are rising - Mr Johnson dismissed the worries of some economists. ""I think that people have been worried about inflation for a long time [but] it hasn't materialised,"" he said.

"Computer analysis of the Earth's climate is important for informing efforts to tackle global warming Three scientists have been awarded the 2021 Nobel Prize in Physics for their work to understand complex systems, such as the Earth's climate. Syukuro Manabe, Klaus Hasselmann and Giorgio Parisi were announced as the winners at an event in Stockholm. Research by Manabe and Hasselmann led to computer models of the Earth's climate that can predict the impact of global warming. The winners will share the prize money of 10 million krona (Â£842,611). It is incredibly difficult to predict the long-term behaviour of complex physical systems such as the climate. Computer models that anticipate how it will respond to rising greenhouse gas emissions have therefore been crucial for understanding global warming as a planetary emergency. A really simple guide to climate change What will climate change look like near me? Four ways climate change links to extreme weather Indeed, the award comes as world leaders are preparing for a critical UN climate conference, known as COP26, to be held in Glasgow this November. Asked about the timing, Prof Parisi said: ""We have to act now in a very fast way and not with a strong delay."" The climate models that have built on the winners' research form a crucial part of the evidence on which leaders at COP26 will base their decisions. Japan-born Syukuro Manabe, 90, who is senior meteorologist at Princeton University in New Jersey, demonstrated how increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could lead to increased temperatures at the surface of the Earth. In the 1960s, he led the development of physical models of the climate. Roughly a decade later, Klaus Hasselmann, 89, from the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany, created a computer model that linked together weather and climate. His work answered the question of why climate models can be reliable despite weather being changeable and chaotic. L-R: Syukuro Manabe, Klaus Hasselmann and Giorgio Parisi On a superficial level, the original work carried out by Prof Parisi, who is currently at the Sapienza University of Rome, seems to bear little relation to climate change. It was concerned with a metal alloy called spin glass, in which iron atoms were randomly mixed into a grid of copper atoms. Even though there are only a few iron atoms, they change the material's magnetic properties in a radical and very puzzling manner. But the Nobel Committee saw spin glass as a microcosm for the complex behaviour of the Earth's climate. Complex systems, on atomic and planetary scales, may share certain features, such as being chaotic and disordered, with behaviour that seems to be governed by chance. Parisi, who is 73, found that hidden rules influence the apparently random behaviour of solid materials - and worked out a way to describe them mathematically. Prof John Wettlaufer, a physicist at Yale University in New Haven, US, explained: ""What emerged from the committee's work was the duality between the study of Earth's climate - which is complex on scales from millimetres to the size of the planet - and Giorgio Parisi's work. The Italian physicist was ""building from the disorder and fluctuations of complex systems at [the level of] their microscopic constituents"", Prof Wettlaufer said. The work of Syukuro Manabe, on the other hand, ""is taking the components of individual processes and knitting them together to predict the behaviour of a complex physical system"". Prof Hasselmann's work encompassed both the microscopic and macroscopic worlds, added the physicist from Yale. ""Even though we've divided the prize between the climate part and the disorder part, they really are linked,"" he explained. Dr Martin Juckes, head of atmospheric science and research and deputy head of the UK's Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA), said: ""It is fantastic to see the work of climate scientists rewarded with the Nobel prize in physics today. The problems of complexity in climate systems, compounded by threats of the climate crisis, continue to challenge climate scientists today."" This year's physics laureates were announced during a news conference at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. One half of the 10 million krona goes to Manabe and Hasselmann, while the other goes to Parisi. The Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel founded the prizes in his will, written a year before his death in 1896. A total of 218 individuals have now won the physics prize since it was first awarded in 1901. Only four of these laureates have been women. One physicist, John Bardeen, won the prize twice - in 1956 and 1972.

"Courts will get new powers to stop disruptive activists attending protests, the home secretary has said. In a Tory conference speech, Priti Patel said new orders would stop the ""small minority of offenders"" intent on ""causing disruption"". A Tory source said they will target people with a ""history of disruption"", or those likely to commit crime. Climate activists blocking roads have previously been warned they couldface fines and up to six months in prison. Protests from Insulate Britain have continued in recent days, despite three court injunctions banningactivists blocking the M25, and other major roads in London,external. Why is Insulate Britain blocking roads? On Tuesday the High Court heard that more than 100 protesters associated with the group have now been served with injunctions. The group has apologised for disruption - but added that ""the reality of our situation"" on climate change has to be faced. Thieves and burglars to be fitted with GPS tags 'Sobriety ankle tags' rolled out across England Patel pledges to crack down on motorway protests In her conference speech in Manchester, Ms Patel unveiled plans to increase the maximum sentence for disruption of a motorway. She also announced a new criminal offence for interfering with critical national infrastructures such as roads, railways and newspaper printing presses. Police are also expected to be given wider stop and search powers allowing officers to inspect activists for ""lock on"" equipment used to prevent them from being moved. The new measures to be announced by Ms Patel are to be included in the Police, Crime, Courts and Sentencing Bill currently going through Parliament. Ms Patel said the actions of climate activists, who in recent weeks have blocked the M1, M4 and M25, ""amounted to some of the most self-defeating environmental protests this country has ever seen."" ""Freedom to protest is a fundamental right our party will forever fight to uphold. But it must be within the law,"" she added. Insulate Britain activists blocking a motorway junction near Heathrow Airport The campaign by Insulate Britain has been running for over three weeks and has led to hundreds of arrests. The group wants the government to insulate all UK homes by 2030 to help cut carbon emissions. On Tuesday, the High Court heard that 111 activists associated with the group had been served with injunctions. A hearing on the injunctions has been adjourned to next week, after government lawyers argued all three should be dealt with together. Speaking outside the court, an Insulate Britain spokesman said the group ""wishes to profoundly apologise for the disruption caused over the past three weeks."" He added: ""We cannot imagine undertaking such acts in normal circumstances. But we believe that the reality of our situation has to be faced."" On Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson described Insulate Britain activists as ""irresponsible crusties"". He told LBC: ""There are some people who call those individuals legitimate protesters."" He added: ""They are not. I think they are irresponsible crusties who are basically trying to stop people going about their day's work and doing considerable damage to the economy."" This video can not be played Motorist: ""I need to go to the hospital, please let me pass. This isn't OK... how can you be so selfish?"" On Monday,Insulate Britain activists were confronted by angry drivers as they blocked more London roads, including the entrance to the Blackwall Tunnel, Wandsworth Bridge, Arnos Grove and the Hanger Lane gyratory. In a video captured by LBC, a motorist told demonstrators she was desperate to see her 81-year-old mother in hospital, asking them: ""How can you be so selfish?"" In other footage shared by Talk Radio, angry motorists at Wandsworth Bridge were filmed dragging protesters out of the road, where an ambulance appeared to be blocked. But in an open letter to Ms Patel, Insulate Britain said: ""You can throw as many injunctions at us as you like, but we are going nowhere."" One activist told BBC News: ""We have tried lobbying, we have tried targeting political leaders, government departments, people have been doing this for two, three, four, five decades, without any success at all. ""We know through history that disruptive direct actions work. The government are forcing our hand because they are not taking the biggest threat to humanity seriously."" Members of Insulate Britain held banners outside the Royal Courts of Justice earlier Meanwhile, Dominic Raab used his first speech as the new justice secretary to promise Â£183m with the aim of doubling the number of offenders in England and Wales on electronic tags by 2025. He told delegates this included an expansion in the ""game-changing"" use ofalcohol-monitoring ankle tagson offenders, to see if they breach court-ordered drinking bans. Mr Raab, who was also made deputy prime minister in last month'scabinet reshuffle, also pledged Â£90m to pay for more hours of community payback by offenders.

"Social media services Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram are back up and running after an outage that lasted almost six hours, Facebook says. It blamed an internal technical issue, which not only affected Facebook's services, but reportedly also employees' work passes and email. The services were down from about 16:00 GMT until around 22:00 on Monday. But the company said there was ""no evidence that user data was compromised"". Sheera Frenkel, the New York Times' technology reporter, told the Today programme part of the reason it took so long to fix was because ""the people trying to figure out what this problem was couldn't even physically get into the building"" to work out what had gone wrong. In a statement,Facebook said that the faulty configuration change affected the company's internal tools,externaland systems which complicated attempts to resolve the problem. Downdetector, which tracks outages, said some 10.6 million problem reports around the world. However, the real number of people affected is much higher: more than 3.5 billion people use Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and Whatsapp. Many found themselves cut off from family and friends they interact with over the various services, while small businesses which use social media to connect with customers were faced with the prospect of an unexpected financial hit. According to the business website Fortune, it also cost Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg an estimated $6bn (Â£4.4bn) at one point as shares plummeted. Mr Zuckerberg has apologised to those affected by the outage. Allow Facebook content? This article contains content provided by Facebook.

The disruption comes the day after an interview with a former Facebook employee who leaked documents about the company. Frances Haugen told CBS news on Sunday thatthe company had prioritised ""growth over safety"". On Tuesday she will testify before a Senate subcommittee in a hearing titled ""Protecting Kids Online"", about the company's research into Instagram's effect on the mental health of young users. Many outages get resolved fairly quickly. They are often localised too, with some people unable to open a website that can be viewed in another country. This outage, however, was global, and affected all of Facebook's many spin-offs. The length of time it was off grid is also unusual. There were reports of ""mayhem"" in Facebook headquarters, as technicians scrambled to fix the problem. Interesting too that the outage hampered Facebook's ability to tackle the crash - bringing down internal tools needed to remedy the problem. It should also be said that Facebook's statement is carefully written. It doesn't rule out foul play. The week had already started off badly - after the whistleblower in the ""Facebook Files"" revelations revealed herself on Sunday. But a bad week has become a terrible one for the social network.

"New car registrations fell to their lowest levels in September for more than two decades, according to figures from the industry's trade body. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said new registrations dropped 35% compared with the same month a year earlier. Falling car production has been blamed on an ongoing global shortage of computer chips. However, sales of electric cars are rising rapidly, the SMMT said. While the car market as a whole has suffered through the pandemic, more than 32,000 electric cars were registered last month, almost as many as registered in the whole of 2019. Second-hand car sales soar amid new model shortage Car production hit by 'pingdemic' and chip shortage September is usually a bumper month for car sales as the half-yearly change in number plates often attracts buyers. However, just 214,000 cars were sold in September - the lowest total for the month since the current registration system for Great Britain was introduced 23 years ago. Last year,new car registrations fell to their lowest level in nearly three decadesdue to falling production. About 1.63 million new cars were registered in 2020, compared with 2.3 million in 2019. The 29% decline was the biggest one-year fall since World War Two, when factories were turned over to military production. SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said the latest figures showed a ""desperately disappointing September and further evidence of the ongoing impact of the Covid pandemic on the sector"". ""Despite strong demand for new vehicles over the summer, three successive months have been hit by stalled supply due to reduced semiconductor availability, especially from Asia."" When lockdowns forced production lines to halt, microchip manufacturers diverted the chips that would normally go into new cars to the consumer electronics market, and supply is yet to fully recover. Alternative-powered cars remain the industry's bright spot, Mr Hawes said. ""The rocketing uptake of plug-in vehicles, especially battery electric cars, demonstrates the increasing demand for these new technologies. ""However, to meet our collective decarbonisation ambitions, we need to ensure all drivers can make the switch - not just those with private driveways - requiring a massive investment in public recharging infrastructure. Chargepoint roll-out must keep pace with the acceleration in plug-in vehicle registrations."" Second-hand car sales in the UK have more than doubled in recent months due to a shortage of new models. Year-on-year, the used car market grew 108.6% in the second quarter, with more than 2.2 million vehicles changing hands, according to the trade body. Increased demand led to a rise in sales of older used cars, with only 12.7% of all vehicles sold being made within the last three years, the lowest on record. New car sales are falling - while demand for used cars is rising. It's a question of availability. The chip shortage has forced car makers around the world to curb production, and focus their efforts on particular models - those which are most profitable to make and sell. The result is that waiting times for new cars have been getting longer. Scarcity is also pushing up prices, with discounts being slashed. That may well be deterring buyers. The slump in sales is bad news for the industry overall - but higher prices could be good for the carmakers long term. Customers, though, could have to get used to paying more.

"Fuel supplies to petrol stations in London and the south-east of England are improving but still remain behind the rest of the country, retailers say. The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) said 64% of forecourts in those areas had both types of fuel compared to 86% of sites nationally. Supplies have increased in recent days after the military was deployed amid a shortage of fuel tanker drivers. The government is offering 300 short-term visas to overseas lorry drivers. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said 127 foreign drivers had applied for visas aimed at tackling shortages, however, the Department for Business said only 27 drivers had been identified. It has not confirmed what Mr Johnson's number was referring to. The Times reported,externalthat just 27 people from the European Union had applied to be tanker drivers. The PRA, which represents independent forecourts across the UK, said ""steady deliveries and stabilising demand"" had led to improvements in stocks across the country. Gordon Balmer, PRA executive director, said 15% of sites in London and the south-east of England still had no fuel, down from 20% on Monday. ""Whilst there has been a significant reduction in dry sites, these areas are still lagging behind in having both grades of fuel available compared to the rest of the UK,"" he said. Nationally, the percentage of dry sites increased from 8% to 11% on Tuesday, the PRA said. ""Members are reporting they are now receiving deliveries from military drivers using commercial tankers, however further action must be taken to address the needs of disproportionately affected areas."" Besides fuel drivers, the government is offering a further 4,700 temporary visas in total for foreign food lorry drivers, which will last from late October to the end of February, in an attempt to avoid other supply chain issues. It is not yet known how many people have applied to this scheme. Mr Johnson said the slow rate of visa applications was a ""fascinating illustration of the problem"", which he added was a ""global"" issue, thought he admitted there was a ""particular problem in the UK"". What's happening about petrol shortages? Why is there an HGV driver shortage? He said working in road haulage ""should be a great job"", but added that there had been an underinvestment in facilities and pay conditions. He dismissed the suggestion that the problem was anything to do with Brexit. He noted the ""supply chain problem is linked to recovery"" and said other parts of the world were also affected. ""Imagine the UK has been in deep freeze and the pipes are unfreezing right now - stresses and strain of the economy waking up,"" Mr Johnson said. The Road Haulage Association (RHA) said the small number of visa applications was the ""proof in the pudding"" that short-term visas were ""not going to be attractive"". A spokesman for the trade body said that for visas to be an attractive proposition to overseas lorry drivers, they needed to last 12 months. ""The reality is that we have to assume these drivers from abroad are already in employment elsewhere. If visas are only three months... it's unlikely there is going to be much take up,"" he added. Livia Spera, general secretary of the European Transport Workers' Federation, said she was ""not surprised"" drivers were not ""rushing to sign up for visas"". ""We already predicted and warned that short-term measures such as visas wouldn't work,"" she added. Ms Spera said there was ""no quick fix"" to the problem. She said increasing driver wages and improving working conditions was the ""only answer to the crisis"". In response to the prime minister's comments on roadside facilities, the RHA's Rod McKenzie said it was a ""false premise"" that a trade body could deal with the issue alone. ""The majority of hauliers are small companies, less than 10 lorries,"" he said. ""It requires government commitment to facilitate the development of commercial sites. ""Government departments however have consistently ignored industry calls to press for cleaner and safer facilities on our roads."" Trade bodies have estimated the UK currently has a shortage of about 90,000 HGV drivers, which has been caused by several factors, including the coronavirus pandemic, Brexit and an ageing workforce. The shortages have started to affect supply chains in recent months, with some supermarkets struggling to stock certain products and petrol stations being unable to stock enough fuel to meet demand. The government has said temporary visas are not a long-term solution and has urged firms to invest in a UK workforce. Mr Johnson said the UK economy could not ""go back to the failed model where you mainline low-wage, low-skilled labour"". ""It's time for investing in people and skills."" No fuel at 20% of forecourts in the South East Visas for foreign lorry drivers extended Why is there an HGV driver shortage?

"Francois Devaux, head of a victims' association, welcomed the release of the damning report Some 216,000 children - mostly boys - have been sexually abused by clergy in the French Catholic Church since 1950, a damning new inquiry has found. The head of the inquiry said there were at least 2,900-3,200 abusers, and accused the Church of showing a ""cruel indifference towards the victims"". Pope Francis ""felt pain"" on hearing about the inquiry's finding, a Vatican statement said. One of those abused said it was time the Church reassessed its actions. FranÃ§ois Devaux, who is also the founder of the victims' associationLa Parole LibÃ©rÃ©e(Freed speech), said there had been a ""betrayal of trust, betrayal of morale, betrayal of children"". The inquiry found the number of children abused in France could rise to 330,000, when taking into account abuses committed by lay members of the Church, such as teachers at Catholic schools. For Mr Devaux it marked a turning point in France's history: ""You have finally given institutional recognition to victims of all the Church's responsibility - something that bishops and the Pope have not yet been prepared to do."" According to the Vatican statement, the Pope learnt about the report after he met visiting French bishops in the last few days. ""His first thoughts are for the victims, with a deep sadness for their wounds and gratitude for their courage in coming forward,"" it read. ""His thoughts also turn to the Church in France, and that, in recognising these terrible events and united by the suffering of the Lord for his most vulnerable children, it can take the path of redemption."" Pope Francis said he felt ""deep sadness"" for the victims after hearing about the inquiry, a statement said The report's release follows a number of abuse claims and prosecutions against Catholic Church officials worldwide. The independent inquiry was commissioned by the French Catholic Church in 2018. It spent more than two-and-a-half years combing through court, police and Church records and speaking to victims and witnesses. Most cases assessed by the inquiry are thought to be too old to prosecute under French law. The report, which is nearly 2,500 pages long, said the ""vast majority"" of victims were boys, many of them aged between 10 and 13. It said the Church had not only failed to prevent abuse but had also failed to report it, at times knowingly putting children in contact with predators. ""There was a whole bunch of negligence, of deficiency, of silence, an institutional cover-up,"" the head of the inquiry, Jean-Marc SauvÃ©, told reporters on Tuesday. He said that until the early 2000s, the Church had shown ""deep, total and even cruel indifference"" towards victims. In March, a service took place at the Cathedral of Lucon in France after the unveiling of a plaque in tribute to child victims of sexual abuse by priests ""The victims are not believed, are not listened to. When they are listened to, they are considered to have perhaps contributed to what they had happen to them,"" he explained. He added that sexual abuse within the Catholic Church continued to be a problem. While the commission found evidence of as many as 3,200 abusers - out of a total of 115,000 priests and other clerics - it said this was probably an underestimation. ""The Catholic Church is, after the circle of family and friends, the environment that has the highest prevalence of sexual violence,"" the report said. Olivier Savignac, head of victims associationParler et Revivre(Speak out and Live again), was abused at the age of 13 by the director of a Catholic holiday camp in the south of France. He told the Associated Press news agency that before the abuse, he had thought of the priest as ""someone who was good, a caring person who would not harm me"". ""We keep this, it's like a growing cyst, it's like gangrene inside the victim's body and the victim's psyche,"" he said. The inquiry found that about 60% of the men and women who were abused had gone on to ""encounter major problems in their emotional or sexual lives"". This was over 70 years and more than half the cases were before 1970. But still - for many French this will be the moment they wake up to the sheer scale of the phenomenon of Church sexual abuse.  What was once anecdotal and prurient is suddenly a defining feature of society. The burden of the report is that ad-hoc expressions of repentance and a bit of tinkering with ecclesiastical structures are no longer good enough. There has to be recognition that sexual abuse of youngsters by priests was systematic.  It was the Church - not rogue individuals - that was responsible. Many in the Church will be horrified by what they discover. Many will welcome the moment as a catharsis.  As Sister Veronique Margron, president of the Conference of Religious Orders, put it: ""If the Church must tremble, well let it tremble."" Only a handful of the cases covered by the inquiry had prompted any disciplinary action, let alone criminal prosecutions. But while most cases are now too old to prosecute via the courts, the inquiry called on the Church to take responsibility for what happened, including by providing compensation to the victims. It noted that while financial compensation would not address the trauma that victims had endured, it was ""nonetheless indispensable as it completes the recognition process"". It also made a series of recommendations about how to prevent abuse, including training priests and other clerics, and fostering policies to recognise victims. ""We expect clear and concrete responses by the Church,"" a group of six victims' associations said. The president of the Bishops' Conference of France, who co-requested the report, said the numbers of victims and their experiences were ""beyond what we could imagine"". ""I express my shame, my fear, my determination to act with them [the victims] so that the refusal to see, the refusal to hear, the desire to hide or mask the facts, the reluctance to denounce them publicly, disappears,"" Archbishop Eric de Moulins-Beaufort said. The French Church has previously announced a plan for ""financial contributions"" to victims, beginning next year. Earlier this year,Pope Francis changed the Roman Catholic Church's lawsto explicitly criminalise sexual abuse, in the biggest overhaul of the criminal code for nearly 40 years.

"Itâs day three of the Pandora Papers, a huge leak of 12 million files that expose the secret wealth and offshore dealings of the rich and powerful James Oliver, who led the investigation for BBC Panorama, and Fergus Shiel, International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) managing editor answered your questions Earlier the BBC uncovered the secret owners of swathes of UK property bought using offshore firms The wife of retail magnate Sir Philip Green went on a buying spree of London property while the couple's recently sold High Street empire teetered on the verge of collapse The Qatari ruling family purchased two of London's most expensive homes through offshore companies, saving millions in tax Ukrainian billionaire Gennadiy Bogolyubov, who has had his assets frozen in a fraud case, owns more than Â£400m of UK property Watch the full BBC Panorama investigation on BBC iPlayer or at the top of this page By Pandora Papers reporting team We're going to wrap up our live coverage of the Pandora Papers here. Over the last three days we've unpicked one of the biggest financial leaks in history and have seen 35 current and former world leaders - and hundreds more public officials - named in the files. There's undoubtedly been a lot to take in. If you've still got questions:  Thanks for joining us. We're nearing the end of our live coverage of the Pandora Papers, so let's have a recap of what we've learned from one of the world's biggest ever financial leaks. On Sunday we heard how:  On Monday, we heard more aboutpolitical party donorsin the UK:  And today:  The BBC was one of more than 140 news organisations to investigate the papers, so do check out other media outlets for dozens more stories. We've got through lots of your questions on the Pandora Papers this afternoon - thank you for sending such good ones in. If there are things you still want to know, we've gota simple guide to the leak. The final question comes from Joshua Page Joshua gets straight to the point. Here's what the reporters have to say on that: Fergus Shiel, ICIJ: Much better still, we can give you the greatest hits. Unlike Sam in Cheers, you donât have to stay up all weekend reading War And Peace to impress your love interest. Weâll give you the best bits to wow them. James Oliver, BBC Panorama: I donât think anyone has read every page of the Pandora Papers or ever will, but I suspect there are more stories to be found. Fergus ShielManaging Editor, International Consortium of Investigative Journalists Yes and no. ICIJ has shared data and details about the use of companies in secrecy jurisdictions by more than 50 politicians inthe Power Players feature,external. ICIJ also plans to incorporate some of the data from the Pandora Papers into the publicly-availableOffshore Leaks database,external. We've had plenty of questions asking why many of these revelations matter if the offshore activity is not illegal Fergus ShielManaging Editor, International Consortium of Investigative Journalists This isnât simply about alleged criminality, although there are many fugitives, convicted and accused felons in the documents. The offshore system offers secrecy, which provides an opportunity to hide assets from authorities, creditors and other claimants as well as public scrutiny. The system allows wealthy people to follow another countryâs financial regulations while not requiring them to live there. The offshore financial system can drain trillions from treasuries, worsen wealth disparities and protect those who cheat and steal while depriving their victims of recourse. Studies have estimated that the worldâs ultra-wealthy own the bulk of the $11 trillion dollar realm of offshore companies. More than 130 billionaires on the Forbes Magazine list turn up in the Pandora Papers. More than a dozen of those billionaires have faced serious questions regarding the sources of their wealth, typically arising from those offshore assets. James OliverBBC Panorama Itâs very early to say for sure what the impact will be. What we do know is that previous leaks and our coverage have had a real impact, not only directly by prompting criminal investigations, government inquiries, the resignations of prime ministers and other politicians, but also less directly. The fact is laws have changed. For example, stashing your money offshore to evade tax in the UK is harder than it was ten years ago when we did an undercover investigation of offshore service providers in the UK. Question from an anonymous reader Fergus ShielManaging Editor, International Consortium of Investigative Journalists Itâs too early to predict the impacts. On the positive side, authorities in the Czech Republic, Panama, India, Estonia, Mexico, Spain and Brazil have already promised investigations. Unhappily, ICIJ and our partners in numerous countries are facing very real attacks. Following the Panama Papers, governments reclaimed more than $1bn in tax. But the sad reality is that the secret economy is booming. Retail magnate Sir Philip Green has now responded to our earlier story on the Pandora Papers. We revealed that his wife, Tina Green,went on a buying spree of London propertywhile the couple's recently sold High Street empire teetered on the verge of collapse. Through their lawyers, both Sir Philip and Lady Green declined to answer detailed questions from the BBC, suggesting that these were private matters. When contacted by the PA news agency about the claims, Sir Philip said: ""I do not own or have never owned any offshore real estate."" Fergus ShielManaging Editor, International Consortium of Investigative Journalists ICIJ and its partners have sent out hundreds, possibly thousands of comment requests to the subjects of our stories. Not one has questioned the authenticity of the documents. Some have questioned our interpretation of them or of events surrounding them. But no-one has questioned the documents. ICIJ works with the best investigative journalists in the world. Complaints of bias are frequent but unfounded. We've had a few questions on this theme... James OliverBBC Panorama One of the first questions we ask on a project like this with millions of documents is whether or not they are genuine. But even once weâre satisfied thatâs the case thereâs an ongoing process to make sure that our information is good. That ends with putting what weâve discovered to the people concerned. As for the political question I can tell you that searches were done in relation to all the main political parties in the UK. But what party a politician is from is not the issue, the key question for me as a journalist is whether or not there is something that itâs in the public interest to investigate. Frederik Obermaier (L) and Bastian Obermayer were the leading lights of the Panama Papers investigation We've been answering your questions on the Pandora Papers, but it's not the first whistleblower-led investigation to rock the finance world in recent years. We've taken a look at some others below. FinCEN Files 2020 In September 2020 theFinCEN Files exposed the failure of major global banksto stop money laundering and financial crime. They also revealed how the UK is often the weak link in the financial system and how London is awash with Russian cash. Paradise Papers 2017 A huge batch of leaked documents mostly from offshore law firm Appleby, along with corporate registries in 19 tax jurisdictions, revealed the financial dealings of politicians, celebrities, corporate giants and business leaders. The documents contained details about investments made bythe Queen's private estate, a tax avoidance schemeused by three stars of BBC sitcom Mrs Brown's Boysand showed thatFormula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton avoided tax on his Â£16.5m luxury jet. Panama Papers 2016 An anonymous source leaked encrypted documents from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca. It sells anonymous offshore companies that help the owners hide their business activities. Overall the financial dealings of a dozen current and former world leaders, more than 120 politicians and public officials and countless billionaires, celebrities and sports stars were exposed. The Pandora Papers, with almost 12 million files, is the biggest of them all. Patrick Stillman's question was about whether the real issue isn't around the enforcement of existing tax laws but the laws themselves Fergus ShielManaging Editor, International Consortium of Investigative Journalists In an era of widening authoritarianism and inequality, the Pandora Papers investigation provides an unequaled perspective on how money and power operate in the 21st Century. In most countries, itâs not illegal to have assets offshore or to use shell companies to do business across national borders so we are not accusing people of that. But these affairs often amount to shifting profits from high-tax countries, where they are earned, to companies that exist only on paper in low-tax jurisdictions. Using offshore shelters is especially controversial for political figures, because they can be used to keep politically unpopular or even illicit activities from public view. Among the many names in the documents are some accused of massive fraud, sex crimes and child abuse, VAT scams, card-skimming, narco-trafficking, official and sports corruption, sanctions-busting, arms dealing and even murder. Question from Patrick Stillman James OliverBBC Panorama The Pandora Papers reveal important stories that involve both legal and illegal behaviour and sometimes behaviour that lies somewhere in between. The project raises questions about both enforcement and the law. You can introduce a law requiring offshore companies that own UK property to declare the identity of the person who ultimately owns it - something the government has said it will do - but unless there is scrutiny of the information given and penalties for not doing it, or giving false information, it is questionable how effective it will be. So itâs about both the law itself, and enforcement. A question from Twitter Fergus ShielManaging Editor, International Consortium of Investigative Journalists In the context of the US, this is perhaps the most significant offshore leak because it provides unprecedented insights into the trusts industry. The US is more interested in forcing other countries to share information about Americans banking offshore than in sharing information about money moving through US bank accounts, companies and trusts. What the documents show are tycoons and others linked to money laundering, corruption and worker exploitation choosing the US over the worldâs traditional tax havens. There are several big US names in the documents. The absence of US politicians is perhaps best explained by the geography of the 14 providers. We have very few documents from the Caymans, where many more Americans have traditionally parked their wealth. Question from an anonymous reader James OliverBBC Panorama As far as we are concerned we redact documents for a number of reasons, but usually because the information is not relevant to demonstrate the validity of the evidence. For example, the name of someone whoâs on an email chain, but has nothing to do with the story we are telling. As to giving people notice, if, for example, we are making serious allegations against someone we have to give them an opportunity to respond. Thatâs fair but it's also a crucial part of our journalism, to check the evidence we have and whether we are right or not. Kevin Todd's question was about the source of the leak Fergus ShielManaging Editor, International Consortium of Investigative Journalists ICIJ never comments on its sources. We can say that we obtained the information over months in batches and that we privately named the source Aladdin. Question from Kevin Todd James OliverBBC Panorama Thatâs really one for Fergus. But what I can say is that we do know where the information came from. Fourteen companies providing offshore services around the world. I think thatâs one of the things that makes this project so important. On previous projects I worked on, like the Panama Papers and Offshore Leaks, we had a relatively narrow insight through documents originating with one or two firms. This leak is global. Journalists Fergus Shiel and James Oliver will be answering your questions Thank you for submitting your questions about the Pandora Papers - plenty of you wanted to know more about the documents, whether you can see them and what impact they may have around the world. We've put them toJames Oliver, who led the investigation for BBC Panorama, and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) managing editorFergus Shiel. We'll post their responses here over the next couple of hours. Today we've been hearing about the secret owners of hundreds of properties in the UK. Let's look a little closer at Gennadiy Bogolyubov. He's a Ukrainian oligarch under investigation by the FBI for alleged money laundering. Via offshore companies he owns multiple properties in the UK, which were frozen in a court case. This commercial building he owns in Trafalgar Square was valued at Â£275m. It now contains a Prezzo and a Waterstones This property in Londonâs Belgravia, home to numerous foreign embassies, was valued at Â£62.5m in 2016 The property also contains two addresses down this mews He also owns a large block of offices in Knightsbridge valued at Â£75m near Hyde Park Lawyers for Mr Bogolyubov declined to comment as legal action is ongoing.

We can say that we obtained the information over months in batches and that we privately named the source Aladdin. Question from Kevin Todd James OliverBBC Panorama Thatâs really one for Fergus. But what I can say is that we do know where the information came from. Fourteen companies providing offshore services around the world. I think thatâs one of the things that makes this project so important. On previous projects I worked on, like the Panama Papers and Offshore Leaks, we had a relatively narrow insight through documents originating with one or two firms. This leak is global. Journalists Fergus Shiel and James Oliver will be answering your questions Thank you for submitting your questions about the Pandora Papers - plenty of you wanted to know more about the documents, whether you can see them and what impact they may have around the world. We've put them toJames Oliver, who led the investigation for BBC Panorama, and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) managing editorFergus Shiel. We'll post their responses here over the next couple of hours. Today we've been hearing about the secret owners of hundreds of properties in the UK. Let's look a little closer at Gennadiy Bogolyubov. He's a Ukrainian oligarch under investigation by the FBI for alleged money laundering. Via offshore companies he owns multiple properties in the UK, which were frozen in a court case. This commercial building he owns in Trafalgar Square was valued at Â£275m. It now contains a Prezzo and a Waterstones This property in Londonâs Belgravia, home to numerous foreign embassies, was valued at Â£62.5m in 2016 The property also contains two addresses down this mews He also owns a large block of offices in Knightsbridge valued at Â£75m near Hyde Park Lawyers for Mr Bogolyubov declined to comment as legal action is ongoing.

"Social media services Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram are back up and running after an outage that lasted almost six hours, Facebook says. It blamed an internal technical issue, which not only affected Facebook's services, but reportedly also employees' work passes and email. The services were down from about 16:00 GMT until around 22:00 on Monday. But the company said there was ""no evidence that user data was compromised"". Sheera Frenkel, the New York Times' technology reporter, told the Today programme part of the reason it took so long to fix was because ""the people trying to figure out what this problem was couldn't even physically get into the building"" to work out what had gone wrong. In a statement,Facebook said that the faulty configuration change affected the company's internal tools,externaland systems which complicated attempts to resolve the problem. Downdetector, which tracks outages, said some 10.6 million problem reports around the world. However, the real number of people affected is much higher: more than 3.5 billion people use Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and Whatsapp. Many found themselves cut off from family and friends they interact with over the various services, while small businesses which use social media to connect with customers were faced with the prospect of an unexpected financial hit. According to the business website Fortune, it also cost Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg an estimated $6bn (Â£4.4bn) at one point as shares plummeted. Mr Zuckerberg has apologised to those affected by the outage. Allow Facebook content? This article contains content provided by Facebook.

The disruption comes the day after an interview with a former Facebook employee who leaked documents about the company. Frances Haugen told CBS news on Sunday thatthe company had prioritised ""growth over safety"". On Tuesday she will testify before a Senate subcommittee in a hearing titled ""Protecting Kids Online"", about the company's research into Instagram's effect on the mental health of young users. Many outages get resolved fairly quickly. They are often localised too, with some people unable to open a website that can be viewed in another country. This outage, however, was global, and affected all of Facebook's many spin-offs. The length of time it was off grid is also unusual. There were reports of ""mayhem"" in Facebook headquarters, as technicians scrambled to fix the problem. Interesting too that the outage hampered Facebook's ability to tackle the crash - bringing down internal tools needed to remedy the problem. It should also be said that Facebook's statement is carefully written. It doesn't rule out foul play. The week had already started off badly - after the whistleblower in the ""Facebook Files"" revelations revealed herself on Sunday. But a bad week has become a terrible one for the social network.

"Sarah-Jane has sickle-cell disease, lives with constant pain and needs a blood transfusion every six weeks The first new sickle-cell treatment in 20 years will help keep thousands of people out of hospital over the next three years, NHS England has said. Sickle-cell disease is incurable and affects 15,000 people in the UK. And the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence said the hope of reducing health inequalities for black people, who are predominantly affected and often have poorer health outcomes due to a number of social factors, made the drug worth recommending. It called it ""an innovative treatment"". The drug, crizanlizumab, made by Novartis, is injected into a vein and can be taken on its own or alongside standard treatment and regular blood transfusions. And in a trial, patients taking the crizanlizumab had a sickle-cell crisis 1.6 times a year on average, compared with nearly three times a year normally. These painful episodes, which can require hospital treatment and lead to other health complications, are caused by by sickle-shaped red blood cells blocking the small blood vessels . But because the trial was small and lasted only a year, it remains unknown how long the benefits last for - and that makes it difficult to judge how cost-effective crizanlizumab is. Nevertheless, NICE, which recommends treatments in England and Wales, is recommending its use for over-16s, albeit under a special arrangement rather than routinely, on the NHS. And additional data on the treatment will be collected through clinical trials. The charity Sickle Cell Society said the new treatment brought ""new hope"" for people living with the world's most common genetic blood condition. NHS chief executive Amanda Pritchard said: ""The moment that a new drug comes that is approved to be used, our job is to make sure that we can do a deal to ensure it's affordable and get it out as quickly as possible."" Sarah-Jane has to rely on a whole range of medication to manage her sickle-cell disease, including very strong painkillers Diagnosed at birth, Sarah-Jane Nkrumah, 27, had her first crisis aged six months and has chronic pain in her joints. ""Every day is pain,"" she says. ""I don't remember the last time I had zero pain."" Sarah-Jane prefers to take breaks from taking painkillers -  but some days cannot get out of bed. ""You just have to try and manage it,"" she says. ""I don't have a choice. ""It's all about having a lot of mental strength and support."" And every six weeks, she has a blood transfusion to boost her energy levels. ""I feel weak and exhausted leading up to them and refreshed and stronger afterwards,"" she says. ""Thanks to donors, I get a chance to live another day."" Sarah-Jane had to give up her ambition to become a nursery teacher because it put her at risk of serious infection. ""Now, I have found my true purpose and love spreading awareness of sickle-cell disease,"" she says. Meindert Boysen, deputy chief executive and director of the Centre for Health Technology Evaluation, at NICE, said: ""Treatment for sickle-cell disease has been limited for years and there has been a lack of treatments for patients whose lives are affected by the condition. ""Crizanlizumab... has shown the potential to improve hundreds of lives and we are delighted to be able to recommend it as the first new treatment for sickle cell disease in two decades."" It is inherited from both parents, who pass on a particular gene It is possible to carry the gene without having the disease Nearly 300 babies are born with it each year in the UK A simple blood test will show whether someone has it Children with sickle cell are at greater risk of stroke Other symptoms can include serious infections, anaemia and tiredness Source: Sickle Cell Society / NHS UK Sickle cell disease - NHS About Sickle Cell Â» Sickle Cell Society Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting 'I have nothing to go back to' - BBC reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Trump avoids prison or fine in hush-money case sentencing LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"The Conservative Party is facing fresh questions about donations made by the wife of a former Russian minister. Lubov Chernukhin is one of the biggest donors to the Tories, giving more than Â£1.8m since 2012. Leaked documents reveal her personal wealth comes from her husband Vladimir. He has been financially linked to people who were close to the Kremlin. Mrs Chernukhin's lawyers say she is a British citizen and is entitled to do as she wishes with her money. Her donations to the Conservative Party have given the 48-year-old access to figures at the top of UK government. Mrs Chernukhin's winning auction bids have seen her play tennis with Boris Johnson and dine with Theresa May, when she was prime minister. But until now, very little has been known about the Chernukhins' wealth and where it comes from. Why are party donations often so controversial? A simple guide to the Pandora Papers leak Your guide to nine years of finance leaks World leaders deny wrongdoing after Pandora leaks The documents in the Pandora Papers leak of internal files and correspondence from offshore financial firms show the couple are linked to a network of 32 companies, three trusts and more than Â£100m in assets. The documents indicate that Mrs Chernukhin's wealth comes from her husband, with one email describing her as being ""financially supported by her husband"", and another as ""a housewife"". One document shows Mr Chernukhin's offshore company loaned Â£4m to his wife's UK company. The latest revelations follow separate allegations about two businessmen linked to donations to the party. Mohammed Amersi, who had given nearly Â£525,000 to the Tories since 2018,was involved in one of Europe's biggest corruption scandals that resulted in a telecoms company being fined $965m (Â£700m) in a US prosecution Abusinessman whose companies donated to 34 Conservative MPsis alleged to have made millions from one of Russia's largest fraud scandals. Former oil executive Victor Fedotov is the owner of a company behind a controversial infrastructure project in the English Channel, which is currently awaiting UK government approval Both men deny any wrongdoing. Working with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and the Guardian, BBC Panorama has had access to almost 12 million documents files from 14 companies in countries including the British Virgin Islands, Belize, Cyprus and Switzerland. The Conservative Party say all donations have been properly and lawfully declared and followed all the rules. Asked about the revelations about party donors that have emerged from the Pandora Papers investigation, the prime minister said all party donations are ""'vetted in the normal way in accordance with rules set up by the Labour government"", adding:  ""So we vet them the whole time"". The main political parties including Labour and the Liberal Democrats have all faced calls to hand donations back over the years. Meanwhile, in response to the claims, Transparency International UK says that vetting process for all political donors in the UK is ""little more than a box-ticking exercise"". ""It's easy to evade the rules or not look too closely. We must do better,"" they add. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said HM Revenue & Customs will examine the leaked papers ""to see if there's anything we can learn"". The Russian-born Chernukhins are both now British citizens. Pandora Papers documents reveal how they secretly acquired properties in the UK through offshore companies. They purchased a house overlooking Regents Park in London now worth Â£38m, as well as a mansion in Oxfordshire bought for Â£10m. Mr Chernukhin, 52, a former deputy minister of finance under Vladimir Putin left Russia for London in 2004 after being sacked by the president. The Pandora Papers investigation found evidence that suggests Mr Chernukhin abused his position as the government appointed head of a state bank to advance his private business interests. In evidence to a court hearing in London in 2018, Mr Chernukhin testified how he had reached an arrangement with the former mayor of Moscow, Yuri Luzhkov, to secure planning permission for a development he had a secret personal interest in. In return Mr Chernukhin told the court he proposed helping the mayor in relation to two other development sites in Moscow in which his bank had an interest. He told the court: ""As a part of negotiations or agreement with them how to proceed, we agreed...â¯that I will help them"", ""and Mr Luzhkov will help me"".â¯ Andrew Mitchell QC, a leading corruption barrister, told Panorama: ""That's a conflict, there's no two ways about it. Here is a man who's chairman of the bank, using the bank as a mean by which he enhances his own personal wealth. And that has corruption written all over it."" Pandora Papers files also show Mr Chernukhin has carried on doing business with people close to the Kremlin. They reveal his secret involvement in a property deal in St Petersburg in 2017, in which his partner was the wife of a then Russian government minister. He sold his stake in the property the following year for $30m, the documents show. Questioned in 2018 about the Chernukhin's wealth, Mr Johnson - then foreign secretary - said ""all possible checks have been made and... will continue to be made"" on donations. Asked whether the donations to the Conservatives should be declared as coming from Mr Chernukhin as well, political law expert Gavin Millar QC said: ""If it's joint money, if it's family money, why isn't he willing to have his name alongside hers in the quarterly return to the Electoral Commission, publicly identified as a donor, and the source of the money?"" He added: ""When you've got somebody who's a prominent associate of people who are connected with the Kremlin andâ¦ with Russian government, you would have thought any British political partyâ¦ would start to investigate it and ask why that money is being given."" Lawyers for the Chernukhins said Panorama's interpretation of the court case involving Mr Chernukhin was a ""gross mis-characterisation"". They said ""the suggestion that he acted improperly whilst an official of the state is wholly untrue"" and he ""has not accumulated his wealth.... in a corrupt manner"". The lawyers said it was not accepted that any of Mrs Chernukhin's political donations have been funded by improper means or affected by the influence of anyone else. Labour and the Liberal Democrats have both said the Tories should return themoney donated by Mohamed Amersi. Investigations by the BBC and its media partners have indicated the businessman was involved in negotiations for Swedish telecoms company Telia that resulted in $220m being paid to a Gibraltar-based company controlled by the daughter of the then president of Uzbekistan. The payment was described by the US authorities as a ""$220m bribe"". Mr Amersi has denied wrongdoing and his lawyers said the offshore company had been ""vetted and approved by Telia"" and that its involvement ""did not raise any red flags"" to him. Representatives for Mr Amersi said on Monday he had ""never knowingly facilitated corrupt transactions"" and the Pandora Papers reports sought to ""embarrass the Conservative Party"". Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine said: ""The Electoral Commission should launch an immediate investigation into these allegations."" The Labour Party chairwoman Anneliese Dodds said the allegations were ""concerning"". Referring to comments by Mr Amersi earlier this year that high-spending donors have been able to gain meetings with the prime minister and chancellor, she added: ""The Conservatives should return the money he donated to them and come clean about who else is getting exclusive access"". Elsewhere, the Russian government has dismissed allegations of financial impropriety involving President Putin contained in the documents leak. Other world leaders,including Jordan's King Abdullah, and the Czech Prime Minister, Andrej Babis, have also rejected allegations concerning the secret purchase of properties using offshore companies. Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan has said his government will investigatecitizens linked to the leak. Hundreds of Pakistanis, including members of Mr Khan's cabinet, are said to have had secretly moved wealth through offshore companies. Update 3 December 2021:  Following publication, Mr and Mrs Chernukhin have made legal complaints about this article.  They say that the article is defamatory of them. In their complaint, they have told the BBC that no deal (corrupt or otherwise) was ultimately concluded with Mayor Luzhkov in respect of the properties in Moscow. The Pandora Papers is a leak of almost 12 million documents and files exposing the secret wealth and dealings of world leaders, politicians and billionaires. The data was obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in Washington DC and has led to one of the biggest ever global investigations. More than 600 journalists from 117 countries have looked at the hidden fortunes of some of the most powerful people on the planet. BBC Panorama and the Guardian have led the investigation in the UK.

"The union that represents some of Hollywood's most important workers has voted to approve a strike in a move that could shut down nearly all US film and television production. Members of the International Alliance of Theatrical and Stage Employees (IATSE), which covers camera crews, prop masters, hairdressers and other craft workers say they are being worked to death with gruelling hours and no guaranteed rest or meal breaks. Members are demanding better work conditions, as well as fairer pay from streaming services to cover their share of labour. Over 50,000 workers voted overwhelmingly - 98% in favour to 2% against - to approve a work stoppage. Should they carry out the stoppage, the strike would be the biggest labour walkout in Hollywood since World War Two. Negotiations between the union and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers broke down last month after the IATSE walked away from a deal. The deal would have improved wages and rest periods, the Alliance said, and included a nearly $400m (Â£293m) pension and health plan. However, with the vote, the union has ""spoken loud and clear"" said its president Matthew Loeb. ""This vote is about the quality of life as well as the health and safety of those who work in the film and television industry,"" his statement Monday said. ""For those at the bottom of the pay scale, they deserve nothing less than a living wage."" After months of pandemic lockdowns in 2020, Hollywood's film and TV sets have been booming in recent months - and crew members say the hours and demands placed on them have become worse than ever. Like many around the world, Hollywood's crew members are re-evaluating how and when they want to work. On the streets of Los Angeles and on social media, Hollywood crew members have been sharing harrowing stories of 15-plus hour days, with claims of working more than 70 and 80 hour weeks. Some spoke of having ""work done"" - surgeries to rebuild backs and knees - failed marriages and missed weddings and funerals. ""Fraturdays"" are said to be a common occurrence in the entertainment industry - workers start on Monday mornings at 06:00, and on Fridays, start late in the afternoon or evening and work until Saturday morning. It leaves little time to do anything but sleep all weekend. ""My hours are insane,"" sound mixer Thomas Pieczkolon said during a rally on Sunset Boulevard as he decorated cars with chalk ""Vote Yes"" signs. He works on a $300m show for a streaming service and has to work nine hours most days before they even break for lunch, he said. Thomas Pieczkolon attended a rally on Sunset Boulevard Mr Pieczkolon recently worked a nearly 18-hour day on a Monday and his friend Jade Thompson, a costume dresser on the show, fell asleep at the wheel driving home. ""I nodded off and then came to and drifted off to the side and had a panic attack,"" she said. ""It wasn't even the end of the week! It was a Monday."" Workers have claimed that is a common problem - the adrenaline of a long day leaves them and the tiredness kicks in on the drive home. ""Sometimes you don't even realise until you're already in your car on that long ride home by yourself,"" Ms Thompson said, adding that her colleagues have WhatsApp group chats to make sure everyone gets home safe. The authorisation vote does not necessarily mean that a strike will take place. Most workers who spoke to the BBC said they hoped it would instead be the leverage their union needed to negotiate better deals. The last time Hollywood shut down for a labour dispute was the writers' strike in 2007 and 2008 amid the rise of reality TV and the soaring popularity of reality television stars like Donald Trump. Today, producers are under pressure to make a deal with workers. More than 100 members of Congress have urged them to implement more humane conditions. The authorisation for a strike could also set up a showdown with streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon, which union members said were taking advantage of their work. ""Streaming companies are getting a discount on our labour,"" said set decorator Lisa Clark. ""We deserve a fair share of that profit - we deserve to be paid at least what we used to be paid when we used to do network television."" Streaming services have transformed the industry with ambitious sets and epic shows and storytelling. Workers love that streaming shows look incredible like feature films, Ms Clark said - but she gets 10 weeks to prepare hundreds of sets which would have taken six months for a feature film. ""It's not a reasonable request,"" she said.
