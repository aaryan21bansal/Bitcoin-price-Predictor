"This video can not be played The BBC's Frank Gardner looks at what could happen to the man known as MBS The US is yet to reach a final conclusion on the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, officials say, despite reports the CIA believes it was ordered by the Saudi crown prince. ""Numerous unanswered questions"" remain, a State Department statement said. Sources told US media they did not believe the murder could have taken place without the approval of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS). Saudi Arabia has called the claim false and denied he had any knowledge. US President Donald Trump said he was due to receive a report on Tuesday which would outline who American authorities believe was responsible for the journalist's death. Khashoggi, a prominent critic of the Saudi government, was killed after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October to obtain a marriage document. Saudi Arabia says Khashoggi was killedas the result of a rogue operation. The public prosecutor has charged 11 people over the murder and is seeking the death penalty for five of them. But after changing its account of the death, and amid suspicions of a high-level cover-up, the Saudi government remains under pressure over the killing. The Washington Post, for which Khashoggi worked, saysthe CIA assessment was based partly on a phone call,externalmade by the crown prince's brother, Prince Khalid bin Salman, the Saudi ambassador to the US. Prince Khalid allegedly called Khashoggi at the direction of his brother and gave him assurances that he would be safe to go to the consulate. This video can not be played How has the death of Jamal Khashoggi impacted the war in Yemen? Prince Khalid, now back in Saudi Arabia, said on Twitter that he had not been in contact with Khashoggi for nearly a year. He said he had never suggested Khashoggi - who had been in London for a conference until the day before his disappearance - should go to Turkey for any reason. Saudi media ignore US reports on Khashoggi It is understood agents have also examined a call made to a senior aide of Crown Prince Mohammed by the team that carried out the killing. Sources quoted in the US media stressed that there was no single piece of evidence linking the crown prince directly to the murder, but officials believe such an operation would have needed his approval. The crown prince is widely described as the kingdom's de facto ruler. Not yet. ""Recent reports indicating that the US government has made a final conclusion [on the murder] are inaccurate,"" State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said. She said the State Department would continue to seek the ""relevant facts"" and work towards making those involved in the killing accountable. US President Donald Trump had spoken to CIA Director Gina Haspel and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the CIA's assessment of the Khashoggi murder, the White House said. Press secretary Sarah Sanders gave no details but said Mr Trump had confidence in the CIA. Earlier, the US president again stressed Saudi Arabia was a ""great ally"" and that he had to ""take a lot of things into consideration"". By Frank Gardner, Security Correspondent, BBC News The reported CIA assessment that MBS ordered the killing of Jamal Khashoggi largely matches those in other Western capitals, including London. The purported intercepted phone call - denied by the Saudis - between MBS's brother in Washington, Prince Khalid bin Salman, and Khashoggi, urging him to visit the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, would appear to be at the behest of the crown prince. A second intercepted phone call was from the hit team on the day of the murder to someone inside MBS's inner circle in the Saudi capital Riyadh. Again, it is hard to believe this would have been without the crown prince's knowledge. Taken together with the Sigint (signals intelligence), the case against MBS is damning but still circumstantial. Government officials do not believe there is a metaphorical ""smoking gun"" that explicitly ties MBS to the murder. But drawing on well-established diplomatic and intelligence contacts, they know that in that part of the world nothing gets done without sign-off from the top. In the tightly controlled Arab Gulf states, there is simply no such thing as ""a rogue operation"", as Saudi statements have described it. Meanwhile the glaring inconsistencies in the official Saudi explanations have only deepened suspicions of a state-sponsored cover-up. More from Frank: Is Saudi crown prince finished?

"Andrew Gillum admitted defeat following a recount in Florida. Democrat Andrew Gillum has admitted defeat to his Republican rival in the race to be named Florida's governor - for the second time. Mr Gillum, who hoped to be Florida's first black governor, congratulated Ron DeSantis in a tweet, 10 days after he first conceded the 6 November election. He withdrew the initial concession after Mr DeSantis's lead narrowed to 0.41%, triggering a recount. A recount has also been ordered in Florida's Senate race. US mid-terms: Why the elections still aren't over Unofficial results revealed Republican former governor Rick Scott was leading Democrat Bill Nelson by just 0.15% for a seat in the US Senate. Florida is a well-known swing state and has a history of close elections, so the slim margins are not a major surprise.

"Families of the crew have gathered at the Mar del Plata naval base to hear the latest details Argentina's defence minister has said it ""does not have the means"" to raise a missing submarine which disappeared with 44 crew on board, after its wreck was found beneath the Atlantic. The ARA San Juan went missing 430km (270 miles) off the Argentine coast on 15 November 2017, and was located a year and a day later. Officials said the vessel was lying 900m (2,950ft) below the surface. Relatives of the crew are demanding that the government raise the wreck. Navy commander Gabriel Attis has confirmed that the submarine imploded. He said the hull was ""totally deformed, collapsed"" and that debris was scattered over an area of about 70m (229ft). Who are the crew of the missing Argentine submarine? The wreck was found by US search firm Ocean Infinity, a private American company which can map the seabed. Argentina had engaged its services after an international operation failed to locate the doomed vessel. The company, which uses underwater rovers, previously tried and failed to find the wreckage of the lost Malaysian Airlines MH370 plane. Yolanda Mendiola, the mother of missing sailor Leandro Cisneros, 28, said families of the crew had been brought together by the navy to learn the latest details. ""We are with the other relatives. They are going to show us the photos. They say that our youngsters are inside,"" she said. ""We are all destroyed here."" Ms Mendiola called on the government to recover the wreck, saying: ""If we don't see it, we can't have closure. Therefore we're going to demand that the president (of Argentina) finds a way to get (them) out, because it's possible, the company said so."" Gabriel Attis, chief of the Mar del Plata naval base, said much of the sub's hull is intact The discovery came a day after relatives had gathered at a sombre ceremony to remember their loved ones. President Mauricio Macri attended and promised to keep up the search for the submarine. An anonymous naval officer told the AFP news agency that the vessel could be lifted - at a cost: ""Raising the submarine to the surface is not impossible, but it is a very complex operation, and therefore very expensive,"" the officer said. It remains unclear what caused the sub to implode, and the victims' families want an independent investigation. ""We have found them,"" Jorge Villarreal, the father of one crew member, told local radio. ""Now we are going to search for the truth. For us this is the start of a new chapter."" The ARA San Juan was returning from a routine mission to Ushuaia, near the southern tip of South America, when it reported an ""electrical breakdown"". According to naval commander Gabriel Galeazzi, the submarine surfaced and reported what was described as a ""short circuit"" in the vessel's batteries. The sub was ordered to cut its mission short and return to the naval base in Mar del Plata immediately. The Argentine navy's last contact with the vessel was at approximately 07:30 (10:30 GMT) on 15 November, at which point its captain reportedly confirmed that the crew were well. What happens when a submarine vanishes Eight days after the sub vanished, the CTBTO - which operates a network of listening posts to monitor nuclear explosions - said that there had been a ""hydro-acoustic anomaly"" about 30 nautical miles (60km) north of the sub's last-known position at 10:31 (13:31 GMT). Last year, navy spokesman Enrique Balbi told reporters that water had entered the submarine's snorkel, which can be used to take in air from above the surface when the submarine is submerged. The saltwater dripped onto a battery tray in the prow, causing the battery to short circuit and to smoulder, he said. The sub had reported the fault and had been ordered back to base, but then disappeared. Argentine authorities later launched a criminal investigation into the disappearance.

"Westminster Bridge was one of five crossings blocked by protesters Protesters blocked off five major bridges in central London as part of a so-called ""rebellion day"". Organisers said thousands gathered in central London to demand the government take greater action on climate change. Demonstrators occupied Southwark, Blackfriars, Waterloo, Westminster and Lambeth bridges for most of the day, after a week of action by campaign group Extinction Rebellion. They later moved on from the crossings to a rally in Parliament Square. Large groups of people holding banners began congregating on the five bridges from 10:00 GMT before blocking off the traffic. According to Extinction Rebellion, 6,000 people joined the protests Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Tiana Jacout, of Extinction Rebellion, said the blockages were ""not a step we take lightly"" but ""if things continue as is, we face an extinction greater than the one that killed the dinosaurs"". ""We have tried marching, and lobbying, and signing petitions. Nothing has brought about the change that is needed."" According to the group, 6,000 people joined the protests and more than 85 were arrested. Several people were arrested on Lambeth Bridge Climate protesters block London bridges The Met said the protests had caused ""significant traffic disruption"" Two protesters on Westminster Bridge, who did not want to be named, told the Press Association they ""truthfully believe we're all heading for extinction"". ""Climate change is so important, it's coming over so fast and nothing is being done,"" the women said. It is believed about 50 people have been arrested for taking part in action over the past week. There was a heavy police presence on all five bridges If climate change goes unaddressed ""we face an extinction greater than the one that killed the dinosaurs"", protesters have said The Met said the protests had caused ""significant traffic disruption"" and ""hampered"" emergency service vehicles from getting across London. On Wednesday,protesters glued themselves to the gates of Downing Street. At the start of the week, activists blockaded the UK's energy department bychaining themselves together on the pavement. By Roger Harrabin, BBC environment analyst We havenât seen a British green group quite like this before. It thinks marching with placards has failed, so itâs aiming to make mayhem instead. But have the protestors picked the right target? The UK is in the leading pack of nations in cutting the CO2 emissions that are over-heating the planet. The Climate Change Act locks Britain into reducing greenhouse gases by 80% by 2050, based on 1990 levels. And the government has kept pace with the step-by-step targets so far, mostly by stopping coal-burning for electricity. It promises to meet future targets too - although its advisers warn it has to improve by getting more electric cars on the road, and making homes and businesses more energy efficient. The protesters say the targets will be breached if the government spends Â£30bn on new roads, encourages fracking and looks to expand aviation even further. Climate change demands a seismic shift in society, they say. And theyâre not seeing that yet.

"One passenger's injuries were described as ""potentially life-changing"" Two men and a teenage boy were injured when a shotgun was fired twice into a minicab they were sitting in. They were waiting in the vehicle on Gordon Road in Edmonton, north London, at 18:00 GMT on Saturday when another car pulled up alongside them. At least two men got out of that vehicle then approached the minicab and fired a shotgun twice into it. Police said the minicab driver, 22, and his two passengers, aged 22 and 16, were all hurt in the shooting. One passenger's injuries were described as ""potentially life-changing"".

"The future of newspapers previously owned by Johnston Press has been secured after they were acquired by JPIMedia, a spokesman said. The newly-formed company bought out Johnston Press, publisher of the i, The Scotsman and the Yorkshire Post, following the court appointment of administrators earlier on Saturday. Johnston Press said it meant employees would keep their jobs. The newspaper group put itself up for sale last month. Johnston Press was one of the largest local and regional newspaper organisations in the UK, but had debts of Â£220m which were due for repayment in June next year. Its chief executive, David King, previously said the debt had ""constrained us"" and that none of the offers they had received for the firm was enough to repay it. Mr King, who is now the new chief executive of JPIMedia, said the sale was ""an important one for the Johnston Press businesses as it ensures that operations can continue as normal, with employees' rights maintained, suppliers paid, and newspapers printed"". He said it would focus on ensuring the group's titles continued to publish ""the high-quality journalism we are known for and which has never been more important"". Daily Mail 'looking to buy i newspaper' Publisher of the i newspaper up for sale And John Ensall, director of JPIMedia, said: ""In the absence of another financial solution being available for the business, we are pleased to have reached this agreement to acquire Johnston Press, to protect the value of the business, preserve jobs and allow for the uninterrupted publication of its websites and newspapers."" He said that as part of the transaction, it had reduced debt levels significantly and would invest Â£35m into the business. Meanwhile, the National Union of Journalists has said it has ""significant concerns"" about the long-term intentions of the newspapers' new owners. The union is demanding ""a commitment that this is not a transition leading to a carve-up of the group motivated by asset-stripping rather than a commitment to journalism and publishing"". The NUJ is expected to meet Johnston Press management on Monday. Johnston Press had titles covering more than 200 locations from Scotland and Northern Ireland to the south of England. It was founded in Falkirk in 1767, and listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1988, growing through acquisitions. The i, which was first launched in 2012 and sells for 60p on weekdays and Â£1 on Saturdays, was seen as the jewel in the crown of its papers. In its latest results, Johnston Press reported a 10% fall in revenues during the first half of 2018. It swung back to a profit of Â£6.2m for the six-month period, but this was mainly due to a one-off accounting gain of Â£8.8m. In September, the i recorded a year-on-year circulation drop of 9% to 242,408 copies. By Douglas Fraser, Business/economy editor, Scotland Facing a debt repayment deadline next June, with no sign of a refinancing deal, and with the market valuation of the whole company below Â£3m, Johnston Press was cornered. The new owners are led by GoldenTree Asset Management. Fidelity is a better known investor as part of the consortium, along with Benefit Street and Carval. They have set up holding companies for ownership of the titles. Such companies do not have a track record of investing in titles for the good of the staff or the communities they serve. But the spin on day one is that that is precisely what the new owners are doing. Supporting the Johnston titles with a debt write-off and new investment is being aligned with the success of an underlying business that remains ""profitable and cash-generative"".

"Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have been on Sky News, with former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr Mrs May warns party rivals that replacing her won't make Brexit negotiations easier or ""change the parliamentary arithmetic"" Labour leader Mr Corbyn says a further referendum is ""an option for the future but not an option for today"" Publication of the draft withdrawal agreement led to the resignations of two senior ministers and several junior ministers and aides Brian Wheeler and Tom Moseley From free trade agreement to no deal, find out what the key terms mean. What are the plans to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit? Theresa May has agreed a draft Brexit deal with Brussels. What happens now? Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have been out and about, setting out their stall on Brexit. We've also heard from the former Brexit secretary who resigned last week and Sir Graham Brady, the Tory MP who knows more than anyone how close the prime minister is to facing a no confidence vote. Here are some key lines:  Adam FlemingBrussels reporter The European Commission has
proposed 31 December, 2022 as the ultimate end date for a possible
extension to the post-Brexit transition or implementation period, according to
a diplomatic note of a meeting between Michel Barnier and EU27 ambassadors in
Brussels this afternoon. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier also said that the
UK is still pushing for a Chequers-style free trade area in goods with a common
rule-book to be included in the political declaration on the future
relationship. There was a divide between member
states that want an ambitious trading relationship with the UK and those who
want Britainâs access to the single market to be more constrained. The UK wants to maintain the
status quo on internal security, which is also âa problem,â ambassadors were
told. The final political declaration
could be between 14 and 20 pages long. Spain raised serious concerns
about Gibraltar, which officials fear could grow in the coming days. Michel Barnier said the political
situation in the UK was âvolatile.â A diplomat said the message from
the EUâs Brexit negotiators to the member states was âkeep a lid on your
concerns for now and weâll deal with them in the negotiations on the future
relationship."". The European Council is also
planning to issue conclusions which will go alongside the withdrawal agreement
and the political declaration when they are endorsed at the special summit next
week. New York Times The New York Times hastaken a quizzical look,externalat how Theresa May could be ousted as prime minister.  In a secret location, the chairman of a panel called the 1922 Committee was collecting poison-pen letters from rebels within Mrs Mayâs Conservative Party, calling for her to be removed as leader.  The number of letters is secret except to the chairman, Graham Brady, but once their number reaches 48, the committee â also known as âthe men in gray suitsâ â can demand a vote of all 315 Conservative members of Parliament. If she doesnât win half the votes, she will be forced to resign.  This is the way political death comes in Britain, speedily and stealthily.""  The Andrew Marr Show Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed her SNP MPs will vote against Theresa May's Brexit deal. The First Minister rejected claims her Westminster MPs could abstain on the vote in the House of Commons. The SNP leader told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show it would be ""deeply irresponsible"" for any MPs to endorse the prime minister's agreement, published last week. And she revealed she will be heading to London to talk to opposition parties about alternatives in the coming days. The SNP has 35 MPs at Westminster. Labour has said it will oppose the draft agreement in the crunch Commons vote, and the DUP - which props up the Tory government in key votes - has also criticised the proposals. Read more More from the DUP's Nigel Dodds, who has described the draft withdrawal deal as ""dangerous"". ""This deal would place a trade border in the Irish Sea, subject us to EU rules without any power to influence or change them and binds us to the EU with no unilateral ability to leave. Indeed, Northern Ireland is part of the EU customs union not the UK's."" Former first secretary of state Damian Green is an ally of Theresa May, so it's no surprise that he is strongly against any challenge to her leadership. If you step back, we are at the absolute crunch point of the most important negotiations this country has had for decades. I think saying that what the country now needs - let alone the Conservative Party, look at it on a national basis - to say that what the country now needs is a leadership election and a change of leadership, is absurd. From the country's point of view, I think that's exactly the wrong way to go.""  The Democratic Unionist Party, whose 10 MPs give Theresa May vital support in key votes, is not happy about the draft agreement, saying it could create a new border down the Irish Sea by making Northern Ireland follow different trade rules to the rest of the UK. Deputy leader Nigel Dodds said: ""I understand why some people fear a 'no deal' scenario. ""But the choice is between this very bad deal and the right
deal. ""With MPs on all sides of the House
pointing to the dangers for the Union of the Withdrawal
Agreement, it is clear that it is time to work for a better deal
which does not undermine the integrity of the United Kingdom.""  Catherine Haddon, of the Institute for Government think
tank, said the 25 November EU summit would probably have to be postponed if May loses a
vote of confidence. She would still be prime minister until a new Tory leader was elected, unless she resigned and handed over to a caretaker PM. âIt would have implications for the negotiations because we
donât know what the position of the new prime minister would be,â Ms Haddon told BBC
News. Appointing a caretaker PM would be âquite problematicâ because
the party is divided and would be unlikely to agree on a suitable candidate. The whole Tory leadership process takes about two months,
although they could shorten it, but they would âhave to say to the EU, and the
public, we will come back in January and try to get through the leadership
contest between now and thenâ. That would take us even closer to the 29 March, the
scheduled departure date, and make it even tighter to get the required Brexit
legislation through Parliament in time. Tory MPs will be conscious of the time pressure and if she
survives this week then the chances of her being ousted are reduced, argued Ms
Haddon. She could face another âpressure pointâ when MPs vote on the

Sky News Liberal Democrats leader Vince Cable says former Prime Minister David Cameron ""opened a can of worms"" that can't easily be closed when he called the referendum in 2016. Sir Cable said the whole issue of Europe was divisive and the ""least damaging"" way forward now would be to go back to the people, put the question before them and come to a ""clear decision"". The case would be made on facts rather than promises, as it was a few years ago, he said. Asked if he thought Mrs May would keep her job, Sir Vince said: ""I think so."" He said she had shown courage and character but that does not avoid the fact she made a terrible decision to set a series of red lines that could not be met.  Allow Twitter content?

Rob WatsonBBC political correspondent This time next week Theresa May hopes to be in Brussels finalising her Brexit plan with EU leaders. In the meantime she's fighting off challenges at home not just to that plan but her very leadership. Her message to hardline Brexiteers within the Conservative Party - getting rid of me won't make Brexit any easier. So far those Brexiteers have yet to muster the numbers against her for a vote of no confidence, though that could come any minute or any day. Whatever happens, whether she survives any leadership challenge or not,  the Conservative party now seems in a state of open civil war over Brexit with unforeseeable consequences for Britain's departure from the EU. The World This WeekendRadio 4 programme John Whittingdale, a former culture secretary, is one of the Conservative MPs who have submitted a letter calling for the prime minister to stand down. ""When you have a succession of resignations of the numbers that we have seen, not just this week, but when the Chequers Agreement was published, it does look like a government in disarray and it's very hard to reach any other conclusion. ""But that is because we are pushing ahead with a deal that commands very little support in the Conservative Party, is opposed in Parliament and certainly on the basis of my discussions with my own constituents, commands virtually no support in the country."" The World This WeekendRadio 4 programme Another Conservative association chair, councillor Tom Ashton of the Boston and Skegness association where people voted overwhelmingly for Brexit, says Mrs May should stay - for now. ""I wouldn't support a leadership challenge at this stage,"" he said. ""I feel she deserves the chance now to bring the deal that she's speaking of before Parliament. ""But if you cannot get a deal through, then I think it'll be up to party colleagues in Parliament 
to consider their options,"" he added. The BBC's Andrew Marr clashes with Baroness Chakrabarti, Labour's shadow attorney general, during a discussion about Brexit. Â© 2025 BBC.

"One passenger's injuries were described as ""potentially life-changing"" Two men and a teenage boy were injured when a shotgun was fired twice into a minicab they were sitting in. They were waiting in the vehicle on Gordon Road in Edmonton, north London, at 18:00 GMT on Saturday when another car pulled up alongside them. At least two men got out of that vehicle then approached the minicab and fired a shotgun twice into it. Police said the minicab driver, 22, and his two passengers, aged 22 and 16, were all hurt in the shooting. One passenger's injuries were described as ""potentially life-changing"".

"This video can not be played The BBC's Frank Gardner looks at what could happen to the man known as MBS The CIA believes that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, according to US media reports. Sources close to the agency said it had assessed the evidence in detail. It is understood there is no ""smoking gun"" but US officials think such an operation would need the prince's approval. Saudi Arabia has called the claim false and insisted that the crown prince knew nothing about plans for the killing. It says Khashoggi was killed as a result of a ""rogue operation"". US President Donald Trump has spoken to CIA Director Gina Haspel and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the CIA's assessment of the Khashoggi murder, the White House says. Press secretary Sarah Sanders gave no details but said Mr Trump had confidence in the CIA. Before the briefing, President Trump stressed the importance of Saudi Arabia to the US, as he has done since news of Khashoggi's killing emerged. ""They have been a truly spectacular ally in terms of jobs and economic development,"" he said. ""I have to take a lot of things into consideration."" Who was Jamal Khashoggi? Saudi journalist's death: Story so far Is Saudi crown prince finished? While there has been widespread international condemnation of Khashoggi's murder there has been little in the way of substantial action. The journalist was killed after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October to obtain a marriage document. His body has not been found. Turkey also insists the order to kill him came from the highest levels. The Washington Post, which Khashoggi worked for, says the CIA assessment was based partly ona phone call made by the crown prince's brother, Prince Khalid bin Salman, the Saudi ambassador to the US.,external Prince Khalid allegedly called Khashoggi at the direction of his brother and gave him assurances that he would be safe to go to the consulate. This video can not be played How has the death of Jamal Khashoggi impacted the war in Yemen? Prince Khalid, now back in Saudi Arabia, said on Twitter that he had not been in contact with Khashoggi for nearly a year. He said he had never suggested Khashoggi - who had been in London for a conference until the day before his disappearance - should go to Turkey for any reason. Saudi media ignore US reports on Khashoggi It is understood agents have also examined a call made to a senior aide of Crown Prince bin Salman by the team that carried out the killing. Sources quoted in the US media stressed that there was no single piece of evidence linking the crown prince directly to the murder, but officials believe such an operation would have needed his approval. At a news conference in Riyadh on Thursday, Deputy Public Prosecutor Shalaan bin Rajih Shalaan said Khashoggi was given a lethal injection and his body was dismembered inside the consulate after his death. The body parts were then handed over to a local ""collaborator"" outside the grounds, he added. A composite sketch of the collaborator has been produced and investigations are continuing to locate the remains. Eleven unidentified people have been charged over the journalist's death and the prosecutor is seeking the death penalty for five of them. By Frank Gardner, Security Correspondent, BBC News The reported CIA assessment that MBS ordered the killing of Jamal Khashoggi largely matches those in other Western capitals, including London. The purported intercepted phone call - denied by the Saudis - between MBS's brother in Washington, Prince Khalid bin Salman, and Khashoggi, urging him to visit the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, would appear to be at the behest of the crown prince. A second intercepted phone call was from the hit team on the day of the murder to someone inside MBS's inner circle in Riyadh. Again, it is hard to believe this would have been without the Crown Prince's knowledge Taken together with the SIGINT (signals intelligence), the case against MBS is damning but still circumstantial. Government officials do not believe there is a metaphorical ""smoking gun"" that explicitly ties MBS to the murder. But drawing on well-established diplomatic and intelligence contacts, they know that in that part of the world nothing gets done without sign-off from the top. In the tightly controlled Arab Gulf states there is simply no such thing as ""a rogue operation,"" as Saudi statements have described it. Meanwhile the glaring inconsistencies in the official Saudi explanations have only deepened suspicions of a state-sponsored cover-up. More from Frank: Is Saudi crown prince finished?

"Irish joy was unconfined after the final whistle at the Aviva Stadium Autumn internationals: Ireland v New Zealand Ireland: (9) 16 Tries:StockdaleCons:SextonPens:Sexton 3 New Zealand: (6) 9 Pens:Barrett 2Drop Goal:Barrett Ireland have beaten New Zealand on home soil for the first time with a frenzied 16-9 win at the Aviva Stadium. Jacob Stockdale's superb chip-and-gather try decided an absorbing contest between the top two sides in the world. Johnny Sexton advanced his claims for the world player of the year award with the rest of Ireland's points. The Grand Slam champions added to their historic first win over the All Blacks in 2016 as they sent out a warning before next year's Rugby World Cup. Stockdale's try pushed his side into a 10-point lead in the 49th minute and they produced a heroic defensive display, led by man-of-the-match Peter O'Mahony, to repel the inevitable New Zealand fightback as 'The Fields of Athenry' rang through the Dublin night. Relive the moment Ireland beat the All Blacks Schmidt scoffs at Hansen's 'Ireland now number one' claim A game of tiny margins was ultimately decided by a moment of brilliance from Stockdale which had Joe Schmidt's imprint all over it. Off a 10-metre line-out - Ireland's favourite attacking platform - the home side swung the ball towards the right before Bundee Aki dramatically switched direction and fed Stockdale down the narrow side. It left last season's Six Nations player of the year facing a group of weary All Blacks who were still picking themselves up from the line-out. The Ulster wing's deft chip took them out of play and he won the sprint with Aaron Smith to gather and score the decisive try. Jacob Stockdale's try helped push Ireland into a 16-6 lead and they held on despite intense late New Zealand pressure The tone for a frenzied but absorbing contest was set from the off when the Irish team took a half-step towards the New Zealand haka and sent the crowd into overdrive. The adrenaline coursed from the stands down onto the pitch, where New Zealand set a bewildering tempo, but a wonderful steal by Josh van der Flier and CJ Stander under their own posts helped Ireland to clear the danger. The All Blacks were living dangerously without the ball and repeatedly were warned for offside by referee Wayne Barnes as a half-time penalty count of 9-2 against the visitors told its own story. Sexton and Beauden Barrett traded early scores but the home side were unquestionably on top with Stockdale and Garry Ringrose looking menacing with every possession. Sexton nudged Ireland back ahead before Barrett landed a wonderful drop-goal to keep his side in touch after Cian Healy had been held up over the line and Rob Kearney had knocked-on in the act of scoring at the other end. Ireland dominated the second quarter after a superb gather-and-go by Stockdale brought them into the opposition half and they appeared determined not to leave without a try. A cross kick to Stockdale did not succeed but New Zealand's creaking defence continued to concede penalties and Kieran Read was warned about his team's indiscipline as Sexton eventually settled for a penalty to give his side a 9-6 half-time lead. Peter O'Mahony produced a number of vital interventions for Ireland in a man-of-the-match display Stockdale's try was the score Ireland deserved for their first-half domination and - crucially - pushed them more than a converted try ahead. But New Zealand are not the world's number one side for no reason and the black jerseys began to gather momentum in the final quarter. Reiko Ioane cut a dangerous figure with ball in hand and Kearney had to scamper back to gather Ardie Savea's kick through. Next it was O'Mahony's turn to save the day as the Munster captain somehow managed to pivot and dive on Barrett's grubber, and minutes later he put his body on the line again to produce a brilliant turnover that lifted the siege and simultaneously forced him off the field with an injury. Sexton conceded a penalty for a high tackle that allowed his opposite number to shrink the gap to seven points but the Ireland fly-half was fired up and he punched the air with a roar minutes later when he combined with Stockdale to bundle Ben Smith out of touch. Sexton also departed before the end as the big hits continued to rain in but the Irish line held firm to clinch a momentous victory. Ireland's man of the match Peter O'Mahony:""They're not the number one team in the world for nothing. We probably had to play our best game of this term and thankfully we managed to do that. ""It's a big piece of history and one that we wanted to tick off here in Ireland and now we have done it."" Ireland captain Rory Best:""To stop New Zealand scoring a try shows what a fantastic effort it was. The boys are very tired in there but it's amazing what a win like that can do to give you a little bit more energy. ""It's a big result for us no matter what the context is.

"This video can not be played Thousands march in France over diesel tax One protester has died and more than 200 were injured as more than a quarter of a million people took to the streets of France, angry at rising fuel prices. The female protester who died was struck after a driver surrounded by demonstrators panicked and accelerated. The ""yellow vests"", so-called after the high-visibility jackets they are required to carry in their cars, blocked motorways and roundabouts. They accuse President Emmanuel Macron of abandoning ""the little people"". Mr Macron has not so far commented on the protests, some of which have seen demonstrators call for him to resign. But he admitted earlier in the week that he had not ""really managed to reconcile the French people with their leaders"". Six held in plot to 'attack' Macron 'Gauls' resistant to change - Macron Jobseeker: Macron should help me find work Nonetheless, he accused his political opponents of hijacking the movement in order to block his reform programme. Some 280,000 people took part in protests across France, the interior ministry said in its latest update. It said 227 people were injured during the day, seven seriously, with 52 people arrested. Most of the protests have been taking place without incident although several of the injuries came when drivers tried to force their way through protesters. A driver forces a car through a group of protesters in Donges, western France Chantal Mazet, 63, was killed in the south-eastern Savoy region when a driver who was taking her daughter to hospital panicked at being blocked by about 50 demonstrators, who were striking the roof of her vehicle, and drove into them. The driver has been taken into police custody in a state of shock. In Paris protesters approaching the ÃlysÃ©e Palace, the president's official residence, were repelled with tear gas. The price of diesel, the most commonly used fuel in French cars, has risen by around 23% over the past 12 months to an average of â¬1.51 (Â£1.32; $1.71) per litre, its highest point since the early 2000s, AFP news agency reports. World oil prices did rise before falling back again but the Macron government raised its hydrocarbon tax this year by 7.6 cents per litre on diesel and 3.9 cents on petrol, as part of a campaign for cleaner cars and fuel. Tear gas was used to disperse protesters in Paris The decision to impose a further increase of 6.5 cents on diesel and 2.9 cents on petrol on 1 January 2019 was seen as the final straw. Speaking on Wednesday, the president blamed world oil prices for three-quarters of the price rise. He also said more tax on fossil fuels was needed to fund renewable energy investments. It has broad support. Nearly three-quarters of respondents to a poll by the Elabe institute backed the Yellow Vests and 70% wanted the government to reverse the fuel tax hikes. More than half of French people who voted for Mr Macron support the protests, Elabe's Vincent Thibault told AFP. Police attend as protesters block a motorway in Antibes ""The expectations and discontent over spending power are fairly broad, it's not just something that concerns rural France or the lower classes,"" he said. The BBC's Lucy Williamson in Paris says the movement has grown via social media into a broad and public criticism of Mr Macron's economic policies. They have certainly tried to tap into it. Far-right leader Marine Le Pen, who was defeated by Mr Macron in the second round of the presidential election, has been encouraging it on Twitter. She said: ""The government shouldn't be afraid of French people who come to express their revolt and do it in a peaceful fashion."" Allow Twitter content?

Laurent Wauquiez, leader of the centre-right Republicans, called on the Macron government to scrap the next planned increase in carbon tax on fossil fuels in January to offset rising vehicle fuel prices. Mr Castaner has described Saturday's action as a ""political protest with the Republicans behind it"". Olivier Faure, leader of the left-wing Socialist Party said the movement - which has no single leader and is not linked to any trade union - had been ""born outside political parties"". ""People want politicians to listen to them and respond. Their demand is to have purchasing power and financial justice,"" he said. Allow Twitter content?

On Wednesday, the government announced action to help poor families pay their energy and transport bills. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced that 5.6 million households would receive energy subsidies. Currently 3.6 million receive them. A state scrappage bonus on polluting vehicles would also be doubled for France's poorest families, he said, and fuel tax credits would be brought in for people who depend on their cars for work. Protesters have mocked the president relentlessly as ""Micron"" or ""Macaron"" (Macaroon) or simply Manu, the short form of Emmanuel, which he famously scolded a student for using.

"This video can not be played President Trump praised the efforts of police, politicians and recovery teams US President Donald Trump has visited California to survey the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in the state's history. The Camp Fire, in northern California, has killed at least 76 people. More than 1,200 people have been reported missing, although officials say that figure could fluctuate. In the destroyed town of Paradise, Mr Trump described the scene as ""sad"" and reiterated his disputed claim that poor forest management was to blame. ""We do have to do management maintenance and we'll be working also with environmental groups. I think everyone's seen the light,"" he said. ""I don't think we'll have this again to this extent,"" he added. Experts have pointed to the weather, climate change and population shiftsas bigger causes of the wildfires. The day Paradise burned down Before and after snapshots Besides the Camp Fire, firefighters are also tackling several other blazes, including the Woolsey Fire near Los Angeles which has claimed at least three lives. Adding to the misery, scores of people have become sick after outbreaks of the norovirus at shelters, andthe air quality in northern California has been rated the world's worst. Heavy rain is forecast next week that could douse the flames but also bring mudslides and floods on hillsides stripped of vegetation. The US president was greeted by Governor Jerry Brown and his successor Gavin Newsom, both of whom are Democrats and have sparred with Mr Trump over the wildfires. ""Now is a time to pull together for the people of California,"" Governor Brown tweeted. Mr Trump viewed the damage to homes in the town of Paradise, which was ravaged by fire In Paradise, Mr Trump praised the efforts of local law enforcement, politicians and the teams searching for survivors on the ground. ""This is very sad to see. As far as the lives are concerned, nobody knows quite yet,"" he said. ""Right now we want to take care of the people who have been so badly hurt."" Some locals held up pro-Trump signs, although one called him a ""moron"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Later in the day, Mr Trump, Governor Brown and Governor-elect Newsom visited an area in southern California affected by the Woolsey fire. Speaking to journalists, Mr Trump - who repeatedly referred to the devastated town of Paradise as ""Pleasure"" - and Mr Newsom pledged to work together to prevent future wildfire tragedies. However, the president said it had not changed his point of view on climate change. Authorities have suggested the scale of the fire was in part fuelled by a severe lack of rain in the state. ""I have a strong opinion,"" Mr Trump told reporters. ""I want great climate and we're going to have that and we're going to have forests that are very safe."" The death toll rose to 76 on Saturday after more bodies were found, most of them in Paradise. So far, officials have tentatively identified 63 of the dead, Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea told reporters. Troops are assisting forensics teams and cadaver dogs as they continue to search for human remains, eight days after the Camp Fire first broke out. Dogs are being used to search for human remains among the devastation Sheriff Honea put the number of people unaccounted for at 1,276. However, he also said 714 people have been found alive and removed from the list. Wildfire survivors: 'We swam to safety' Is it advisable to escape a wildfire by car? Red carpets cancelled after wildfires On Friday, the sheriff described the list as ""dynamic"". ""The information I am providing you is raw data and we find there is the likely possibility that the list contains duplicate names,"" he said. Some of those on the list may be fine but unaware they have been reported missing, or unable to call, authorities say. The Camp Fire is now about 55% contained but fire officials say they may not have it fully under control until the end of the month. Historically, California's ""wildfire season"" started in summer and ran into early autumn - but experts have warned that the risk is now year-round. Low humidity, warm winds, and dry ground after a rain-free month have produced a prime fire-spreading environment. Have you been affected by the wildfires? If it is safe to do so please get in touch.

"Westminster seems more peaceful tonight. Maybe I should just stop there. It is Friday night after all, and after the Big Dipper ride of the last few days, maybe for Number 10, and maybe for you, that's enough to be going on with for now. But Number 10 knows they'd be kidding themselves to imagine that the danger has gone. We simply won't know, probably until Monday, whether there are enough Tory MPs willing to put their names to letters calling for her to go to trigger a vote on confidence in her that might - in theory - force her from office. It is possible that by the start of next week Theresa May finds herself with a vote that could unseat her. If she doesn't, or even if she does but then wins such a vote, here's the problem. More than 20 MPs have put their names out there publicly calling on her to go and screaming protests at her Brexit deal. They might not get their confidence vote. Even if they do, they might not get enough support to oust her. But it seems impossible for those who have put their names out there to vote for the Brexit deal in a few weeks time. With the DUP bristling with rage about the deal and how it was arrived at, and very little sign of a cavalry of Labour MPs riding to the rescue, the number of public protests from those Tory MPs makes it seem like Theresa May's agreement is doomed. In that regard, how on earth does the government plan to get it through? Can they? There are two factors that Number 10 hopes will come through for them. First off, they hope that once the deal is done officially with the EU, next Sunday (25 November), then the dynamic will change. Something along the lines ofthe leaked plan to sell the dealthat we saw last week can get going, and when it does, expect it to rev up fast and loud. As we've discussed before plenty of times, the government machine will crank up fast and furiously to get MPs to back the deal - or else. And they also hope that more Labour MPs than currently expected will back them in the end. That's not just because they could choose a deal rather than open Pandora's box. But it's also because there's a belief in Number 10 that Labour's fellow politicians on the left around Europe will make it clear that frankly, this deal is the best the UK will get, and that a hypothetical Labour government couldn't and wouldn't do any better. Is that realistic, when the opposition party have the temptation of doing maximum damage to the government of the day? Let's see. For some of the government's critics, it's simply deluded to imagine they will be able to turn this debate around. The draft deal, only 48 hours after it was published, has been roundly attacked. There are many more MPs on the record now than are needed to defeat the agreement in Parliament. But it is impossible to be in the minds of the MPs contemplating turning in a letter calling for May to quit over the weekend. And harder still to be in the minds of those who will have an agonising choice if the deal makes it to the Commons in a few weeks time. It is calmer in Westminster tonight, but it is messy, and the danger hasn't gone away.

"Al James (front centre) died in hospital after suffering a fall One of the original members of the pop group Showaddywaddy has died at the age of 72. Bassist Al James, whose real name was Geoffrey Betts, died in hospital on Friday, three weeks after suffering a fall at his Market Harborough home. Ex-Showaddywaddy frontman Dave Bartram told the BBC that James was ""a great mate and I loved the guy to bits"". The band, which formed in Leicester in 1973, specialised in revivals of hit songs from the 1950s and 1960s. The group performing Under the Moon of Love in 1976 James was with the group for 35 years and retired in 2008. Bartram said: ""He just had that little bit of something different to offer. ""His sense of mischief and fun - that's the unforgettable. ""He lived life to the full. He loved the rock and roll lifestyle... he was a good bloke."" Showaddywaddy were regulars on Top of the Pops in the 1970s The lead singer said he spoke to the retired bassist in hospital before he died. ""He's not one to show emotion, but he grabbed a hold of my hand and there was a little tear in his eye and he said to me 'would you say a few words at my funeral?',"" Bartram said. ""It will be difficult, but it's something I intend to honour."" Romeo Challenger, Showaddywaddy's drummer since 1973, said: ""He was one of the funniest people I have ever met - his anecdotes were hilarious - [he was] generous to a fault, and we all loved him."" The eight-piece group sold millions of records The band had their first hit single, Hey Rock and Roll, in 1974. The eight-piece group had 15 UK top 20 hit singles during the 1970s. They sold millions of records, including top five hits Under the Moon of Love, You Got What It Takes and Three Steps to Heaven. The band's appeal began to wane at the end of the decade although they have continued to record and tour. Follow BBC East Midlands onFacebook,external,Twitter,external, orInstagram,external.

"Families of the crew have gathered at the Mar del Plata naval base to hear the latest details Argentina's defence minister has said it ""does not have the means"" to raise a missing submarine which disappeared with 44 crew on board, after its wreck was found beneath the Atlantic. The ARA San Juan went missing 430km (270 miles) off the Argentine coast on 15 November 2017, and was located a year and a day later. Officials said the vessel was lying 900m (2,950ft) below the surface. Relatives of the crew are demanding that the government raise the wreck. Navy commander Gabriel Attis has confirmed that the submarine imploded. He said the hull was ""totally deformed, collapsed"" and that debris was scattered over an area of about 70m (229ft). Who are the crew of the missing Argentine submarine? The wreck was found by US search firm Ocean Infinity, a private American company which can map the seabed. Argentina had engaged its services after an international operation failed to locate the doomed vessel. The company, which uses underwater rovers, previously tried and failed to find the wreckage of the lost Malaysian Airlines MH370 plane. Yolanda Mendiola, the mother of missing sailor Leandro Cisneros, 28, said families of the crew had been brought together by the navy to learn the latest details. ""We are with the other relatives. They are going to show us the photos. They say that our youngsters are inside,"" she said. ""We are all destroyed here."" Ms Mendiola called on the government to recover the wreck, saying: ""If we don't see it, we can't have closure. Therefore we're going to demand that the president (of Argentina) finds a way to get (them) out, because it's possible, the company said so."" Gabriel Attis, chief of the Mar del Plata naval base, said much of the sub's hull is intact The discovery came a day after relatives had gathered at a sombre ceremony to remember their loved ones. President Mauricio Macri attended and promised to keep up the search for the submarine. An anonymous naval officer told the AFP news agency that the vessel could be lifted - at a cost: ""Raising the submarine to the surface is not impossible, but it is a very complex operation, and therefore very expensive,"" the officer said. It remains unclear what caused the sub to implode, and the victims' families want an independent investigation. ""We have found them,"" Jorge Villarreal, the father of one crew member, told local radio. ""Now we are going to search for the truth. For us this is the start of a new chapter."" The ARA San Juan was returning from a routine mission to Ushuaia, near the southern tip of South America, when it reported an ""electrical breakdown"". According to naval commander Gabriel Galeazzi, the submarine surfaced and reported what was described as a ""short circuit"" in the vessel's batteries. The sub was ordered to cut its mission short and return to the naval base in Mar del Plata immediately. The Argentine navy's last contact with the vessel was at approximately 07:30 (10:30 GMT) on 15 November, at which point its captain reportedly confirmed that the crew were well. What happens when a submarine vanishes Eight days after the sub vanished, the CTBTO - which operates a network of listening posts to monitor nuclear explosions - said that there had been a ""hydro-acoustic anomaly"" about 30 nautical miles (60km) north of the sub's last-known position at 10:31 (13:31 GMT). Last year, navy spokesman Enrique Balbi told reporters that water had entered the submarine's snorkel, which can be used to take in air from above the surface when the submarine is submerged. The saltwater dripped onto a battery tray in the prow, causing the battery to short circuit and to smoulder, he said. The sub had reported the fault and had been ordered back to base, but then disappeared. Argentine authorities later launched a criminal investigation into the disappearance.

"Relatives have fought to ensure their loved ones were found The wreckage of a submarine which went missing with 44 crew on board a year ago has been found, the Argentine navy says. The ARA San Juan submarine disappeared 430km (270 miles) off the Argentine coast on 15 November 2017. The navy stopped its rescue mission two weeks after the sub's disappearance. However, a year and a day after it went missing, officials announced it had been found 800m (2,620ft) below the surface of the Atlantic Ocean. Who are the crew of the missing Argentine submarine? According to a tweet from the Argentine navy, the ARA San Juan had been positively identified under the water by a US company. The navy had earlier shared a picture from the seabed, suggesting a 60m-long object might be the missing submarine. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Cadaver dogs have been brought in to help with the search for bodies More than 1,000 people have been reported missing in a California wildfire which has destroyed thousands of homes and killed at least 71, local officials have said. The death toll rose from 63 on Friday, eight days after the Camp Fire broke out in northern California. However, the sharp increase in the missing list - from 631 to 1,011 in 24 hours - may not be accurate. Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said it was possible it contained duplications.

However, there could also be people among the dead who no-one has yet realised are missing. The fire - the deadliest in the state's history - has destroyed 142,000 acres (57,000 ha), including most of the town of Paradise, home to 27,000 people. Rescue workers, aided by cadaver dogs, were continuing to comb what little remained of the town on Friday. In total, some 47,000 people have been told to evacuate, with those who have fled the fire being houses in emergency shelters, as well as with friends and family, while others are camping. President Donald Trump is due to travel to California on Saturday to survey the damage and meet those affected. The California Fire Department says it has now contained about 50% of the Camp Fire blaze. Officials say they do not expect to fully contain the blaze until the end of the month.

Three more people have also died in the Woolsey Fire. The worst-hit area is Paradise, with officials saying it will need a ""total rebuild"" job that will take several years.

Red carpets cancelled after wildfires Brock Long, administrator of Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), said the damage to Paradise was ""one of the worst disasters"" he had ever seen. Military troops are assisting forensics teams and cadaver dogs as they continue to search for human remains. Seven more bodies were found in the town on Friday, the sheriff's office confirmed, while an eighth was found in Magalia, just to the north. Two of the victims were named as Paula and Randall Dodge, aged 70 and 67, of Paradise. Three others were identified earlier in the week: Ernest Foss, 65, of Paradise, Jesus Fernandez, 48, of Concow, and Carl Wiley, 77, of Magalia. Officials have warned the search operation could go on for weeks. Officials have not yet confirmed what started any of the blazes, as investigations are continuing. Several people have already filed a lawsuit against a local power company, alleging that the Camp Fire started when a high-voltage transmission line failed.

"This video can not be played President Trump praised the efforts of police, politicians and recovery teams US President Donald Trump has visited California to survey the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in the state's history. The Camp Fire, in northern California, has killed at least 76 people. More than 1,200 people have been reported missing, although officials say that figure could fluctuate. In the destroyed town of Paradise, Mr Trump described the scene as ""sad"" and reiterated his disputed claim that poor forest management was to blame. ""We do have to do management maintenance and we'll be working also with environmental groups. I think everyone's seen the light,"" he said. ""I don't think we'll have this again to this extent,"" he added. Experts have pointed to the weather, climate change and population shiftsas bigger causes of the wildfires. The day Paradise burned down Before and after snapshots Besides the Camp Fire, firefighters are also tackling several other blazes, including the Woolsey Fire near Los Angeles which has claimed at least three lives. Adding to the misery, scores of people have become sick after outbreaks of the norovirus at shelters, andthe air quality in northern California has been rated the world's worst. Heavy rain is forecast next week that could douse the flames but also bring mudslides and floods on hillsides stripped of vegetation. The US president was greeted by Governor Jerry Brown and his successor Gavin Newsom, both of whom are Democrats and have sparred with Mr Trump over the wildfires. ""Now is a time to pull together for the people of California,"" Governor Brown tweeted. Mr Trump viewed the damage to homes in the town of Paradise, which was ravaged by fire In Paradise, Mr Trump praised the efforts of local law enforcement, politicians and the teams searching for survivors on the ground. ""This is very sad to see. As far as the lives are concerned, nobody knows quite yet,"" he said. ""Right now we want to take care of the people who have been so badly hurt."" Some locals held up pro-Trump signs, although one called him a ""moron"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Later in the day, Mr Trump, Governor Brown and Governor-elect Newsom visited an area in southern California affected by the Woolsey fire. Speaking to journalists, Mr Trump - who repeatedly referred to the devastated town of Paradise as ""Pleasure"" - and Mr Newsom pledged to work together to prevent future wildfire tragedies. However, the president said it had not changed his point of view on climate change. Authorities have suggested the scale of the fire was in part fuelled by a severe lack of rain in the state. ""I have a strong opinion,"" Mr Trump told reporters. ""I want great climate and we're going to have that and we're going to have forests that are very safe."" The death toll rose to 76 on Saturday after more bodies were found, most of them in Paradise. So far, officials have tentatively identified 63 of the dead, Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea told reporters. Troops are assisting forensics teams and cadaver dogs as they continue to search for human remains, eight days after the Camp Fire first broke out. Dogs are being used to search for human remains among the devastation Sheriff Honea put the number of people unaccounted for at 1,276. However, he also said 714 people have been found alive and removed from the list. Wildfire survivors: 'We swam to safety' Is it advisable to escape a wildfire by car? Red carpets cancelled after wildfires On Friday, the sheriff described the list as ""dynamic"". ""The information I am providing you is raw data and we find there is the likely possibility that the list contains duplicate names,"" he said. Some of those on the list may be fine but unaware they have been reported missing, or unable to call, authorities say.

"It's hard enough to run a small business at the best of times. But the Brexit talks are adding an extra level of stress for many entrepreneurs. During the run-up to the referendum in June 2016,the BBC spoke to dozens of small business ownersabout the prospect of the UK leaving the European Union. Almost two and a half years later, we got back in touch, to find out what they make of the show so far and the prime minister's draft Brexit agreement. Stephen Britt's firm, Anchor Storage, organises warehousing and distribution for other companies. His Suffolk-based business employs 19 people. Mr Britt voted to leave the European Union, but has become unhappy about the way the talks have been handled. ""I'm getting increasingly sick and tired of the paucity of ambition of our Whitehall civil servants and the supine politicians who are in charge of them. ""I'm just really fed up with the whole thing, at how inadequate we've all been, in what should have been a relatively sensible, level-headed negotiation."" But despite his frustration, he would vote to leave again. The talks have proved, in his opinion, that the European Union is a ""protectionist organisation"" not interested in ""making globalism work"". Kris Ingham is the founder and chief executive of Rejuvenation, a health drinks business. The London-based firm employs four people. Kris, who voted to remain, says of the current situation: ""It's carnage, but carnage from a political sense more than anything else. ""From a business perspective I still hold the same view, it's business as usual."" His company is planning to expand into Europe. ""I'm more than happy to be involved in Europe, to have production in Europe and sales in Europe."" He always suspected the European Union would not make it easy for the UK to leave. ""They kind of have to make this as protracted as possible to put off other nations doing this as well."" Brexit Q&A: Your questions answered Brexit: Where we are in eight charts Shelley Lloyd's business sells staff relocation services. It was recently sold to a bigger organisation and is now called Celsium Powered by Brunel. She voted to leave, but is having second thoughts. ""Knowing what I know now, perhaps I would have voted to remain."" She thinks the negotiations have been managed badly and communication from the government has been poor. ""The government has repeatedly given the general public misinformation,"" she says. Currently, she is helping clients work out how much extra it will cost after Brexit to keep EU nationals working in the UK, and UK workers in the European Union. Ed Salt is managing director of dairy products firm Delamere Dairy. The Cheshire-based business employs 23 staff. Mr Salt, who voted to remain, just laughs when asked what he makes of the current situation. ""We're still very hopeful of a deal going through,"" he says. ""A significant proportion of business owners and politicians really want to get a soft Brexit, rather than a hard Brexit and I think there was a will on both sides of the fence in Europe and the UK, but how we actually get there is unknown."" He has been making preparations in case a deal is not reached, including checking contracts, hedging against possible currency moves and perhaps switching some production to the European Union, so he can supply his clients there. But his company has been unable to get extra warehousing space. ""It's already pre-booked by people stockpiling,"" he says. Julie Price has been running her own insurance business, Julie Price & Co, for 30 years. The Hinkley-based firm employs five staff. The Leave supporter expected negotiations to be difficult. ""When you're negotiating anything you have to go backwards to go forwards."" She does not regret voting to leave, saying the European Union has ""massive problems"". ""When you've got 27 or 28 countries how are you all going to agree on something? It takes ages. Have you ever tried [to organise] a committee of over 10 people? You get nothing done,"" she says. She is not worried by a hard Brexit, saying it won't be as bad as the 2008 financial crisis. ""When the banks had that big wobble, that was massive."" Jennifer Brown runs her own luxury accessories business, Pampeano. The Oxford-based company has seven employees. Ms Brown, who voted to remain, says about the latest turmoil: ""It's very disappointing. There's still no clarity and it seems to be ever worse."" All of her raw materials are priced in dollars, so the weakness of the pound since the referendum has cut her profits by 30%. ""I had hopes earlier this week that there would be a definitive bounce in the pound, but no. It's still not happening. We seem to be in even more of a mess."" However, she is ""delighted"" that Theresa May's deal plans to keep the UK in a customs union in the short term, which is ""essential"" for her business.

"Now the Brexit deal has been signed off in Brussels, attention turns to Westminster. MPs will get their say on whether they approve of the deal or not. Several days of debate will be followed by what's known as the ""meaningful vote"". This is expected to take place in the week beginning 10 December. Any attempt to work out the parliamentary arithmetic can only be an estimate so all numbers should be treated with caution. As things stand, though, there seems to be a majority against the proposed deal. What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? Who has written no confidence letters? A guide to where we are with Brexit Theresa May relies on the 10 Democratic Unionist Party MPs for her majority in the House of Commons. Their opposition to the proposed deal alone could make winning the vote tricky but the prime minister's problems don't end there. Some 57 Conservative MPs have signed up to the StandUp4Brexit campaign which argues that the proposed deal leaves the UK too close to the EU. (That includes Charlie Elphicke who is currently suspended from the party but generally votes with the government.) Added to those are the seven pro-Brexit MPs who resigned from government or party jobs on 15 November. And several more who have publicly stated they are opposed to the deal. Then there are, perhaps, a further dozen or so Conservative MPs from the Remain wing of the party who support the People's Vote campaign for another referendum or would like a closer relationship with the EU. All in all, there are around 80-90 Tories currently set to defy the government. Some of them have only said they can't support the deal which, perhaps, suggests, they might abstain when it comes to the crucial vote. But others are more hardline. On the other side of the calculation, there are a handful of pro-Brexit Labour MPs who might back the deal. And a further group who could vote for it to stop the possible alternative of a ""no deal"" Brexit. There's also one Liberal Democrat MP, Stephen Lloyd, who says he'll vote in favour of the deal to fulfil a pledge he made to his constituents. As things stand, though, this group isn't big enough to outweigh the DUP and Conservative rebels. Things can change of course. Mrs May will hope to persuade some of the rebels and more opposition MPs. But she has a long way to go.

"This video can not be played Richard Baker introduced the first news bulletin broadcast on BBC TV. Former BBC newsreader Richard Baker has died aged 93. The son of a plasterer, London-born Baker introduced the first BBC TV news bulletin broadcast in July 1954. He went on to front the Last Night of the Proms and present on Radio 2, 3 and 4. Baker's son James said his father died this morning at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. BBC director general Tony Hall was among those to pay tribute, saying he ""became the face of news for millions"". Obituary: The voice of the first BBC TV news bulletin Baker's studies at Cambridge University were interrupted by World War Two. He served on a minesweeper with the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve during the conflict, attached to the supply convoys to Russia. A keen amateur dramatist, Baker resumed his education after the war and joined the BBC in 1950 as a radio presenter. Baker presented BBC TV news bulletins until 1982.

Baker also presented coverage of the Proms Lord Hall said Baker had been ""at the forefront of the creation of the modern news presenter"", adding: ""He was a calm and assured presence who became the face of news for millions. ""Later, he became a great advocate for classical music, presenting many much loved programmes.  But more than that, he was quite simply a lovely and charming man. ""Our sympathies are with his many friends and family.""

"The future of newspapers previously owned by Johnston Press has been secured after they were acquired by JPIMedia, a spokesman said. The newly-formed company bought out Johnston Press, publisher of the i, The Scotsman and the Yorkshire Post, following the court appointment of administrators earlier on Saturday. Johnston Press said it meant employees would keep their jobs. The newspaper group put itself up for sale last month. Johnston Press was one of the largest local and regional newspaper organisations in the UK, but had debts of Â£220m which were due for repayment in June next year. Its chief executive, David King, previously said the debt had ""constrained us"" and that none of the offers they had received for the firm was enough to repay it. Mr King, who is now the new chief executive of JPIMedia, said the sale was ""an important one for the Johnston Press businesses as it ensures that operations can continue as normal, with employees' rights maintained, suppliers paid, and newspapers printed"". He said it would focus on ensuring the group's titles continued to publish ""the high-quality journalism we are known for and which has never been more important"". Daily Mail 'looking to buy i newspaper' Publisher of the i newspaper up for sale And John Ensall, director of JPIMedia, said: ""In the absence of another financial solution being available for the business, we are pleased to have reached this agreement to acquire Johnston Press, to protect the value of the business, preserve jobs and allow for the uninterrupted publication of its websites and newspapers."" He said that as part of the transaction, it had reduced debt levels significantly and would invest Â£35m into the business. Meanwhile, the National Union of Journalists has said it has ""significant concerns"" about the long-term intentions of the newspapers' new owners. The union is demanding ""a commitment that this is not a transition leading to a carve-up of the group motivated by asset-stripping rather than a commitment to journalism and publishing"". The NUJ is expected to meet Johnston Press management on Monday. Johnston Press had titles covering more than 200 locations from Scotland and Northern Ireland to the south of England. It was founded in Falkirk in 1767, and listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1988, growing through acquisitions. The i, which was first launched in 2012 and sells for 60p on weekdays and Â£1 on Saturdays, was seen as the jewel in the crown of its papers. In its latest results, Johnston Press reported a 10% fall in revenues during the first half of 2018. It swung back to a profit of Â£6.2m for the six-month period, but this was mainly due to a one-off accounting gain of Â£8.8m. In September, the i recorded a year-on-year circulation drop of 9% to 242,408 copies. By Douglas Fraser, Business/economy editor, Scotland Facing a debt repayment deadline next June, with no sign of a refinancing deal, and with the market valuation of the whole company below Â£3m, Johnston Press was cornered. The new owners are led by GoldenTree Asset Management. Fidelity is a better known investor as part of the consortium, along with Benefit Street and Carval. They have set up holding companies for ownership of the titles. Such companies do not have a track record of investing in titles for the good of the staff or the communities they serve. But the spin on day one is that that is precisely what the new owners are doing. Supporting the Johnston titles with a debt write-off and new investment is being aligned with the success of an underlying business that remains ""profitable and cash-generative"".

"I once asked David Hockney how memorable images are created. ""I don't know,"" he said, ""but I've made some."" And so he has. Not least his 1972 painting, Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures), which broke the auction record this week for a work by a living artist when it sold for $90m (Â£70m). The moment when the Christie's auctioneer asks if the other bidder wants to offer more for David Hockney's Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures) The reason it fetched the very high price is fairly easy to comprehend. Portrait of an Artist is widely considered to be one of Hockney's most accomplished paintings, uniting the two career-defining subjects that preoccupied him in the late 60s and 70s: swimming pools and double portraits. It's a two-for-one. Plus, it's unique. And it apparently has excellent provenance. Added to which, at least two people were very keen to own it (you'd need a big wall - it's a 7ft-by-10ft canvas). And that means the market-driven rules of supply and demand come into play, pushing the price up to such giddy heights. All of which tells us something about the nature of the art market but very little about the art. So, back to that original question, what makes it a memorable image? Structure is one factor. It has a geometric formality - squares, rectangles and triangles - that provides a coherent and solid framework in which the more complex effects Hockney wants to capture can be clearly expressed. In David Hockney's Study for Portrait of an Artist, 1972, the viewer can see the importance of the geometric structure in the composition He was particularly interested in evoking in the viewer the sense of looking through a thin film of disturbed surface water, which is one of the reasons why it was so important to have the figure swimming below. It works. But it wasn't easy. Hockney abandoned his first attempt after months of experimenting with different compositional angles, and various technical approaches to applying his acrylic paint. The water is not the only elemental motif the artist is attempting to convey pictorially. Air and light and temperature are all essential factors in our reading of this contemporary pastoral scene. It is hot and still and clear: An idyllic day for swimming in an idyllic landscape (based on photographs he took in the South of France). And so our senses are aroused and receptive, while our desire for order is satisfied by the simplicity of geometric shapes. It's a good start, but it is not what makes Portrait of an Artist a memorable image. Part of its magic lies in the feeling of space Hockney has created. It sounds like a fairly simple thing to achieve, but it is fiendishly difficult. Ultimately, it requires the artist to paint thin air. The master of this particular craft was the 15th Century Italian artist Piero della Francesca (1415 - 1492), to whom Hockney owes a large debt. Look at the great Renaissance man's masterpiece The Flagellation of Christ (c.1450s), and you will see where the 81-year-old Yorkshireman found inspiration for his own painting. The structure and sense of space in Hockney's work can be traced back to The Flagellation of Christ, painted by Piero della Francesca in the 15th Century There is that same feeling of space in Piero della Francesca's artwork, the same reliance on an architectural structure (emphasised in both cases with tiled paving), and the same compositional device of having two distinct, non-referring areas in which figures appear. Both paintings knowingly assert the single vanishing point: the Italian does so with buildings, Hockney uses two Cypress trees and an allusion to Mount Fuji in the background. That the similarities are so striking only goes to show that the man who became a famous face in the 60s with his gold lamÃ© jacket, bleached blond hair and round glasses is not simply a pop artist, but a serious-minded contemporary painter who is producing pictures that refer back to centuries of image-making, from Fra Angelico to Paul Cezanne and beyond. Take a good look at those hills in the background of Portrait of an Artist and you will see the Pointillism of Georges Seurat. The Impressionist painting technique developed by Georges Seurat (Bathers at AsniÃ¨res, 1884) is evident in Hockney's work And note the cropping of the swimming pool to create dynamism, which is reminiscent of Degas, and the bright colours of his high-key palette nod to Matisse. It is this combination of influences filtered through his temperament and experiences that lend Hockney's painting an air of permanence: it appears at once modern and classical. All of which contributes to making it a memorable image. But there is one factor above all others that gives the painting its wall-power. And that is its psychological charge. Like Edward Hopper's Nighthawks or a Lynette Yiadom-Boakye imagined figure, Portrait of an Artist has an uncanny atmosphere that draws you in. Similar to Edward Hopper's Nighthawks (1942), Hockney's Portrait of an Artist creates a highly-charged atmosphere that draws the viewer into the painting Who are these two men? Why are they so detached? Is it Narcissus peering down at his reflection? Or are they lovers? Were they lovers? Will they become lovers? What is on their minds? Portrait of An Artist provokes so many searching questions about the two men in the painting There is an unspoken and unresolved tension between the two figures. They exist in separate worlds. One is vertical and on dry land, the other horizontal and submerged. We can see the face of the standing figure but the man in white swimming trunks is a total mystery. Even when you know the backstory to the painting the psychological impact remains. It came about when Hockney noticed two random photographs side-by-side on his studio floor (one of a man swimming taken in 1966, the other of a boy looking down) and saw immediately that the combination would make for a compelling composition (the man standing by the pool was eventually modelled on his ex-boyfriend Peter Schlesinger from whom he had recently split). A still from the film A Bigger Splash, which shows David Hockney taking a photograph of his former boyfriend Peter Schlesinger, who was the model for the man standing by the pool Although the painting is a partly staged collage of multiple sources, it has an inherent authenticity. It rings true. There is something in the mood it captures that is universal and relatable and as old as time. Man alone in Arcadia with only his thoughts and memories for company. It is a beautifully balanced composition that pleases the eye, with a subject - reflection - that gives our minds food for thought. It plays with our hearts and our heads. And that is what makes it such a memorable image.

"Pushing his trolley, Michael Rogers (left) helped police confront the attacker A homeless man who used his shopping trolley to try to ram a knife-wielding attacker in Melbourne has been charged with offences including burglary and theft. Michael Rogers, dubbed ""Trolley Man"" online, was filmed on 9 November trying to prevent Hassan Khalif Shire Ali from stabbing two police officers. The suspect had already killed a cafe owner and injured two other people. He was later shot by police and died in hospital. Mr Rogers was called in by police for questioning on Friday. Australian media reported that the five alleged offences - two counts of burglary, two counts of theft and committing an indictable offence while on bail - had taken place before the 9 November attack. Mr Rogers has been hailed as a hero for his efforts to prevent Shire Ali from stabbing two police officers. This video can not be played The attacker set a car on fire and stabbed three people When tracked down by reporters, the 46-year-old told 7 News: ""I threw the trolley straight at him, and I got him. I didn't quite get him down, though."" At the time he was only metres from a burning car full of gas cylinders, which the attacker had set alight near Bourke Street, a busy road in the city centre. An online fundraising campaign for Mr Rogers has raised more than A$140,000 ($103,000; Â£80.000). It was set up by Donna Stolzenberg, founder of the charity Melbourne Homeless Collective, to help get him back on his feet.

"University students have been bombarded with fake tax refund emails in the last month, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has warned. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of students have been targeted in a bid to steal their banking and personal details. The fraudsters appear to be using .ac.uk email addresses that look genuine, in order to avoid detection. HMRC said email, text or voicemail would never be used for real refunds. ""Although HMRC is cracking down hard on internet scams, criminals will stop at nothing to steal personal information. ""I'd encourage all students to become phishing-aware - it could save you a lot of money,"" said financial secretary to the Treasury, Mel Stride. Scammers steal half-a-billion pounds from UK banking customers Hidden 'shame' of elderly scam victims The tax authority said it was the first time it had seen a tax-scam attack directly targeting university students in such high volumes. In common with other tax scams, fraudsters send a message - complete with HMRC, Gov.uk, or credit card branding - supposedly telling the recipient about a tax refund. The recipient's name and email address may be included several times within the email itself. If tricked, the victim then clicks on a link, into which they enter their banking and personal details. Fraudsters can use this information to steal money from bank accounts, or to sell on to other con-artists. Between April and September this year, HMRC requested that 7,500 of these phishing sites be deactivated. Thousands of students have reported cases at certain universities, particularly in the past three or four weeks, but institutions across the country have been targeted. HMRC said that it was calling on particular universities to raise awareness of the dangers. They were Aberdeen, Bristol, Cambridge, Durham, Imperial College London, King's College London, Manchester Metropolitan, Newcastle, Nottingham, Plymouth, Queen Mary (London), Queen's (Belfast), Southampton, Sussex, University College London, and Warwick. It is not known how many students have fallen for the scam or how much they have lost. HMRC believes cases are under-reported. Pauline Smith, director of Action Fraud, said: ""Devious fraudsters will try every trick in the book to convince victims to hand over their personal information, often with devastating consequences. ""It is vital that students spot the signs of fraudulent emails to avoid falling victim by following HMRC's advice."" Anyone targeted should not click on any links but can report cases to HMRC by forwarding the emails toHMRC,externalor texts to 60599. Anyone who has lost money should contactAction Fraud,external.

"Countries which embrace protectionism are ""doomed to failure"", China's Xi Jinping has warned in a veiled swipe at the US's America First policy. Mr Xi was speaking at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit, where US-Chinese tensions are likely to be centre stage. US Vice-President Mike Pence later said he was prepared to ""more than double"" the tariffs imposed on Chinese goods. The two countries have been engaged in a tit-for-tat trade war this year. The White House says its tariffs are a response to China's ""unfair"" trade policies. China v the US: Not just a trade war What China wants from the Pacific US to invest more than $100m in Asia Both sides have said the tariffs, already totalling billions of dollars, can still be increased. However, Mr Xi appeared to warn against any further escalation of tensions between the two countries. ""History has shown that confrontation, whether in the form of a cold war, a hot war or a trade war, will produce no winners,"" he told leaders gathered in Papua New Guinea's capital, Port Moresby, for the summit. This video can not be played How hogs and Harleys became weapons in a looming trade war. ""Attempts to erect barriers and cut close economic ties work against the laws of economics and the trends of history. ""This is a short-sighted approach and it is doomed to failure,"" he added, warning that those who close their doors ""will only cut himself off from the rest of the world and lose his direction"". But Mr Pence - who spoke at the forum directly after Mr Xi - said the tariffs were a response to the ""imbalance"" with China. ""The United States, though, will not change course until China changes its ways,"" he said. His comments come a day afterPresident Donald Trump told reporters he was confident a deal between China and the US ""will be made"". However, he said a number of key issues had not been included on a list for negotiation ahead of next month's G20 summit in Argentina, meaning it was ""not acceptable"" yet to the president.

"Part of Derwent Hall has been exposed by the low water levels Low water levels at a reservoir have revealed a rarely-seen abandoned village that was flooded in the 1940s. Derwent, in Derbyshire, made way for the Ladybower Reservoir, which was built between 1935 and 1943. Dave Aston from the Peak District's Upper Derwent Visitor Centre said the rare sight of the ""exposed village"" has attracted many people to the area. Earlier in November, one man had to be rescued after he got stuck in the mud while inspecting the ruins. A pump house from Derwent village has been exposed by the low water levels Historic buildings, churches and limestone cottages in Derwent and Ashopton were lost when the Derwent Valley was flooded. The plan, which was strongly opposed, was to help serve the growing cities of Derby, Sheffield, Nottingham and Leicester with water. The lost village of Derwent is still visible and drawing the crowds, Severn Trent Water has said A Lancaster bomber flies over a full Ladybower Reservoir in May, to mark the 75th anniversary of the Dambusters raid Mr Aston said he last saw the flooded village in 1995, after a dry period that year, and also following the hot summer months of 1976. ""It is a rare occurrence to see the ruins of Derwent village,"" he said. ""The long dry spring and summer has lowered the water levels of the reservoir slowly and in the last four weeks the remains have become visible. ""Visitor numbers are soaring because of it. People are walking in the exposed village."" Rob Eardley visited the site on Thursday and said it was ""surreal"" On 3 November,Edale Mountain Rescue Team reported having to rescue someone,externalwho got stuck in the ""extremely thick"" mud around the ruins. It took 30 minutes to free the man, whose temperature and ""general welfare"" had dropped ahead of being rescued. The team urged people to view the remnants from solid ground. A postcard shows the spire of Derwent's church emerging from the water after the valley was flooded This postcard shows young people gathered on a bridge in Derwent A spokeswoman for Severn Trent Water has said the reservoir's levels are ""lower than normal"" following the ""exceptionally dry and hot summer"". She added the company expects it to refill over the rest of autumn and winter and water can be moved from nearby reservoirs ""if needed"". Allow Twitter content?

"Relatives have fought to ensure their loved ones were found The wreckage of a submarine which went missing with 44 crew on board a year ago has been found, the Argentine navy says. The ARA San Juan submarine disappeared 430km (270 miles) off the Argentine coast on 15 November 2017. The navy stopped its rescue mission two weeks after the sub's disappearance. However, a year and a day after it went missing, officials announced it had been found 800m (2,620ft) below the surface of the Atlantic Ocean. Who are the crew of the missing Argentine submarine? According to a tweet from the Argentine navy, the ARA San Juan had been positively identified under the water by a US company. The navy had earlier shared a picture from the seabed, suggesting a 60m-long object might be the missing submarine. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Relatives gathered to remember their loved ones earlier this week, while President Mauricio Macri promised to keep up the search for the submarine. The ARA San Juan was returning from a routine mission to Ushuaia, near the southern tip of South America, when it reported an ""electrical breakdown"". According to naval commander Gabriel Galeazzi, the submarine surfaced and reported what was described as a ""short circuit"" in the vessel's batteries. The sub was ordered to cut its mission short and return to the naval base in Mar del Plata immediately. The Argentine navy's last contact with the vessel was at approximately 07:30 (10:30 GMT) on 15 November, at which point its captain reportedly confirmed that the crew were well. What happens when a submarine vanishes Eight days after the sub vanished, the Vienna-based Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Organisation said that it had detected a noise a few hours after the sub's last contact. The body, which operates a network of listening posts to monitor nuclear explosions, said that there had been a ""hydro-acoustic anomaly"" about 30 nautical miles (60km) north of the sub's last-known position at 10:31 (13:31 GMT). The Argentine navy said it could have been the sound of the submarine imploding. Navy spokesman Enrique Balbi told reporters last year that water had entered the submarine's snorkel, which can be used to take in air from above the surface when the submarine is submerged. The saltwater dripped on to a battery tray in the prow, causing the battery to short circuit and to smoulder, he said. The sub had reported the fault and had been ordered back to base but then disappeared. Who are the crew of missing Argentine submarine?

"Jeff Rohrer (centre) spent six seasons as a linebacker for the Dallas Cowboys A former Dallas Cowboys football player will make history this weekend when he becomes the first ever NFL player to marry a man. Jeff Rohrer, a former linebacker for the Texas American football team, publicly came out as gay on Wednesday. ""If I had told the Dallas Cowboys in the 1980s that I was gay, I would have been cut immediately,"" Rohrer told the New York Times. ""It was a different world back then. People didn't want to hear that."" Rohrer, 59, will marry his partner of three years, Joshua Ross, 36, who grew up near the Texas stadium where Rohrer used to play throughout his professional sports career in the 1980s. Three decades later, Rohrer has gone on to become a successful director of TV commercials. His partner is a famous skin-care expert and aesthetician from West Hollywood, who appeared on last season's reality TV programme, The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. LGBT sports website Outsports reports that 11 NFL players have come out as gay - no-one during their professional career. Only eight ever played in a regular season game. ""I've given at least five people heart attacks with this news,"" Rohrer told the Times. The couple met at a tequila bar in West Hollywood in 2015 ""But for the most part, many of my closest friends, including some of my former teammates with the Cowboys, could not have been more happy and supportive."" He said that one friend returned his wedding invitation because he ""actually thought it was a joke"". ""People are floored.I guess I was a really good actor,"" he said about all his years hiding his sexual orientation.,external Before meeting Mr Ross at a tequila bar in West Hollywood in 2015 he was ""completely in the closet,"" he says. ""And if not for Josh, I'd still be in there,"" he said. Mr Ross recalled seeing ""this big, gregarious guy sitting there, though I wasn't sure if he was gay"". ""But once we started talking, I realised he was."" The couple will tie the knot in an elaborate ceremony Los Angeles on Sunday.

"This video can not be played The BBC's Frank Gardner looks at what could happen to the man known as MBS The CIA believes that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, according to US media reports. Sources close to the agency said it had assessed the evidence in detail. It is understood there is no ""smoking gun"" but US officials think such an operation would need the prince's approval. Saudi Arabia has called the claim false and insisted that the crown prince knew nothing about plans for the killing. It says Khashoggi was killed as a result of a ""rogue operation"". US President Donald Trump has spoken to CIA Director Gina Haspel and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the CIA's assessment of the Khashoggi murder, the White House says. Press secretary Sarah Sanders gave no details but said Mr Trump had confidence in the CIA. Before the briefing, President Trump stressed the importance of Saudi Arabia to the US, as he has done since news of Khashoggi's killing emerged. ""They have been a truly spectacular ally in terms of jobs and economic development,"" he said. ""I have to take a lot of things into consideration."" Who was Jamal Khashoggi? Saudi journalist's death: Story so far Is Saudi crown prince finished? While there has been widespread international condemnation of Khashoggi's murder there has been little in the way of substantial action. The journalist was killed after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October to obtain a marriage document. His body has not been found. Turkey also insists the order to kill him came from the highest levels. The Washington Post, which Khashoggi worked for, says the CIA assessment was based partly ona phone call made by the crown prince's brother, Prince Khalid bin Salman, the Saudi ambassador to the US.,external Prince Khalid allegedly called Khashoggi at the direction of his brother and gave him assurances that he would be safe to go to the consulate. This video can not be played How has the death of Jamal Khashoggi impacted the war in Yemen? Prince Khalid, now back in Saudi Arabia, said on Twitter that he had not been in contact with Khashoggi for nearly a year. He said he had never suggested Khashoggi - who had been in London for a conference until the day before his disappearance - should go to Turkey for any reason. Saudi media ignore US reports on Khashoggi It is understood agents have also examined a call made to a senior aide of Crown Prince bin Salman by the team that carried out the killing. Sources quoted in the US media stressed that there was no single piece of evidence linking the crown prince directly to the murder, but officials believe such an operation would have needed his approval. At a news conference in Riyadh on Thursday, Deputy Public Prosecutor Shalaan bin Rajih Shalaan said Khashoggi was given a lethal injection and his body was dismembered inside the consulate after his death. The body parts were then handed over to a local ""collaborator"" outside the grounds, he added. A composite sketch of the collaborator has been produced and investigations are continuing to locate the remains. Eleven unidentified people have been charged over the journalist's death and the prosecutor is seeking the death penalty for five of them. By Frank Gardner, Security Correspondent, BBC News The reported CIA assessment that MBS ordered the killing of Jamal Khashoggi largely matches those in other Western capitals, including London. The purported intercepted phone call - denied by the Saudis - between MBS's brother in Washington, Prince Khalid bin Salman, and Khashoggi, urging him to visit the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, would appear to be at the behest of the crown prince. A second intercepted phone call was from the hit team on the day of the murder to someone inside MBS's inner circle in Riyadh. Again, it is hard to believe this would have been without the Crown Prince's knowledge Taken together with the SIGINT (signals intelligence), the case against MBS is damning but still circumstantial. Government officials do not believe there is a metaphorical ""smoking gun"" that explicitly ties MBS to the murder. But drawing on well-established diplomatic and intelligence contacts, they know that in that part of the world nothing gets done without sign-off from the top. In the tightly controlled Arab Gulf states there is simply no such thing as ""a rogue operation,"" as Saudi statements have described it. Meanwhile the glaring inconsistencies in the official Saudi explanations have only deepened suspicions of a state-sponsored cover-up. More from Frank: Is Saudi crown prince finished?

"Donald Trump says he has finished answering questions about alleged Russian meddling during the 2016 presidential campaign. The US leader told reporters he had personally answered the questions ""very easily"", but his responses had yet to be submitted to the investigating team. Special counsel Robert Mueller has been looking into allegations of collusion between Mr Trump's campaign and Russia. Mr Trump strongly denies any collusion, calling the probe ""a witch hunt"". On Thursday,he took to Twitter to describe Mr Mueller as ""conflicted"", called the investigation ""absolutely nuts"", adding that those involved in the long-running probe ""are a disgrace to our nation"". The tweets came a week afterhe forced the resignation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, replacing him with Matthew Whitaker, who now has the power to sack Mr Mueller or end the investigation. After Trump fires Sessions - is Mueller next? All you need to know about Trump Russia story Speaking to reporters on Friday, he said the investigation had wasted ""millions and millions of dollars"" and ""should never have taken place"". Mr Trump also suggested the people who wrote the questions he agreed to answer ""probably have bad intentions"". ""I'm sure they're tricked-up because, you know, they like to catch people,"" Mr Trump said, after making it clear he had written the answers to the questions. Robert Mueller is overseeing the investigation in allegations of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign ""My lawyers don't write answers. I write answers,"" he said. ""I was asked a series of questions. I've answered them very easily."" Exactly what the questions covered is not known. However, Mr Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani told the Washington Post on Thursdayhe had not answered questions relating to the period after his election,external, saying some were ""possible traps"", while others were ""unnecessary"" or ""irrelevant"". In 2016, US intelligence agencies concluded that Russia had used a state-authorised campaign of cyber attacks and fake news stories planted on social media in an attempt to turn the election against Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton. A team of investigators led by Mr Mueller is looking into whether anyone from Mr Trump's campaign colluded in the effort. It has been established that senior members of Mr Trump's team met Russian officials, and that several of these meetings were not initially disclosed. The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words The president's son, Donald Trump Jr, met a Russian lawyer during the campaign who was said to have ""dirt"" on Mrs Clinton, and former adviser George Papadopoulos has admitted lying to the FBI about meetings with alleged go-betweens for Russia. Four people connected with Mr Trump's campaign and presidency - campaign chairman Paul Manafort, advisers Rick Gates and George Papadopoulos, as well as former national security adviser Michael Flynn - have been charged and further indictments could be issued. However the US president denies any wrongdoing and no solid evidence has emerged to implicate him. Trump rages about 'nuts' Russia probe Trump 'didn't speak to Whitaker' about Russia.

Some reported breathing problems, while other witnesses said they saw people vomiting outside the venue. Police said about 20 people with minor injuries were assessed by paramedics at the scene.

""All of a sudden people were saying, 'Look, you need to get out',"" Mr Rutter, a reporter with the Cambs Times, said. ""I just couldn't breathe and you had this feeling in the back of your throat. ""I looked down and people had stopped watching the music and were just trying to get out. ""There was a real sense of panic as they were running for the doors."" One eyewitness described scenes of panic as people tried to get out After he got out Mr Rutter, who was not badly affected, said a number of people were being treated outside. ""People were crying and stuff and a few were vomiting,"" he said. ""They were sitting on blankets and the medics were keeping a close eye on them."" Following the evacuation, Lil Pump continued the gig from on top of his tour bus outside the venue. A number of people were treated outside the venue for the effects of the flare In a statement, Rock City said: ""We had additional staff at the venue last night to carry out thorough searches of customers on entry and opened our doors earlier to give us extra time to carry out the checks. ""We take our responsibility for the safety of our customers very seriously, and also had security staff deployed in the venue.""

"This video can not be played Thousands march in France over diesel tax One protester has died and more than 200 were injured as more than a quarter of a million people took to the streets of France, angry at rising fuel prices. The female protester who died was struck after a driver surrounded by demonstrators panicked and accelerated. The ""yellow vests"", so-called after the high-visibility jackets they are required to carry in their cars, blocked motorways and roundabouts. They accuse President Emmanuel Macron of abandoning ""the little people"". Mr Macron has not so far commented on the protests, some of which have seen demonstrators call for him to resign. But he admitted earlier in the week that he had not ""really managed to reconcile the French people with their leaders"". Six held in plot to 'attack' Macron 'Gauls' resistant to change - Macron Jobseeker: Macron should help me find work Nonetheless, he accused his political opponents of hijacking the movement in order to block his reform programme. Some 280,000 people took part in protests across France, the interior ministry said in its latest update. It said 227 people were injured during the day, seven seriously, with 52 people arrested. Most of the protests have been taking place without incident although several of the injuries came when drivers tried to force their way through protesters. A driver forces a car through a group of protesters in Donges, western France Chantal Mazet, 63, was killed in the south-eastern Savoy region when a driver who was taking her daughter to hospital panicked at being blocked by about 50 demonstrators, who were striking the roof of her vehicle, and drove into them. The driver has been taken into police custody in a state of shock. In Paris protesters approaching the ÃlysÃ©e Palace, the president's official residence, were repelled with tear gas. The price of diesel, the most commonly used fuel in French cars, has risen by around 23% over the past 12 months to an average of â¬1.51 (Â£1.32; $1.71) per litre, its highest point since the early 2000s, AFP news agency reports. World oil prices did rise before falling back again but the Macron government raised its hydrocarbon tax this year by 7.6 cents per litre on diesel and 3.9 cents on petrol, as part of a campaign for cleaner cars and fuel. Tear gas was used to disperse protesters in Paris The decision to impose a further increase of 6.5 cents on diesel and 2.9 cents on petrol on 1 January 2019 was seen as the final straw. Speaking on Wednesday, the president blamed world oil prices for three-quarters of the price rise. He also said more tax on fossil fuels was needed to fund renewable energy investments. It has broad support. Nearly three-quarters of respondents to a poll by the Elabe institute backed the Yellow Vests and 70% wanted the government to reverse the fuel tax hikes. More than half of French people who voted for Mr Macron support the protests, Elabe's Vincent Thibault told AFP. Police attend as protesters block a motorway in Antibes ""The expectations and discontent over spending power are fairly broad, it's not just something that concerns rural France or the lower classes,"" he said. The BBC's Lucy Williamson in Paris says the movement has grown via social media into a broad and public criticism of Mr Macron's economic policies. They have certainly tried to tap into it. Far-right leader Marine Le Pen, who was defeated by Mr Macron in the second round of the presidential election, has been encouraging it on Twitter. She said: ""The government shouldn't be afraid of French people who come to express their revolt and do it in a peaceful fashion."" Allow Twitter content?

A state scrappage bonus on polluting vehicles would also be doubled for France's poorest families, he said, and fuel tax credits would be brought in for people who depend on their cars for work.

"Brazilian players observed a minute of silence to Aldyr Schlee before a friendly against Uruguay in London The man who designed the Brazilian football team's famous yellow shirt has died. Aldyr Garcia Schlee, a designer, journalist and writer, was 83 and had been diagnosed with skin cancer. He was only 18 when he submitted his design to a national competition launched after Brazil's traumatic home defeat in the 1950 World Cup. Until losing in the final match to Uruguay, the Brazilian national team used to play in white. That unexpected and traumatic defeat led to a crisis of national identity. The authorities decided that a new strip would be created and launched a national competition in 1953. Schlee made several attempts before choosing the winning design The only requirement was that it should have the four colours of the national flag (green, yellow, blue and white) to instil the players with a sense of pride and passion. The competition was won by Mr Schlee, who worked as an illustrator for a provincial newspaper in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul. He sketched out 100 different combinations of the colours. ""In the end I realised the shirt just had to be yellow,"" Mr Schlee said. ""That went nicely with the blue and the socks could be white, with the green around the collar."" His prize was a plane trip to Rio de Janeiro, which was then Brazil's capital city. The new kit was used for the first time in a friendly in 1954 and later that year in the World Cup in Switzerland. ""I thought they would replace the kit once more, after Brazil was knocked out,"" he said. Brazil played in white with blue collars and cuffs in the final match of the 1950 World Cup Brazil would win its first World Cup in Sweden four years later, with PelÃ© and Garrincha, and immortalise the strip designed by Mr Schlee. Ironically, Mr Schlee was born near the border and supported the Uruguayan football team throughout his life, including in the 1950 match against Brazil. He died on the same day the Brazilian and the Uruguayan national teams played a friendly in London. Before the match, which Brazil won 1-0, a brief eulogy was read in the stadium and players from both sides observed a minute of silence.

"Jeff Rohrer (centre) spent six seasons as a linebacker for the Dallas Cowboys A former Dallas Cowboys football player will make history this weekend when he becomes the first ever NFL player to marry a man. Jeff Rohrer, a former linebacker for the Texas American football team, publicly came out as gay on Wednesday. ""If I had told the Dallas Cowboys in the 1980s that I was gay, I would have been cut immediately,"" Rohrer told the New York Times. ""It was a different world back then. People didn't want to hear that."" Rohrer, 59, will marry his partner of three years, Joshua Ross, 36, who grew up near the Texas stadium where Rohrer used to play throughout his professional sports career in the 1980s. Three decades later, Rohrer has gone on to become a successful director of TV commercials. His partner is a famous skin-care expert and aesthetician from West Hollywood, who appeared on last season's reality TV programme, The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. LGBT sports website Outsports reports that 11 NFL players have come out as gay - no-one during their professional career. Only eight ever played in a regular season game. ""I've given at least five people heart attacks with this news,"" Rohrer told the Times. The couple met at a tequila bar in West Hollywood in 2015 ""But for the most part, many of my closest friends, including some of my former teammates with the Cowboys, could not have been more happy and supportive."" He said that one friend returned his wedding invitation because he ""actually thought it was a joke"". ""People are floored.I guess I was a really good actor,"" he said about all his years hiding his sexual orientation.,external Before meeting Mr Ross at a tequila bar in West Hollywood in 2015 he was ""completely in the closet,"" he says.

"Jim Acosta was in court to hear the judge's temporary ruling Donald Trump has threatened to walk out of future press briefings if reporters do not act with ""decorum"". The US president was speaking after a Washington DC court ordered the White House to return CNN reporter Jim Acosta's press pass after it was revoked by the US Secret Service. Mr Acosta's press pass was taken after he clashed with the president during a news conference earlier this month. Mr Trump played down the ruling, saying it wasn't ""a big deal"". But, he said, ""people have to behave"", adding his staff were ""writing up rules and regulations"" for the press to abide by, including sticking to the agreed number of questions. ""If they don't listen to the rules and regulations we'll end up back in court and will win,"" Mr Trump said. ""But more importantly, we'll just leave, and then you won't be very happy."" ""You can't take three questions and four questions and just stand up and not sit down,"" he added. ""Decorum. You have to practice decorum."" Speaking outside the court earlier in the day, Mr Acosta praised the decision and told reporters ""let's go back to work"". The judge said the White House decision likely violated the journalist's right to due process and freedom of speech. This video can not be played Donald Trump and CNN's Acosta clash The ruling forces the White House press office to temporarily return Mr Acosta's ""hard pass"", the credential that allows reporters easy access to the White House and other presidential events. Mr Acosta's lawyer called the ruling ""a great day for the first amendment and journalism"". White House attacks CNN's Acosta lawsuit The Acosta affair: An unpopular opinion Mr Acosta was barred from entering the White House a day after he had a heated exchange with President Trump during a news conference on 8 November. A White House intern tried to take the microphone from Mr Acosta as he attempted to ask the president a second question. In a statement Mrs Sanders claimed that he had put ""his hands on a young woman"" during the exchange, during which Mr Trump called the reporter ""a rude, terrible person"". CNN sued to have Mr Acosta's pass restored, and their lawsuit was joined by other media groups, including conservative-leaning Fox News. Jim Acosta lost his White House access after a fiery exchange with President Trump Anthony Zurcher, BBCNews,Washington With Jim Acosta sitting in the front row of the courtroom, the media won the opening round of what could be an extended legal battle. Judge Kelly said he was not ruling on the merits of this case, but that the White House did not provide sufficient justification for revoking Acosta's credentials. That shouldn't come as much of a shock, given that the administration's explanation for the move has shifted multiple times, from a tenuous allegation that the CNN reporter ""placed his hands"" on a White House intern to a more general assertion that he violated press conference decorum. What's left to be decided after further hearings and court filings - assuming the case proceeds - is how much power a president has in determining which reporters get to have, and keep, access to the White House. An administration has discretion to limit the number of passes it gives out, but the balancing of executive power and press rights gets trickier when government officials try to take media credentials away. Judge Timothy Kelly, who was appointed to the bench by Mr Trump last year, said Mr Acosta's constitutional rights outweighed the White House's right to have an orderly news conference, the Washington Post reported. He also criticised the Trump administration's decision, saying that the process was ""so shrouded in mystery that the government could not tell me... who made the decision"". He also called Mrs Sanders' statement claiming that Mr Acosta had inappropriately touched an intern ""belated efforts [that] were hardly sufficient to satisfy due process"". But in court documents, the White House argued that the decision was made in order to preserve White House decorum and it did not claim impropriety towards the intern. Judge Kelly added that the White House was required to restore his White House access, but is under no obligation to call on him during questions. A hearing on the case is scheduled for next week, but it is unclear if the White House will once again seek to strip Mr Acosta's access, or allow him to resume his work as CNN's chief White House correspondent. In a statement, CNN said: ""We are gratified with this result and we look forward to a full resolution in the coming days. ""Our sincere thanks to all who have supported not just CNN, but a free, strong and independent American press."" Mrs Sanders said the judge ""made clear that there is no absolute first amendment right to access the White House"" and that her office planned to ""temporarily reinstate the reporter's hard pass"". Ben Wizner of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said that the White House's attempts to silence Mr Acosta had backfired. ""The White House surely hoped that expelling a reporter would deter forceful questioning, but the court's ruling will have the opposite effect. ""The freedom of the press is a bedrock principle, and our democracy is strengthened when journalists challenge our leaders rather than defer to them.""

"UN Special Rapporteur Philip Alston travelled the country for his report on poverty Ministers are in a ""state of denial"" about poverty, a UN expert has said following a 12-day tour of the UK. Philip Alston, special rapporteur on extreme poverty, said despite being in the one of the world's richest countries he had encountered ""misery"". Levels of child poverty are ""staggering"" and 1.5 million people were destitute at some point in 2017, the Australian said. The government rejected his analysis, pointing to rising household incomes. Prof Alston, an expert in human rights law based at New York University, visited locations including Belfast, Bristol, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Essex, Glasgow, London and Newcastle on a fact-finding mission. He met people affected by poverty as well as government officials, discussing the impact of austerity, changes to benefits and local government funding. At a news conference in London, he said he witnessed ""a lot of misery, a lot of people who feel the system is failing them, a lot of people who feel the system is really just there to punish them"". Quoting figures from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, he said that more than 1.5 million people were destitute at some point in 2017, meaning they lived on less than Â£70 a week or went without essentials such as housing, food, clothing or heating. A fifth of the population, amounting to 14 million people, are living in poverty, Prof Alston said. Prof Alston useda new measure by the Social Metrics Commission,externalto come up with the figure of 14m people in the UK in poverty. It is a measure of ""relative poverty"", meaning it looks at the percentage of people living with less than 55% of the median income, taking into account costs such as childcare, housing, debt and disability. But the government has preferred to use the measure of ""absolute poverty"". This counts the number of people in households with less than 60% of the median income as it was in 2010/11, so it shows how living standards of low-income households have changed over time. By that measure, the government says there are a million fewer people in absolute poverty than there were in 2010. Among experts in the media, think tanks, Parliament and organisations such as the National Audit Office, Prof Alston said there was ""close to unanimity"" that Britain was not doing enough to combat poverty. But he said the view from ministers was the opposite. Foodbanks 'should not be safety net' UN poverty expert visits deprived village Osborne 'ignored child poverty warning' ""Ministers with whom I met told me that things are going well that they don't see any big problems and they are happy with the way their policies are playing out,"" Prof Alston said. Prof Alston met human rights workers and residents in deprived parts of Belfast He said the government was preoccupied with reducing welfare dependency but said he could not believe ministers were as happy with the results as they claimed to be. Prof Alston said: ""The era of connectivity and the era of social media makes it much less sustainable to have this dramatic difference between people living the high life, a higher life than has ever been lived before, and at the other end, people who can't afford a tin of beans, can't afford the seventh meal of the week."" by Michael Buchanan, BBC social affairs correspondent Britain's poorest communities often feel ignored, that politicians aren't interested in their experiences. For a UN representative to hold public meetings, to seek out their concerns, mattered. Some of the gatherings were packed - hundreds of people took the opportunity to be heard. What emerged for Philip Alston was an astounding disconnect between what he heard at those meetings, backed by other research he'd done, and the discussions he held with the ministers who oversee the very system causing such hardship for many people. Some will ask why the UN is looking at poverty in the UK - one of the world's richest nations. The answer, said Prof Alston, is that the government has supported these UN investigations in other countries, and couldn't therefore oppose the legitimacy of his visit here. These harsh criticisms of the government's approach to the poor may not make their lives better immediately. But their daily struggles have appalled the UN, and in time, that might matter. The approach to benefits was ""punitive, mean-spirited, and often callous"", Prof Alston said. He gave the example of ""draconian sanctions"" which shut people out from the benefits system for weeks or months at a time, sometimes for minor infringements such as missing an appointment. Many of the ""harsh"" policies could be ended ""overnight"" at little cost, he claimed. Thousands of children in 'bed poverty' Two-child benefit cap lawful, court rules Education spending now 'skewed' to poor These included the delay of five to 12 weeks before Universal Credit was paid, the single household payments which give more leverage to controlling or violent partners, and the two-child limit for benefit claimants. Prof Alston compared this limit to China's notorious one-child policy and said it was ""a perfect way to punish families"". Welfare changes have disproportionately affected women, especially single parents, he said. ""If you got a group of misogynists in a room, and said guys, how can we make this system work for men and not for women, they wouldn't have come up with too many other ideas than what's already in place."" He also warned that the poor would ""bear the brunt"" of the expected impact of Brexit on the UK economy, and said the fall in the value of the pound had already cost low-income families Â£400 a year. ""In my meetings with the government, it was clear to me that the impact of Brexit on people in poverty is an afterthought,"" he said. Jaywick, Essex, pictured in 2015, was one of the towns visited for the UN report Prof Alston's report will be presented to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva next year. A spokeswoman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: ""We completely disagree with this analysis."" She said that household incomes have ""never been higher"", income inequality has fallen and there are one million fewer people living in absolute poverty compared with 2010. It is not the first time the UK has been criticised by UN special rapporteurs, who are independent human rights experts appointed for fact-finding and monitoring missions around the world. In 2014, urban planning expert Raquel Rolnik said the ""bedroom tax"", which meant social housing tenants with spare rooms had to pay more rent or move somewhere smaller,undermined the right to adequate housing. On that occasion, ministers said her report was a ""misleading Marxist diatribe"" and made an official complaint to the UN.

Barrow Local Committee was told the library had sporadic opening hours. There is now a plan to get library staff out and about in the community more, providing story sessions for children, author visits and reading groups. Cumbria County Council installed the library at Barrow Island Primary School. Tracey Ingham, the council's area support manager for Barrow, told the committee a different approach was needed. She said: ""The proposal is to move away from the static library in the school and do more outreach."" Councillors agreed library staff should visit other community centres on Barrow Island each week, theLocal Democracy Reporting Serviceis reporting. The area's libraries as a whole were used by 844 adults and 538 young people in two months. Councillors also agreed to invest Â£5,400 in Barrow Central Library for ""autism-friendly"" services for children and adults.
