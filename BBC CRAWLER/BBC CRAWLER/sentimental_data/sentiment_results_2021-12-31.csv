"The measures are part of a slate of environmental rules introduced by President Emmanuel Macron A new law banning plastic packaging on most fruit and vegetables comes into effect in France from New Year's day. Cucumbers, lemons and oranges are among the 30 varieties banned from being wrapped in plastic. Larger packs as well as chopped or processed fruit will be exempt. President Emmanuel Macron called the ban ""a real revolution"" and said it showed the country's commitment to phase out single use plastics by 2040. More than a third of fruit and vegetable products in France are thought to be sold in plastic wrapping, and government officials believe that the ban could prevent a billion items of single use plastics being used every year. In a statement announcing the new law, the Environment Ministry said that France uses an ""outrageous amount"" of single use plastics and that the new ban ""aims at cutting back the use of throwaway plastic and boost its substitution by other materials or reusable and recyclable packaging"". The ban forms part of a multi-year programme introduced by Mr Macron's government that will see plastics slowly eased out in many industries. From 2021, the country banned plastic straws, cups and cutlery, as well as polystyrene takeaway boxes. And later in 2022 public spaces will be forced to provide water fountains to reduce the use of plastic bottles, publications will have to be shipped without plastic wrapping, and fast-food restaurants will no longer be able offer free plastic toys. However, industry figures have expressed concerns over the speed at which the new ban is being introduced. Philippe Binard, from the European Fresh Produce Association, said the ""removal of plastic packaging from most fruit and vegetables at such short notice does not allow alternatives to be tested and introduced in a timely manner and stocks of existing packaging to be cleared"". Several other European countries have announced similar bans in recent months as they pursue commitments made at the recent COP26 conference in Glasgow. Earlier this month Spain announced that it will introduce a ban on the sale of fruit and vegetables in plastic packaging from 2023 to allow business to find alternative solutions. Mr Macron's government also announced several other new environmental regulations, including rules calling on car adverts to promote greener alternatives such as walking and cycling.

"In 2019, Prof Chris Whitty - now Sir Chris - appeared in just two BBC News online stories. One was about doctors in Englandprescribing fewer antibiotics;the other was a preview ofthe week in Parliament. In the same year, his colleague Prof Jonathan Van-Tam appeared in just one BBC story,about England's biggest ever flu vaccination campaign. But that was a lifetime ago - or at least, a pandemic ago - when medical advisers were unseen and unknown, with barely a Wikipedia page between them (by the end of 2019, Prof Whitty's entry was just 248 words; Prof Van-Tam's didn't exist). Since then, both men have appeared in hundreds of BBC stories - Whitty 599, Van-Tam 238 - and have public profiles, and name recognition, that would have seemed far-fetched less than two years ago. Without the pandemic, both men may still have earned knighthoods. But it's certain they wouldn't have their faces on a mug twinset on eBay: Prof Van-Tam's emblazoned with ""JV Tea""; Whitty's with his apparent catchphrase: ""Next slide please"". Prof Whitty, it's fair to assume, stepped onto the stage reluctantly. He is a private person: when, in 2020, colleagues were asked what his interests were,one scratched his head and replied:""There was some talk of him enjoying Scottish dancing."" He was born in Gloucester in 1966, and spent much of his childhood in Europe and Africa, as his parents were teachers and then British Council workers. He was educated in England, including at Malvern College in Worcestershire. One of his tutors there, Roy Allen,told BBC Radio 4's Profile programmethe young Chris was ""reserved, scholarly, sensitive, intelligent, very likeable"". In 1984, just before his A-Levels, his father Kenneth - by then a diplomat - was killed by militants in Athens. Chris learned the news at Malvern; Mr Allen said the murder made his former pupil even more determined. ""I think he feels, probably privately, he is fulfilling the ambitions and hopes of his father and mother,"" he said. ""It was a family with a very strong sense that...you live for a purpose, not just for yourself."" ""Next slide please"": Chris Whitty is the face of government coronavirus data at No 10 briefings After studying at Oxford - former BBC correspondent Danny Shaw, who studied with him, remembered him as ""down to earth, dry sense of humour, 20 going on 40"" - he became a doctor in Africa and Asia. In 2004, he worked in malaria research in Tanzania, where he had a small boat at the yacht club in Tanga, according to then colleague Prof Chris Drakeley. Prof Drakeley, speaking to Profile, also confirmed the interest in dancing. ""He does enjoy it - I have seen it with my own eyes,"" he remembered. ""And I have heard from people who have danced with him that he is very good."" But away from the yacht club, and the occasional Scottish jig, it seems Prof Whitty's preferred pastime is study - the more, the better. ""Chris is a polymath - he's really extraordinary,"" said Prof David Mabey, a former colleague. ""He's very interested in history. Since I've known him he's done a diploma in economics, a degree in law, and an MBA [a graduate business degree] in his spare time."" BBC Radio 4 Profile: Prof Chris Whitty Chris Whitty: The man with our lives in his hands Penalties, equalisers & yoghurts - Van-Tam's best analogies Prof Van-Tam - Boston United superfan Prof Whittybecame chief medical officer for England in 2019,external- just months before the pandemic arrived in the UK - and the spotlight has not always been welcome. Last summer, two men were arrested after accosting him in London. One was given a suspended sentence; the other man's case is ongoing. The convicted man, Lewis Hughes, told the court he stopped Prof Whitty because he wanted ""a selfie for his mum"". In a way, it was quite telling: in a pandemic, a chief medical officer veers close to celebrity status. At the time of writing, there are132 Chris Whitty mugs on eBay,and his Wikipedia entry is more than 1,500 words long. ""Tonight, we're going viral!"" Prof Van-Tam giving the Royal Institution Christmas lecture Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, it's fair to say, seems a more natural public figure. In a recentRoyal Institution lecture,he began by ripping off his tie in a puff of smoke, before pointing at the camera and declaring: ""Tonight, we're going viral!"" It's hard to imagine Prof Whitty doing the same. Compared to his boss, Prof Van-Tam has been happy to share some of his background. He lives near Boston, Lincolnshire, with his wife and two teenage sons (an older daughter has moved out) and is an avid Boston United fan. He was born to a British mother and French-Vietnamese father - both were teachers - and his paternal grandfather was prime minister of South Vietnam in the 1950s when it was a French protectorate. ""I guess it's quite South East Asian, but I've always been struck by the fact that the next generation are more important than we are,""he told the Times in a recent interview.,external Prof Van-Tam is not, in fact, the only deputy chief medical officer - there arethree others in England,external- but his turn of phrase has turned him into a key public-facing figure. ""I love metaphors,"" he told the BBC a year ago. ""I think they bring complex stories to life for people."" This video can not be played ""They've got a goal... we've now got an equaliser"" - Prof Van-Tam used a lengthy football analogy to explain the significance of vaccines in December 2020 True to his word, in November he was asked on the BBC about the pandemic in the UK. ""It's half time in extra time,"" he said. ""I think the final whistle...I can't predict it, but we've got a few months to run, and we'll be in calmer waters by spring."" Like Prof Whitty, he has earned a down-to-earth popularity among many of the millions who've watched his news conferences. The Times called him an ""unlikely cult hero""; earlier in the year, he was even tipped to appear on Strictly Come Dancing. Although he batted away the rumours - ""It would be rather like watching Jumbo on ice"" - it's hard to imagine him, or Prof Whitty, returning to one or two stories a year any time soon.

"The West of England, Lincolnshire and London have had the warmest weather Britain has seen its hottest New Year's Eve ever with temperatures reaching 15.8C (60.4F) in the west of England, the Met Office has said. The previous record of 14.8C (58.6F) in Colwyn Bay, Wales, in 2011 was toppled this afternoon in Somerset. Temperatures will continue to rise across England before dropping at night as the UK rings in 2022. Areas of southern and eastern England including the West Country and London will see the mildest weather. The Met Office said the extremely mild spell was driven by a flow of warm, moist air from the Canary Islands. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Met Office spokesperson Stephen Dixon said the first reading taken at Ryehill in East Yorkshire at 11:00 GMT had ""provisionally broken the New Year's Eve record"". ""Our station at Ryehill, a small village in East Yorkshire has recorded 14.9C (58.8F) today, which tops the previous record of 14.8C (58.6F)."" That figure has since risen to 15.8C (60.4F) and was last recorded at the Met Office's station in Merryfield in southwest Somerset. The Met Office said the weather was forecast to get cooler from Tuesday, potentially bringing wintry showers and frosts. Forget your fleece and coat - it's liberating to take a pleasant New Year's Eve stroll in just your T-shirt. But it doesn't bode well for the future. The Met Office say the UK's record temperatures have all been elevated by manmade climate change which has raised temperatures globally by 1.1C. Cold records are still being broken, as in the Beast from the East storm in 2018. But the Met Office say warm weather records are being broken nine times more frequently - a clear sign of an over-heating planet. The winter wildfires in Colorado are even arguably more alarming than unseasonal warmth in the UK. It's too soon to say what role human-driven climate change may have played in the disaster - but it's the latest episode of regular weather patterns being disrupted. Meanwhile,different regions of Alaskaare experiencing record high and low temperatures at the same time. Climate scientists warnthat we can expect many more extremes as the planet continues to heat. And attempts to reduce emissions have been undermined by several factors, including President Biden's struggle with climate policies in the USA. The highest UK daytime temperature recorded on New Year's Day is 15.6C (60F) in Bude, Cornwall, in 1916. Met Office chief forecaster Steve Ramsdale said: ""The current weather pattern is bringing extremely mild conditions to the UK - perhaps reaching around 16.0C (60.8F) in some parts. ""We also expect some very mild overnight temperatures as well with minimum temperature records being broken in places."" The Met Office added the warm spell has the potential to challenge records for New Year's Day, creating the unusual situation of one weather system perhaps breaking weather records for two days in separate calendar years.

South Africa’s last white president FW de Klerk pictured with Nelson Mandela in 1990 FW de Klerk pictured with Nelson Mandela in 1990 For some, he was a great statesman - the Nobel Peace Prize winner who had helped end the system of legalised racism which he’d inherited. For others, he benefited enormously from that same system of apartheid, which had segregated South Africa’s people by skin colour, and deserved to be prosecuted for its many crimes. Although essentially a conservative by nature, FW de Klerk came to believe that white-minority rule was not sustainable. It was his ending of the ban on the African National Congress - and the freeing of Nelson Mandela in 1990 - that triggered the move to majority rule.

"More than three quarters of adults in Scotland have received their Covid-19 booster vaccinations. The Scottish government had set a target of getting 80% of eligible adults and young people boosted by the end of the year. By 30 December, 77% had received the jabs. The government said high infection levels had meant thousands of people had to delay their appointments. Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said it was not too late to get vaccinated. He paid tribute to the people of Scotland for their collective effort and success in getting more than 2.98 million people ""boosted by the bells"". Of them, about 790,000 have received their booster since 13 December, when the rollout was accelerated due to the threat of the Omicron variant. Final push begins to get 'boosted by the bells' Scots urged to stay at home for Hogmanay Mr Yousaf initially set a target of boosting 70,000 people a day, but that waslater revised down to 61,000. However, that was only achieved on five days. Scotland leads the rest of the UK on first, second, third and booster doses, and the Scottish government said it continued to deliver one of the fastest and most successful vaccination programmes in the world. In England, more than 70% of eligible adults have had their booster jabs while in Wales 71% of those aged 12 and above have had a booster. Mr Yousaf toldBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetimeprogramme that there was the capacity to give boosters to more than 80% of eligible people. He said: ""Unfortunately, we had a lot of cancellations, in this week in particular, given the high levels of infection but that shouldn't take away from the fact that our vaccination teams have done a brilliant job. ""It's been a phenomenal effort and Scotland continues to lead the rest of the UK in what is a very successful vaccination programme. ""We are investing in science, not just in vaccines but with anti-viral treatments coming on board as well.  If we didn't have the vaccine, the situation we are in now would be far, far worse. ""The next few weeks will be really difficult given the high number of cases and the pressure on the NHS but I do believe 2022 will be a far better and far safer year for all of us."" Mr Yousaf said that in the week ending 26 December - with staff taking a break on Christmas Day and Boxing Day and amid high infection rates in some areas - Scotland achieved record-breaking numbers of vaccinations, with 77,927 jabbed on the busiest day. People queued up at Hampden Park vaccination centre for booster jabs before the Christmas break Figures from theOffice of National Statistics,externalshow that in the week ending 23 December, one in 40 people in Scottish households - not including care homes and hospitals - had Covid. Mr Yousaf said anyone who had to delay their booster due to a Covid infection or isolation period could now arrange a new appointment, 28 days after their positive PCR test. ""To deliver maximum benefits we need as many people as possible to get boosted as quickly as possible,"" Mr Yousaf said. ""It is everyone's duty to get a jab if you haven't already - vaccination could literally save your life as well as keeping family, friends and loved ones safe. ""And it is never too late to receive your booster - or even a first or second dose - so please come forward as soon as possible, as there is capacity available to get you vaccinated."" The  expansion of the booster programme and other vaccine doses will continue into the new year and young people aged 12-15 who are still to receive their second dose will now be invited to reschedule existing appointments or attend drop-in centres from Monday 3 January.

South Africa’s last white president FW de Klerk pictured with Nelson Mandela in 1990 FW de Klerk pictured with Nelson Mandela in 1990 For some, he was a great statesman - the Nobel Peace Prize winner who had helped end the system of legalised racism which he’d inherited. For others, he benefited enormously from that same system of apartheid, which had segregated South Africa’s people by skin colour, and deserved to be prosecuted for its many crimes. Although essentially a conservative by nature, FW de Klerk came to believe that white-minority rule was not sustainable. It was his ending of the ban on the African National Congress - and the freeing of Nelson Mandela in 1990 - that triggered the move to majority rule.

"Police have spent New Year's Eve searching Philpot's Farm Open Space A 16-year-old boy has died after being stabbed in west London, making him the 30th teenage homicide in the capital in 2021, surpassing a peak of 29 in 2008. The fatal stabbing on Thursday evening happened shortly aftera 15-year-old boy was also found fatally wounded in Ashburton Park, Croydon, south London. A boy, 15, has been held on suspicion of murder over the Croydon stabbing. The 16-year-old victim was found by police and paramedics with a stab wound in Hillingdon but he died at the scene. He was found at Philpots Farm Open Space, close to Heather Lane in Yiewsley, at 19:30 GMT, about half an hour after the first stabbing. No arrests have yet been made in connection with the Hillingdon incident but officers have opened a murder inquiry. A post-mortem examination would ""be held in due course"", the Met said. Neither boy has been formally identified, Scotland Yard added, but their family members had been informed and were being supported by officers. The other teenager who died in a separate incident was found in Ashburton Park, Croydon The 15-year-old boy who died in Croydon was discovered injured after police had been called to Ashburton Park at about 19:00 GMT over reports of an assault. He was given first aid by officers before paramedics arrived but died at the scene. How London broke 2008 record for teenage killings Boy, 15, stabbed to death in London park The Met said his family had been informed and that a post-mortem examination would take place on Saturday. The arrested 15-year-old boy remains in police custody. Of the 30 teenage homicides in the capital this year, 27 of them have been stabbings while two have been shootings and one was the result of a suspected arson attack. More than 40 teenagers in the capital have also been charged with murder during 2021. Speaking from the scene in Croydon, Met Police Cdr Alex Murray said: ""My message today, other than speaking to the families and friends of those that London has lost, is to say you cannot carry knives in London. ""This is what happens when knives are carried and we all have a role in relation to tackling knife crime."" He also had a direct message to parents, saying: ""If you have concerns, talk to your kids. ""Make sure they're not carrying knives, make sure they're not hanging around with kids carrying knives."" The Metropolitan Police has opened 122 murder investigations in London this year, of which 79 are stabbings. Violent crime is down generally, but not when it comes to young people under the age of 18 in London. For the numbers of teenage homicides to have exceeded the previous high in 2008 will put new pressure on the Met. To understand why it is happening, the government decided in the summer to increase the number of 'serious case reviews' of murder and manslaughter cases, especially in London. No results have yet been published, but there are well known issues, and new developments. Police say that disagreements between people on social media result in real-life violence. They also blame the trend towards drugs being sold by ""county lines"" gangs who target vulnerable young people to involve them in the trade. However, these have been trends for years and don't necessarily explain the latest surge. Covid lockdowns, the closure of youth services and young people not being in school may be more relevant factors that have added additional chaos to troubled young lives, increasing their risk of being in violent situations. Cdr Murray told the BBC that violent crime in London was down overall ""but for teenagers it's not, our teenage homicide rate is tragically high"". He said he believed the increase was due to a combination of teenagers believing it was acceptable to carry knives, people ""encouraging fight-back"" between groups on social media, and children getting involved in county lines and drug dealing. ""Those three things are probably intersecting to create the peak in homicides in the capital,"" he explained. Responding to the two killings, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said the safety of Londoners ""will always be my number one priority"", before adding he was ""investing record amounts in policing to put more officers on the streets"". ""I refuse to accept that the loss of young lives is inevitable and will continue to be relentless in taking the bold action needed to put an end to violence in our city,"" he added. Police in Croydon have arrested a 15-year-old boy Anthony King, chairman of the MyEnds programme, which aims to tackle knife crime in London, described the record number of deaths as like taking ""10 steps forward and 11 steps backward"". He said he thought the rise in knife crime among teenagers was ""because we're having a lot of breakdowns in schools, in education, young people are being excluded too quickly, some for minor incidents, there's breakdown in the homes"". ""Parents, if you see a bread knife or bun knife missing from the home, please speak to somebody, please contact an agency or an organisation and let the teachers know,"" Mr King added. 19 January: Anas Mezenner, 17, was found with stab wounds in West Green Road, Haringey 25 January: Romario Opia, 15, was discovered stabbed in Holland Walk, Islington 11 February: Hani Solomon, 18, was found stabbed after police were called over reports of a fight between two groups of men in Ackmar Road, Fulham 18 February: Drekwon Patterson, 16, was stabbed in Preston Road, Brent 26 February: Ahmed Beker, 19, was stabbed in Paddington Green, near Edgware Road 3 March: Tai Jordan O'Donnell, 19, was stabbed inside a house in Alpha Road, Croydon 6 March: Mazaza Owusu-Mensah, 18, was stabbed during a fight in Edington Road, Abbey Wood 6 March: Ezra Okobia, 14, was fatally injured by fumes from a fire at his home in Russett Way, Lewisham.

"Police have spent New Year's Eve searching Philpot's Farm Open Space A 16-year-old boy has died after being stabbed in west London, making him the 30th teenage homicide in the capital in 2021, surpassing a peak of 29 in 2008. The fatal stabbing on Thursday evening happened shortly aftera 15-year-old boy was also found fatally wounded in Ashburton Park, Croydon, south London. A boy, 15, has been held on suspicion of murder over the Croydon stabbing. The 16-year-old victim was found by police and paramedics with a stab wound in Hillingdon but he died at the scene. He was found at Philpots Farm Open Space, close to Heather Lane in Yiewsley, at 19:30 GMT, about half an hour after the first stabbing. No arrests have yet been made in connection with the Hillingdon incident but officers have opened a murder inquiry. A post-mortem examination would ""be held in due course"", the Met said. Neither boy has been formally identified, Scotland Yard added, but their family members had been informed and were being supported by officers. The other teenager who died in a separate incident was found in Ashburton Park, Croydon The 15-year-old boy who died in Croydon was discovered injured after police had been called to Ashburton Park at about 19:00 GMT over reports of an assault. He was given first aid by officers before paramedics arrived but died at the scene. How London broke 2008 record for teenage killings Boy, 15, stabbed to death in London park The Met said his family had been informed and that a post-mortem examination would take place on Saturday. The arrested 15-year-old boy remains in police custody. Of the 30 teenage homicides in the capital this year, 27 of them have been stabbings while two have been shootings and one was the result of a suspected arson attack. More than 40 teenagers in the capital have also been charged with murder during 2021. Speaking from the scene in Croydon, Met Police Cdr Alex Murray said: ""My message today, other than speaking to the families and friends of those that London has lost, is to say you cannot carry knives in London. ""This is what happens when knives are carried and we all have a role in relation to tackling knife crime."" He also had a direct message to parents, saying: ""If you have concerns, talk to your kids. ""Make sure they're not carrying knives, make sure they're not hanging around with kids carrying knives."" The Metropolitan Police has opened 122 murder investigations in London this year, of which 79 are stabbings.

"The latest Covid booster campaign is under way across the UK and those who qualify are urged to get jabbed as soon as possible. No Covid restrictions are in place across the UK, but guidance recommends people who catch the virus ""should try to stay at home"". Many of the symptomsare similar to those for colds and flu,externaland include: high temperature, fever or chills continuous cough loss of, or change in, your normal sense of taste or smell shortness of breath feeling tired or exhausted aching body headache sore throat blocked or runny nose loss of appetite diarrhoea feeling sick or being sick Most people feel better within a few days or weeks - but for some, it can be more serious. Those concerned their or their child's symptoms are worsening should request an urgent GP appointment or help fromNHS 111,external. WHO charts rapid spread of new JN.1 Covid variant Why Covid is still flooring some people Between 2% and 20% of people catching Covidgo on to have longer-term symptoms, ""long Covid"", research suggests. In March, the Office for National Statistics (ONS)estimated 1.9 million people in the UK (2.9% of the population),externalstill had symptoms more than four weeks after their initial infection. There is no simple test for long Covid, andpeople report a variety of symptoms,external, including: extreme tiredness shortness of breath muscle aches memory and concentration problems (""brain fog"") Some people have developed long Covid after an initial mild infection. What are the symptoms of long Covid? Get NHS help with Covid recovery,external Routine Covid testing is not recommended, and most people can't get free tests via the NHS. You may stillbe able to get free NHS tests,externalif you: have a health condition that makes you eligible for treatment if you test positive work in healthcare or a hospice You can buy a test for about Â£2 from High Street and online chemists, but cannot report these test results to the NHS. People are largely advised to treat Covid like any other respiratory disease. You no longer have to self-isolate after testing positive. However, the government recommends trying to stay home for five days - or three for under-18s, as younger people tend to be infectious for a shorter period. People at higher risk of becoming seriously ill with Covid who have been told they areentitled to treatments if they catch it,externalmust report their test result so the NHS can contact them about their options. How to look after yourself if you get Covid Some people are infectious for about five days but others may be contagious for up to 10. Those who have a high temperature or still feel unwell after five days are advised to stay home if they can until they: feel well enough for your normal activities no longer have a high temperature You don't have to tell your employer you have Covid. However, you are asked to avoid contact with others for five days, which means you should work from home if you can, especially if you have a high temperature. The specific schemes offering financial support to those isolating during the pandemic have ended. But you may be entitled toStatutory Sick Pay,external- worth Â£109.40 a week. Under-18s who test positive for Covid are advised to stay at home for three days. NHS guidance saysif a child has mild symptoms such as a runny nose, sore throat or mild cough,external- and they feel well enough - they can go to school or childcare. In the UK, you canonly have the Covid vaccine via the NHS,externalif you meet certain criteria. For most people, vaccinations are now available only as part of a seasonal rollout.  You cannot currently buy them privately. The 2023 autumn booster campaign is targeting: residents in care homes for older adults over-65s people aged six months to 64 years in a clinical risk group front-line health and social-care workers 12-64-year-olds who are household contacts of people with weakened immune systems 16-64-year-olds who are carers or work in care homes for older adults pregnant women The NHS has been contacting eligible people. You canno longer book a Covid jab online or by calling NHS 119,external- but you may be able to with a local NHS vaccination serviceor you can find a walk-in site,external. This round of seasonal Covid jabs will be available until 31 January. Moderna told BBC News ithoped its Covid jab would be on sale in the UK from 2024. Pfizer is also exploring options for private provision. Who can get another Covid jab this autumn? If you have Covid, or think you might,NHS advice is to delay vaccination until you feel better,external. It also recommends waiting if you have a high temperature or feel otherwise unwell with any illness. But there is no need to wait if you have recently recovered from Covid and feel well. The vaccines do not infect people with Covid and cannot cause positive test results.

"This video can not be played Watch: Fires devastate suburban Colorado Tens of thousands of people have been evacuated and nearly 1,000 homes have been destroyed as wildfires spread through the US state of Colorado. The fast-moving blazes are burning in Boulder County, north of Denver. Governor Jared Polis called it a ""New Year's Eve miracle"" that no deaths had been reported. Some 30,000 people in the towns of Louisville and Superior were told to leave their homes on Thursday. A state of emergency has been declared. ""It was in blink of an eye. This was a disaster in fast motion, all in the course of half a day,"" Governor Polis said in a news conference on Friday. ""Nearly 1,000 homes are gone,"" he added. Winds of up to 105 mph (169 km/h) are fanning flames across the region amid a historic drought. While previous fires in Colorado have been in rural areas, these latest blazes are burning in more suburban parts of the state. Thursday's fires, named the Marshall Fire and Middle Fork Fire, are coming relatively late in the season. At least some were sparked when power lines were toppled by strong winds, and they have quickly become the most destructive wildfires in the state's modern history. Experts say that wildfires in western North America have grown more intense in recent years. ""This is our community so to watch it burn so quickly, so unexpectedly, is something that we are struggling to understand,"" said Gov Polis, who added that President Joe Biden had called to say he would sign a federal emergency declaration. While previous fires in Colorado have been in rural areas, these latest blazes are burning in towns Some 370 homes went up in flames west of Superior and 210 were lost in the Old Town area of Superior, Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle said. A shopping complex and hotel were also destroyed, and about 6,000 acres were burned in total, the sheriff said. Snow had began falling near the fires on Friday morning, offering some reprieve to firefighters who say the remaining fires are expected to burn out shortly. Neither of the two major hospitals in the area were affected, and all schools were ""spared"" from the flames, added Gov Polis. At least one first responder and six others were injured, Sheriff Pelle said, adding that more casualties were likely. One video taken outside a supermarket showed a dramatic scene as winds ripped through the car park. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He rushed home but only had time to gather a few possessions before the flames engulfed the property. His pet dog and cat both died. ""It's just a strange feeling to go from having everything to make your life comfortable to having nothing,"" he said. Colorado has been experiencing extreme droughts in recent years. Climate change increases the risk of the hot, dry weather that is likely to fuel wildfires.

"Sarah Ransome said the conviction was a ""major step forward in the fight for justice"" Former British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, 60, has been found guilty of recruiting and trafficking young girls to be sexually abused by the late American financier Jeffrey Epstein, her ex-boyfriend. A 12-person jury in New York found her guilty on five of the six counts she faced, including the most serious charge, that of trafficking a minor for sex. Survivors have celebrated the verdict, expressing ""relief"" and calling it a ""major step forward in the fight for justice"". One of the women who testified against Maxwell. She told the court she had a ""dark memory"" of abuse by Maxwell and Epstein. ""I am so relieved and grateful that the jury recognised the pattern of predatory behaviour that Maxwell engaged in for years and found her guilty of these crimes. ""I hope that this verdict brings solace to all who need it and demonstrates that no-one is above the law. Even those with great power and privilege will be held accountable when they sexually abuse and exploit the young."" She accused Maxwell of recruiting her as a masseuse to Epstein at the age of 15. She has also filed a civil case in New York saying she was sexually assaulted by the Duke of York, an accusation he has repeatedly denied. She says the alleged abuse happened at Maxwell's London home and at Epstein's homes in Manhattan and Little St James in the US Virgin Islands. ""My soul yearned for justice for years and today the jury gave me just that. I will remember this day always. Having lived with the horrors of Maxwell's abuse, my heart goes out to the many other girls and young women who suffered at her hands and whose lives she destroyed. ""I hope that today is not the end but rather another step in justice being served. Maxwell did not act alone. Others must be held accountable. I have faith that they will be."" Accused Epstein of sexually assaulting her at the age of 22, and previously told the BBC Maxwell was a ""master manipulator"". ""Justice takes the lead today. I am consumed with gratitude for every brave, courageous and justice-driven person that has fought for this outcome. Ghislaine Maxwell will never again have the opportunity to take anything from anyone. She will reside on the other side of freedom. Us, survivors, we go free."" This video can not be played Epstein accuser: Ghislaine Maxwell is a 'master manipulator' One of Epstein and Maxwell's accusers, she had told the BBC's Panorama programme that Maxwell was ""the nuts and bolts of the sex trafficking operation"" and that they worked closely together. ""The jury's conviction... is a major step forward in the fight for justice. Finally, after decades in some cases, survivors of Maxwell's sex trafficking now know that the public heard their testimony, and their voices can no longer be ignored or they be shamed. I think this courage is contagious. ""As one of way too many survivors of the Epstein and Maxwell sex trafficking conspiracy, I feel vindication for myself and for all survivors. I am so proud of all the survivors who came forward, risking their lives and careers to speak truth to power, even when the powerful didn't want to hear it."" Says Maxwell introduced her to Epstein and that the two assaulted her when she was 21.In her first broadcast interview, she told BBC Radio 4's The World at One that their relationship lasted for three years, and that she was assaulted multiple timesby both Epstein and Maxwell - with other people participating on some occasions. ""What happened to me that night with them [when she was assaulted for the first time] really shook me... I absolutely should've gone to the police. I didn't feel like I could. I just can't explain to you the fear and the emotional manipulation. In my mind these are my friends, those were people that said they cared about me. ""It was particularly difficult because I was made to feel like I was unsophisticated - because participating in sexual activities with multiple people was something that hadn't even crossed my mind at that age. So I had these friends who were powerful and magnetic and exciting pressuring meâ¦ Nobody asked if they could gang rape me. ""I think that [the verdict] is something that so many of us didn't think would ever happen. And especially for a woman to be charged with these things. I hope this really sets a precedent and it shows people that she was equally complicit in doing these things."" PROFILE:The story of Ghislaine Maxwell's downfall ANALYSIS:The damning testimony that brought Maxwell down CONTEXT:Key moments in the trial Represented a number of accusers ""Moved to tears. This day has finally come. Convicted sex trafficker Maxwell has finally been held to account for bringing girls to Jeffrey Epstein. Maxwell got to walk free on this earth for 60 years. May she never walk free again. ""The lesson: you do not have to be perfect to stand up for justice. All four of Ghislaine's accusers endured tough cross examinations about drug use, sexual behaviours, inconsistent statements. The jury saw through it and delivered justice."" She also shared a message she had received from one of her clients, named only asKiki: ""No sentence or punishment will take away the trauma that we all had to endure at their hands, but now she will have to live with what she did, just the way the survivors have to live with it every day of our lives. ""What she and Jeffrey did for their own sadistic pleasures, sentenced all of their victims to their own metaphorical prisons. I fight every day to escape those four walls that entrapped me the day I was abused, and now she will know what that's like for all of the girls she damaged for life."" Represented Jane (a pseudonym to protect her identity), one of Maxwell's accusers who testified at the trial. ""The verdict screams loud and clear - if you make it easier for another to sexually abuse children, you, too, will be held accountable for your role in that abuse. The strong women survivors of Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein's abuse can all sleep better tonight knowing that the justice system got it right.""

"Letters between Boris Johnson and his independent standards adviser on who paid for the refurbishment of his Downing Street flat will be published next month, the BBC has been told. TheFinancial Times has reported,externalthat the prime minister will be cleared of breaking the ministerial code and misleading adviser Lord Geidt. Labour said Mr Johnson had ""made a mockery of the standards the public has a right to expect"". Downing Street declined to comment. The Cabinet Office, which co-ordinates government policy, said it would not comment on speculation. What is the row over Boris Johnson's flat about? What do we know about Boris Johnson's finances? Lord Geidtcleared the prime minister in May of a conflict of interestafter it emerged that Conservative peer Lord Brownlow had donated Â£52,000 to help cover the costs of the refurbishment of his flat above No 11 Downing Street. But the adviser revisited his inquiry after new information emerged, to see if he had been misled by the prime minister. The Financial Times reported that, while Mr Johnson is set to be criticised in the fresh probe, he will be cleared of breaking the ministerial code, which sets rules for conduct in office. The newspaper also suggested he would not be found to have deceived his adviser. In May, Lord Geidt said the prime minister appeared not to be aware that Lord Brownlow had contributed from his own pocket. But in December, the Electoral Commission said in a report that Mr Johnson had sent a WhatsApp message to Lord Brownlow in November 2020 to ask for extra money. Downing Street argued that the prime minster was ""not aware of the underlying details"" of Lord Brownlow's donations, when asked about the apparent discrepancy between what he told Lord Geidt and what the Electoral Commission said. His spokesman said Mr Johnson had thought Lord Brownlow was overseeing the money, but he did not realise the peer was providing the money himself. When the apparent discrepancy emerged, the BBC was told Lord Geidt wasunhappy but was not considering quitting. However, Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner accused the prime minister of lying to the public. On Thursday, the Financial Times quoted anonymous senior officials as saying the prime minister's conduct would be ""criticised"" and that Lord Geidt had now seen all the relevant WhatsApp messages between Mr Johnson and Lord Brownlow. The BBC has been told that a series of letters between the prime minister and Lord Geidt will be published on the government's website in early January. A spokesperson for the Cabinet Office, where Lord Geidt's office is based, said they would not comment on speculation, but added: ""The terms of reference set out that advice the independent adviser provides to the prime minister on matters which are referred to him will be published in a timely manner."" Ms Rayner said: ""After the Electoral Commission ruled that the Conservative Party broke the law on declaring donations, the prime minister has made a mockery of the standards the public has a right to expect. ""While the British public is facing a cost-of-living crisis, Boris Johnson is busy writing to his own adviser about why he did not give him all of the information he needed for his investigation."" She called for all the correspondence between Lord Geidt and the prime minister to be published ""as a first step towards providing full transparency into how Boris Johnson is explaining away his WhatsApp messages with Tory donors"". ""It is embarrassing that when the country needs real leadership, Boris Johnson is busy trying to clear up his own personal mess,"" she added.

"Annie Farmer testified against Maxwell A woman who was groomed by Ghislaine Maxwell and gave key evidence at her sex-trafficking trial hopes the verdict will bring ""solace"" to other survivors. ""I am so relieved and grateful,"" said Annie Farmer, the only witness to use her real name during her testimony. ""I hope this verdict... demonstrates that no one is above the law."" Maxwell was found guilty of grooming underage girls to be abused by Jeffrey Epstein. Her lawyers say they will appeal against the verdict. 'No-one is above the law': Victims react to Maxwell verdict The 60-year-old was convicted on five of the six counts she faced, including the most serious charge - that of sex-trafficking a minor. Prosecutors made the case that Maxwell and Epstein were ""partners in crime"" The verdict, reached after five full days of deliberation by a 12-person jury in New York, means the British socialite could spend the rest of her life behind bars. Ms Farmer, now 42 and a psychologist, testified that she had been lured when she was 16 to a New Mexico ranch owned by Epstein, where Maxwell had given her a nude massage. ""I hope that this verdict brings solace to all who need it,"" she said. ""Even those with great power and privilege will be held accountable when they sexually abuse and exploit the young."" PROFILE:The story of Ghislaine Maxwell's downfall ANALYSIS:The damning testimony that brought Maxwell down SURVIVOR INTERVIEW:'I just can't explain to you the fear' A lawyer representing a victim who used the name Jane as a pseudonym to protect her identity thanked the jury for recognising Maxwell's ""critical role in helping"" Epstein, and praised the victims who had shared their experiences. ""The strong women survivors of Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein's abuse can all sleep better tonight knowing that the justice system got it right,"" Robert Glassman said. Another lawyer who represents a number of Epstein accusers, Gloria Allred, told the BBC the outcome sent a ""message to other sex predators"" who took advantage of vulnerable young women. ""Charges may be filed against you, you may be prosecuted and you may end up getting sentenced to prison for the rest of your life,"" she said. Virginia Giuffre, who is one of Maxwell and Epstein's most prominent accusers, said she would ""remember this day always"". ""Having lived with the horrors of Maxwell's abuse, my heart goes out to the many other girls and young women who suffered at her hands and whose lives she destroyed,"" she said. Ms Giuffre has also previously alleged that she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew three times. The Duke of York denies the allegations. Wednesday's verdict followed a month-long trial featuring testimony from four women who described being abused by Epstein between 1994 and 2004. Maxwell showed no visible sign of emotion as the verdict was read out on Wednesday, only pouring herself a glass of water which she sipped from twice. A date for her sentencing has not yet been set. Maxwell, a long-time associate of convicted child sex offender Epstein, has been in jail since July 2020 when she was charged with involvement in the financier's abuse of teenage girls. Some of the victims were as young as 14. Epstein killed himself in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. A well-connected socialite, Maxwell is the youngest daughter of the disgraced newspaper tycoon Robert Maxwell who died in 1991. Soon after her father's death, Maxwell left the UK to settle in America where she worked in real estate and eventually met Epstein. The pair's romantic relationship reportedly lasted only a few years, but she continued to work with him long after and is said to have introduced Epstein to wealthy and powerful figures including Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew. During the trial, Maxwell's lawyers repeatedly argued she was a scapegoat for Epstein's crimes. Prosecutors sought to portray the duo as ""partners in crime"" running a ""pyramid scheme of abuse"". Prosecutors cited bank records showing she had received $30m (Â£22m) from Epstein between 1999 and 2007 as evidence she had been motivated by money. All of the women who testified said they had been sexually abused by Epstein before they turned 18, and that Maxwell had urged, facilitated and even participated in the sexual encounters. This video can not be played Ghislaine Maxwell's lawyer said the guilty verdict would be appealed Another accuser, Liz Stein, who did not testify at Maxwell's trial, told BBC Radio 4's The World at One she had met Maxwell when she was 21 - and had been assaulted by her and Epstein the first day they met. In her first broadcast interview, she described how both Epstein and Maxwell ""made you feel like there was nobody else in the world, like you were the most important person in the universe"". Explaining why she had seen the pair repeatedly after being abused, Ms Stein said: ""I absolutely should've gone to the police. I didn't feel like I could. I just can't explain to you the fear and the emotional manipulation. In my mind these are my friends, those were people that said they cared about me."" Asked about the guilty verdict, she said: ""I think that is something that so many of us didn't think would ever happen. And especially for a woman to be charged with these things. I hope this really sets a precedent and it shows people that she was equally complicit in doing these things.""

"Cathay Pacific has announced immediate major cuts to its flight schedule, including cancelling passenger and cargo services to and from Hong Kong. The airline did not provide details on how many flights would be grounded but it said it would operate a skeleton passenger schedule in January. It comes after Hong Kong announced tighter Covid-19 quarantine rules for air cargo crew earlier this week. The move was aimed at tackling the threat of the Omicron Covid variant. Cathay pilots have previously told the BBC the restrictions have affected their mental health and personal lives. Late on Thursday Cathay Pacific said it was tentatively planning to cancel some passenger flights in and out of the Asian financial hub in the first three months of the new year. It also said that long haul freight and cargo-only passenger flights including from Europe, Riyadh and Dubai would be suspended until 6 January. Cathay Pacific had already announced last week that it would cancel some of its flights in January. The latest decision is likely to put further strain on the already struggling global supply chain. Like much of the rest of the global aviation industry, Cathay has been hit hard by the pandemic. It posteda net loss of $2.8bn (Â£2bn) in 2020and lost $972m in the first half of 2021. Airlines around the world have cancelled thousands of flights in the Christmas period alone due to the coronavirus. In line with mainland China, Hong Kong has a zero-Covid policy as it aims to persuade Beijing to allow cross-border travel. As a result the city has some of strictest quarantine rules in the world, raising concerns that it may be left behind as other major financial centres open up as they adopt approaches that see them live with the coronavirus rather than remaining closed off to keep case numbers low. Hong Kong is one of the world's biggest aviation hubs but also has some of the strictest coronavirus regulations in the world. Two pilots with Cathay Pacific recently told the BBC that the rules have seriously affected their mental health and putting a strain on their personal lives. ""You're just in a perpetual state of quarantine,"" one pilot, who has spent almost 150 days in isolation this year alone, said. Though Hong Kong has recorded barely any local coronavirus cases in recent months, the city has imposed an extensive testing and quarantine regime, in line with mainland China's zero Covid policy.

"This video can not be played Russian troop build-up: View from Ukraine front line When Russia wanted the US to sit up and take notice last April it sent tanks towards the Ukrainian border. The show of force worked: President Joe Biden called Russia's Vladimir Putin and in June the two men met in Geneva. But whatever they agreed about Ukraine at their summit, something has since gone awry. In recent weeks, Russian tanks have been moving west towards Ukraine once again, prompting fresh, even starker warnings from US intelligence circles that a cross-border offensive could be on the cards. This build-up of Russian forces was spotted some 300km (185 miles) from Ukraine Moscow insists that's ""anti-Russian"" hysteria, and most analysts agree there's no rationale for Russia openly entering - and massively escalating - the conflict in Ukraine, where it backs separatist forces but always denies a direct role. Instead, they see the Kremlin sending a message that it's ready to defend its ""red lines"" on Ukraine: above all, that it must not join Nato. ""I think for Putin it's really important. He thinks the West has begun giving Ukraine's elite hope about joining Nato,"" political analyst Tatiana Stanovaya at R.Politik told the BBC. ""The training, the weapons and so on are like a red rag to a bull for Putin and he thinks if he doesn't act today, then tomorrow there will be Nato bases in Ukraine. He needs to put a stop to that."" Ukraine's desire to join the security bloc is nothing new, nor is Russia's insistence on vetoing that ambition in what it sees as its own ""back yard"". But Moscow has been rattled recently by the Ukrainian military using Turkish drones against Russian-backed forces in eastern Ukraine; the flight near Crimea of two nuclear-capable US bombers was an extra irritant. Russia has been angered by Ukraine's use of Bayraktar drones There's also concern that the so-called Minsk agreements, a framework for ending Ukraine's seven-year-old conflict that's too contentious to actually implement, could be jettisoned for something more favourable to Kyiv. In April, Russia found that demonstrative military deployment worked well so it's repeating the trick. ""Our recent warnings have indeed been heard and the effect is noticeable: tensions have risen,"" President Putin told Russian diplomats last week. He argued that tension needed sustaining to force the West to reckon with Russia, not ignore it. ""If the military movements [close to Ukraine] are explicit, then this is not about direct military action - it's about a signal Putin wants to send,"" Andrei Kortunov, head of the RIAC think-tank in Moscow, told the BBC. The signal to Ukraine is not to try anything rash, he believes, like seizing back control of the Donbas. For the West, Mr Kortunov says Russia's message is to stop its ""infiltration"" of Ukraine with Nato infrastructure, including new kinds of weapons. ""That's definitely a matter of concern for Moscow,"" he argues. This week, Russia's external intelligence agency, the SVR, evoked the 2008 Georgia war, in a statement on Ukraine. It recalled the ""high price"" paid by then Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili, who sparked all-out conflict with Russia by attempting to regain control of the separatist region of South Ossetia, which is backed by Moscow. Russian troops invaded Georgia in 2008 when it tried to recapture a breakaway region ""The Georgian scenario is on the table and could be used in Ukraine,"" Tatiana Stanovaya argues. ""That doesn't mean Russia is preparing it; that there's no way back. I think it's just an option for now, not a decision,"" she says. Ukraine itself at first dismissed US talk of an unusual troop build-up, though it has since joined the chorus of concern. According to its head of military intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov, around 90,000 Russian troops are now deployed in the vicinity of Ukraine - fewer than during similar tensions last spring. He believes they could launch an attack from several directions early next year. On Friday, Ukraine's president made clear his country had no plans for an incursion into the Donbas. Others are sceptical. ""Russia would definitely like to send the signal that if forced to fight, it will fight,"" Mr Kortunov reasons. ""But I don't see what can be accomplished by a direct military offensive against Ukraine."" ""No matter how it goes, the collateral damage will be much more significant than any possible gain."" So it's possible Mr Putin is hedging his bets. ""My suspicion is that this is contingency planning,"" was security expert Mark Galeotti's conclusion in his podcast In Moscow's Shadow. He suggests the Kremlin is ""creating all sorts of opportunities"", and no firm decision has been taken. But he too doubts that Moscow wants open conflict, bringing more sanctions and a total rupture in relations with the West. ""A vicious war in Ukraine could shatter the unity and legitimacy of the Russian regime,"" warns Mark Galeotti. ""The good news is that I suspect the regimeâ¦ understands that."" On balance, he believes the Kremlin will find reasons not to escalate the situation. There are also signs that, once again, what Moscow really wants to achieve with its tanks are more talks with the US: another summit of the two presidents. It's a risky way of conducting diplomacy, but for Mr Putin the stakes are high. The two leaders met in Geneva in June ""At a meeting between Putin and Biden, neither will give clear commitments but there may be some tacit understanding on how far the US is ready to go in increasing its military support to Ukraine,"" Mr Kortunov argues. ""That's not impossible."" Russian sources say such talks could happen in the coming weeks, perhaps remotely at first. The White House hasn't yet confirmed that. ""Whilst Putin has a flicker of hope that he can do a deal with Biden, he won't take any rash steps. But if he thinks it's all doomed, he could do the worst things we can imagine,"" Tatiana Stanovaya warns. As long as the Russian leader has that hope, then she believes ""things won't be so awful"".

"This video can not be played Watch: Fires devastate suburban Colorado Tens of thousands of people have been evacuated and nearly 1,000 homes have been destroyed as wildfires spread through the US state of Colorado. The fast-moving blazes are burning in Boulder County, north of Denver. Governor Jared Polis called it a ""New Year's Eve miracle"" that no deaths had been reported. Some 30,000 people in the towns of Louisville and Superior were told to leave their homes on Thursday. A state of emergency has been declared. ""It was in blink of an eye. This was a disaster in fast motion, all in the course of half a day,"" Governor Polis said in a news conference on Friday. ""Nearly 1,000 homes are gone,"" he added. Winds of up to 105 mph (169 km/h) are fanning flames across the region amid a historic drought. While previous fires in Colorado have been in rural areas, these latest blazes are burning in more suburban parts of the state. Thursday's fires, named the Marshall Fire and Middle Fork Fire, are coming relatively late in the season. At least some were sparked when power lines were toppled by strong winds, and they have quickly become the most destructive wildfires in the state's modern history. Experts say that wildfires in western North America have grown more intense in recent years. ""This is our community so to watch it burn so quickly, so unexpectedly, is something that we are struggling to understand,"" said Gov Polis, who added that President Joe Biden had called to say he would sign a federal emergency declaration. While previous fires in Colorado have been in rural areas, these latest blazes are burning in towns Some 370 homes went up in flames west of Superior and 210 were lost in the Old Town area of Superior, Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle said. A shopping complex and hotel were also destroyed, and about 6,000 acres were burned in total, the sheriff said. Snow had began falling near the fires on Friday morning, offering some reprieve to firefighters who say the remaining fires are expected to burn out shortly. Neither of the two major hospitals in the area were affected, and all schools were ""spared"" from the flames, added Gov Polis. At least one first responder and six others were injured, Sheriff Pelle said, adding that more casualties were likely. One video taken outside a supermarket showed a dramatic scene as winds ripped through the car park. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He rushed home but only had time to gather a few possessions before the flames engulfed the property. His pet dog and cat both died. ""It's just a strange feeling to go from having everything to make your life comfortable to having nothing,"" he said. Colorado has been experiencing extreme droughts in recent years. Climate change increases the risk of the hot, dry weather that is likely to fuel wildfires.

"Sarah Ransome said the conviction was a ""major step forward in the fight for justice"" Former British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, 60, has been found guilty of recruiting and trafficking young girls to be sexually abused by the late American financier Jeffrey Epstein, her ex-boyfriend. A 12-person jury in New York found her guilty on five of the six counts she faced, including the most serious charge, that of trafficking a minor for sex. Survivors have celebrated the verdict, expressing ""relief"" and calling it a ""major step forward in the fight for justice"". One of the women who testified against Maxwell. She told the court she had a ""dark memory"" of abuse by Maxwell and Epstein. ""I am so relieved and grateful that the jury recognised the pattern of predatory behaviour that Maxwell engaged in for years and found her guilty of these crimes. ""I hope that this verdict brings solace to all who need it and demonstrates that no-one is above the law. Even those with great power and privilege will be held accountable when they sexually abuse and exploit the young."" She accused Maxwell of recruiting her as a masseuse to Epstein at the age of 15. She has also filed a civil case in New York saying she was sexually assaulted by the Duke of York, an accusation he has repeatedly denied. She says the alleged abuse happened at Maxwell's London home and at Epstein's homes in Manhattan and Little St James in the US Virgin Islands. ""My soul yearned for justice for years and today the jury gave me just that. I will remember this day always. Having lived with the horrors of Maxwell's abuse, my heart goes out to the many other girls and young women who suffered at her hands and whose lives she destroyed. ""I hope that today is not the end but rather another step in justice being served. Maxwell did not act alone. Others must be held accountable. I have faith that they will be."" Accused Epstein of sexually assaulting her at the age of 22, and previously told the BBC Maxwell was a ""master manipulator"". ""Justice takes the lead today. I am consumed with gratitude for every brave, courageous and justice-driven person that has fought for this outcome. Ghislaine Maxwell will never again have the opportunity to take anything from anyone. She will reside on the other side of freedom. Us, survivors, we go free."" This video can not be played Epstein accuser: Ghislaine Maxwell is a 'master manipulator' One of Epstein and Maxwell's accusers, she had told the BBC's Panorama programme that Maxwell was ""the nuts and bolts of the sex trafficking operation"" and that they worked closely together. ""The jury's conviction... is a major step forward in the fight for justice. Finally, after decades in some cases, survivors of Maxwell's sex trafficking now know that the public heard their testimony, and their voices can no longer be ignored or they be shamed. I think this courage is contagious. ""As one of way too many survivors of the Epstein and Maxwell sex trafficking conspiracy, I feel vindication for myself and for all survivors. I am so proud of all the survivors who came forward, risking their lives and careers to speak truth to power, even when the powerful didn't want to hear it."" Says Maxwell introduced her to Epstein and that the two assaulted her when she was 21.In her first broadcast interview, she told BBC Radio 4's The World at One that their relationship lasted for three years, and that she was assaulted multiple timesby both Epstein and Maxwell - with other people participating on some occasions. ""What happened to me that night with them [when she was assaulted for the first time] really shook me... I absolutely should've gone to the police. I didn't feel like I could. I just can't explain to you the fear and the emotional manipulation. In my mind these are my friends, those were people that said they cared about me. ""It was particularly difficult because I was made to feel like I was unsophisticated - because participating in sexual activities with multiple people was something that hadn't even crossed my mind at that age. So I had these friends who were powerful and magnetic and exciting pressuring meâ¦ Nobody asked if they could gang rape me. ""I think that [the verdict] is something that so many of us didn't think would ever happen. And especially for a woman to be charged with these things. I hope this really sets a precedent and it shows people that she was equally complicit in doing these things."" PROFILE:The story of Ghislaine Maxwell's downfall ANALYSIS:The damning testimony that brought Maxwell down CONTEXT:Key moments in the trial Represented a number of accusers ""Moved to tears. This day has finally come. Convicted sex trafficker Maxwell has finally been held to account for bringing girls to Jeffrey Epstein. Maxwell got to walk free on this earth for 60 years. May she never walk free again. ""The lesson: you do not have to be perfect to stand up for justice. All four of Ghislaine's accusers endured tough cross examinations about drug use, sexual behaviours, inconsistent statements. The jury saw through it and delivered justice."" She also shared a message she had received from one of her clients, named only asKiki: ""No sentence or punishment will take away the trauma that we all had to endure at their hands, but now she will have to live with what she did, just the way the survivors have to live with it every day of our lives. ""What she and Jeffrey did for their own sadistic pleasures, sentenced all of their victims to their own metaphorical prisons. I fight every day to escape those four walls that entrapped me the day I was abused, and now she will know what that's like for all of the girls she damaged for life."" Represented Jane (a pseudonym to protect her identity), one of Maxwell's accusers who testified at the trial. ""The verdict screams loud and clear - if you make it easier for another to sexually abuse children, you, too, will be held accountable for your role in that abuse.

"Annie Farmer testified against Maxwell A woman who was groomed by Ghislaine Maxwell and gave key evidence at her sex-trafficking trial hopes the verdict will bring ""solace"" to other survivors. ""I am so relieved and grateful,"" said Annie Farmer, the only witness to use her real name during her testimony. ""I hope this verdict... demonstrates that no one is above the law."" Maxwell was found guilty of grooming underage girls to be abused by Jeffrey Epstein. Her lawyers say they will appeal against the verdict. 'No-one is above the law': Victims react to Maxwell verdict The 60-year-old was convicted on five of the six counts she faced, including the most serious charge - that of sex-trafficking a minor. Prosecutors made the case that Maxwell and Epstein were ""partners in crime"" The verdict, reached after five full days of deliberation by a 12-person jury in New York, means the British socialite could spend the rest of her life behind bars. Ms Farmer, now 42 and a psychologist, testified that she had been lured when she was 16 to a New Mexico ranch owned by Epstein, where Maxwell had given her a nude massage. ""I hope that this verdict brings solace to all who need it,"" she said. ""Even those with great power and privilege will be held accountable when they sexually abuse and exploit the young."" PROFILE:The story of Ghislaine Maxwell's downfall ANALYSIS:The damning testimony that brought Maxwell down SURVIVOR INTERVIEW:'I just can't explain to you the fear' A lawyer representing a victim who used the name Jane as a pseudonym to protect her identity thanked the jury for recognising Maxwell's ""critical role in helping"" Epstein, and praised the victims who had shared their experiences. ""The strong women survivors of Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein's abuse can all sleep better tonight knowing that the justice system got it right,"" Robert Glassman said. Another lawyer who represents a number of Epstein accusers, Gloria Allred, told the BBC the outcome sent a ""message to other sex predators"" who took advantage of vulnerable young women. ""Charges may be filed against you, you may be prosecuted and you may end up getting sentenced to prison for the rest of your life,"" she said. Virginia Giuffre, who is one of Maxwell and Epstein's most prominent accusers, said she would ""remember this day always"". ""Having lived with the horrors of Maxwell's abuse, my heart goes out to the many other girls and young women who suffered at her hands and whose lives she destroyed,"" she said. Ms Giuffre has also previously alleged that she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew three times. The Duke of York denies the allegations. Wednesday's verdict followed a month-long trial featuring testimony from four women who described being abused by Epstein between 1994 and 2004. Maxwell showed no visible sign of emotion as the verdict was read out on Wednesday, only pouring herself a glass of water which she sipped from twice. A date for her sentencing has not yet been set. Maxwell, a long-time associate of convicted child sex offender Epstein, has been in jail since July 2020 when she was charged with involvement in the financier's abuse of teenage girls. Some of the victims were as young as 14. Epstein killed himself in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. A well-connected socialite, Maxwell is the youngest daughter of the disgraced newspaper tycoon Robert Maxwell who died in 1991. Soon after her father's death, Maxwell left the UK to settle in America where she worked in real estate and eventually met Epstein. The pair's romantic relationship reportedly lasted only a few years, but she continued to work with him long after and is said to have introduced Epstein to wealthy and powerful figures including Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew. During the trial, Maxwell's lawyers repeatedly argued she was a scapegoat for Epstein's crimes. Prosecutors sought to portray the duo as ""partners in crime"" running a ""pyramid scheme of abuse"". Prosecutors cited bank records showing she had received $30m (Â£22m) from Epstein between 1999 and 2007 as evidence she had been motivated by money. All of the women who testified said they had been sexually abused by Epstein before they turned 18, and that Maxwell had urged, facilitated and even participated in the sexual encounters. This video can not be played Ghislaine Maxwell's lawyer said the guilty verdict would be appealed Another accuser, Liz Stein, who did not testify at Maxwell's trial, told BBC Radio 4's The World at One she had met Maxwell when she was 21 - and had been assaulted by her and Epstein the first day they met. In her first broadcast interview, she described how both Epstein and Maxwell ""made you feel like there was nobody else in the world, like you were the most important person in the universe"". Explaining why she had seen the pair repeatedly after being abused, Ms Stein said: ""I absolutely should've gone to the police. I didn't feel like I could. I just can't explain to you the fear and the emotional manipulation. In my mind these are my friends, those were people that said they cared about me."" Asked about the guilty verdict, she said: ""I think that is something that so many of us didn't think would ever happen. And especially for a woman to be charged with these things.
