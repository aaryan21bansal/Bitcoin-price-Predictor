"This video can not be played Democrats kneel in moment of silence for George Floyd US Democrats in Congress have proposed sweeping legislation to reform American police, following weeks of protests against police brutality and racism. The bill would make it easier to prosecute police for misconduct, ban chokeholds, and addresses racism. It comes as Minneapolis lawmakers vowed to disband the city's police force. The death of George Floyd at the hands of a white officer there sparked national pressure for change. However, it was unclear whether Republicans, who control the US Senate, would support the proposed Justice in Policing Act of 2020. US President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that ""the Radical Left Democrats want to Defund and Abandon our Police. Sorry, I want LAW & ORDER!"" What Trump states make of unrest Five pieces of context to understand protests Why I decided not to watch Floyd's video Timeline: From Kaepernick kneeling to NFL apology Mr Floyd's brother is expected to testify to the House of Representatives later this week in a hearing on police reform. The Justice in Policing Act of 2020 was introduced on Monday by top Democratic lawmakers House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, black senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker and members of the Congressional Black Caucus. As she unveiled the bill, Mrs Pelosi read the names of black men and women who have died at the hands of police in recent years. The bill forces federal police to use body and dashboard cameras, ban chokeholds, eliminate unannounced police raids known as ""no-knock warrants"", make it easier to hold police liable for civil rights violations and calls for federal funds to be withheld from local police forces who do not make similar reforms. ""The martyrdom of George Floyd gave the American experience a moment of national anguish, as we grieve for the black Americans killed by police brutality,"" Mrs Pelosi said. This video can not be played The history of police violence in the US ""Today, this movement of national anguish is being transformed into a movement of national action"". The bill makes lynching a federal crime, limits the sale of military weapons to the police and gives the Department of Justice the authority to investigate state and local police for evidence of department-wide bias or misconduct. It would also create a ""national police misconduct registry"" - a database of complaints against police. Some Republican leaders have said they would consider the possibility of writing their own bill, with a hearing scheduled in the Senate Judiciary committee next week. However, members of President Trump's party have been largely reticent on signalling support for legislation. In a break with his party, Republican Senator Mitt Romney on Sunday tweeted pictures of himself marching towards the White House with Christian protesters, with the caption ""Black Lives Matter."" The reform package, crafted by Democratic leaders in Congress, can be viewed as the ""official"" position of the party - at least for now. It is, in part, an effort to head off more drastic measures that some on the left, under the slogan ""defund the police"", are pushing. If the Democrats can keep their liberal ranks in line, they should be able to get the reforms passed in the House of Representatives, where they have a majority. The outlook is less certain in the Republican-controlled Senate - particularly if Donald Trump sees political advantage in trying to paint Democratic proposals as a threat to ""law and order"". While there is sure to be plenty of heated rhetoric from national politicians during a presidential election season, the real change may end up coming from local officials who are more directly accountable to the voters in municipalities that have seen the largest protests. The call to disband the police in Minneapolis, while largely symbolic at this point, could indicate that sweeping changes are very real possibility - with or without federal guidance. This could be the beginning of series of local experiments in policing reform that take very different forms in different parts of the US. VIEWPOINT:Tipping point for racially divided nation WATCH:'This is why we are protesting' TIMELINE:Recent black deaths at hands of police BACKGROUND:Five pieces of context to understand the protests CRIME AND JUSTICE:How are African Americans treated? ""Defund the police"" was a rallying cry during the latest street protests, that at times spilt into violence and looting. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio had already said he would divert money from the city's police department to social services. This video can not be played The US's history of racial inequality has paved the way for modern day police brutality ""Defunding"" advocates have for years been condemning what they describe as the aggressive militarised policing in the US. They argue that police departments' budgets should be slashed and funds diverted to social programmes to avoid unnecessary confrontation and heal the racial divide. President Donald Trump has sought to cast his expected presidential challenger, Democrat Joe Biden, as a proponent of defunding police, but Mr Biden on Monday denied that he was a supporter. ""I don't support defunding the police,""Mr Biden said in an interview,externalwith the BBC's US partner CBS. ""I support conditioning federal aid to police, based on whether or not they meet certain basic standards of decency and... are able to demonstrate they can protect the community and everybody in the community."" Entire city police departments have been disbanded before in the country: in Compton, California, in 2000, and 12 years later in Camden, New Jersey. In both cases they were replaced with bigger new forces that covered local counties. Demonstrators gathered again on Sunday in US cities including Washington DC, New York, and Los Angeles - where a local broadcaster estimated 20,000 people had rallied down Hollywood Boulevard. The protests were mostly peaceful, and security measures across the US were lifted as unrest started to ease. However, Seattle Police Department said a man drove a car into a demonstration there on Sunday night, before shooting and wounding a 27-year-old bystander. The UK also saw sizeable weekend protests in support of Black Lives Matter, with demonstrations in cities including London, Manchester, Cardiff, Leicester and Sheffield. Protesters tear down statue amid anti-racism demos Protesters in London knelt for a minute's silence before chanting ""no justice, no peace"". In Australia, tens of thousands joined anti-racism protests in Brisbane, Melbourne, Hobart, Adelaide and elsewhere, despite warnings from officials over the coronavirus. 25 May 2020 George Floyd dies after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Footage shows a white officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floydâs neck for several minutes while he is pinned to the floor. Mr Floyd is heard repeatedly saying ""I canât breathe"". He is pronounced dead later in hospital. 26 May Four officers involved in the arrest of George Floyd are fired. Protests begin as the video of the arrest is shared widely on social media. Hundreds of demonstrators take to the streets of Minneapolis and vandalise police cars and the police station with graffiti. 27 May Protests spread to other cities including Memphis and Los Angeles. In some places, like Portland, Oregon, protesters lie in the road, chanting ""I canât breathe"". Demonstrators again gather around the police station in Minneapolis where the officers involved in George Floydâs arrest were based and set fire to it. The building is evacuated and police retreat. 28 May President Trump blames the violence on a lack of leadership in Minneapolis and threatens to send in the National Guard in a tweet. Â He follows it up in a second tweet with a warning ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"". The second tweet is hidden by Twitter for ""glorifying violence"". 29 May A CNN reporter, Omar Jimenez, is arrested while covering the Minneapolis protest. Mr Jimenez was reporting live when police officers handcuffed him. A few minutes later several of his colleagues are also arrested. They are all later released once they are confirmed to be members of the media. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, 44, is charged with murder and manslaughter. The charges carry a combined maximum 35-year sentence. 31 May Violence spreads across the US on the sixth night of protests. A total of at least five people are reported killed in protests from Indianapolis to Chicago. More than 75 cities have seen protests. At least 4,400 people have been arrested. Â Curfews are imposed across the US to try to stem the unrest. 1 June President Trump threatens to send in the military to quell growing civil unrest. He says if cities and states fail to control the protests and ""defend their residents"" he will deploy the army and ""quickly solve the problem for them"". Mr Trump poses in front of a damaged church shortly after police used tear gas to disperse peaceful protesters nearby. 2 June Tens of thousands of protesters again take to the streets. One of the biggest protests is in George Floydâs hometown of Houston, Texas. Many defy curfews in several cities, but the demonstrations are largely peaceful. 4 June A memorial service for George Floyd is held in Minneapolis. Â Those gathered in tribute stand in silence for eight minutes, 46 seconds, the amount of time Mr Floyd is alleged to have been on the ground under arrest. Hundreds attended the service, which heard a eulogy from civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton. 7 June As the US saw another weekend of protests, with tens of thousands marching in Washington DC, anti-racism demonstrations were held around the world. In Australia, there were major protests in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane that focused on the treatment of indigenous Australians. There were also demonstrations in France, Germany, Spain and the UK. In Bristol, protesters tore down the statue of a 17th century slave trader and threw it into the harbour. 9 June A funeral service for George Floyd is held in Houston, Mr Floydâs home town. Just over two weeks after his death in Minneapolis and worldwide anti-racism protests, about 500 guests invited by the Floyd family are in attendance at the Fountain of Praise Church. Â Many more gather outside to show their support.

"Routine dental appointments may not happen until next year Dental health in Wales faces an ""impending disaster"" unless surgeries reopen, a dentist has warned in a letter to the first minister. Cardiff dentist Dr Charlie Stephanakis said his plea on behalf of about 500 Welsh colleagues reflected mounting concerns for patients. Dentists in England can reopen from Monday, but in Wales a phased approach will begin in July. The Welsh Government said reinstating services needed to be ""gradual"". Routine appointments have been postponed since the start of lockdown, but in that time dentists in Wales have seen 11,500 people in practices for urgent care and provided 140,000 consultations over the phone or using video services. From July patients will be able to be assessed for urgent care at their practices, but those requiring invasive procedures such as high-speed drilling will still be referred to specialist 'Urgent Dental Care' centres. Under the phased guidelines,externalset out by Wales' chief dental officer, Colette Bridgman, routine assessments and care will only be reinstated between January and March 2021. 'I tried to pull my tooth out with pliers' Missing out on NHS dental care What's on and off in Wales? But in his open letter to Mark Drakeford, Dr Stephanakis said without action ""we are facing the long-term degradation of the oral health of the population of Wales"". The dentist said keeping surgeries closed following the coronavirus lockdown in Wales had led to several issues, including: An increase in patients with untreated acute dental problems An increase of urgent dental related hospital admissions Loss of teeth due to uncontrolled chronic disease, decline in dental health and mental health issues He has called for urgent meetings with the Welsh Government to seek a way forward. The British Dental Association, which represents the health sector, said there was a ""great, growing demand"" for swifter action before 2021. A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""We share dentists' concerns and recognise routine care cannot be postponed indefinitely. ""We have published our plan for the reinstatement of services but this needs to be a cautious and gradual approach, taking into consideration the risk of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) on Covid-19 transmission. ""There is a need to balance the oral health needs of patients against the need to protect patients, dental teams and communities in Wales from coronavirus.""

"Rachel Adedeji has appeared in more than 200 episodes of Hollyoaks Hollyoaks has launched an investigation after Rachel Adedeji alleged she witnessed racism on the soap. The actress said a senior producer referred to black cast members using a racial slur and claimed black actresses were told to change their hair. In a statement on Tuesday, Hollyoaks' producers said they were ""deeply shocked and saddened"" by the issues that had come to light. They said they have ""zero tolerance on racism"" but ""have further work to do"". On Saturday,Adedeji tweeted several claims,externalabout her experiences on the Channel 4 soap, which is produced by Lime Pictures. The actress said she was told ""You're all the same"" by a make-up artist, and said black actresses on the show were ""forced to drastically change their hair"" after being told viewers wouldn't be able to tell them apart. Adedeji, has appeared in more than 200 episodes of the show, but said in her four years on the soap she had only worked with one black director. ""Working at Hollyoaks is mostly positive, but the experiences I have encountered are a constant reminder of how difficult it is being a black woman in the industry,"" Adedeji said. ""I am no longer standing for it."" Her comments followthe Black Lives Matter protests, which were sparked bythe death of George Floyd in police custody. Adedeji's co-star KÃ©llÃ© Bryan said the show was launching a series of podcasts about racism In their statement on Tuesday, Lime Pictures said: ""We must stamp out implicit bias which means calling out racism wherever and whenever we see it. ""We will continue to add to our action plan as we continue and broaden our dialogue with cast and staff."" The action plan includes the following measures: Contacting all cast and staff who have raised issues and addressing all concerns Asking cast, staff and freelancers to share any other issues of concern or instances of unacceptable behaviour Working with unconscious bias trainers to help address concerns All BAME staff, freelancers and cast to be offered mentoring from Lime's senior management Lime to be made ""as diverse and inclusive as possible across all aspects of recruitment and talent retention, on and off screen"" Lime's BAME writers and directors schemes to be reviewed A Hollyoaks podcast where the black cast will share their experiences on racism with their audience Former Hollyoaks starAmanda Clapham supported Adedeji,externalon Twitter, saying she witnessed ""micro-aggressions"" towards BAME staff on the show. Clapham alleged one male black cast member was ""disproportionately told off"" for talking and messing around during filming, when a whole group of actors had been involved. Andrea Ali, who plays Celeste Faroe, supported Adedeji but praised the soap's efforts on representation. ""I am beyond blessed to be a part of a team as diverse and as inclusive as Hollyoaks,""Ali said.,external ""Celeste Faroe is a powerhouse and that representation of black women is not only one that I am proud of, but one that matters."" Last week,Hollyoaks announced it would address the Black Lives Matter movement,externalby recording a series of special podcasts about racism. At the time, actress KÃ©llÃ© Bryan said: ""We've been busy behind the scenes having lots of highly important conversations and we'll be kick-starting with a podcast all about racism - how we tackle it, how we face it and, most importantly, how we overcome it."" But in her statement, Adedeji said: ""Putting out a podcast and asking your black cast members to teach you how to tackle these issues is the bare minimum. Do better."" PM: Anti-racism protests 'subverted by thuggery' George Floyd murder suspect to appear in court On Monday's Loose Women, Bryan addressed the backlash she'd received from the podcast announcement, but said there was no bad blood between herself and Adedeji. ""Myself and Rachel have spoken and we have shared our feelings... I'm supporting her and she's reached out to me also. We'll just work through this, hopefully, internally. ""She meant no harm in her post in terms of me personally."" Hollyoaks is set to resume production in Liverpool this week, with the cast expected back on set in July.

"This video can not be played Protesters in Bristol pull down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston Lewis Hamilton has urged countries around the world to remove ""racist symbols"" after the toppling of the statue of a slave trader in Bristol. The world champion saluted anti-racism protesters for tearing down a monument to the 17th-century slave trader Edward Colston at a demonstration on Sunday. Hamilton said governments around the world should ""implement the peaceful removal of these racist symbols"". He has made a series of statements amid global anti-racism protests. Hamilton 'overcome with rage' at events in US These have occurred in a number of countries following the death of George Floyd in the US last month. Floyd, a 46-year-old African-American man, died in police custody in Minneapolis after an officer knelt on his neck for nine minutes. Hamilton said last week that he was ""completely overcome with rage"" at events following Floyd's death. And on Monday he said the Colston statue should not be recovered after demonstrators threw it into a river. ""If those people hadn't taken down that statue, honouring a racist slave trader, it would never have been removed,"" he said on Instagram. ""There's talks of it going into a museum. That man's statue should stay in the river just like the 20,000 African souls who died on the journey here and thrown into the sea, with no burial or memorial. He stole them from their families, country and he must not be celebrated!"" In a post on Twitter shortly afterwards, Hamilton made a pointed reference to US President Donald Trump's response to the protests that have swept America. The 35-year-old posted a picture of the slogan ""Black Lives Matter"" painted on the road leading to the White House and wrote: ""And don't you forget it.""

Thousands of people have flocked to the area's beaches in recent weeks,with local groups complaining about ""horrendous"" amounts of litter left behind Volunteers from clean-up group GoPladdle said they also found discarded PPE items and food wrappers at Lake Pier in Hamwothy, Poole. ""While we can commend the great effort some people went to, to disguise their faeces inside takeaway containers, yoghurt pots, towels, blankets, socks and crisp packets, we did not enjoy clearing it up,"" a spokesman for the group said, describing the job as ""stomach churning"". One benefit of viewing from your car: no huddling around artworks Pandemic-required lockdowns have prompted drive-in meals,
drive-in cinemas, even drive-in church services. And now: a drive-in art
gallery. At the weekend a car park at Germanyâs Cologne/Bonn airport
became a space for artists to display their creations, as big indoor
exhibitions have been cancelled. It is one way to support artists hit hard by the freeze on artistic events, said organiser and artist Dieter Nusbaum. ""We saw the trolleys and they have the perfect
height should you look at a painting from the car, so we were given 300
trolleys by the airport,â he said. âThe big pictures we have placed quite unorthodoxly, on
the ground. We are quite practical in that wayâ¦ we are just happy that we were
able to set it up at all."" The charge was â¬4.50 (Â£4) per car, per hour. The grounding of most flights meant the car park had plenty of free space Fifty artists displayed about 300 paintings and sculptures Jonathan MarcusBBC Diplomatic and defence correspondent Will
the world that emerges from the Covid-19 pandemic be more peaceful, or, will it
be more divided, more unstable and more open to conflict? This debate has been
raging in the pages of the worldâs leading foreign policy journal, Foreign Affairs. And the latest contribution is
decidedly pessimistic. The authors argue that there is unlikely to
be a âcoronavirus peace dividendâ. In many countries - even in some of the most
developed - the crisis has highlighted inequalities and contributed to domestic
unrest. In authoritarian states (and beyond) the technological opportunities
for monitoring have raised additional concerns about civil liberties. Social
media spreads conspiracy theories and racism as contagious as the virus itself.
Economic instability promises tensions for some years to come as nations turn
inward. There is, of course, a contrary view - that good will indeed come from
this crisis. But look around. For now the pessimists seem more realistic. Soread the article,externaland join the debate. Mark Selby says customers could be given the option of ordering food on apps in a bid to encourage people back into restaurants Restaurants and pubs across the UK have been hard-hit by lockdown measures but are now busy making plans to reopen.

A five-year-old schoolboy, who had both legs amputated as a baby, has raised more than Â£222,000 for the hospital that saved his life. Tony Hudgell, from Kent, has new prosthetic legs and crutches and aims to walk every day this month to reach his 10km (six mile) challenge. He had hoped to raise Â£500, inspired by fellow NHS fundraiserCaptain Tom Moore. His adoptive mother, Paula Hudgell, said: ""He saw Captain Tom walking with his frame in the garden, and he said 'I could do that'."" Tony had to have both his legs amputated when he was just five weeks old after suffering horrific injuries from his biological parents. He was treated at the Evelina Children's Hospital in London and had prosthetic legs fitted last year.

The traffic spike also coincided with a rise in online searches for information on symptoms like ""cough"" and âdiarrheaâ. Dr John Brownstein, who led the research, said the evidence was circumstantial, but told ABC News that it would provide important context in the search for the virus' origins. âSomething was happening in October,â said Dr Brownstein. âClearly, there was some level of social disruption taking place well before what was previously identified as the start of the novel coronavirus pandemic.â On 31 December 2019, China reported a cluster of pneumonia cases with an unknown cause to the World Health Organization. Nine days later, Chinese authorities revealed they had detected a novel coronavirus (later named Sars-CoV-2, the virus causing Covid-19) in several of the pneumonia cases. New York state Governor Andrew Cuomo has urged New Yorkers taking part in protests against the killing of George Floyd last month to get tested for the coronavirus. ""Please go get a test.

As New York city began reopening 100 days after the lockdown, Cuomo warned residents to ""stay smart"" to avoid the resurgence of coronavirus cases being seen in other US states. ""New Yorkers did what many experts told me wasn't possible in 100 days,"" Cuomo said. ""I don't think I've had a good night's sleep in 100 days knowing some of things they told me. New Yorkers bent the curve by being smart. We're celebrating, we're reopening, we're excited. Our mojo's back, our energy's back, stay smart."" Microsoft has yet to reveal the cost of the forthcoming Xbox Series X The biggest challenge facing Microsoft and Sony's next generation consoles - the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 - might not be proving the most powerful or having the best games at launch but the fallout from Covid-19. Many gamers will have less spare cash to spend. And there has been speculation that supply-chain problems caused by the pandemic will lead to manufacturing delays and higher costs. This was supposed to be the week of the giant E3 games expo, in Los Angeles, a chance to build hype for the launches. Instead, Xbox will give a first look at some games in development via a streamed event in July. Here Xbox chief Phil Spencer speaks to BBC Click about how the pandemic has affected launch plans. A cut in public funding has left the arts sector in England more exposed to the threat of Covid-19,new figures suggest. The latest Arts Index, which is published annually by the National Campaign for the Arts (NCA), showed public investment in the arts per head of the population fell by 35% in the last decade. The NCA said the sector had been ""brought to its knees"" amid the coronavirus pandemic, adding that many companies now face ""ruinous losses"". While galleries and cinemas are putting plans in place to reopen, theatres and concert venues will remain closed for the foreseeable future. The government said it had announced ""unprecedented financial aid"" for the sector and was working with it on how to reopen safely and plan for the future. The economic downturn in the US triggered by the pandemic has been officially declared a recession. The National Bureau of Economic Research made the designation on Tuesday, citing the scale and severity of the current contraction. It said activity and employment hit a ""clear"" and ""well-defined"" peak in February, before falling. The ruling puts a formal end to what had been more than a decade of expansion - the longest in US history.

Eddie Hunn, who lives in Norwich, was unable to share his milestone on Sunday with family and friends amid government guidelines on social distancing. But the centenarian received 107 cards after staff at his Chiswick House care home organised a campaign. As well as the cards, Mr Hunn also received a telegram from the Queen and an email from the High Commission of the Republic of Singapore. Mr Hunn joined the Territorial Army in 1938 as a driver mechanic before he saw action in Singapore, and spent three-and-a-half years as a prisoner of war on the Thai-Burma Railway.

Four library hubs around the Welsh capital will offer readers collection appointments for items they have pre-booked online or over the telephone. Delivery services will also be available for people who are shielding or self-isolating due to coronavirus. Books will be quarantined and cleaned before they are reused, and will not be shared between hubs. The Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) said Cardiff was the first council to restart physical lending since the lockdown began. Adam EastonWarsaw Correspondent Poland has recorded 599 new coronavirus cases on Monday, the highest daily rise in the country since the start of the pandemic. The cause of the spike has been an outbreak among coal miners in Upper Silesia. Just one coal mine, Zofiowka, run by state coking coal producer JSW, accounted for 60% of the new cases on Saturday and 34% on Sunday. On Monday, 54% of all new cases were recorded in Upper Silesia, southern Poland, home to the majority of Polandâs coal mines. In response, the government has announced that it will temporarily close 12 mines for three weeks to allow it to conduct mass testing. Poland is the biggest hard coal producer in the EU and the country generates about 50% of its electricity from hard coal. Power generation is not under threat, though, because coal stockpiles are at a very high level. Polish authorities have recorded far fewer cases and deaths than many western European countries. But in light of the latest developments, this could change. BBC OS Many countries have been easing lockdown restrictions. In England, dental practices are allowed to open again from today â but with new guidelines in place. Here are the experiences of two dentists in different parts of the world. Dr Sarveen Mannowns a small practice in London, which is preparing to reopen on 15 June, and told BBC Outside Source: ""Itâs been a bit of a rollercoaster.

Dr Jeff Cooper says getting PPE is a problem Dr Jeff Cooperis a dentist in Wisconsin, US, whose practice reopened some weeks ago. âWe donât have people in waiting rooms, they wait in cars and we call them in when necessary.

"This video can not be played Protesters in Bristol pull down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston Lewis Hamilton has urged countries around the world to remove ""racist symbols"" after the toppling of the statue of a slave trader in Bristol. The world champion saluted anti-racism protesters for tearing down a monument to the 17th-century slave trader Edward Colston at a demonstration on Sunday. Hamilton said governments around the world should ""implement the peaceful removal of these racist symbols"". He has made a series of statements amid global anti-racism protests. Hamilton 'overcome with rage' at events in US These have occurred in a number of countries following the death of George Floyd in the US last month. Floyd, a 46-year-old African-American man, died in police custody in Minneapolis after an officer knelt on his neck for nine minutes. Hamilton said last week that he was ""completely overcome with rage"" at events following Floyd's death. And on Monday he said the Colston statue should not be recovered after demonstrators threw it into a river. ""If those people hadn't taken down that statue, honouring a racist slave trader, it would never have been removed,"" he said on Instagram. ""There's talks of it going into a museum. That man's statue should stay in the river just like the 20,000 African souls who died on the journey here and thrown into the sea, with no burial or memorial. He stole them from their families, country and he must not be celebrated!"" In a post on Twitter shortly afterwards, Hamilton made a pointed reference to US President Donald Trump's response to the protests that have swept America. The 35-year-old posted a picture of the slogan ""Black Lives Matter"" painted on the road leading to the White House and wrote: ""And don't you forget it.""

"New rules requiring all people arriving in the UK to self-isolate for 14 days have come into effect. Those arriving by plane, ferry or train - including UK nationals - must give an address where they will self-isolate. Rule breakers will be fined. Home Secretary Priti Patel has said the laws were designed ""to prevent a second wave"" of coronavirus. But the boss of Ryanair has said the rules are a ""political stunt"" and are not a quarantine. Michael O'Leary told the BBC: ""You could be in Sainsbury's, you could be on the beach, you could be on the golf course in the unlikely event the Home Office calls you - all they will have is a mobile number."" He claimed even the Home Office acknowledged the rules were unenforceable. Some industries have warned they will be severely impacted by the rules, and Mr O'Leary warned of devastation. What's the chance of going on holiday? Ryanair boss's face mask claim fact-checked BA refuses to meet Home Secretary over quarantine plans Quarantine rules a 'killer blow' for travel sector Despite criticism from businesses, Ms Patel has said the measures are ""proportionate"" and being implemented ""at the right time"". People arriving in the UK should drive their own car to their destination, where possible, and once there they must not use public transport or taxis. Arrivals must not go to work, school, or public areas, or have visitors - except for essential support. They are also not allowed to go out to buy food, or other essentials, where they can rely on others. Those arriving in England, Wales and Northern Ireland could face a fine of Â£1,000 if they fail to self-isolate for the full 14 days, while they face a Â£480 finein Scotland.The maximum fine for repeat offenders in Scotland is Â£5,000. For more on the rulesclick here. Almost all travellers have to fill in a ""public health passenger locator"" form on arrival. Failure to do so could lead to a penalty of Â£100, or travellers may be refused entry. If they are unable to provide an address, the government will arrange accommodation at the traveller's expense. It says there will also be checks to see whether the rules are being followed. One airline passenger who was flying out to Germany from Stansted for work but lives in the UK, said he may have to stay overseas for longer because of the 14-day quarantine rule. He told the BBC: ""I have to consider coming back or not."" He also said the UK's quarantine rule ""makes no sense because in Germany [there is] a rate less than here and infection is more likely here in the UK than in Germany so for me it makes no sense.""

The union representing UK Border Force staff said the rules were complex and they were not fully prepared. Lucy Moreton, professional officer at the Immigration Services Union, told the BBC that technical papers explaining what to check for only arrived on Friday and were still not available to those operating on the front line. She said there 42 categories that were exempt from the quarantine rules. Ms Moreton added there was no system for checking addresses and only flagrant rule-flouters - such as using the name Mickey Mouse - would be picked up. An internal memo, seen by the BBC, told Border Force agents that the fines would not apply to passengers arriving in the UK through Ireland, who are covered by a separate set of rules. The travel industry has been vocal in its criticism of the government's quarantine rules, warning that the isolation period will deter visitors and put jobs at risk. The manufacturing industry has also highlighted that fewer flights will restrict imports and exports, which will have a knock-on effect for the freight industry, as well as hampering the recovery of some businesses. Stansted Airport encourages passengers in the departure lounge to practice social distancing and disinfects seating areas British Airways, EasyJet and Ryanair have written to Procurator General Sir Jonathan Jones, the government's most senior legal official - the first stage required when taking legal action against the government.

Travel trade body Abta has called on the government to urgently create a roadmap for restarting international travel, while the UK's biggest airport services company, Swissport, has warned it could deliver a ""killer blow"" to the tourism sector. Industry leaders wrote to Prime Minister Boris Johnsonin May asking that the government avoid taking a ""blanket approach"" to quarantine, suggesting so-called ""air bridges"" with countries that have low coronavirus rates.

It said activity and employment hit a ""clear"" and ""well-defined"" peak in February, before falling. The ruling puts a formal end to what had been more than a decade of economic expansion - the longest in US history. Meanwhile, US markets continued their rebound on Monday, as investors remained optimistic that the downturn will be short-lived. What 2008 recession can teach us about this one Coronavirus: Australia set for first recession in three decades Coronavirus could 'drag on US economy for a decade' A recession was expected after the US economy contracted 5% in the first three months of the year. Employers also reported cutting roughly 22 million jobs in March and April, as restrictions on activity intended to help control the virus forced many businesses to close. Some economists are hopeful that the job losses have now stopped, and a rebound has begun. In May, US employers added 2.5 million jobs, as states started reopening. The National Bureau of Economic Research,  a private research organisation, said it viewed the scale of the decline that started in February as more significant than its duration. ""The unprecedented magnitude of the decline in employment and production, and its broad reach across the entire economy, warrants the designation of this episode as a recession, even if it turns out to be briefer than earlier contractions,"" it said. The bureau typically defines a recession as an economic contraction that lasts ""more than a few months"". It has declared 12 recessions since 1948, the longest of which was the Great Recession, which lasted 18 months, from December 2007 to June 2009. US financial markets, which tumbled in February amid signs of the economic collapse, have been on the upswing since March, due to investor hopes that economic damage will be limited, thanks toemergency relief from Congress and the central bank.

It said it expected the US economy to contract by 6.1% and the Euro area to shrink by 9.1%.

"The UK has recorded its lowest daily rise in the number of coronavirus deaths since before lockdown on 23 March,latest government figures,externalshow. A further 55 people died after testing positive with the virus as of 17:00 BST on Sunday, taking the total to 40,597. This included no new deaths announcedin both ScotlandandNorthern Irelandfor the second consecutive day. However, there tends to be fewer deaths reported on Mondays, due to a reporting lag over the weekend. The number of new UK cases on Monday - 1,205 - is also the lowest number since the start of lockdown. Could more UK virus deaths have been prevented? Your tributes to those who have died Which regions have been worst hit? On the day lockdown began, 23 March, there was a rise of 74 deaths. The UK is only the second country - after the US - to pass the milestone of 40,000 deaths. The welcome drop in deaths being announced is encouraging news. But they come with a big caveat - there are always delays recording fatalities over the weekend. Last Monday there were just over 100 new deaths announced, but other days last week topped 300. Nonetheless, it does show that progress is being made. Two Mondays ago there were more than 120 deaths and in the week before that there were 160. During the peak of the virus there were more than 1,000 deaths a day. The challenge now will be making sure the figures stay low as restrictions are eased. Another difficulty facing the government is that, even with the extra testing in place, not all infections appear to be getting picked up. Monday's data shows there were 1,205 new infections diagnosed, but surveillance suggests the true figure may be five times higher. Some of these will be asymptomatic cases - people who do not show symptoms - but the concern remains that some people are simply not coming forward. Identifying these will be crucial to keep on top of the virus. There were no new deaths reported from London hospitals for the second day in a row. However, NHS England said it was aware of a ""small number"" of people who had died over the weekend and they would be included in figures in the next few days. In Wales,three more deaths were announced. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the House of Commons that the R number -the rate at which the virus reproduces- remained below one in every region of the country but said that while the figure was the lowest since lockdown, 55 deaths was ""55 too many"". ""So, there are encouraging trends on all of these critical measures, coronavirus is in retreat across the land, our plan is working and these downward trends mean we can proceed with our plans. But we do so putting caution and safety first,"" he said. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth called for the government to proceed with caution but said ""many now fear that the prime minister is starting to throw caution to the wind"". At the daily coronavirus briefing Mr Hancock said data was ""pointing in the right direction"" and showed ""we are winning the battle with this disease but have further to go"". He said the government was ready to take action in response to local outbreaks of the virus if the R number was seen to rise. ""This will mean, for instance, action in particular hospitals or particular care homes to make sure there is control of those outbreaks,"" he said. Mr Hancock also announced the launch of a national Covid-19 social care support taskforce, led by David Pearson, a former chief of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services. All staff and residents at 6,000 care homes for adults with disabilities in England will receive coronavirus tests, Mr Hancock said, following on from his claim on Sunday that the governmenthad hit its target of testing staff and residents homes for the over-65s. The final batches were delivered to 9,000 homes last week.

WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll On average, a total of about 1,600 people a day die of all causes in the UK. What is not known about the coronavirus deaths being reported is to what extent those deaths are in addition to that average figure, or whether they form part of it. Many of the victims are old and frail people with underlying health conditions, who therefore are at the highest risk of dying. Experts predict there will be significant overlap between the coronavirus deaths and those that would normally be expected to die. Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which counts death certificates mentioning the virus, suggests those deaths had reached more than 48,000 by 22 May.

"This video can not be played Democrats kneel in moment of silence for George Floyd US Democrats in Congress have proposed sweeping legislation to reform American police, following weeks of protests against police brutality and racism. The bill would make it easier to prosecute police for misconduct, ban chokeholds, and addresses racism. It comes as Minneapolis lawmakers vowed to disband the city's police force. The death of George Floyd at the hands of a white officer there sparked national pressure for change. However, it was unclear whether Republicans, who control the US Senate, would support the proposed Justice in Policing Act of 2020. US President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that ""the Radical Left Democrats want to Defund and Abandon our Police. Sorry, I want LAW & ORDER!"" What Trump states make of unrest Five pieces of context to understand protests Why I decided not to watch Floyd's video Timeline: From Kaepernick kneeling to NFL apology Mr Floyd's brother is expected to testify to the House of Representatives later this week in a hearing on police reform. The Justice in Policing Act of 2020 was introduced on Monday by top Democratic lawmakers House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, black senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker and members of the Congressional Black Caucus. As she unveiled the bill, Mrs Pelosi read the names of black men and women who have died at the hands of police in recent years. The bill forces federal police to use body and dashboard cameras, ban chokeholds, eliminate unannounced police raids known as ""no-knock warrants"", make it easier to hold police liable for civil rights violations and calls for federal funds to be withheld from local police forces who do not make similar reforms. ""The martyrdom of George Floyd gave the American experience a moment of national anguish, as we grieve for the black Americans killed by police brutality,"" Mrs Pelosi said. This video can not be played The history of police violence in the US ""Today, this movement of national anguish is being transformed into a movement of national action"". The bill makes lynching a federal crime, limits the sale of military weapons to the police and gives the Department of Justice the authority to investigate state and local police for evidence of department-wide bias or misconduct. It would also create a ""national police misconduct registry"" - a database of complaints against police. Some Republican leaders have said they would consider the possibility of writing their own bill, with a hearing scheduled in the Senate Judiciary committee next week. However, members of President Trump's party have been largely reticent on signalling support for legislation. In a break with his party, Republican Senator Mitt Romney on Sunday tweeted pictures of himself marching towards the White House with Christian protesters, with the caption ""Black Lives Matter."" The reform package, crafted by Democratic leaders in Congress, can be viewed as the ""official"" position of the party - at least for now. It is, in part, an effort to head off more drastic measures that some on the left, under the slogan ""defund the police"", are pushing. If the Democrats can keep their liberal ranks in line, they should be able to get the reforms passed in the House of Representatives, where they have a majority. The outlook is less certain in the Republican-controlled Senate - particularly if Donald Trump sees political advantage in trying to paint Democratic proposals as a threat to ""law and order"". While there is sure to be plenty of heated rhetoric from national politicians during a presidential election season, the real change may end up coming from local officials who are more directly accountable to the voters in municipalities that have seen the largest protests. The call to disband the police in Minneapolis, while largely symbolic at this point, could indicate that sweeping changes are very real possibility - with or without federal guidance. This could be the beginning of series of local experiments in policing reform that take very different forms in different parts of the US. VIEWPOINT:Tipping point for racially divided nation WATCH:'This is why we are protesting' TIMELINE:Recent black deaths at hands of police BACKGROUND:Five pieces of context to understand the protests CRIME AND JUSTICE:How are African Americans treated? ""Defund the police"" was a rallying cry during the latest street protests, that at times spilt into violence and looting. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio had already said he would divert money from the city's police department to social services. This video can not be played The US's history of racial inequality has paved the way for modern day police brutality ""Defunding"" advocates have for years been condemning what they describe as the aggressive militarised policing in the US. They argue that police departments' budgets should be slashed and funds diverted to social programmes to avoid unnecessary confrontation and heal the racial divide. President Donald Trump has sought to cast his expected presidential challenger, Democrat Joe Biden, as a proponent of defunding police, but Mr Biden on Monday denied that he was a supporter. ""I don't support defunding the police,""Mr Biden said in an interview,externalwith the BBC's US partner CBS. ""I support conditioning federal aid to police, based on whether or not they meet certain basic standards of decency and... are able to demonstrate they can protect the community and everybody in the community."" Entire city police departments have been disbanded before in the country: in Compton, California, in 2000, and 12 years later in Camden, New Jersey. In both cases they were replaced with bigger new forces that covered local counties. Demonstrators gathered again on Sunday in US cities including Washington DC, New York, and Los Angeles - where a local broadcaster estimated 20,000 people had rallied down Hollywood Boulevard. The protests were mostly peaceful, and security measures across the US were lifted as unrest started to ease. However, Seattle Police Department said a man drove a car into a demonstration there on Sunday night, before shooting and wounding a 27-year-old bystander. The UK also saw sizeable weekend protests in support of Black Lives Matter, with demonstrations in cities including London, Manchester, Cardiff, Leicester and Sheffield. Protesters tear down statue amid anti-racism demos Protesters in London knelt for a minute's silence before chanting ""no justice, no peace"". In Australia, tens of thousands joined anti-racism protests in Brisbane, Melbourne, Hobart, Adelaide and elsewhere, despite warnings from officials over the coronavirus. 25 May 2020 George Floyd dies after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Footage shows a white officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floydâs neck for several minutes while he is pinned to the floor. Mr Floyd is heard repeatedly saying ""I canât breathe"". He is pronounced dead later in hospital. 26 May Four officers involved in the arrest of George Floyd are fired. Protests begin as the video of the arrest is shared widely on social media. Hundreds of demonstrators take to the streets of Minneapolis and vandalise police cars and the police station with graffiti. 27 May Protests spread to other cities including Memphis and Los Angeles. In some places, like Portland, Oregon, protesters lie in the road, chanting ""I canât breathe"". Demonstrators again gather around the police station in Minneapolis where the officers involved in George Floydâs arrest were based and set fire to it. The building is evacuated and police retreat. 28 May President Trump blames the violence on a lack of leadership in Minneapolis and threatens to send in the National Guard in a tweet. Â He follows it up in a second tweet with a warning ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"". The second tweet is hidden by Twitter for ""glorifying violence"". 29 May A CNN reporter, Omar Jimenez, is arrested while covering the Minneapolis protest. Mr Jimenez was reporting live when police officers handcuffed him. A few minutes later several of his colleagues are also arrested. They are all later released once they are confirmed to be members of the media. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, 44, is charged with murder and manslaughter. The charges carry a combined maximum 35-year sentence. 31 May Violence spreads across the US on the sixth night of protests. A total of at least five people are reported killed in protests from Indianapolis to Chicago. More than 75 cities have seen protests. At least 4,400 people have been arrested. Â Curfews are imposed across the US to try to stem the unrest. 1 June President Trump threatens to send in the military to quell growing civil unrest. He says if cities and states fail to control the protests and ""defend their residents"" he will deploy the army and ""quickly solve the problem for them"". Mr Trump poses in front of a damaged church shortly after police used tear gas to disperse peaceful protesters nearby. 2 June Tens of thousands of protesters again take to the streets. One of the biggest protests is in George Floydâs hometown of Houston, Texas. Many defy curfews in several cities, but the demonstrations are largely peaceful. 4 June A memorial service for George Floyd is held in Minneapolis. Â Those gathered in tribute stand in silence for eight minutes, 46 seconds, the amount of time Mr Floyd is alleged to have been on the ground under arrest. Hundreds attended the service, which heard a eulogy from civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton. 7 June As the US saw another weekend of protests, with tens of thousands marching in Washington DC, anti-racism demonstrations were held around the world. In Australia, there were major protests in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane that focused on the treatment of indigenous Australians. There were also demonstrations in France, Germany, Spain and the UK. In Bristol, protesters tore down the statue of a 17th century slave trader and threw it into the harbour. 9 June A funeral service for George Floyd is held in Houston, Mr Floydâs home town. Just over two weeks after his death in Minneapolis and worldwide anti-racism protests, about 500 guests invited by the Floyd family are in attendance at the Fountain of Praise Church. Â Many more gather outside to show their support.

Ms Patel said the majority of demonstrators ""were peaceful"" and told them: ""I hear you."" But she echoed Prime Minister Boris Johnson's comment that the protests had been ""subverted by thuggery"" after some demonstrators clashed with police. Meanwhile, the Voice newspaper's head called for restraint from protesters. Anti-racism protests have taken place across the world, following the death ofGeorge Floyd, 46, in Minneapolis, in the US, after a white police officer was filmed kneeling on his neck. Thousands of people attended largely peaceful demonstrations across the UK over the weekend, including London, Manchester and Glasgow. Unrest in the capital on Sunday led to 35 officers being injured and 36 people being arrested for offences including violent disorder, criminal damage and assaulting police, the Metropolitan Police said on Monday. Of the officers injured, two required hospital treatment, with one suffering a head wound and the second a shoulder injury after being hit by a thrown bottle. In Bristol, police are continuing to investigate the ""criminal damage"" of a bronze statue of Edward Colston -a prominent 17th Century slave trader- which was ripped down by protesters, a move Downing Street called a ""criminal act"". The statue has been a source of controversy in Bristol for years. Thecity's mayor saidhe felt no ""sense of loss"" at the statue being pulled down. The city divided by a slave trader's legacy Torn down slave trader statue 'was an affront' Speaking in the House of Commons, Ms Patel urged people not to attend future protests, saying due to the coronavirus any large gatherings of people were ""currently unlawful"". She said 137,500 people had attended more than 200 protests across the UK over the weekend and the majority were peaceful. But she condemned a ""lawless minority of protesters"" who ""regrettably turned to violence"", adding: ""this hooliganism is utterly indefensible"". She said 135 people had been arrested in total. This video can not be played Priti Patel: ""This hooliganism is utterly indefensible, no justification for it"" She was challenged by a Labour MP Florence Eshalomi, who asked her whether she recognised the ""structural inequality, discrimination and racism"" in the UK and called on her to act. But Ms Patel said she would ""not take lectures"" from others about racism, and gave examples of the racist abuse she had personally received, including facing racial slurs in the playground and on the streets, and being advised to use her husband's surname in order to advance her career. Meanwhile, Chancellor Rishi Sunakissued a statement,externalsaying he knows racism exists in the UK, but that ""a better society doesn't happen overnight"". Mr Sunak condemned the acts of violence and added a message for the peaceful protesters: ""Whilst our progress feels slow, I promise you it is permanent."" This video can not be played Protesters in Bristol pull down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston There have beenrepeated calls in recent yearsto remove the Colston statue. Protestershave said seeingthe statue removed was ""empowering"" and it marked a ""part of a history that shouldn't be glorified"". The PM's spokesman said Mr Johnson ""absolutely understands the strength of feeling"" but if people wanted the statue removed, there are ""democratic routes"" which can be followed. Mr Johnson does not believe the UK is a racist country but accepts that discrimination is an ongoing issue, the spokesman added. He said there remains ""more to do"" and No 10 would not be ""complacent"" in its efforts to stamp out discrimination and racism ""where it happens"". Government ministers condemned the ""vandalism and desecration"" of the Churchill statue In Parliament Square in Westminster, a statue of Sir Winston Churchill was sprayed with graffiti and a Black Lives Matter sign attached to it. Met Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick condemned the ""violent criminality"" by a ""minority of protesters"" as ""disgraceful"" and said it was ""never acceptable"" to attack police officers or damage property. She said given the potential risk of coronavirus being spread at mass gatherings, people should find alternative ways to express their anger and frustration. Campaigners rename streets linked to slave owners Are you allowed to protest during lockdown? Avon and Somerset Police told the BBC 17 people have been identified in connection with the toppling of Colston's statue. No arrests have yet been made. Chief Constable Andy Marsh defended the decision taken by commanders on the ground not to intervene when the statue was torn down and dumped in the harbour. He said arresting suspects could have had ""very serious ramifications"" for the city of Bristol, including injuries to protesters, police and bystanders. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told LBC radio that the statue should not have been torn down by protesters - but added that it was wrong for the monument to have remained in place for so long. The curator of the International Slavery Museum in Liverpool, Jean Francois Manicom, said it would not be a problem for the museum to display the statue, as it was not ""afraid to face things of the past"". He told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that the UK's history of slavery was ""not only a black story"". The co-founder of UK Black Pride, Phyll Opoku-Gyimah, also suggested that children in school should be taught more about Britain's role in the slave trade. She said when people look at the how Britain benefitted from slavery, ""you cannot divorce yourself from... how what we have in this country today [is] based on the economic wealth people have received through slavery"". ""This is not about wanting people to feel guilt - because guilt serves no purpose - but this is about understanding the historical context of how colonisation have really had an impact a disproportionate impact on those who are black, Caribbean and also Asian,"" she said Protesters filled Parliament Square - where a statue of Winston Churchill was sprayed with graffiti Paulette Simpson, the director of the Voice, one of Britain's leading black newspapers, said people had a ""legitimate right"" to protest issues that have ""reached boiling point"", but urged people ""to restrain themselves"" and to try to ""contain"" their emotions. She said she did not feel the violence had ""hijacked"" the protests' message. Addressing protesters, she said: ""We know that you're angry, we know that you're in pain, we know that the you feel there's no other route to express yourself."" Paulette Simpson, director of The Voice newspaper, called for protesters to show restraint Ms Simpson questioned why the UK still has statues, symbols and names of streets ""that remind us of a very dark place in history"", and urged the government and others to ""listen"" to those who call for their removal. John Apter, national chairman of the Police Federation, said while he understood there was ""an awful lot of anger and frustration"" his ""concern and sadness"" was that the ""legitimate message"" of the protests had been ""hijacked by some who are intent on violence"" against police.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: 'I will not support those who flout the rules on social distancing' Boris Johnson has urged the country to ""work peacefully, lawfully"" to defeat racism and discrimination. Writing in the Voice,,externalthe PM said the government could not ignore the anger and ""undeniable feeling of injustice"" sparked by George Floyd's killing. But he said the cause risked being ""undermined"" by a minority who attack police and property during protests. The UK, he said, had made ""huge strides"" in tackling racism in recent decades but more had to be done. More protests are taking place on Tuesday, including in London and Oxford, with the latter focusing on calls fora statue at Oriel College of imperialist Cecil Rhodes to be taken down. Parliament holds minute's silence for George Floyd The city divided by a slave trader's legacy Torn down slave trader statue 'was an affront' Pub name rethink over slave trade link Thedeath of George Floyd, 46, in Minneapolis, in the United States, after a white police officer was filmed kneeling on his neck, triggered an international outcry and sparked days of mass protests in cities across the UK. While the demonstrations have been largely peaceful, they turned violent in London on Saturday when police officers were confronted with flares, and a statue of wartime leader Winston Churchill was vandalised. The Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has asked his officials to develop an action plan with community groups - to tackle racism, discrimination and inequality. Mr Khan said the protests that have followed the death of George Floyd should be a ""catalyst for change"".

""We who lead and who govern simply can't ignore those feelings because in too many cases, I am afraid, they will be founded on a cold reality."" While he believed the UK was a much less racist society than it was 40 years ago, the PM said he ""heard"" the Black Lives Matter protesters and accepted much more needed to be done to ensure everyone was treated equally. ""We must also frankly acknowledge that there is so much more to do - in eradicating prejudice, and creating opportunity, and the government I lead is committed to that effort.""

"This video can not be played Protesters in Bristol pull down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston Protests against the death of George Floyd, the black man who died while being restrained by a Minnesota police officer, have taken place in the UK, organised by campaign group Black Lives Matter. This is despite Home Secretary Priti Patel and Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick asking people not to go on to the streets. So are such demonstrations actually legal given the coronavirus lockdown? England now has the loosest lockdown in the UK, with no restrictions on going outside. But the rules (officially known as regulations) don't explicitly say anything about protests. However, regulation seven restricts public gatherings to no more than six people. The law defines a ""gathering"" as a meeting involving ""social interaction with each other, or to undertake any other activity"". And so that means, pretty clearly, that a protest is currently illegal along with any other activity that could increase the virus's spread. ""There's a reason that we have laws in place temporarily to say that gatherings of over six people should not happen,"" says Health Secretary Matt Hancock. Police have been trying to encourage people to follow the law and the public health message, and they can break up gatherings. Before Mr Floyd's death, this tended to mean officers directing large parties to stop and ordering people to go home - such as with thisrave in the West Midlandslast month. Officers can hand out fixed-penalty notices - a form of on-the-spot ticket - that start at Â£100 to anyone who won't follow the health regulations. They can also arrest and charge someone with an offence, potentially leading to a large fine in a magistrates' court. So taking all that together, officers have the power to break up and ticket people for being part of a protest, on coronavirus health grounds. Hundreds of people joined a protest in Cardiff Yes, but this is where it gets rather tricky because that right is often misunderstood. And the coronavirus health emergency has complicated things further. Barrister Audrey Cherryl Mogan explains the European Convention on Human Rights (in British law as the Human Rights Act) says that public bodies must respect both the right to assemble and to express one's views. But these two rights are not absolute. The government or another public body can interfere with them if it has a proper legal reason to do so. ""So it becomes a balancing exercise,"" she says. ""If what's being done is to enforce the health regulations, then you can argue that [stopping a protest] would be reasonable and proportionate."" Ms Mogan argues the police should approach these protests in the same way that officers would consider a park full of sunbathing friends. ""If we are talking about stopping a protest, there has to be a fair and just application of the law to these people."" If not, she warns, closing down a Black Lives Matter protest on coronavirus grounds could be seen as unfair and a disproportionate use of the regulations. LOCKDOWN UPDATE:What's changing, where? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters AIR TRAVELLERS:The new quarantine rules LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Chief constables today talk about their public duty to ""facilitate"" demonstrations - and say that they only turn to force - such as bringing in riot police - if they have to quell trouble. And over the first weekend in June, it was pretty clear that the police didn't want to break up peaceful Black Lives Matter demonstrations even though, on paper at least, they would breach coronavirus laws. Dame Cressida and other police chiefs had asked people not to come out and protest on the streets. She said that: ""Coming together in a gathering is not only unlawful but also, perhaps more importantly, it is putting yourself and your family at unnecessary risk and other people around you."" She said officers, if faced with large gatherings, would seek to uphold the law but would make ""a case-by-case decision"" as to what was the right thing to do. Some of the organisers of the Black Lives Matter demonstrations argued over the weekend that they were completely justified in asking people to protest. They said it was because racism - and the violence that comes with it - is like a virus that can only be combatted and defeated by taking a stand. This video can not be played Raheem Sterling: ""The only disease right now is the racism that we're fighting"" England and Manchester City striker Raheem Sterling summed up that sentiment in a BBC interview, saying:""The only disease right now is the racism that we are fighting."" So, in short, many protesters believe that it is their duty to come out and have their say - and that their decision should be recognised as a lawful and reasonable excuse to be out on the streets.

"This video can not be played The history of police violence in the US The Minneapolis ex-policeman accused of killing unarmed black man George Floyd has made his first court appearance, where his bail was set at $1.25m (Â£1m). Prosecutors cited the ""severity of the charges"" and public outrage as the reason for upping his bail from $1m. Derek Chauvin faces charges of second-degree murder and manslaughter. Three other arresting officers are charged with aiding and abetting murder. Mr Floyd's death in May led to global protests and calls for police reform. Mr Chauvin, who is white, knelt on Mr Floyd's neck for almost nine minutes while he was being arrested in Minneapolis on 25 May. He and the three other police officers have since been fired. Who are the officers charged over George Floyd's death? What Trump states make of unrest Why I decided not to watch Floyd's video Meanwhile, mourners in Houston, Texas, where Mr Floyd lived before moving to Minneapolis, have been viewing his body, publicly on display for six hours at The Fountain of Praise church. On Tuesday, a private funeral service will be held in Houston. Memorial services have already been held in Minneapolis and North Carolina, where Mr Floyd was born. It is believed a family member escorted Mr Floyd's body on a flight to Texas late on Saturday. Democratic US presidential candidate Joe Biden met privately with Mr Floyd's relatives in Houston to offer his sympathies on Monday. ""He listened, heard their pain, and shared in their woe,"" said Floyd family spokesman Benjamin Crump, who tweeted a photo of the meeting. ""That compassion meant the world to this grieving family."" Aides to the former vice-president said he would also record a video message for Tuesday's service. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Chauvin, a 19-year police veteran, did not enter a plea as he appeared via teleconference on Monday. He did not speak during the 15-minute hearing, and was handcuffed and wearing an orange jumpsuit as he sat at a small table. Judge Jeannice M Reding set a bail of $1.25m with no preconditions, or $1m with conditions that include Mr Chauvin not contacting Mr Floyd's family, surrendering his firearms and not working in law enforcement or security as he awaits trial. His lawyer did not object to the bail price. Mr Chauvin, 44, is currently being held at the Minnesota state prison in Oak Park Heights, after being transferred several times. His next court appearance is set for 29 June. He faces three separate charges: unintentional second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, for which the maximum penalties are prison terms of 40, 25 and 10 years respectively. Derek Chauvin is to appear in court by video link Further charges could be brought butit appears unlikely he will be accused of first-degree murder,externalas prosecutors would have to prove premeditation, intent and motive, the Associated Press reports. By bringing multiple charges, prosecutors give jurors a choice and increase the chances of a conviction. Minneapolis city council has voted to ban chokeholds and neck restraints by police officers, and Democrats in Congress have unveiled sweeping legislation on police reform. In France, which saw Black Lives Matter protests over the weekend, Interior Minister Christophe Castaner announced that police would no longer be allowed to use chokeholds to arrest people. France's police watchdog has revealed that there were 1,500 complaints against officers last year, half of them for alleged assaults. It is the turn of people in Houston to pay their respects Masked and gloved mourners have been filing past Mr Floyd's coffin in line with coronavirus social distancing requirements, with only 15 guests allowed in the church at a time. Mr Floyd's body is on display at the Fountain of Praise church Anti-racism protests started by Mr Floyd's death are now entering their third week in the US. Huge rallies have been held in several cities, including Washington DC, New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco. With the rallying cries ""Black Lives matter"" and ""No Justice, No Peace"", the demonstrations are among the largest US protests against racism since the 1960s. Saturday's gatherings included a protest in the Texas town of Vidor, once infamous as a stronghold of the Ku Klux Klan white supremacist group. The majority of protests have been peaceful, however episodes of looting and violence have been reported.President Donald Trump has threatened to call up troops to quash any unrest. This video can not be played The USA's history of racial inequality has paved the way for modern day police brutality Security measures were lifted across the US on Sunday as unrest started to ease. New York ended its nearly week-long curfew, and Mr Trump said he was ordering the National Guard to start withdrawing from Washington DC. VIEWPOINT:Tipping point for racially divided nation WATCH:'This is why we are protesting' TIMELINE:Recent black deaths at hands of police BACKGROUND:Five pieces of context to understand the protests CRIME AND JUSTICE:How are African Americans treated? Protesters in European cities including London and Rome also gathered to show their support for Black Lives Matter over the weekend, whileanti-racism protests in Australia were attended by tens of thousands. In the city of Bristol in the UK, protesters tore down a statue of Edward Colston, a prominent 17th Century slave trader. 25 May 2020 George Floyd dies after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Footage shows a white officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floydâs neck for several minutes while he is pinned to the floor. Mr Floyd is heard repeatedly saying ""I canât breathe"". He is pronounced dead later in hospital. 26 May Four officers involved in the arrest of George Floyd are fired. Protests begin as the video of the arrest is shared widely on social media. Hundreds of demonstrators take to the streets of Minneapolis and vandalise police cars and the police station with graffiti. 27 May Protests spread to other cities including Memphis and Los Angeles. In some places, like Portland, Oregon, protesters lie in the road, chanting ""I canât breathe"". Demonstrators again gather around the police station in Minneapolis where the officers involved in George Floydâs arrest were based and set fire to it. The building is evacuated and police retreat. 28 May President Trump blames the violence on a lack of leadership in Minneapolis and threatens to send in the National Guard in a tweet. Â He follows it up in a second tweet with a warning ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"". The second tweet is hidden by Twitter for ""glorifying violence"". 29 May A CNN reporter, Omar Jimenez, is arrested while covering the Minneapolis protest. Mr Jimenez was reporting live when police officers handcuffed him. A few minutes later several of his colleagues are also arrested. They are all later released once they are confirmed to be members of the media. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, 44, is charged with murder and manslaughter. The charges carry a combined maximum 35-year sentence. 31 May Violence spreads across the US on the sixth night of protests. A total of at least five people are reported killed in protests from Indianapolis to Chicago. More than 75 cities have seen protests. At least 4,400 people have been arrested. Â Curfews are imposed across the US to try to stem the unrest. 1 June President Trump threatens to send in the military to quell growing civil unrest. He says if cities and states fail to control the protests and ""defend their residents"" he will deploy the army and ""quickly solve the problem for them"". Mr Trump poses in front of a damaged church shortly after police used tear gas to disperse peaceful protesters nearby. 2 June Tens of thousands of protesters again take to the streets. One of the biggest protests is in George Floydâs hometown of Houston, Texas. Many defy curfews in several cities, but the demonstrations are largely peaceful. 4 June A memorial service for George Floyd is held in Minneapolis. Â Those gathered in tribute stand in silence for eight minutes, 46 seconds, the amount of time Mr Floyd is alleged to have been on the ground under arrest. Hundreds attended the service, which heard a eulogy from civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton. 7 June As the US saw another weekend of protests, with tens of thousands marching in Washington DC, anti-racism demonstrations were held around the world. In Australia, there were major protests in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane that focused on the treatment of indigenous Australians. There were also demonstrations in France, Germany, Spain and the UK. In Bristol, protesters tore down the statue of a 17th century slave trader and threw it into the harbour. 9 June A funeral service for George Floyd is held in Houston, Mr Floydâs home town. Just over two weeks after his death in Minneapolis and worldwide anti-racism protests, about 500 guests invited by the Floyd family are in attendance at the Fountain of Praise Church.

"This video can not be played What does the ease in restrictions mean for people in Northern Ireland? All non-essential retailers can reopen in Northern Ireland from Friday, Stormont's economy minister has said. Pressure had been building on Stormont ministers to name a date, as only large retailers and shops in retail parks could open from today. In the Republic of Ireland, allhigh street shops resumed businesson Monday. Diane Dodds said the executive will discuss when shopping centres can reopen later this week. Ministers met earlier and agreed to the further changes for retailers, and are due to hold a special meeting on Thursday assessing long-term strategies for helping NI to slowly return to normality. Mrs Dodds described the announcement on shops as a ""major step forward"" for the economy, but that it was time to accelerate the pace of recovery. ""It was agreed that as long as retailers can adhere to the necessary safety measures, and there is no increase in the spread of the virus by Thursday, then these shops can reopen,"" she added. Larger retailers opened in Northern Ireland on Monday ""All retailers must be able to implement measures that minimise the risk to their staff and to the people who visit their stores.""

Chief Executive of the Belfast Chamber of Commerce, Simon Hamilton, described the announcement as a ""huge step in the right direction"". ""Reopening will allow more retailers to start trading again after what has been a dark and difficult period for the sector."" It is understood ministers also discussed whether face coverings on public transport should be mandatory at their meeting on Monday, but no decision was taken. It comes as no new Covid-19 related deaths were recorded in Northern Ireland for the second day in a row. The Department of Health's death toll remains at 537. Its daily figures are mostly comprised of hospital deaths and where a patient had previously tested positive for the virus. The latest figures on the department's dashboard show six new confirmed positive cases of the virus, bringing that total to 4,802. By 29 May, government statistics agencyNisra had recorded 757 deaths, as it records all fatalities where Covid-19 was mentioned on a death certificate. Speaking at the Stormont daily press conference on Monday, First Minister Arlene Foster said she ""regrets"" that the executive has not been able to allow people to visit family indoors yet. The measure was included in step one of the Pathway to Recovery blueprint, but Mrs Foster said the science still did not permit ministers to ease this restriction. ""I hope we can move on it sooner rather than later because I know people have been waiting a long time to hear us say those words,"" said Mrs Foster. In full: The five stages of NI's plan to ease lockdown Coronavirus bubbles: Who is in yours? She added that the executive is looking atthe ""social bubble"" approach, advocated by New Zealand, which allows people to have a small, exclusive group of friends and family they can interact with while in lockdown. The executive will meet on Thursday to discuss that possibility, as well as recovery from the pandemic across all sectors, said Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill. ""If you have headroom and space to move, we as an executive have to get our priorities right,"" she said. ""Working our way out of lockdown was always going to be more complicated, but we're trying to get the balance right between family time, the economy and all those other areas."" From Monday, restrictions for some visitors entering Northern Irelandcome into force, with anyone entering from outside the Common Travel Area having to self-isolate for 14 days. The Common Travel Area covers the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. Leaving isolation prematurely could result in a fine of up to Â£1,000. The executive has warned that people's behaviour over the next few weeks will determine whether lockdown-easing steps continue, are halted, or are reversed, depending on how the R value is affected. The R-number, or reproduction number, is the average number of people that one coronavirus-infected person will pass the virus on to. Small outdoor weddings will be allowed in Northern Ireland from Monday, ministers have agreed The Department of Health said it estimated the R-number in Northern Ireland is currently between 0.7 and 0.9, enabling ministers to move ahead with lifting restrictions. It will publish the R-number every Thursday. The executive'sfive-step Pathway to Recoverydoes not include a timetable for each of the phases, but aspects of different steps will likely take effect at the same time. Measures permitted from Monday in Northern Ireland include: About 80,000 people advised to shield can go outdoors with their household; or if they live alone they can meet one person from another household Small weddings and civil partnership ceremonies permitted outdoors, with no more than 10 people present Hotels can take advance bookings, ahead of a planned reopening on 20 July Outdoor sports facilities reopen People can leave home to attend to the needs or welfare of an animal - for example to access a range of services, including dog grooming Large non-food retailers can reopen, including car showrooms, electrical shops and phone shops Ministers have stressed that people and businesses must still adhere to physical distancing rules, by staying 2m (6ft) apart.

"BP has announced plans to cut 10,000 jobs following a global slump in demand for oil because of the coronavirus crisis. The oil giant had paused redundancies during the peak of the pandemic but told staff on Monday that around 15% will leave by the end of the year. BP has not said how many jobs will be lost in the UK but it is thought the figure could be close to 2,000. Chief executive Bernard Looney blamed a drop in the oil price for the cuts. In an email to staff, he said: ""The oil price has plunged well below the level we need to turn a profit. ""We are spending much, much more than we make - I am talking millions of dollars, every day."" Countries across the globe have ordered people to stay indoors and not travel, which has caused a slump in demand for oil. As a result, the cost of oil fell to less than $20 a barrel at the peak of the crisis, less than a third of the $66 it cost at the start of the year. It has since partly recovered to around $42 a barrel. That has taken a toll on the industry, sparking warnings that30,000 UK jobscould be lost as a result of the crisis. BP employs around 15,000 people in the UK. The firm's office-based workers are expected to bear the brunt of the redundancies, which will not affect any of its retail staff. ""It was always part of the plan to make BP a leaner, faster-moving and lower carbon company,"" Mr Looney - who took over as the boss of BP in February - said in his email to staff on Monday. ""Then the COVID-19 pandemic took hold,"" he said. ""You are already aware that, beyond the clear human tragedy, there has been widespread economic fallout, along with consequences for our industry and our company."" Deirdre Michie, the chief executive of industry group Oil and Gas UK (OGUK), said the planned redundancies highlighted the ""very real and personal"" impact of the coronavirus pandemic on jobs and livelihoods. ""There is a serious risk the UK loses the skills it needs not only to meet existing energy demands from domestic resources, but also to meet the UK's climate ambitions,"" she said. The message from BP's chief executive, Bernard Looney, is that the numbers don't add up. The oil price has recovered a bit but the business is still losing money hand over fist. On top of that, Big Oil is trying to execute a big swerve towards renewables. None of the above is of any comfort to the thousands who will be pushed out of BP's doors in a matter of months. This is a sign of how precarious the job market is becoming as the crisis caused by the virus takes hold. The pain will be felt most in the senior ranks but, whatever the pay grade, each loss will be hard to bear. In April, BP said it planned to pay a $0.11 per share dividend to shareholders and in an announcement on Monday, the company said it would still make that payment later this month. Energy expert Professor David Elmes from Warwick Business School said other firms would question how much they can hand out to shareholders as a result of the crisis. ""The job losses at BP are symptomatic of the wider challenges facing the industry,"" he said. ""Coronavirus has reduced oil demand and the price per barrel has plummeted, but that has happened in a wider context of short-term and long-term decline."" ""All firms in the sector will all be looking at how they can cut costs, shift their activities to the lowest cost field, trim investment, and thinking hard about what dividend they can pay.""

Deirdre Michie, the chief executive of industry group Oil and Gas UK (OGUK), said the planned redundancies highlighted the ""very real and personal"" impact of the coronavirus pandemic on jobs and livelihoods. ""There is a serious risk the UK loses the skills it needs not only to meet existing energy demands from domestic resources, but also to meet the UK's climate ambitions,"" she said. The message from BP's chief executive, Bernard Looney, is that the numbers don't add up. The oil price has recovered a bit but the business is still losing money hand over fist. On top of that, Big Oil is trying to execute a big swerve towards renewables. None of the above is of any comfort to the thousands who will be pushed out of BP's doors in a matter of months. This is a sign of how precarious the job market is becoming as the crisis caused by the virus takes hold. The pain will be felt most in the senior ranks but, whatever the pay grade, each loss will be hard to bear. In April, BP said it planned to pay a $0.11 per share dividend to shareholders and in an announcement on Monday, the company said it would still make that payment later this month. Energy expert Professor David Elmes from Warwick Business School said other firms would question how much they can hand out to shareholders as a result of the crisis. ""The job losses at BP are symptomatic of the wider challenges facing the industry,"" he said. ""Coronavirus has reduced oil demand and the price per barrel has plummeted, but that has happened in a wider context of short-term and long-term decline."" ""All firms in the sector will all be looking at how they can cut costs, shift their activities to the lowest cost field, trim investment, and thinking hard about what dividend they can pay.""

"Protestors are calling for the statue of the British Imperialist Cecil Rhodes to be removed Campaigners protesting against the statue of imperialist Cecil Rhodes say Oxford University has ""failed to address its institutional racism"". The ""Rhodes Must Fall"" campaign, among other student groups, is demanding the university removes the statue. Protesters will demonstrate in front of the figure in the city's high street as part of the Black Lives Matter movement. Oxford University and Oriel College has been contacted by the BBC for comment. Calls to remove the Rhodes statue at Oriel College have reignited after the statue ofEdward Colston, a 17th Century slave trader, was toppled in Bristol on Sunday. Campaigners have long argued Rhodes, a 19th Century businessman and politician in southern Africa, represented white supremacy and is steeped in colonialism and racism. Oriel Collegedecided not to remove the statue in High Street in 2016and said the figure ""was a reminder of the complexity of history and of the legacies of colonialism"". Why is Cecil Rhodes such a controversial figure? In anopen letter,externalto the university's vice-chancellor, campaigners said ""none of the demands of the movement have been met...and concerns continue to be dismissed by senior members of the university"" four years since the previous protests. ""Many colleges and university institutions who have benefited from slavery and imperialism have made no attempts at reparation,"" they added. Femi Nylander, Rhodes Must Fall campaigner, said promises made to black students by the university ""around the curriculum, access and representation have never materialised"". The letter to vice-chancellor Professor Louise Richardson outlines five steps campaigners ""hope the university will agree to, in order to make upholding anti-racist values a reality"".

One benefit of viewing from your car: no huddling around artworks Pandemic-required lockdowns have prompted drive-in meals,
drive-in cinemas, even drive-in church services. And now: a drive-in art

became a space for artists to display their creations, as big indoor
exhibitions have been cancelled. It is one way to support artists hit hard by the freeze on artistic events, said organiser and artist Dieter Nusbaum. ""We saw the trolleys and they have the perfect
height should you look at a painting from the car, so we were given 300
trolleys by the airport,â he said. âThe big pictures we have placed quite unorthodoxly, on
the ground. We are quite practical in that wayâ¦ we are just happy that we were
able to set it up at all."" The charge was â¬4.50 (Â£4) per car, per hour. The grounding of most flights meant the car park had plenty of free space Fifty artists displayed about 300 paintings and sculptures Jonathan MarcusBBC Diplomatic and defence correspondent Will
the world that emerges from the Covid-19 pandemic be more peaceful, or, will it
be more divided, more unstable and more open to conflict? This debate has been
raging in the pages of the worldâs leading foreign policy journal, Foreign Affairs. And the latest contribution is
decidedly pessimistic. The authors argue that there is unlikely to
be a âcoronavirus peace dividendâ. In many countries - even in some of the most
developed - the crisis has highlighted inequalities and contributed to domestic
unrest. In authoritarian states (and beyond) the technological opportunities
for monitoring have raised additional concerns about civil liberties. Social
media spreads conspiracy theories and racism as contagious as the virus itself.
Economic instability promises tensions for some years to come as nations turn
inward. There is, of course, a contrary view - that good will indeed come from
this crisis. But look around. For now the pessimists seem more realistic. Soread the article,externaland join the debate.

The traffic spike also coincided with a rise in online searches for information on symptoms like ""cough"" and âdiarrheaâ. Dr John Brownstein, who led the research, said the evidence was circumstantial, but told ABC News that it would provide important context in the search for the virus' origins. âSomething was happening in October,â said Dr Brownstein. âClearly, there was some level of social disruption taking place well before what was previously identified as the start of the novel coronavirus pandemic.â On 31 December 2019, China reported a cluster of pneumonia cases with an unknown cause to the World Health Organization. Nine days later, Chinese authorities revealed they had detected a novel coronavirus (later named Sars-CoV-2, the virus causing Covid-19) in several of the pneumonia cases.

Microsoft has yet to reveal the cost of the forthcoming Xbox Series X The biggest challenge facing Microsoft and Sony's next generation consoles - the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 - might not be proving the most powerful or having the best games at launch but the fallout from Covid-19. Many gamers will have less spare cash to spend. And there has been speculation that supply-chain problems caused by the pandemic will lead to manufacturing delays and higher costs. This was supposed to be the week of the giant E3 games expo, in Los Angeles, a chance to build hype for the launches. Instead, Xbox will give a first look at some games in development via a streamed event in July. Here Xbox chief Phil Spencer speaks to BBC Click about how the pandemic has affected launch plans. A cut in public funding has left the arts sector in England more exposed to the threat of Covid-19,new figures suggest. The latest Arts Index, which is published annually by the National Campaign for the Arts (NCA), showed public investment in the arts per head of the population fell by 35% in the last decade. The NCA said the sector had been ""brought to its knees"" amid the coronavirus pandemic, adding that many companies now face ""ruinous losses"". While galleries and cinemas are putting plans in place to reopen, theatres and concert venues will remain closed for the foreseeable future. The government said it had announced ""unprecedented financial aid"" for the sector and was working with it on how to reopen safely and plan for the future. The economic downturn in the US triggered by the pandemic has been officially declared a recession. The National Bureau of Economic Research made the designation on Tuesday, citing the scale and severity of the current contraction. It said activity and employment hit a ""clear"" and ""well-defined"" peak in February, before falling. The ruling puts a formal end to what had been more than a decade of expansion - the longest in US history.

New York City has begun its first phase of reopening In case you're just joining us, here are some of the biggest stories from today so far.  James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News A deserted Millennium bridge in central London Lockdowns have saved more than three million lives from coronavirus in Europe, a study has estimated. The team at Imperial College London, which assessed the impact of restrictions in 11 countries in western Europe up to the beginning of May, said the ""death toll would have been huge"" without lockdown. But the team warned that only a small proportion of people had been infected and we were still only ""at the beginning of the pandemic"". Meanwhile, a separate study has argued that global lockdowns have ""saved more lives, in a shorter period of time, than ever before"".

Eddie Hunn, who lives in Norwich, was unable to share his milestone on Sunday with family and friends amid government guidelines on social distancing. But the centenarian received 107 cards after staff at his Chiswick House care home organised a campaign. As well as the cards, Mr Hunn also received a telegram from the Queen and an email from the High Commission of the Republic of Singapore. Mr Hunn joined the Territorial Army in 1938 as a driver mechanic before he saw action in Singapore, and spent three-and-a-half years as a prisoner of war on the Thai-Burma Railway. Eddie Hunn was able to see his family from a distance as he marked his birthday Library servicesare partially reopening in Cardiffto offer residents a reserve and collect book service. Four library hubs around the Welsh capital will offer readers collection appointments for items they have pre-booked online or over the telephone. Delivery services will also be available for people who are shielding or self-isolating due to coronavirus. Books will be quarantined and cleaned before they are reused, and will not be shared between hubs. The Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) said Cardiff was the first council to restart physical lending since the lockdown began. Adam EastonWarsaw Correspondent Poland has recorded 599 new coronavirus cases on Monday, the highest daily rise in the country since the start of the pandemic. The cause of the spike has been an outbreak among coal miners in Upper Silesia. Just one coal mine, Zofiowka, run by state coking coal producer JSW, accounted for 60% of the new cases on Saturday and 34% on Sunday. On Monday, 54% of all new cases were recorded in Upper Silesia, southern Poland, home to the majority of Polandâs coal mines. In response, the government has announced that it will temporarily close 12 mines for three weeks to allow it to conduct mass testing. Poland is the biggest hard coal producer in the EU and the country generates about 50% of its electricity from hard coal. Power generation is not under threat, though, because coal stockpiles are at a very high level. Polish authorities have recorded far fewer cases and deaths than many western European countries. But in light of the latest developments, this could change. BBC OS Many countries have been easing lockdown restrictions. In England, dental practices are allowed to open again from today â but with new guidelines in place. Here are the experiences of two dentists in different parts of the world. Dr Sarveen Mannowns a small practice in London, which is preparing to reopen on 15 June, and told BBC Outside Source: ""Itâs been a bit of a rollercoaster. We donated our PPE and our oxygen cylinder to the frontline so now we have to have it all back in place. Thereâs panic within the profession to get PPE."" Dr Jeff Cooper says getting PPE is a problem Dr Jeff Cooperis a dentist in Wisconsin, US, whose practice reopened some weeks ago. âWe donât have people in waiting rooms, they wait in cars and we call them in when necessary. Weâve got a real problem getting protective equipment, and masks are the worst. Our suppliers are rationing things out.â Whatâs the reaction from patients been? âPeople have been very good, but those on reception have caught some flak from patients irate about having to wear a mask. âMy choice is to tell them, âYouâd be better served elsewhereâ.â Tom EdwardsTransport Correspondent, BBC London If any more evidence was needed that transport workers are on the front line with Covid-19, it emerged today. There have been 43 deaths of transport workers from Covid-19, it was revealed at the Transport for London (TfL) board meeting. Six worked directly for TfL. Thirty-three worked for bus companies, of which 29 were bus drivers. What was also shocking was the 60 reports of people spitting at bus drivers since the lockdown began. Read more here Â© 2025 BBC.

"Catl already has a contract to supply batteries to Tesla A Chinese car battery-maker says it is ready to manufacture a product capable of powering a vehicle for 1.2 million miles (two million kilometres) across the course of a 16-year lifespan. By contrast, most automakers only offer warranties ranging from 60,000 to 150,000 miles over a three to eight-year period on their cars' batteries. Contemporary Amperex Technology has not revealed who it intends to supply. But it was previouslyreported that the battery was co-developed with Tesla,external. The latest news was revealed in an interviewCatl's chairman gave to the Bloomberg news agency,external. ""If someone places an order, we are ready to produce,"" it quoted Zeng Yuqun as saying. He added that it was set, however, to cost a 10% premium over the batteries it already supplies. The company signed a two-year deal to supply batteries for Tesla's Model 3 cars in February. Its other clients include BMW, Daimler, Honda, Toyota, Volkswagen and Volvo. Catl has grown into being the world's top-selling car battery-maker since being established in 2011 Demand for electric vehicles is growing. The European market for EVs and plug-in hybrids grew by 72% in the first three months of the year compared to the same period in 2019, representing 7% of all delivered new cars, according to research firm Canalys. By contrast, the pandemic weighed on the wider market, which as a whole saw deliveries down by 26% for the quarter. The firm said that Catl's claim was ""significant but difficult to verify"". ""It is likely to be used as a differentiator by some car-makers when there is a significant difference from one vehicle to another - dramatically affecting resale value,"" said Canalys's chief automotive analyst Chris Jones. He added that this and other factors - including the wider availability of charging points and longer driving ranges - should help tempt more motorists to make the switch to an electric car. In February, the Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told the BBC that the UK might ban sales of new petrol and diesel cars as soon as 2032, to help meet the UK's zero-carbon emission targets. The Sunday Telegraph reported yesterday that the government is considering offering drivers up to Â£6,000 to swap their existing cars for electric models next month as part of efforts to boost the UK's electric car manufacturing industry. The Nissan Leaf and Mini Electric are made locally, and Property Week has reported that Teslais also considering opening its own ""gigafactory"" car battery plant in England,external. However, Catl's own European efforts are currently focused on Germany, where it is building a factory in the eastern town of Erfurt, which is scheduled to start producing lithium-ion car batteries in 2021.

"This video can not be played Anti-racism protests on Sunday were mostly peaceful; in London there were clashes as police tried to clear Whitehall Home Secretary Priti Patel has said""justice will follow"",externalsome of the violence seen during anti-racism protests across the UK at the weekend. Ms Patel said the majority of demonstrators ""were peaceful"" and told them: ""I hear you."" But she echoed Prime Minister Boris Johnson's comment that the protests had been ""subverted by thuggery"" after some demonstrators clashed with police. Meanwhile, the Voice newspaper's head called for restraint from protesters. Anti-racism protests have taken place across the world, following the death ofGeorge Floyd, 46, in Minneapolis, in the US, after a white police officer was filmed kneeling on his neck. Thousands of people attended largely peaceful demonstrations across the UK over the weekend, including London, Manchester and Glasgow. Unrest in the capital on Sunday led to 35 officers being injured and 36 people being arrested for offences including violent disorder, criminal damage and assaulting police, the Metropolitan Police said on Monday. Of the officers injured, two required hospital treatment, with one suffering a head wound and the second a shoulder injury after being hit by a thrown bottle. In Bristol, police are continuing to investigate the ""criminal damage"" of a bronze statue of Edward Colston -a prominent 17th Century slave trader- which was ripped down by protesters, a move Downing Street called a ""criminal act"". The statue has been a source of controversy in Bristol for years. Thecity's mayor saidhe felt no ""sense of loss"" at the statue being pulled down. The city divided by a slave trader's legacy Torn down slave trader statue 'was an affront' Speaking in the House of Commons, Ms Patel urged people not to attend future protests, saying due to the coronavirus any large gatherings of people were ""currently unlawful"". She said 137,500 people had attended more than 200 protests across the UK over the weekend and the majority were peaceful. But she condemned a ""lawless minority of protesters"" who ""regrettably turned to violence"", adding: ""this hooliganism is utterly indefensible"". She said 135 people had been arrested in total. This video can not be played Priti Patel: ""This hooliganism is utterly indefensible, no justification for it"" She was challenged by a Labour MP Florence Eshalomi, who asked her whether she recognised the ""structural inequality, discrimination and racism"" in the UK and called on her to act. But Ms Patel said she would ""not take lectures"" from others about racism, and gave examples of the racist abuse she had personally received, including facing racial slurs in the playground and on the streets, and being advised to use her husband's surname in order to advance her career. Meanwhile, Chancellor Rishi Sunakissued a statement,externalsaying he knows racism exists in the UK, but that ""a better society doesn't happen overnight"". Mr Sunak condemned the acts of violence and added a message for the peaceful protesters: ""Whilst our progress feels slow, I promise you it is permanent."" This video can not be played Protesters in Bristol pull down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston There have beenrepeated calls in recent yearsto remove the Colston statue. Protestershave said seeingthe statue removed was ""empowering"" and it marked a ""part of a history that shouldn't be glorified"". The PM's spokesman said Mr Johnson ""absolutely understands the strength of feeling"" but if people wanted the statue removed, there are ""democratic routes"" which can be followed. Mr Johnson does not believe the UK is a racist country but accepts that discrimination is an ongoing issue, the spokesman added. He said there remains ""more to do"" and No 10 would not be ""complacent"" in its efforts to stamp out discrimination and racism ""where it happens"". Government ministers condemned the ""vandalism and desecration"" of the Churchill statue In Parliament Square in Westminster, a statue of Sir Winston Churchill was sprayed with graffiti and a Black Lives Matter sign attached to it. Met Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick condemned the ""violent criminality"" by a ""minority of protesters"" as ""disgraceful"" and said it was ""never acceptable"" to attack police officers or damage property. She said given the potential risk of coronavirus being spread at mass gatherings, people should find alternative ways to express their anger and frustration. Campaigners rename streets linked to slave owners Are you allowed to protest during lockdown? Avon and Somerset Police told the BBC 17 people have been identified in connection with the toppling of Colston's statue. No arrests have yet been made. Chief Constable Andy Marsh defended the decision taken by commanders on the ground not to intervene when the statue was torn down and dumped in the harbour. He said arresting suspects could have had ""very serious ramifications"" for the city of Bristol, including injuries to protesters, police and bystanders. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told LBC radio that the statue should not have been torn down by protesters - but added that it was wrong for the monument to have remained in place for so long. The curator of the International Slavery Museum in Liverpool, Jean Francois Manicom, said it would not be a problem for the museum to display the statue, as it was not ""afraid to face things of the past"". He told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that the UK's history of slavery was ""not only a black story"". The co-founder of UK Black Pride, Phyll Opoku-Gyimah, also suggested that children in school should be taught more about Britain's role in the slave trade. She said when people look at the how Britain benefitted from slavery, ""you cannot divorce yourself from... how what we have in this country today [is] based on the economic wealth people have received through slavery"". ""This is not about wanting people to feel guilt - because guilt serves no purpose - but this is about understanding the historical context of how colonisation have really had an impact a disproportionate impact on those who are black, Caribbean and also Asian,"" she said Protesters filled Parliament Square - where a statue of Winston Churchill was sprayed with graffiti Paulette Simpson, the director of the Voice, one of Britain's leading black newspapers, said people had a ""legitimate right"" to protest issues that have ""reached boiling point"", but urged people ""to restrain themselves"" and to try to ""contain"" their emotions. She said she did not feel the violence had ""hijacked"" the protests' message. Addressing protesters, she said: ""We know that you're angry, we know that you're in pain, we know that the you feel there's no other route to express yourself."" Paulette Simpson, director of The Voice newspaper, called for protesters to show restraint Ms Simpson questioned why the UK still has statues, symbols and names of streets ""that remind us of a very dark place in history"", and urged the government and others to ""listen"" to those who call for their removal. John Apter, national chairman of the Police Federation, said while he understood there was ""an awful lot of anger and frustration"" his ""concern and sadness"" was that the ""legitimate message"" of the protests had been ""hijacked by some who are intent on violence"" against police.

"BP has announced plans to cut 10,000 jobs following a global slump in demand for oil because of the coronavirus crisis. The oil giant had paused redundancies during the peak of the pandemic but told staff on Monday that around 15% will leave by the end of the year. BP has not said how many jobs will be lost in the UK but it is thought the figure could be close to 2,000. Chief executive Bernard Looney blamed a drop in the oil price for the cuts. In an email to staff, he said: ""The oil price has plunged well below the level we need to turn a profit. ""We are spending much, much more than we make - I am talking millions of dollars, every day."" Countries across the globe have ordered people to stay indoors and not travel, which has caused a slump in demand for oil. As a result, the cost of oil fell to less than $20 a barrel at the peak of the crisis, less than a third of the $66 it cost at the start of the year. It has since partly recovered to around $42 a barrel. That has taken a toll on the industry, sparking warnings that30,000 UK jobscould be lost as a result of the crisis. BP employs around 15,000 people in the UK. The firm's office-based workers are expected to bear the brunt of the redundancies, which will not affect any of its retail staff. ""It was always part of the plan to make BP a leaner, faster-moving and lower carbon company,"" Mr Looney - who took over as the boss of BP in February - said in his email to staff on Monday. ""Then the COVID-19 pandemic took hold,"" he said. ""You are already aware that, beyond the clear human tragedy, there has been widespread economic fallout, along with consequences for our industry and our company."" Deirdre Michie, the chief executive of industry group Oil and Gas UK (OGUK), said the planned redundancies highlighted the ""very real and personal"" impact of the coronavirus pandemic on jobs and livelihoods. ""There is a serious risk the UK loses the skills it needs not only to meet existing energy demands from domestic resources, but also to meet the UK's climate ambitions,"" she said. The message from BP's chief executive, Bernard Looney, is that the numbers don't add up. The oil price has recovered a bit but the business is still losing money hand over fist. On top of that, Big Oil is trying to execute a big swerve towards renewables. None of the above is of any comfort to the thousands who will be pushed out of BP's doors in a matter of months. This is a sign of how precarious the job market is becoming as the crisis caused by the virus takes hold. The pain will be felt most in the senior ranks but, whatever the pay grade, each loss will be hard to bear. In April, BP said it planned to pay a $0.11 per share dividend to shareholders and in an announcement on Monday, the company said it would still make that payment later this month. Energy expert Professor David Elmes from Warwick Business School said other firms would question how much they can hand out to shareholders as a result of the crisis. ""The job losses at BP are symptomatic of the wider challenges facing the industry,"" he said. ""Coronavirus has reduced oil demand and the price per barrel has plummeted, but that has happened in a wider context of short-term and long-term decline."" ""All firms in the sector will all be looking at how they can cut costs, shift their activities to the lowest cost field, trim investment, and thinking hard about what dividend they can pay.""

"The CrossFit fitness regimen was developed by Greg Glassman Fitness brands including Reebok have cut ties with CrossFit after the company's CEO posted a tweet making light of George Floyd's death. In reply to a public health body saying racism was a public health issue, Greg Glassman tweeted: ""FLOYD-19."" He also called an affiliate ""delusional"" for questioning why CrossFit had been silent on the killing of Floyd by police in Minneapolis. Mr Glassman has now apologised, saying CrossFit ""will not stand for racism"". He said he had been trying to make a point about lockdowns that have been put in place to try to contain the spread of the coronavirus. CrossFit is a company based on a fitness regimen developed by Mr Glassman, and is incorporated into gyms across the world. These gyms are run on an affiliate model, paying the main CrossFit company for permission to use the name and regimen. It began when the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington tweeted that ""racism is a public health issue"". In response, Mr Glassman tweeted ""FLOYD-19"" - a play on Covid-19, the name of the disease caused by the coronavirus. George Floyd died while under police custody in Minneapolis Mr Glassman also came under fire for an email he reportedly sent to an affiliate who asked for a response from the company on anti-racist protests across the US. ""I sincerely believe the quarantine has adversely impacted your mental health,"" he reportedly wrote to the woman, before calling her ""delusional"". ""You think you're more virtuous than we are. It's disgusting."" Since Mr Glassman's tweet about George Floyd, hundreds of affiliate gyms have removed CrossFit from their branding. A spreadsheet tracking all of the gyms that are rebranding currently lists 227 fitness centres distancing themselves from CrossFit. One of these gyms, Petworth Fitness in Washington DC - formerly CrossFit Petworth - wrote on Instagram: ""For a brand that has preached about being 'for all', the deafening silence on current and past issues of racism tells us all we need to know."" It added that it would donate its annual affiliate fee - $3,000 (Â£2,364) - to the Black Lives Matter DC and Know Your Rights anti-racist campaign groups. Minneapolis council pledges to dismantle police Five pieces of context to understand the US protests Why I decided not to watch the George Floyd video Adidas AG, which owns Reebok, also issued a statement confirming it was ending its relationship with CrossFit. ""Recently, we have been in discussions regarding a new agreement, however, in light of recent events, we have made the decision to end our partnership with CrossFit HQ,"" the company said in a statement to AFP news agency. Several CrossFit athletes also criticised the company. Four-time CrossFit Games champion Matthew Fraser praised a colleague for disaffiliating from the company, while Olympian and three-time CrossFit Games champion Tia-Clair Toomey said she was ""incredibly saddened, disappointed and frustrated"" with Mr Glassman's comments.

""I, CrossFit HQ, and the CrossFit community will not stand for racism. I made a mistake by the words I chose yesterday,"" he said. ""My heart is deeply saddened by the pain it has caused. It was a mistake, not racist but a mistake. ""Floyd is a hero in the black community and not just a victim. I should have been sensitive to that and wasn't. I apologise for that. ""I was trying to stick it to the @IHME_UW [Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation] for their invalidated models resulting in needless, economy-wrecking, life-wrecking lockdown, and when I saw they were announcing modelling a solution to our racial crisis, I was incredulous, angry, and overly emotional.

"The UK has recorded its lowest daily rise in the number of coronavirus deaths since before lockdown on 23 March,latest government figures,externalshow. A further 55 people died after testing positive with the virus as of 17:00 BST on Sunday, taking the total to 40,597. This included no new deaths announcedin both ScotlandandNorthern Irelandfor the second consecutive day. However, there tends to be fewer deaths reported on Mondays, due to a reporting lag over the weekend. The number of new UK cases on Monday - 1,205 - is also the lowest number since the start of lockdown. Could more UK virus deaths have been prevented? Your tributes to those who have died Which regions have been worst hit? On the day lockdown began, 23 March, there was a rise of 74 deaths. The UK is only the second country - after the US - to pass the milestone of 40,000 deaths. The welcome drop in deaths being announced is encouraging news. But they come with a big caveat - there are always delays recording fatalities over the weekend. Last Monday there were just over 100 new deaths announced, but other days last week topped 300. Nonetheless, it does show that progress is being made. Two Mondays ago there were more than 120 deaths and in the week before that there were 160. During the peak of the virus there were more than 1,000 deaths a day. The challenge now will be making sure the figures stay low as restrictions are eased. Another difficulty facing the government is that, even with the extra testing in place, not all infections appear to be getting picked up. Monday's data shows there were 1,205 new infections diagnosed, but surveillance suggests the true figure may be five times higher. Some of these will be asymptomatic cases - people who do not show symptoms - but the concern remains that some people are simply not coming forward. Identifying these will be crucial to keep on top of the virus. There were no new deaths reported from London hospitals for the second day in a row. However, NHS England said it was aware of a ""small number"" of people who had died over the weekend and they would be included in figures in the next few days. In Wales,three more deaths were announced. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the House of Commons that the R number -the rate at which the virus reproduces- remained below one in every region of the country but said that while the figure was the lowest since lockdown, 55 deaths was ""55 too many"". ""So, there are encouraging trends on all of these critical measures, coronavirus is in retreat across the land, our plan is working and these downward trends mean we can proceed with our plans. But we do so putting caution and safety first,"" he said. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth called for the government to proceed with caution but said ""many now fear that the prime minister is starting to throw caution to the wind"". At the daily coronavirus briefing Mr Hancock said data was ""pointing in the right direction"" and showed ""we are winning the battle with this disease but have further to go"". He said the government was ready to take action in response to local outbreaks of the virus if the R number was seen to rise. ""This will mean, for instance, action in particular hospitals or particular care homes to make sure there is control of those outbreaks,"" he said. Mr Hancock also announced the launch of a national Covid-19 social care support taskforce, led by David Pearson, a former chief of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services. All staff and residents at 6,000 care homes for adults with disabilities in England will receive coronavirus tests, Mr Hancock said, following on from his claim on Sunday that the governmenthad hit its target of testing staff and residents homes for the over-65s. The final batches were delivered to 9,000 homes last week. The health secretary also denied there was a trade-off between the economy and health, amid reports the government is considering further easing measures, and said a ""second spike would be hugely damaging to the economy"". FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? YOUR QUESTIONS:Our experts have answers LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? VACCINE:How close are we to finding one? WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll On average, a total of about 1,600 people a day die of all causes in the UK. What is not known about the coronavirus deaths being reported is to what extent those deaths are in addition to that average figure, or whether they form part of it. Many of the victims are old and frail people with underlying health conditions, who therefore are at the highest risk of dying. Experts predict there will be significant overlap between the coronavirus deaths and those that would normally be expected to die. Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which counts death certificates mentioning the virus, suggests those deaths had reached more than 48,000 by 22 May.

the world that emerges from the Covid-19 pandemic be more peaceful, or, will it
be more divided, more unstable and more open to conflict? This debate has been
raging in the pages of the worldâs leading foreign policy journal, Foreign Affairs. And the latest contribution is
decidedly pessimistic. The authors argue that there is unlikely to
be a âcoronavirus peace dividendâ. In many countries - even in some of the most
developed - the crisis has highlighted inequalities and contributed to domestic
unrest. In authoritarian states (and beyond) the technological opportunities
for monitoring have raised additional concerns about civil liberties. Social
media spreads conspiracy theories and racism as contagious as the virus itself.
Economic instability promises tensions for some years to come as nations turn
inward. There is, of course, a contrary view - that good will indeed come from
this crisis. But look around. For now the pessimists seem more realistic. Soread the article,externaland join the debate.

Microsoft has yet to reveal the cost of the forthcoming Xbox Series X The biggest challenge facing Microsoft and Sony's next generation consoles - the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 - might not be proving the most powerful or having the best games at launch but the fallout from Covid-19.

But the centenarian received 107 cards after staff at his Chiswick House care home organised a campaign. As well as the cards, Mr Hunn also received a telegram from the Queen and an email from the High Commission of the Republic of Singapore.

Adam EastonWarsaw Correspondent Poland has recorded 599 new coronavirus cases on Monday, the highest daily rise in the country since the start of the pandemic. The cause of the spike has been an outbreak among coal miners in Upper Silesia. Just one coal mine, Zofiowka, run by state coking coal producer JSW, accounted for 60% of the new cases on Saturday and 34% on Sunday. On Monday, 54% of all new cases were recorded in Upper Silesia, southern Poland, home to the majority of Polandâs coal mines. In response, the government has announced that it will temporarily close 12 mines for three weeks to allow it to conduct mass testing. Poland is the biggest hard coal producer in the EU and the country generates about 50% of its electricity from hard coal. Power generation is not under threat, though, because coal stockpiles are at a very high level. Polish authorities have recorded far fewer cases and deaths than many western European countries.

""More than six months into this pandemic, this is not the time for any country to take its foot off the pedal,"" WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in Geneva.

A museum in the UK has reimagined how some of the subjects in its paintings would be protecting themselves during lockdown. The Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge has released a Masterpieces 2020 Edition,featuring five well-known portraits with added protective masks. The editions are being sold as cards to support the museum during its closure.

Thousands of people have flocked to the area's beaches in recent weeks,with local groups complaining about ""horrendous"" amounts of litter left behind Volunteers from clean-up group GoPladdle said they also found discarded PPE items and food wrappers at Lake Pier in Hamwothy, Poole. ""While we can commend the great effort some people went to, to disguise their faeces inside takeaway containers, yoghurt pots, towels, blankets, socks and crisp packets, we did not enjoy clearing it up,"" a spokesman for the group said, describing the job as ""stomach churning"". One benefit of viewing from your car: no huddling around artworks Pandemic-required lockdowns have prompted drive-in meals,
drive-in cinemas, even drive-in church services. And now: a drive-in art
gallery. At the weekend a car park at Germanyâs Cologne/Bonn airport
became a space for artists to display their creations, as big indoor
exhibitions have been cancelled. It is one way to support artists hit hard by the freeze on artistic events, said organiser and artist Dieter Nusbaum. ""We saw the trolleys and they have the perfect
height should you look at a painting from the car, so we were given 300
trolleys by the airport,â he said. âThe big pictures we have placed quite unorthodoxly, on
the ground. We are quite practical in that wayâ¦ we are just happy that we were
able to set it up at all."" The charge was â¬4.50 (Â£4) per car, per hour. The grounding of most flights meant the car park had plenty of free space Fifty artists displayed about 300 paintings and sculptures Jonathan MarcusBBC Diplomatic and defence correspondent Will
the world that emerges from the Covid-19 pandemic be more peaceful, or, will it
be more divided, more unstable and more open to conflict? This debate has been
raging in the pages of the worldâs leading foreign policy journal, Foreign Affairs. And the latest contribution is
decidedly pessimistic. The authors argue that there is unlikely to
be a âcoronavirus peace dividendâ. In many countries - even in some of the most
developed - the crisis has highlighted inequalities and contributed to domestic
unrest. In authoritarian states (and beyond) the technological opportunities
for monitoring have raised additional concerns about civil liberties. Social
media spreads conspiracy theories and racism as contagious as the virus itself.
Economic instability promises tensions for some years to come as nations turn
inward. There is, of course, a contrary view - that good will indeed come from
this crisis. But look around. For now the pessimists seem more realistic. Soread the article,externaland join the debate.

A five-year-old schoolboy, who had both legs amputated as a baby, has raised more than Â£222,000 for the hospital that saved his life. Tony Hudgell, from Kent, has new prosthetic legs and crutches and aims to walk every day this month to reach his 10km (six mile) challenge. He had hoped to raise Â£500, inspired by fellow NHS fundraiserCaptain Tom Moore. His adoptive mother, Paula Hudgell, said: ""He saw Captain Tom walking with his frame in the garden, and he said 'I could do that'.""

The traffic spike also coincided with a rise in online searches for information on symptoms like ""cough"" and âdiarrheaâ. Dr John Brownstein, who led the research, said the evidence was circumstantial, but told ABC News that it would provide important context in the search for the virus' origins. âSomething was happening in October,â said Dr Brownstein. âClearly, there was some level of social disruption taking place well before what was previously identified as the start of the novel coronavirus pandemic.â On 31 December 2019, China reported a cluster of pneumonia cases with an unknown cause to the World Health Organization. Nine days later, Chinese authorities revealed they had detected a novel coronavirus (later named Sars-CoV-2, the virus causing Covid-19) in several of the pneumonia cases.

Microsoft has yet to reveal the cost of the forthcoming Xbox Series X The biggest challenge facing Microsoft and Sony's next generation consoles - the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 - might not be proving the most powerful or having the best games at launch but the fallout from Covid-19.

A cut in public funding has left the arts sector in England more exposed to the threat of Covid-19,new figures suggest. The latest Arts Index, which is published annually by the National Campaign for the Arts (NCA), showed public investment in the arts per head of the population fell by 35% in the last decade. The NCA said the sector had been ""brought to its knees"" amid the coronavirus pandemic, adding that many companies now face ""ruinous losses"". While galleries and cinemas are putting plans in place to reopen, theatres and concert venues will remain closed for the foreseeable future. The government said it had announced ""unprecedented financial aid"" for the sector and was working with it on how to reopen safely and plan for the future. The economic downturn in the US triggered by the pandemic has been officially declared a recession. The National Bureau of Economic Research made the designation on Tuesday, citing the scale and severity of the current contraction.

The Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) said Cardiff was the first council to restart physical lending since the lockdown began. Adam EastonWarsaw Correspondent Poland has recorded 599 new coronavirus cases on Monday, the highest daily rise in the country since the start of the pandemic. The cause of the spike has been an outbreak among coal miners in Upper Silesia. Just one coal mine, Zofiowka, run by state coking coal producer JSW, accounted for 60% of the new cases on Saturday and 34% on Sunday. On Monday, 54% of all new cases were recorded in Upper Silesia, southern Poland, home to the majority of Polandâs coal mines. In response, the government has announced that it will temporarily close 12 mines for three weeks to allow it to conduct mass testing. Poland is the biggest hard coal producer in the EU and the country generates about 50% of its electricity from hard coal. Power generation is not under threat, though, because coal stockpiles are at a very high level. Polish authorities have recorded far fewer cases and deaths than many western European countries. But in light of the latest developments, this could change. BBC OS Many countries have been easing lockdown restrictions.

"Catl already has a contract to supply batteries to Tesla A Chinese car battery-maker says it is ready to manufacture a product capable of powering a vehicle for 1.2 million miles (two million kilometres) across the course of a 16-year lifespan. By contrast, most automakers only offer warranties ranging from 60,000 to 150,000 miles over a three to eight-year period on their cars' batteries. Contemporary Amperex Technology has not revealed who it intends to supply. But it was previouslyreported that the battery was co-developed with Tesla,external. The latest news was revealed in an interviewCatl's chairman gave to the Bloomberg news agency,external. ""If someone places an order, we are ready to produce,"" it quoted Zeng Yuqun as saying. He added that it was set, however, to cost a 10% premium over the batteries it already supplies. The company signed a two-year deal to supply batteries for Tesla's Model 3 cars in February. Its other clients include BMW, Daimler, Honda, Toyota, Volkswagen and Volvo. Catl has grown into being the world's top-selling car battery-maker since being established in 2011 Demand for electric vehicles is growing. The European market for EVs and plug-in hybrids grew by 72% in the first three months of the year compared to the same period in 2019, representing 7% of all delivered new cars, according to research firm Canalys. By contrast, the pandemic weighed on the wider market, which as a whole saw deliveries down by 26% for the quarter. The firm said that Catl's claim was ""significant but difficult to verify"". ""It is likely to be used as a differentiator by some car-makers when there is a significant difference from one vehicle to another - dramatically affecting resale value,"" said Canalys's chief automotive analyst Chris Jones. He added that this and other factors - including the wider availability of charging points and longer driving ranges - should help tempt more motorists to make the switch to an electric car. In February, the Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told the BBC that the UK might ban sales of new petrol and diesel cars as soon as 2032, to help meet the UK's zero-carbon emission targets. The Sunday Telegraph reported yesterday that the government is considering offering drivers up to Â£6,000 to swap their existing cars for electric models next month as part of efforts to boost the UK's electric car manufacturing industry. The Nissan Leaf and Mini Electric are made locally, and Property Week has reported that Teslais also considering opening its own ""gigafactory"" car battery plant in England,external. However, Catl's own European efforts are currently focused on Germany, where it is building a factory in the eastern town of Erfurt, which is scheduled to start producing lithium-ion car batteries in 2021.

"The statue of Edward Colston in Bristol ""is a constant reminder of his inhumanity"", says poet Miles Chambers This article was first published in February 2018 Bristol's fame and wealth were built on the slave trade and few slave traders were more infamous or wealthy than Edward Colston. Almost 300 years since his death, his past is set to be formally acknowledged by the city for the first time. But does this go far enough? Colston made his fortune through human suffering. Between 1672 and 1689,ships,externalare believed to have transported about 80,000 men, women and children from Africa to the Americas. However, in the city he called home, his memory has been honoured for centuries. On his death in 1721, hebequeathed his wealth to charitiesand his legacy can still be seen on Bristol's streets, memorials and buildings. His statue, which stands on Colston Avenue in the city centre, makes no mention of his notorious past. But this could be about to change. The city council is proposing to put a plaque on the statue which will recognise and acknowledge the people Colston and others in the city enslaved. It's a move that has been a long time coming, says Ros Martin, one of the driving forces behind the Countering Colston campaign group. ""The plaque is good but we need it to be part of an ongoing examination of historical narrative and a change of attitudes and culture. ""What we want goes beyond tokenism - we want institutions and organisations in the city to examine their history and acknowledge their individual roles in the slave trade and beyond."" The statue of the slave trader and philanthropist was erected in 1895 The drive to reconsider Bristol's attitude to Colston has long been gathering momentum. For years Massive Attackrefused to play,externalat hometown venue Colston Hall, which last yearagreed to drop the slave trader's name. Not before time, says Miles Chambers, the city's poet laureate. ""Some people don't get that black people still feel the full impact of slavery today. ""We can look at the descendants of the slaves and economically they are still worse off; psychologically they are still worse off; mentally they still feel collectively as inferior; more African-Caribbean males are disproportionately in prison and in the judicial system; they do worse at schools; economically are paid less and are working less. ""The pattern continues and even though many people say slavery is over, because of those legacies we still feel enslaved. ""A name change or statue move is not going to rectify racism or eradicate the slave mentality that still exists, but it will help to say to black people: 'You are equal to us, you are British, you are valuable and you mean as much to us as any other citizen.'"" Captains were instructed to buy as many slaves as the ship could ""conveniently carry"" In 1680 Colston became a member of theRoyal African Company,externalwhich at the time had a monopoly on the slave trade. By 1689 he had risen to become its deputy governor. Slaves bought in West Africa were branded with the company initials RAC, then herded on to ships and plunged into a nightmarish voyage. Closely shackled together, hundreds of enslaved people lay in their own filth; disease, suicide and murder claimed between 10 and 20 per cent of them during the six to eight week voyage to the Americas. Human suffering on this scale made Colston rich and a grateful Bristol honoured his benevolence; naming dozens of buildings, institutions, charities, schools, sports clubs, pubs, societies and roads after him. His charity iscommemorated,externalduring processions and church services. School children have paid homage to him at services. His statue stands in the city centre, inscribed as a ""memorial of one of the most virtuous and wise sons of the city"". For hundreds of years, he has been unquestionably venerated. ""Colston may have helped more people than he abused but the people he abused and their descendants say this is unacceptable and although they are a minority, something needs to be done about it,"" says Mr Chambers. ""We are still seeing the effects of slavery in this city, there is still money from slavery in this city and so we can't ignore it."" Ros Martin says tourists wonder why so many buildings and roads are named after Colston There have been questions about Colston and his profile in Bristolsince the 1920s,externalbut they remained largely ignored until 1999 when Prof Madge Dresser, at the University of West England, spoke about Colston and his involvement in the slave trade. The next morning, ""Slave Trader"" was scrawled across his statue. The graffiti was scrubbed off and the city went back to turning a blind eye until two years ago, when Countering Colston ignited the debate once again. It has staged protests outside many events linked to Colston and called for the city to remember, among other things, the ""full, true history of transatlantic slavery, colonialism and exploitation"". ""When you come to Bristol you go around the streets and, for anyone outside coming in, they must think 'Who is this man?' and 'Why are so many buildings, roads and schools named after him?',"" says Ms Martin. ""I think it's very disingenuous, very disrespecting of the memory of African ancestors who contributed to the wealth of the city through enslaved labour. They suffered and there is not enough recognition in any way. ""[Countering Colston] would like to see permanent public art works as a memorial to the victims of the city's human trafficking into enslavement. ""I would like all those institutions that played a role in this business of transatlantic inhumanity to provide public exhibitions of their involvement and a monument to those who suffered in their institution."" As head girl, Jane Ghosh's had to lay a wreath on Colston's tomb on Commemoration Day Countering Colston's work is beginning to make its mark. After Colston Hall announced it was severing any connection with the slave trader, others swiftly followed. For the first time in centuries, a controversial church service in his name wasdropped last year,external; the custodians of St Stephen's citing a ""growing concern"" about a man who made his money from buying and selling people. However, for some the campaign is simply going too far. ""We all knew what he'd done but it wasn't spoken about,"" says Jane Ghosh, a former head girl of Colston Girls school. Founded in 1891 with an endowment left in his will, the school has steadfastlyrefused to drop his name. During her school days, Ms Ghosh took part in many Charter Day ceremonies to commemorate the school's founder. As head girl, she joined the procession through the city to placed a wreath on his tomb, while Colston buns - created by and named after the merchant -  werehanded out during the service,external. ""I'm not an apologist [for slavery] but I am a realist,"" she continues. ""So many families, so many buildings in Bristol are connected to the slave trade and one of the reasons I get a bit cross is because I think, 'Why are we picking on Colston?' ""So many people were a mixture of good and bad - as we all are - and he seems to be singled out and I don't know why."" Francis Greenacre standing outside Colston Almshouses - built in 1796 with Colston's money to provide homes for the poor Between 1698 and 1807just over 2,100 Bristol ships set sail on slaving voyageswith many of the earliest voyages funded by ordinary people who provided cash or goods to be bartered for captured slaves. That Colston's name has not disappeared with time is testament to his membership of an influential and selective group of Bristol businessmen. TheSociety of Merchant Venturers,externalhelped set up and run many of the institutions and charities that still bear his name. Former museum curator and society member Francis Greenacre says the achievements of a man who did so much for charity have now been overshadowed by the debate about his name. ""His status was extraordinary... the extent of his charity was vast in Bristol and enormous in London, as it was throughout the country."" His wealth also founded schools and almshouses for the poor and he entrusted the society to carry on his work. Today, the Merchant Venturers run nine schools in Bristol, are involved in social enterprise, charities looking after the elderly, scholarships and trusts. However, controversial ceremonies are still reported to exist including aSilent Toast to Colston,externalduring theGrateful Society's,externalannual dinner. Standing outside Colston Tower, Jasmine Ketibuah-Foley says she is ""uncomfortable"" that a slave trader's name is ""celebrated"" Campaigners accuse the society of continuing to""celebrate a slave trader"".,externalMr Greenacre says the society is commemorating Colston's charity work, rather than his slaving past. ""That word [celebrate] comes from Countering Colston - it is in no sense what is being done,"" he says. ""We are not celebrating the slave trade; that is a perception which is in effect deeply offensive."" However, he acknowledges that times have changed and society must change as well, referring to the council's decision to acknowledge Colston's past. ""Someone walking past his statue, which makes no reference to the slave trade; if they are a descendant of enslaved Africans they may feel genuinely offended; indeed some feel not just hurt but real anguish and that ought to be addressed."" Colston's statue is a ""memorial [to] one of the most virtuous and wise sons of the city"" For some, the amendment to Colston's statue is not enough. ""I would really like it if the statue was put in the museum,"" says Jasmine Ketibuah-Foley, a presenter for community station Ujima Radio, which focuses on Bristol's African-Caribbean population. ""People can still see that this is a man who did a lot for Bristol, but we should put [a statue] in the city centre of ablack Bristolian who has changed Bristol and done something good for Bristol."" Others think saving Colston's legacy is not even as simple as moving a statue or changing the name of buildings, roads and schools. When he heard the concert venue would be dropping the name, history graduate Max Barton set up a petition against the move which attracted 5,000 signatures. He said it was ""time to educate and not eliminate"" people about the slave trader and his history. Max Barton says some people in Bristol see Colston as a figurehead of the city ""White, working-class Bristolians have grown up with Colston as a kind of father of Bristol,"" he says. ""They see him as a figurehead, they see him as this person who was a great charitable philanthropist - wiping out that history would alienate this group. ""Countering Colston has a list of places associated with Colston on their website - a hit list as far as I'm concerned... they want to eliminate him from history and that will alienate people."" Bristol is not alone in trying to come to terms with its past. FromOxfordtoCharlottesville, fromSydneytoCape Town, cities are facing the same question - how do you remember history without celebrating brutality? Historian Dr Edson Burton is reluctant to see Colston's name disappear but believes Bristol is similar to many cities in being ""built on a romanticised myth"". He says now we are in a position to question ""the great figures that we have venerated in the past"", we should not be surprised to ""find that they are not up to the mark for our modern standards"". Dr Edson Burton standing outside Bristol Cathedral, which has a huge stained glass window dedicated to Colston ""I see that there are a number of institutions willing to look their history in the eye and acknowledge that there is a question about the legacy and foundation on which they were built. ""I think that is a monumental step - my concern is that it is not sufficient enough."" He is one of many in the city searching for a solution. At the vanguard of change, in more ways than one, is Colston Primary School, whichannounced last year it would be changing its name. Kate Swainson Price said the decision to change the school's name is not about eradicating history Chair of governors Kate Swainson Price said the decision was not about pandering to political correctness. ""For me, the decision to change our school name is about a recontextualisation of history rather than eradication, obliteration or whitewashing. ""It's making history, not erasing history. Facts don't change but attitudes and values do, as do societies."" The school is now at the centre of plans to design the new plaque on Colston's statue, which will recognise and acknowledge the people he and others in the city enslaved. The children will be joining Countering Colston members, Prof Dresser and the city council to help put Colston's legacy into context. Ms Swainson Price said it was ""amazing and appropriate"" for the children to ""to help review and redress the balance about how we remember and acknowledge Bristol's historical figures"" and ""importantly, the slaves themselves"". The current plaque makes no mention of the thousands of people he enslaved The man in charge of the project, the council's historic environment officer Pete Insole, said the people who were exploited by Colston are ""invisible"" in Bristol. He is helping to co-ordinate events during the summer about the city's links to the slave trade, which will culminate in the unveiling of the plaque. ""Slave traders are the most commemorated people in the city; we can't change the past but we can change the present and the future,"" he added. But for Ms Martin this is only the beginning: ""We have created debate... It's not just Bristol, it's a global narrative, it's about colonisation and decolonisation. ""Across Europe and across America the debate is very alive. We are questioning people and we are challenging society. ""You are only here for a short time on Earth and I like to think we are bequeathing something better than we have inherited.""

"This video can not be played Protesters in Bristol pull down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston The name Edward Colston looms large over Bristol, with streets and buildings named after the 17th Century merchant and slave trader. On Sunday, protesters at an anti-racism demonstration in the city toppled a statue of Colston and dumped it in Bristol Harbour. The BBC's Jack Grey witnessed the statue's fall. Thousands of people attended the demonstration in Bristol,one of many in the UKsparked by the death of George Floyd while he was under arrest in Minneapolis in the United States last month. A group of protesters surrounded the statue on Colston Avenue, erected in honour of a man whose ships sent about 80,000 men, women and children from Africa to the Americas between 1672 and 1689. Colston's memory has divided the city for years, with some thinking history can't be changed and others campaigning successfully for his name to be erased from streets, schools and venues. The statue in Colston Avenue was erected in 1895 There was clear frustration in Sunday's crowd, partly because the statue still stood in 2020, but also because it had simply been covered for the protest. The canvas covering, which had already been targeted by egg-throwers, was torn off with some people saying they wanted to look the man in the eyes. Soon ropes had been tied round the bronze monument and the process of removing it began. Once the covering was removed, three protestors climbed atop the statue to fasten two ropes around the head. Thirty seconds later Colston was on the floor. Many jumped on the fallen statue, others holding a Black Lives Matter banner climbed the plinth where it had stood. There was not so much joy when the statue hit the ground as anger, but the crowd had not finished with the monument. It was dragged the short distance to Bristol Harbour and dumped over the quayside. The statue was taken from Colston Avenue and dumped into Bristol Harbour Colston was born into a prosperous Bristol merchant's family and, although he lived in London for many years, was always closely associated with the city By 1672 he had his own business in the capital trading in slaves, cloth, wine and sugar A significant proportion of Colston's wealth came directly or indirectly from the slave trade In 1680, he became an official of the Royal African Company, which at the time held the monopoly in Britain on slave trading He donated to churches and hospitals in Bristol, also founding two almshouses and a school Colston also lent money to the Bristol corporation and was a city MP for a short time Source: BBC History/Nigel Pocock Protesters tear down statue amid anti-racism demos Slave trader statue torn down in Bristol.

"This video can not be played Protesters in Bristol pull down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston Protests against the death of George Floyd, the black man who died while being restrained by a Minnesota police officer, have taken place in the UK, organised by campaign group Black Lives Matter. This is despite Home Secretary Priti Patel and Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick asking people not to go on to the streets. So are such demonstrations actually legal given the coronavirus lockdown? England now has the loosest lockdown in the UK, with no restrictions on going outside. But the rules (officially known as regulations) don't explicitly say anything about protests. However, regulation seven restricts public gatherings to no more than six people. The law defines a ""gathering"" as a meeting involving ""social interaction with each other, or to undertake any other activity"". And so that means, pretty clearly, that a protest is currently illegal along with any other activity that could increase the virus's spread. ""There's a reason that we have laws in place temporarily to say that gatherings of over six people should not happen,"" says Health Secretary Matt Hancock. Police have been trying to encourage people to follow the law and the public health message, and they can break up gatherings. Before Mr Floyd's death, this tended to mean officers directing large parties to stop and ordering people to go home - such as with thisrave in the West Midlandslast month. Officers can hand out fixed-penalty notices - a form of on-the-spot ticket - that start at Â£100 to anyone who won't follow the health regulations. They can also arrest and charge someone with an offence, potentially leading to a large fine in a magistrates' court. So taking all that together, officers have the power to break up and ticket people for being part of a protest, on coronavirus health grounds. Hundreds of people joined a protest in Cardiff Yes, but this is where it gets rather tricky because that right is often misunderstood. And the coronavirus health emergency has complicated things further. Barrister Audrey Cherryl Mogan explains the European Convention on Human Rights (in British law as the Human Rights Act) says that public bodies must respect both the right to assemble and to express one's views. But these two rights are not absolute. The government or another public body can interfere with them if it has a proper legal reason to do so. ""So it becomes a balancing exercise,"" she says. ""If what's being done is to enforce the health regulations, then you can argue that [stopping a protest] would be reasonable and proportionate."" Ms Mogan argues the police should approach these protests in the same way that officers would consider a park full of sunbathing friends. ""If we are talking about stopping a protest, there has to be a fair and just application of the law to these people."" If not, she warns, closing down a Black Lives Matter protest on coronavirus grounds could be seen as unfair and a disproportionate use of the regulations. LOCKDOWN UPDATE:What's changing, where? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters AIR TRAVELLERS:The new quarantine rules LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Chief constables today talk about their public duty to ""facilitate"" demonstrations - and say that they only turn to force - such as bringing in riot police - if they have to quell trouble. And over the first weekend in June, it was pretty clear that the police didn't want to break up peaceful Black Lives Matter demonstrations even though, on paper at least, they would breach coronavirus laws. Dame Cressida and other police chiefs had asked people not to come out and protest on the streets. She said that: ""Coming together in a gathering is not only unlawful but also, perhaps more importantly, it is putting yourself and your family at unnecessary risk and other people around you."" She said officers, if faced with large gatherings, would seek to uphold the law but would make ""a case-by-case decision"" as to what was the right thing to do. Some of the organisers of the Black Lives Matter demonstrations argued over the weekend that they were completely justified in asking people to protest. They said it was because racism - and the violence that comes with it - is like a virus that can only be combatted and defeated by taking a stand. This video can not be played Raheem Sterling: ""The only disease right now is the racism that we're fighting"" England and Manchester City striker Raheem Sterling summed up that sentiment in a BBC interview, saying:""The only disease right now is the racism that we are fighting."" So, in short, many protesters believe that it is their duty to come out and have their say - and that their decision should be recognised as a lawful and reasonable excuse to be out on the streets.

"New rules requiring all people arriving in the UK to self-isolate for 14 days have come into effect. Those arriving by plane, ferry or train - including UK nationals - must give an address where they will self-isolate. Rule breakers will be fined. Home Secretary Priti Patel has said the laws were designed ""to prevent a second wave"" of coronavirus. But the boss of Ryanair has said the rules are a ""political stunt"" and are not a quarantine. Michael O'Leary told the BBC: ""You could be in Sainsbury's, you could be on the beach, you could be on the golf course in the unlikely event the Home Office calls you - all they will have is a mobile number."" He claimed even the Home Office acknowledged the rules were unenforceable. Some industries have warned they will be severely impacted by the rules, and Mr O'Leary warned of devastation. What's the chance of going on holiday? Ryanair boss's face mask claim fact-checked BA refuses to meet Home Secretary over quarantine plans Quarantine rules a 'killer blow' for travel sector Despite criticism from businesses, Ms Patel has said the measures are ""proportionate"" and being implemented ""at the right time"". People arriving in the UK should drive their own car to their destination, where possible, and once there they must not use public transport or taxis. Arrivals must not go to work, school, or public areas, or have visitors - except for essential support. They are also not allowed to go out to buy food, or other essentials, where they can rely on others. Those arriving in England, Wales and Northern Ireland could face a fine of Â£1,000 if they fail to self-isolate for the full 14 days, while they face a Â£480 finein Scotland.The maximum fine for repeat offenders in Scotland is Â£5,000. For more on the rulesclick here. Almost all travellers have to fill in a ""public health passenger locator"" form on arrival. Failure to do so could lead to a penalty of Â£100, or travellers may be refused entry. If they are unable to provide an address, the government will arrange accommodation at the traveller's expense. It says there will also be checks to see whether the rules are being followed. One airline passenger who was flying out to Germany from Stansted for work but lives in the UK, said he may have to stay overseas for longer because of the 14-day quarantine rule. He told the BBC: ""I have to consider coming back or not."" He also said the UK's quarantine rule ""makes no sense because in Germany [there is] a rate less than here and infection is more likely here in the UK than in Germany so for me it makes no sense."" Anyone arriving from the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man does not have to complete a form or enter quarantine. There are also exemptions,externalfor workers in some industries such as road haulage and medical professionals who are providing essential care. SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters AIR TRAVELLERS:The new quarantine rules LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? The union representing UK Border Force staff said the rules were complex and they were not fully prepared. Lucy Moreton, professional officer at the Immigration Services Union, told the BBC that technical papers explaining what to check for only arrived on Friday and were still not available to those operating on the front line. She said there 42 categories that were exempt from the quarantine rules. Ms Moreton added there was no system for checking addresses and only flagrant rule-flouters - such as using the name Mickey Mouse - would be picked up. An internal memo, seen by the BBC, told Border Force agents that the fines would not apply to passengers arriving in the UK through Ireland, who are covered by a separate set of rules. The travel industry has been vocal in its criticism of the government's quarantine rules, warning that the isolation period will deter visitors and put jobs at risk. The manufacturing industry has also highlighted that fewer flights will restrict imports and exports, which will have a knock-on effect for the freight industry, as well as hampering the recovery of some businesses. Stansted Airport encourages passengers in the departure lounge to practice social distancing and disinfects seating areas British Airways, EasyJet and Ryanair have written to Procurator General Sir Jonathan Jones, the government's most senior legal official - the first stage required when taking legal action against the government. The airlines say they are prepared to ask for a judicial reviewinto the government's travel quarantine rules. Travel trade body Abta has called on the government to urgently create a roadmap for restarting international travel, while the UK's biggest airport services company, Swissport, has warned it could deliver a ""killer blow"" to the tourism sector. Industry leaders wrote to Prime Minister Boris Johnsonin May asking that the government avoid taking a ""blanket approach"" to quarantine, suggesting so-called ""air bridges"" with countries that have low coronavirus rates. Aviation, maritime and rail industry leaders were invited to discuss the new quarantine plans butBritish Airways refused to attend the meeting, and aviation bosses told the BBC that they were not impressed by the content of the call.

Separately, Heathrow Airport's chief executive has warned that about 25,000 jobs could be at risk at Heathrow Airport. Government sources have told the BBC that the UK is hoping to secure air bridge agreements with certain countries, such as Portugal, Spain and France, as well as Australia and Singapore. But the government's position is that the idea is only ""under consideration"".

the world that emerges from the Covid-19 pandemic be more peaceful, or, will it
be more divided, more unstable and more open to conflict? This debate has been
raging in the pages of the worldâs leading foreign policy journal, Foreign Affairs. And the latest contribution is
decidedly pessimistic. The authors argue that there is unlikely to
be a âcoronavirus peace dividendâ. In many countries - even in some of the most
developed - the crisis has highlighted inequalities and contributed to domestic
unrest. In authoritarian states (and beyond) the technological opportunities
for monitoring have raised additional concerns about civil liberties. Social
media spreads conspiracy theories and racism as contagious as the virus itself.
Economic instability promises tensions for some years to come as nations turn
inward. There is, of course, a contrary view - that good will indeed come from
this crisis. But look around. For now the pessimists seem more realistic. Soread the article,externaland join the debate.

The traffic spike also coincided with a rise in online searches for information on symptoms like ""cough"" and âdiarrheaâ. Dr John Brownstein, who led the research, said the evidence was circumstantial, but told ABC News that it would provide important context in the search for the virus' origins. âSomething was happening in October,â said Dr Brownstein. âClearly, there was some level of social disruption taking place well before what was previously identified as the start of the novel coronavirus pandemic.â On 31 December 2019, China reported a cluster of pneumonia cases with an unknown cause to the World Health Organization.

A cut in public funding has left the arts sector in England more exposed to the threat of Covid-19,new figures suggest. The latest Arts Index, which is published annually by the National Campaign for the Arts (NCA), showed public investment in the arts per head of the population fell by 35% in the last decade. The NCA said the sector had been ""brought to its knees"" amid the coronavirus pandemic, adding that many companies now face ""ruinous losses"". While galleries and cinemas are putting plans in place to reopen, theatres and concert venues will remain closed for the foreseeable future. The government said it had announced ""unprecedented financial aid"" for the sector and was working with it on how to reopen safely and plan for the future.

Adam EastonWarsaw Correspondent Poland has recorded 599 new coronavirus cases on Monday, the highest daily rise in the country since the start of the pandemic. The cause of the spike has been an outbreak among coal miners in Upper Silesia. Just one coal mine, Zofiowka, run by state coking coal producer JSW, accounted for 60% of the new cases on Saturday and 34% on Sunday. On Monday, 54% of all new cases were recorded in Upper Silesia, southern Poland, home to the majority of Polandâs coal mines. In response, the government has announced that it will temporarily close 12 mines for three weeks to allow it to conduct mass testing. Poland is the biggest hard coal producer in the EU and the country generates about 50% of its electricity from hard coal. Power generation is not under threat, though, because coal stockpiles are at a very high level. Polish authorities have recorded far fewer cases and deaths than many western European countries. But in light of the latest developments, this could change. BBC OS Many countries have been easing lockdown restrictions.

We leave you with a sobering warning from the World Health Organization (WHO). More than seven million cases of coronavirus are now confirmed worldwide, along with 404,000 virus-related deaths. And despite progress in tackling the virus in Europe, the WHO says the pandemic is ""worsening"" globally. ""More than six months into this pandemic, this is not the time for any country to take its foot off the pedal,"" WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in Geneva.

A museum in the UK has reimagined how some of the subjects in its paintings would be protecting themselves during lockdown. The Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge has released a Masterpieces 2020 Edition,featuring five well-known portraits with added protective masks. The editions are being sold as cards to support the museum during its closure. Pre-Raphaelite artist John Everett Millaisâ The Bridesmaid (1851) dons a floral mask to match her silk gown Titianâs Venus and Cupid with a lute player (1555-1565) is given a modern twist This image is inspired by the family portrait The Daughters of Sir Matthew Decker, painted by Dutch artist Jan van Meyer in 1718 Used sanitary items, human faeces and underwear were among items dumped at a beach in Dorset since lockdown restrictions were eased across England. Thousands of people have flocked to the area's beaches in recent weeks,with local groups complaining about ""horrendous"" amounts of litter left behind Volunteers from clean-up group GoPladdle said they also found discarded PPE items and food wrappers at Lake Pier in Hamwothy, Poole. ""While we can commend the great effort some people went to, to disguise their faeces inside takeaway containers, yoghurt pots, towels, blankets, socks and crisp packets, we did not enjoy clearing it up,"" a spokesman for the group said, describing the job as ""stomach churning"". One benefit of viewing from your car: no huddling around artworks Pandemic-required lockdowns have prompted drive-in meals,
drive-in cinemas, even drive-in church services. And now: a drive-in art
gallery. At the weekend a car park at Germanyâs Cologne/Bonn airport
became a space for artists to display their creations, as big indoor
exhibitions have been cancelled. It is one way to support artists hit hard by the freeze on artistic events, said organiser and artist Dieter Nusbaum. ""We saw the trolleys and they have the perfect
height should you look at a painting from the car, so we were given 300
trolleys by the airport,â he said. âThe big pictures we have placed quite unorthodoxly, on
the ground. We are quite practical in that wayâ¦ we are just happy that we were
able to set it up at all."" The charge was â¬4.50 (Â£4) per car, per hour. The grounding of most flights meant the car park had plenty of free space Fifty artists displayed about 300 paintings and sculptures Jonathan MarcusBBC Diplomatic and defence correspondent Will
the world that emerges from the Covid-19 pandemic be more peaceful, or, will it
be more divided, more unstable and more open to conflict? This debate has been
raging in the pages of the worldâs leading foreign policy journal, Foreign Affairs. And the latest contribution is
decidedly pessimistic. The authors argue that there is unlikely to
be a âcoronavirus peace dividendâ. In many countries - even in some of the most
developed - the crisis has highlighted inequalities and contributed to domestic
unrest. In authoritarian states (and beyond) the technological opportunities
for monitoring have raised additional concerns about civil liberties. Social
media spreads conspiracy theories and racism as contagious as the virus itself.
Economic instability promises tensions for some years to come as nations turn
inward. There is, of course, a contrary view - that good will indeed come from
this crisis. But look around. For now the pessimists seem more realistic. Soread the article,externaland join the debate. Mark Selby says customers could be given the option of ordering food on apps in a bid to encourage people back into restaurants Restaurants and pubs across the UK have been hard-hit by lockdown measures but are now busy making plans to reopen. The government says it is working towards 4 Julyas the possible date they will be allowed to reopenin England. There's no firm date yet for Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. ""Starting up, it's going to be hell,""says Mark Selby, the boss of Mexican restaurant chain Wahaca. ""A lot of people are going be nervous about coming out. We've all got to do our jobs in making people feel confident, making them feel safe, but also giving them that experience that hospitality is."" A five-year-old schoolboy, who had both legs amputated as a baby, has raised more than Â£222,000 for the hospital that saved his life. Tony Hudgell, from Kent, has new prosthetic legs and crutches and aims to walk every day this month to reach his 10km (six mile) challenge. He had hoped to raise Â£500, inspired by fellow NHS fundraiserCaptain Tom Moore. His adoptive mother, Paula Hudgell, said: ""He saw Captain Tom walking with his frame in the garden, and he said 'I could do that'."" Tony had to have both his legs amputated when he was just five weeks old after suffering horrific injuries from his biological parents. He was treated at the Evelina Children's Hospital in London and had prosthetic legs fitted last year.

The traffic spike also coincided with a rise in online searches for information on symptoms like ""cough"" and âdiarrheaâ. Dr John Brownstein, who led the research, said the evidence was circumstantial, but told ABC News that it would provide important context in the search for the virus' origins. âSomething was happening in October,â said Dr Brownstein. âClearly, there was some level of social disruption taking place well before what was previously identified as the start of the novel coronavirus pandemic.â On 31 December 2019, China reported a cluster of pneumonia cases with an unknown cause to the World Health Organization. Nine days later, Chinese authorities revealed they had detected a novel coronavirus (later named Sars-CoV-2, the virus causing Covid-19) in several of the pneumonia cases. New York state Governor Andrew Cuomo has urged New Yorkers taking part in protests against the killing of George Floyd last month to get tested for the coronavirus. ""Please go get a test. It's free, it's available,"" Cuomo said. As New York city began reopening 100 days after the lockdown, Cuomo warned residents to ""stay smart"" to avoid the resurgence of coronavirus cases being seen in other US states. ""New Yorkers did what many experts told me wasn't possible in 100 days,"" Cuomo said. ""I don't think I've had a good night's sleep in 100 days knowing some of things they told me. New Yorkers bent the curve by being smart. We're celebrating, we're reopening, we're excited. Our mojo's back, our energy's back, stay smart."" Microsoft has yet to reveal the cost of the forthcoming Xbox Series X The biggest challenge facing Microsoft and Sony's next generation consoles - the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 - might not be proving the most powerful or having the best games at launch but the fallout from Covid-19. Many gamers will have less spare cash to spend. And there has been speculation that supply-chain problems caused by the pandemic will lead to manufacturing delays and higher costs. This was supposed to be the week of the giant E3 games expo, in Los Angeles, a chance to build hype for the launches. Instead, Xbox will give a first look at some games in development via a streamed event in July. Here Xbox chief Phil Spencer speaks to BBC Click about how the pandemic has affected launch plans. A cut in public funding has left the arts sector in England more exposed to the threat of Covid-19,new figures suggest. The latest Arts Index, which is published annually by the National Campaign for the Arts (NCA), showed public investment in the arts per head of the population fell by 35% in the last decade. The NCA said the sector had been ""brought to its knees"" amid the coronavirus pandemic, adding that many companies now face ""ruinous losses"". While galleries and cinemas are putting plans in place to reopen, theatres and concert venues will remain closed for the foreseeable future. The government said it had announced ""unprecedented financial aid"" for the sector and was working with it on how to reopen safely and plan for the future. The economic downturn in the US triggered by the pandemic has been officially declared a recession. The National Bureau of Economic Research made the designation on Tuesday, citing the scale and severity of the current contraction. It said activity and employment hit a ""clear"" and ""well-defined"" peak in February, before falling. The ruling puts a formal end to what had been more than a decade of expansion - the longest in US history. Police officers outside Wuhan's Huanan Seafood Market - the location of the early outbreak Investigating the outbreak of a virus is not unlike the work of any detective. Itâs a race to the scene of the crime before any evidence disappears; witnesses are interviewed - and then the chase begins, to track down and contain the killer before they strike again. But despite rallying an unrivalled international effort, the coronavirus continues to advance, killing thousands of people every day.

New York City has begun its first phase of reopening In case you're just joining us, here are some of the biggest stories from today so far.  James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News A deserted Millennium bridge in central London Lockdowns have saved more than three million lives from coronavirus in Europe, a study has estimated. The team at Imperial College London, which assessed the impact of restrictions in 11 countries in western Europe up to the beginning of May, said the ""death toll would have been huge"" without lockdown. But the team warned that only a small proportion of people had been infected and we were still only ""at the beginning of the pandemic"". Meanwhile, a separate study has argued that global lockdowns have ""saved more lives, in a shorter period of time, than ever before"".

"Demonstrators have defended the dismantling of the police department in Minneapolis A majority of Minneapolis City Council has pledged to dismantle the local police department, a significant move amid nationwide protests sparked by George Floyd's death last month. Nine of the 13 councillors said a ""new model of public safety"" would be created in a city where law enforcement has been accused of racism. Mayor Jacob Frey earlier opposed the move, drawing boos from the crowds. Activists, who for years have demanded such a step, called it a turning point. But commentators say Minneapolis can now expect a long and complex debate over policing, and it remains unclear what form structural reform will take. Mr Floyd's death in police custody triggered mass protests against racism and police brutality. What Trump states make of unrest Five pieces of context to understand protests Why I decided not to watch Floyd's video Timeline: From Kaepernick kneeling to NFL apology Officer Derek Chauvin, who knelt on Mr Floyd's neck for almost nine minutes, has been dismissed and charged with second-degree murder. He will make his first court appearance later on Monday. Three other officers who were at the scene have also been sacked and charged with aiding and abetting. The nine councillors read a statement to hundreds of protesters on Sunday. ""We are here because here in Minneapolis and in cities across the United States it is clear that our existing system of policing and public safety is not keeping our communities safe,"" City Council President Lisa Bender was quoted as saying. ""Our efforts at incremental reform have failed. Period."" Ms Bender said details of the overhaul plan needed to be discussed further, adding that she would try to shift police funding towards community based strategies. Meanwhile,councillor Alondra Cano tweeted that ""a veto-proof majority"" in the council,externalhad agreed that the city police department was ""not reformable and that we're going to end the current policing system"". This video can not be played The history of police violence in the US Last week, Minnesota launched a civil rights investigation of the Minneapolis Police Department, with Governor Tim Walz saying he wanted to root out ""systemic racism that is generations deep"". The city council later voted for a number of policing changes, including the ban on chokeholds and neck restraints by police officers. The reform plan in Minneapolis sets up what is likely to be a complicated discussion over new ways of policing across the US. But the process of setting up a new system will probably take months, and is not guaranteed because of the mayor's opposition. Reacting to the announcement, Kandace Montgomery, the director of the Minnesota-based campaign group Black Vision, said: ""It shouldn't have taken so much death to get us here. We're safer without armed, unaccountable patrols supported by the state hunting black people."" On Monday, Democrats in Congress are expected to present sweeping legislation on police reform. VIEWPOINT:Tipping point for racially divided nation WATCH:'This is why we are protesting' TIMELINE:Recent black deaths at hands of police BACKGROUND:Five pieces of context to understand the protests CRIME AND JUSTICE:How are African Americans treated? New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio had already said he would divert money from the city's police department to social services. ""Defund the police"" was a rallying cry during the latest street protests, that occasionally spilled into violence and looting. This video can not be played The US's history of racial inequality has paved the way for modern day police brutality ""Defunding"" advocates have for years been condemning what they describe as the aggressive militarised policing in the US. They argue that police departments' budgets should be slashed and funds diverted to social programmes to avoid unnecessary confrontation and heal the racial divide. Entire city police departments have been disbanded before in the country: in Compton, California, in 2000, and 12 years later in Camden, New Jersey. In both cases they were replaced with bigger new forces that covered local counties. Demonstrators gathered again on Sunday in US cities including Washington DC, New York, and Los Angeles - where a local broadcaster estimated 20,000 people had rallied down Hollywood Boulevard. Republican Senator Mitt Romney tweeted pictures of himself marching towards the White House with Christian protesters, with the caption ""Black Lives Matter."" The protests were mostly peaceful, and security measures across the US were lifted as unrest started to ease. However, Seattle Police Department said a man drove a car into a demonstration there on Sunday night, before shooting and wounding a 27-year-old bystander. The UK also saw sizeable weekend protests in support of Black Lives Matter, with demonstrations in cities including London, Manchester, Cardiff, Leicester and Sheffield. Protesters tear down statue amid anti-racism demos Protesters in London knelt for a minute's silence before chanting ""no justice, no peace"". In Australia, tens of thousands joined anti-racism protests in Brisbane, Melbourne, Hobart, Adelaide and elsewhere, despite warnings from officials over the coronavirus. 25 May 2020 George Floyd dies after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Footage shows a white officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floydâs neck for several minutes while he is pinned to the floor. Mr Floyd is heard repeatedly saying ""I canât breathe"". He is pronounced dead later in hospital. 26 May Four officers involved in the arrest of George Floyd are fired. Protests begin as the video of the arrest is shared widely on social media. Hundreds of demonstrators take to the streets of Minneapolis and vandalise police cars and the police station with graffiti. 27 May Protests spread to other cities including Memphis and Los Angeles. In some places, like Portland, Oregon, protesters lie in the road, chanting ""I canât breathe"". Demonstrators again gather around the police station in Minneapolis where the officers involved in George Floydâs arrest were based and set fire to it. The building is evacuated and police retreat. 28 May President Trump blames the violence on a lack of leadership in Minneapolis and threatens to send in the National Guard in a tweet. Â He follows it up in a second tweet with a warning ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"". The second tweet is hidden by Twitter for ""glorifying violence"". 29 May A CNN reporter, Omar Jimenez, is arrested while covering the Minneapolis protest. Mr Jimenez was reporting live when police officers handcuffed him. A few minutes later several of his colleagues are also arrested. They are all later released once they are confirmed to be members of the media. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, 44, is charged with murder and manslaughter. The charges carry a combined maximum 35-year sentence. 31 May Violence spreads across the US on the sixth night of protests. A total of at least five people are reported killed in protests from Indianapolis to Chicago. More than 75 cities have seen protests. At least 4,400 people have been arrested. Â Curfews are imposed across the US to try to stem the unrest. 1 June President Trump threatens to send in the military to quell growing civil unrest. He says if cities and states fail to control the protests and ""defend their residents"" he will deploy the army and ""quickly solve the problem for them"". Mr Trump poses in front of a damaged church shortly after police used tear gas to disperse peaceful protesters nearby. 2 June Tens of thousands of protesters again take to the streets. One of the biggest protests is in George Floydâs hometown of Houston, Texas. Many defy curfews in several cities, but the demonstrations are largely peaceful. 4 June A memorial service for George Floyd is held in Minneapolis. Â Those gathered in tribute stand in silence for eight minutes, 46 seconds, the amount of time Mr Floyd is alleged to have been on the ground under arrest. Hundreds attended the service, which heard a eulogy from civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton. 7 June As the US saw another weekend of protests, with tens of thousands marching in Washington DC, anti-racism demonstrations were held around the world. In Australia, there were major protests in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane that focused on the treatment of indigenous Australians. There were also demonstrations in France, Germany, Spain and the UK. In Bristol, protesters tore down the statue of a 17th century slave trader and threw it into the harbour. 9 June A funeral service for George Floyd is held in Houston, Mr Floydâs home town. Just over two weeks after his death in Minneapolis and worldwide anti-racism protests, about 500 guests invited by the Floyd family are in attendance at the Fountain of Praise Church. Â Many more gather outside to show their support.

"BP has announced plans to cut 10,000 jobs following a global slump in demand for oil because of the coronavirus crisis. The oil giant had paused redundancies during the peak of the pandemic but told staff on Monday that around 15% will leave by the end of the year. BP has not said how many jobs will be lost in the UK but it is thought the figure could be close to 2,000. Chief executive Bernard Looney blamed a drop in the oil price for the cuts. In an email to staff, he said: ""The oil price has plunged well below the level we need to turn a profit. ""We are spending much, much more than we make - I am talking millions of dollars, every day."" Countries across the globe have ordered people to stay indoors and not travel, which has caused a slump in demand for oil. As a result, the cost of oil fell to less than $20 a barrel at the peak of the crisis, less than a third of the $66 it cost at the start of the year. It has since partly recovered to around $42 a barrel. That has taken a toll on the industry, sparking warnings that30,000 UK jobscould be lost as a result of the crisis. BP employs around 15,000 people in the UK. The firm's office-based workers are expected to bear the brunt of the redundancies, which will not affect any of its retail staff. ""It was always part of the plan to make BP a leaner, faster-moving and lower carbon company,"" Mr Looney - who took over as the boss of BP in February - said in his email to staff on Monday. ""Then the COVID-19 pandemic took hold,"" he said. ""You are already aware that, beyond the clear human tragedy, there has been widespread economic fallout, along with consequences for our industry and our company."" Deirdre Michie, the chief executive of industry group Oil and Gas UK (OGUK), said the planned redundancies highlighted the ""very real and personal"" impact of the coronavirus pandemic on jobs and livelihoods. ""There is a serious risk the UK loses the skills it needs not only to meet existing energy demands from domestic resources, but also to meet the UK's climate ambitions,"" she said. The message from BP's chief executive, Bernard Looney, is that the numbers don't add up. The oil price has recovered a bit but the business is still losing money hand over fist. On top of that, Big Oil is trying to execute a big swerve towards renewables. None of the above is of any comfort to the thousands who will be pushed out of BP's doors in a matter of months. This is a sign of how precarious the job market is becoming as the crisis caused by the virus takes hold. The pain will be felt most in the senior ranks but, whatever the pay grade, each loss will be hard to bear. In April, BP said it planned to pay a $0.11 per share dividend to shareholders and in an announcement on Monday, the company said it would still make that payment later this month. Energy expert Professor David Elmes from Warwick Business School said other firms would question how much they can hand out to shareholders as a result of the crisis. ""The job losses at BP are symptomatic of the wider challenges facing the industry,"" he said. ""Coronavirus has reduced oil demand and the price per barrel has plummeted, but that has happened in a wider context of short-term and long-term decline."" ""All firms in the sector will all be looking at how they can cut costs, shift their activities to the lowest cost field, trim investment, and thinking hard about what dividend they can pay.""

"The UK has been warned by the pharmaceutical industry that some stockpiles of medical supplies have been ""used up entirely"" by the virus. A memo seen by the BBC advises the government to buy and store ""critical"" medicines to treat the virus. Drug makers fear stockpiles cannot feasibly be built back up again in time, if the UK should fail to strike a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU. The government said ""robust contingency plans are in place"". The spokesperson added: ""We want a relationship with the EU which is based on friendly cooperation between sovereign equals and centred on free trade."" However, firms fear disruption to global supply chains will seriously impact the NHS. The internal pharmaceutical industry memo, which was prepared for the government in May, warns that after the pandemic ends, there will be ""less or zero product available in the market to allow for stockpiling a broad range of products"" than there was in 2019, when stockpiling occurred in preparation for a possible no-deal Brexit. At the time, the industry itself paid for six weeks' worth of stockpiles. ""Preparations for the end of the transition period must complement plans to secure the supply of coronavirus therapeutic and supportive products,"" the memo says. The pandemic has led to a massive increase in demand for medicines not previously stockpiled for critical care and respiratory medicines, such as inhalers. The pharmaceutical industry is predicting a massive disruption to supply chains in the event of a no-deal Brexit At the same time, coronavirus lockdown measures imposed by governments have caused significant supply bottlenecks due to factory closures and export bans, as well as a drastic decline in air freight. The memo was put together by a cross section of pharmaceutical industry groups anticipating preparations for a failure to strike a trade deal with the EU, alongside a refusal to extend the negotiating period. If this happens,the UK would trade on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms, which would mean trade barriers from the start of next year. The memo goes on to remind the government that the flow of medicines has been kept going through the pandemic thanks to ""international coordination and information sharing within global companies to ramp up, and where necessary, redirect manufacturing"". As a result, the pharmaceutical industry writes: ""We would warn against any drastic policies mandating wholesale changes to global supply chains, as this could fundamentally disrupt the supply of medicines for the NHS and patients in other countries."" The pharmaceutical industryhas long anticipated that a no-deal Brexit could cause congestionat the ports of Dover and Calais, which is the route that 90% of imported drugs and medicines from the EU take to get to the UK. As a result, the industry has advised that the government itself will have to buy and store a longer list of ""critical products"" where ""supply could be challenging due to either COVID-19 or the end of the [Brexit] transition period"". No-deal Brexit: Drug supply plans not yet clear UK's chief medical officers dashed PM's 'hopes' to lower coronavirus alert Why a billion items of PPE is not enough The need for trading stability is even more important this year, because the pattern of demand for medicines is likely to be very different to normal. That means, the memo says, that the government needs to develop a new broader list of critical products which ""reflect the challenges posed by both the end of the transition period and continues response"" to the coronavirus crisis. The memo also emphasises that the government needs to be storing a much broader list of medicines going forward, because of the joint challenge of the pandemic and in the event of a no-deal Brexit deal at the end of this year. But the pharmaceutical industry says that to have significant impact, the stockpiling will have to start in the next few weeks, and even after the pandemic ends, stockpiling will not be possible for every medicine required. Drug makers say they have been working ""round the clock"" to keep medicine supply chains running through the pandemic In a normal year, Christmas would be ""the worst time of year to ask companies to increase their stockpile levels"", the memo says. The pharmaceutical industry is expecting the system of no-deal government-chartered freight ferries and aeroplanes to be re-established, given that border disruption is expected at the end of the Brexit transition period. It says the government needs to signal that this will be the case by next month. And it has requested ""urgent clarity"" on the implementation of arrangements for Irish Sea trade, under the Northern Ireland Protocol. The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI), one of the organisations involved in drafting the report, says firms had ""worked around the clock"" during the pandemic to make sure medicine supply chains held up. ""With this pressure likely to continue over the coming months, the pandemic has reinforced why it is essential that the UK and EU reach a deal on their future relationship,"" said ABPI's chief executive Dr Richard Torbett. In the meantime, he said its members would continue to work closely with government to put detailed plans in place. ""But not everything is in the gift of industry. Stockpiling is one element - having alternative supply routes and making sure that goods can continue to flow uninterrupted across borders is also critical,"" he stressed.

"Huawei is launching a newspaper and internet campaign to mark 20 years of business in the UK. In an open letter to the public, the Chinese telecoms company says it is ""as committed as ever"" to provide ""the best equipment"" to the UK's 5G mobile and full-fibre broadband providers. It comes amid a new security reviewthat could lead the UK government to ban use of Huawei's 5G network kit. Huawei's local boss said he expects the UK to act in the nation's interests. The initiative follows a report in Saturday's Daily Telegraph, which said London-headquartered bank HSBCfears it could face reprisals in China,external, if the UK acts against Huawei. The Sunday Times also reported that China's ambassador to the UK hadrecently told business leaders that Beijing viewed the matter,externalas ""a litmus test of whether Britain is a true and faithful partner"". Victor Zhang, vice president of Huawei and head of its UK operations, told the BBC the advertising campaign was about giving people the facts amid all the ""noise"" surrounding the company. Senator tells MPs Huawei puts US troops at risk What would happen if the UK ditched Huawei? US targets Huawei with tighter chip export rules He said he hoped the UK would take an ""evidence and fact-based approach"" and warned of huge economic impact if greater connectivity was delayed by the company's exclusion, potentially running into the tens of billions of pounds of lost productivity benefits. ""We need to work closely to address the issue, but we need to take action to accelerate the broadband deployment,"" he said. ""We don't have time to delay this."" Huawei's first significant global breakthrough came in the UK in 2005, when it signed a deal to upgrade BT's copper broadband service, five years after having entered the market. Two of the UK's mobile operators now need to remove Huawei equipment from their networks in order to meet the 35% cap imposed by the government And 15 years later, the UK government's decision to allow Huawei a role in the country's 5G mobile networks represented another crucial victory. In January, ministers announced thatHuawei's market share would be capped at 35%, and it would be excluded from sensitive locations, as well as the so-called ""core"" of the network, which is likened to the brains of the system. It appeared that the Chinese tech giant had avoided the outright ban that the US had been pressing for, on the grounds that the firm poses a national security risk. But a backbench rebellion by Conservative MPs in March and then the coronavirus crisis have heightened political pressure for the UK to be less dependent on China. And Washington's campaign has also not relented since January's decision, despite Huawei's repeated denials that it would ever compromise its clients. In May, the US placed significant new sanctions on the company, which limits its access to American computer chip technology. ""We think this decision will heavily impact on the global supply chain of the semiconductor industry,"" Mr Zhang told the BBC. ""We need to work out a solution."" Huawei spells out the benefits it presents the UK in the ad pegged to its 20th anniversary Mr Zhang said that it was still too early for the company to draw any conclusion about the impact, and promised to share details of its own review when complete. However, the sanctions prompted the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) to carry out its own review. NCSC is expected to report in the coming weeks, and may say it has lost confidence it can manage the risks associated with Huawei being involved in 5G. That could open the way for the government to shift its position to further reducing, or even eventually eliminating Huawei's role. That could be costly to mobile operators, leading to higher bills for customers. It could also mean their rollout of 5G in the UK is slower. The advertising campaign also highlights Huawei's support of British universities and other institutions, which might also be affected, were the company to be blocked. ""We believe the UK will definitely review this based on the facts and the evidence, because the UK will take its own interests very seriously,"" Mr Zhang said. The founder of Huawei, Ren Zhengfeiwas reported by the Wall Street Journal on Saturday,externalto have told staff in 2018 that the company was in a battle with the US and they should ""surge forward, killing as you go, to blaze us a trail of blood"". Huawei's founder Ren Zhengfei Asked about the language, Mr Zhang said it reflected a sense that Huawei was under intense attack from the United States. ""We are very vulnerable and we know America tried to attack Huawei with so called security reasons which are actually totally wrong,"" he said. ""It is simply because of trade and protectionism.""

"Demonstrators have defended the dismantling of the police department in Minneapolis A majority of Minneapolis City Council has pledged to dismantle the local police department, a significant move amid nationwide protests sparked by George Floyd's death last month. Nine of the 13 councillors said a ""new model of public safety"" would be created in a city where law enforcement has been accused of racism. Mayor Jacob Frey earlier opposed the move, drawing boos from the crowds. Activists, who for years have demanded such a step, called it a turning point. But commentators say Minneapolis can now expect a long and complex debate over policing, and it remains unclear what form structural reform will take. Mr Floyd's death in police custody triggered mass protests against racism and police brutality. What Trump states make of unrest Five pieces of context to understand protests Why I decided not to watch Floyd's video Timeline: From Kaepernick kneeling to NFL apology Officer Derek Chauvin, who knelt on Mr Floyd's neck for almost nine minutes, has been dismissed and charged with second-degree murder. He will make his first court appearance later on Monday. Three other officers who were at the scene have also been sacked and charged with aiding and abetting. The nine councillors read a statement to hundreds of protesters on Sunday. ""We are here because here in Minneapolis and in cities across the United States it is clear that our existing system of policing and public safety is not keeping our communities safe,"" City Council President Lisa Bender was quoted as saying. ""Our efforts at incremental reform have failed. Period."" Ms Bender said details of the overhaul plan needed to be discussed further, adding that she would try to shift police funding towards community based strategies. Meanwhile,councillor Alondra Cano tweeted that ""a veto-proof majority"" in the council,externalhad agreed that the city police department was ""not reformable and that we're going to end the current policing system"". This video can not be played The history of police violence in the US Last week, Minnesota launched a civil rights investigation of the Minneapolis Police Department, with Governor Tim Walz saying he wanted to root out ""systemic racism that is generations deep"". The city council later voted for a number of policing changes, including the ban on chokeholds and neck restraints by police officers. The reform plan in Minneapolis sets up what is likely to be a complicated discussion over new ways of policing across the US. But the process of setting up a new system will probably take months, and is not guaranteed because of the mayor's opposition. Reacting to the announcement, Kandace Montgomery, the director of the Minnesota-based campaign group Black Vision, said: ""It shouldn't have taken so much death to get us here. We're safer without armed, unaccountable patrols supported by the state hunting black people."" On Monday, Democrats in Congress are expected to present sweeping legislation on police reform.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio had already said he would divert money from the city's police department to social services. ""Defund the police"" was a rallying cry during the latest street protests, that occasionally spilled into violence and looting. This video can not be played The US's history of racial inequality has paved the way for modern day police brutality ""Defunding"" advocates have for years been condemning what they describe as the aggressive militarised policing in the US. They argue that police departments' budgets should be slashed and funds diverted to social programmes to avoid unnecessary confrontation and heal the racial divide. Entire city police departments have been disbanded before in the country: in Compton, California, in 2000, and 12 years later in Camden, New Jersey. In both cases they were replaced with bigger new forces that covered local counties. Demonstrators gathered again on Sunday in US cities including Washington DC, New York, and Los Angeles - where a local broadcaster estimated 20,000 people had rallied down Hollywood Boulevard. Republican Senator Mitt Romney tweeted pictures of himself marching towards the White House with Christian protesters, with the caption ""Black Lives Matter."" The protests were mostly peaceful, and security measures across the US were lifted as unrest started to ease. However, Seattle Police Department said a man drove a car into a demonstration there on Sunday night, before shooting and wounding a 27-year-old bystander. The UK also saw sizeable weekend protests in support of Black Lives Matter, with demonstrations in cities including London, Manchester, Cardiff, Leicester and Sheffield.

He is pronounced dead later in hospital. 26 May Four officers involved in the arrest of George Floyd are fired. Protests begin as the video of the arrest is shared widely on social media. Hundreds of demonstrators take to the streets of Minneapolis and vandalise police cars and the police station with graffiti. 27 May Protests spread to other cities including Memphis and Los Angeles. In some places, like Portland, Oregon, protesters lie in the road, chanting ""I canât breathe"". Demonstrators again gather around the police station in Minneapolis where the officers involved in George Floydâs arrest were based and set fire to it. The building is evacuated and police retreat. 28 May President Trump blames the violence on a lack of leadership in Minneapolis and threatens to send in the National Guard in a tweet. Â He follows it up in a second tweet with a warning ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"". The second tweet is hidden by Twitter for ""glorifying violence"". 29 May A CNN reporter, Omar Jimenez, is arrested while covering the Minneapolis protest. Mr Jimenez was reporting live when police officers handcuffed him. A few minutes later several of his colleagues are also arrested. They are all later released once they are confirmed to be members of the media. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, 44, is charged with murder and manslaughter. The charges carry a combined maximum 35-year sentence. 31 May Violence spreads across the US on the sixth night of protests. A total of at least five people are reported killed in protests from Indianapolis to Chicago. More than 75 cities have seen protests. At least 4,400 people have been arrested. Â Curfews are imposed across the US to try to stem the unrest. 1 June President Trump threatens to send in the military to quell growing civil unrest.

Mr Trump poses in front of a damaged church shortly after police used tear gas to disperse peaceful protesters nearby. 2 June Tens of thousands of protesters again take to the streets. One of the biggest protests is in George Floydâs hometown of Houston, Texas. Many defy curfews in several cities, but the demonstrations are largely peaceful. 4 June A memorial service for George Floyd is held in Minneapolis. Â Those gathered in tribute stand in silence for eight minutes, 46 seconds, the amount of time Mr Floyd is alleged to have been on the ground under arrest. Hundreds attended the service, which heard a eulogy from civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton. 7 June As the US saw another weekend of protests, with tens of thousands marching in Washington DC, anti-racism demonstrations were held around the world. In Australia, there were major protests in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane that focused on the treatment of indigenous Australians. There were also demonstrations in France, Germany, Spain and the UK. In Bristol, protesters tore down the statue of a 17th century slave trader and threw it into the harbour. 9 June A funeral service for George Floyd is held in Houston, Mr Floydâs home town.

"This video can not be played Protesters in Bristol pull down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston The name Edward Colston looms large over Bristol, with streets and buildings named after the 17th Century merchant and slave trader. On Sunday, protesters at an anti-racism demonstration in the city toppled a statue of Colston and dumped it in Bristol Harbour. The BBC's Jack Grey witnessed the statue's fall. Thousands of people attended the demonstration in Bristol,one of many in the UKsparked by the death of George Floyd while he was under arrest in Minneapolis in the United States last month. A group of protesters surrounded the statue on Colston Avenue, erected in honour of a man whose ships sent about 80,000 men, women and children from Africa to the Americas between 1672 and 1689. Colston's memory has divided the city for years, with some thinking history can't be changed and others campaigning successfully for his name to be erased from streets, schools and venues. The statue in Colston Avenue was erected in 1895 There was clear frustration in Sunday's crowd, partly because the statue still stood in 2020, but also because it had simply been covered for the protest. The canvas covering, which had already been targeted by egg-throwers, was torn off with some people saying they wanted to look the man in the eyes. Soon ropes had been tied round the bronze monument and the process of removing it began. Once the covering was removed, three protestors climbed atop the statue to fasten two ropes around the head. Thirty seconds later Colston was on the floor. Many jumped on the fallen statue, others holding a Black Lives Matter banner climbed the plinth where it had stood. There was not so much joy when the statue hit the ground as anger, but the crowd had not finished with the monument. It was dragged the short distance to Bristol Harbour and dumped over the quayside. The statue was taken from Colston Avenue and dumped into Bristol Harbour Colston was born into a prosperous Bristol merchant's family and, although he lived in London for many years, was always closely associated with the city By 1672 he had his own business in the capital trading in slaves, cloth, wine and sugar A significant proportion of Colston's wealth came directly or indirectly from the slave trade In 1680, he became an official of the Royal African Company, which at the time held the monopoly in Britain on slave trading He donated to churches and hospitals in Bristol, also founding two almshouses and a school Colston also lent money to the Bristol corporation and was a city MP for a short time Source: BBC History/Nigel Pocock Protesters tear down statue amid anti-racism demos Slave trader statue torn down in Bristol.

"The statue of Edward Colston in Bristol ""is a constant reminder of his inhumanity"", says poet Miles Chambers This article was first published in February 2018 Bristol's fame and wealth were built on the slave trade and few slave traders were more infamous or wealthy than Edward Colston. Almost 300 years since his death, his past is set to be formally acknowledged by the city for the first time. But does this go far enough? Colston made his fortune through human suffering. Between 1672 and 1689,ships,externalare believed to have transported about 80,000 men, women and children from Africa to the Americas. However, in the city he called home, his memory has been honoured for centuries. On his death in 1721, hebequeathed his wealth to charitiesand his legacy can still be seen on Bristol's streets, memorials and buildings. His statue, which stands on Colston Avenue in the city centre, makes no mention of his notorious past. But this could be about to change. The city council is proposing to put a plaque on the statue which will recognise and acknowledge the people Colston and others in the city enslaved. It's a move that has been a long time coming, says Ros Martin, one of the driving forces behind the Countering Colston campaign group. ""The plaque is good but we need it to be part of an ongoing examination of historical narrative and a change of attitudes and culture. ""What we want goes beyond tokenism - we want institutions and organisations in the city to examine their history and acknowledge their individual roles in the slave trade and beyond."" The statue of the slave trader and philanthropist was erected in 1895 The drive to reconsider Bristol's attitude to Colston has long been gathering momentum. For years Massive Attackrefused to play,externalat hometown venue Colston Hall, which last yearagreed to drop the slave trader's name. Not before time, says Miles Chambers, the city's poet laureate. ""Some people don't get that black people still feel the full impact of slavery today. ""We can look at the descendants of the slaves and economically they are still worse off; psychologically they are still worse off; mentally they still feel collectively as inferior; more African-Caribbean males are disproportionately in prison and in the judicial system; they do worse at schools; economically are paid less and are working less. ""The pattern continues and even though many people say slavery is over, because of those legacies we still feel enslaved. ""A name change or statue move is not going to rectify racism or eradicate the slave mentality that still exists, but it will help to say to black people: 'You are equal to us, you are British, you are valuable and you mean as much to us as any other citizen.'"" Captains were instructed to buy as many slaves as the ship could ""conveniently carry"" In 1680 Colston became a member of theRoyal African Company,externalwhich at the time had a monopoly on the slave trade. By 1689 he had risen to become its deputy governor. Slaves bought in West Africa were branded with the company initials RAC, then herded on to ships and plunged into a nightmarish voyage. Closely shackled together, hundreds of enslaved people lay in their own filth; disease, suicide and murder claimed between 10 and 20 per cent of them during the six to eight week voyage to the Americas. Human suffering on this scale made Colston rich and a grateful Bristol honoured his benevolence; naming dozens of buildings, institutions, charities, schools, sports clubs, pubs, societies and roads after him. His charity iscommemorated,externalduring processions and church services. School children have paid homage to him at services. His statue stands in the city centre, inscribed as a ""memorial of one of the most virtuous and wise sons of the city"". For hundreds of years, he has been unquestionably venerated. ""Colston may have helped more people than he abused but the people he abused and their descendants say this is unacceptable and although they are a minority, something needs to be done about it,"" says Mr Chambers. ""We are still seeing the effects of slavery in this city, there is still money from slavery in this city and so we can't ignore it."" Ros Martin says tourists wonder why so many buildings and roads are named after Colston There have been questions about Colston and his profile in Bristolsince the 1920s,externalbut they remained largely ignored until 1999 when Prof Madge Dresser, at the University of West England, spoke about Colston and his involvement in the slave trade. The next morning, ""Slave Trader"" was scrawled across his statue. The graffiti was scrubbed off and the city went back to turning a blind eye until two years ago, when Countering Colston ignited the debate once again. It has staged protests outside many events linked to Colston and called for the city to remember, among other things, the ""full, true history of transatlantic slavery, colonialism and exploitation"". ""When you come to Bristol you go around the streets and, for anyone outside coming in, they must think 'Who is this man?' and 'Why are so many buildings, roads and schools named after him?',"" says Ms Martin. ""I think it's very disingenuous, very disrespecting of the memory of African ancestors who contributed to the wealth of the city through enslaved labour. They suffered and there is not enough recognition in any way. ""[Countering Colston] would like to see permanent public art works as a memorial to the victims of the city's human trafficking into enslavement. ""I would like all those institutions that played a role in this business of transatlantic inhumanity to provide public exhibitions of their involvement and a monument to those who suffered in their institution."" As head girl, Jane Ghosh's had to lay a wreath on Colston's tomb on Commemoration Day Countering Colston's work is beginning to make its mark. After Colston Hall announced it was severing any connection with the slave trader, others swiftly followed. For the first time in centuries, a controversial church service in his name wasdropped last year,external; the custodians of St Stephen's citing a ""growing concern"" about a man who made his money from buying and selling people. However, for some the campaign is simply going too far. ""We all knew what he'd done but it wasn't spoken about,"" says Jane Ghosh, a former head girl of Colston Girls school. Founded in 1891 with an endowment left in his will, the school has steadfastlyrefused to drop his name. During her school days, Ms Ghosh took part in many Charter Day ceremonies to commemorate the school's founder. As head girl, she joined the procession through the city to placed a wreath on his tomb, while Colston buns - created by and named after the merchant -  werehanded out during the service,external. ""I'm not an apologist [for slavery] but I am a realist,"" she continues. ""So many families, so many buildings in Bristol are connected to the slave trade and one of the reasons I get a bit cross is because I think, 'Why are we picking on Colston?' ""So many people were a mixture of good and bad - as we all are - and he seems to be singled out and I don't know why."" Francis Greenacre standing outside Colston Almshouses - built in 1796 with Colston's money to provide homes for the poor Between 1698 and 1807just over 2,100 Bristol ships set sail on slaving voyageswith many of the earliest voyages funded by ordinary people who provided cash or goods to be bartered for captured slaves. That Colston's name has not disappeared with time is testament to his membership of an influential and selective group of Bristol businessmen. TheSociety of Merchant Venturers,externalhelped set up and run many of the institutions and charities that still bear his name. Former museum curator and society member Francis Greenacre says the achievements of a man who did so much for charity have now been overshadowed by the debate about his name. ""His status was extraordinary... the extent of his charity was vast in Bristol and enormous in London, as it was throughout the country."" His wealth also founded schools and almshouses for the poor and he entrusted the society to carry on his work. Today, the Merchant Venturers run nine schools in Bristol, are involved in social enterprise, charities looking after the elderly, scholarships and trusts. However, controversial ceremonies are still reported to exist including aSilent Toast to Colston,externalduring theGrateful Society's,externalannual dinner. Standing outside Colston Tower, Jasmine Ketibuah-Foley says she is ""uncomfortable"" that a slave trader's name is ""celebrated"" Campaigners accuse the society of continuing to""celebrate a slave trader"".,externalMr Greenacre says the society is commemorating Colston's charity work, rather than his slaving past. ""That word [celebrate] comes from Countering Colston - it is in no sense what is being done,"" he says. ""We are not celebrating the slave trade; that is a perception which is in effect deeply offensive."" However, he acknowledges that times have changed and society must change as well, referring to the council's decision to acknowledge Colston's past. ""Someone walking past his statue, which makes no reference to the slave trade; if they are a descendant of enslaved Africans they may feel genuinely offended; indeed some feel not just hurt but real anguish and that ought to be addressed."" Colston's statue is a ""memorial [to] one of the most virtuous and wise sons of the city"" For some, the amendment to Colston's statue is not enough. ""I would really like it if the statue was put in the museum,"" says Jasmine Ketibuah-Foley, a presenter for community station Ujima Radio, which focuses on Bristol's African-Caribbean population. ""People can still see that this is a man who did a lot for Bristol, but we should put [a statue] in the city centre of ablack Bristolian who has changed Bristol and done something good for Bristol."" Others think saving Colston's legacy is not even as simple as moving a statue or changing the name of buildings, roads and schools. When he heard the concert venue would be dropping the name, history graduate Max Barton set up a petition against the move which attracted 5,000 signatures. He said it was ""time to educate and not eliminate"" people about the slave trader and his history. Max Barton says some people in Bristol see Colston as a figurehead of the city ""White, working-class Bristolians have grown up with Colston as a kind of father of Bristol,"" he says. ""They see him as a figurehead, they see him as this person who was a great charitable philanthropist - wiping out that history would alienate this group. ""Countering Colston has a list of places associated with Colston on their website - a hit list as far as I'm concerned... they want to eliminate him from history and that will alienate people."" Bristol is not alone in trying to come to terms with its past. FromOxfordtoCharlottesville, fromSydneytoCape Town, cities are facing the same question - how do you remember history without celebrating brutality? Historian Dr Edson Burton is reluctant to see Colston's name disappear but believes Bristol is similar to many cities in being ""built on a romanticised myth"". He says now we are in a position to question ""the great figures that we have venerated in the past"", we should not be surprised to ""find that they are not up to the mark for our modern standards"". Dr Edson Burton standing outside Bristol Cathedral, which has a huge stained glass window dedicated to Colston ""I see that there are a number of institutions willing to look their history in the eye and acknowledge that there is a question about the legacy and foundation on which they were built. ""I think that is a monumental step - my concern is that it is not sufficient enough."" He is one of many in the city searching for a solution. At the vanguard of change, in more ways than one, is Colston Primary School, whichannounced last year it would be changing its name. Kate Swainson Price said the decision to change the school's name is not about eradicating history Chair of governors Kate Swainson Price said the decision was not about pandering to political correctness. ""For me, the decision to change our school name is about a recontextualisation of history rather than eradication, obliteration or whitewashing. ""It's making history, not erasing history. Facts don't change but attitudes and values do, as do societies."" The school is now at the centre of plans to design the new plaque on Colston's statue, which will recognise and acknowledge the people he and others in the city enslaved. The children will be joining Countering Colston members, Prof Dresser and the city council to help put Colston's legacy into context. Ms Swainson Price said it was ""amazing and appropriate"" for the children to ""to help review and redress the balance about how we remember and acknowledge Bristol's historical figures"" and ""importantly, the slaves themselves"". The current plaque makes no mention of the thousands of people he enslaved The man in charge of the project, the council's historic environment officer Pete Insole, said the people who were exploited by Colston are ""invisible"" in Bristol. He is helping to co-ordinate events during the summer about the city's links to the slave trade, which will culminate in the unveiling of the plaque. ""Slave traders are the most commemorated people in the city; we can't change the past but we can change the present and the future,"" he added. But for Ms Martin this is only the beginning: ""We have created debate... It's not just Bristol, it's a global narrative, it's about colonisation and decolonisation. ""Across Europe and across America the debate is very alive. We are questioning people and we are challenging society. ""You are only here for a short time on Earth and I like to think we are bequeathing something better than we have inherited.""

"This video can not be played Protesters in Bristol pull down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston A statue of a slave trader which was torn down during an anti-racism protest in Bristol was ""an affront"", the city's mayor has said. Mayor Marvin Rees said he felt no ""sense of loss"" after the controversial bronze statue of Edward Colston was pulled down and thrown into the harbour by protesters on Sunday. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson described it as a ""criminal act"". Avon and Somerset Police said a decision was taken not to intervene. Mr Johnson's official spokesman said: ""The PM's view is that in this country, where there is strong opinion, there is a democratic process which should be followed. ""People can campaign for the removal of a statue but what happened yesterday was a criminal act and when the criminal law is broken that is unacceptable and the police will want to hold to account those responsible. ""The PM absolutely understands the strength of feeling, but in this country we settle our differences democratically and if people wanted the removal of the statue there are democratic routes which can be followed.""

But unrest in London on Sundayresulted in eight police officers being injured and 12 arrests. The statue of the prominent 17th Century slave trader has been a source of controversy in Bristol for years. Ten thousand people descended on the city on Sunday for the protestwhich saw the Colston statue torn down and dragged through the streetsto the harbour, where it was thrown into the water. Updates and reaction to the statue being torn down Colston was a member of the Royal African Company, which transported about 80,000 men, women and children from Africa to the Americas.

After the statue was toppled, a protester was pictured with his knee on the figure's neck - reminiscent of the video showing George Floyd, the black man who died while being restrained by a white Minnesota police officer. The statue of Edward Colston was dragged through Bristol before being thrown into the harbour Home Secretary Priti Patel said the incident was ""utterly disgraceful"" and ""it's not for mobs to tear down statues"". Mr Rees said those comments showed an ""absolute lack of understanding"". He added the statue would be retrieved from the harbour ""at some point"" and it was likely to end up in a city museum. ""I think circumstances came to a head and people felt the need to take the statue down,"" Mr Rees said. ""I can't and won't pretend the statue of a slave trader in a city I was born and grew up in wasn't an affront to me and people like me. ""People in Bristol who don't want that statue in the middle of the city came together and it is my job to unite, hear those voices and hold those truths together for people for who that statue is a personal affront.

Police said a ""tactical decision"" was taken by officers at the protest not to intervene as people pulled the statue down. Supt Andy Bennett said although he was ""disappointed, he did understand"" as the statue had caused ""a lot of angst"" for the city's black community. The Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers in England and Wales, has criticised the decision not to intervene, saying it sent a negative message.

One benefit of viewing from your car: no huddling around artworks Pandemic-required lockdowns have prompted drive-in meals,
drive-in cinemas, even drive-in church services. And now: a drive-in art
gallery. At the weekend a car park at Germanyâs Cologne/Bonn airport
became a space for artists to display their creations, as big indoor
exhibitions have been cancelled. It is one way to support artists hit hard by the freeze on artistic events, said organiser and artist Dieter Nusbaum. ""We saw the trolleys and they have the perfect
height should you look at a painting from the car, so we were given 300
trolleys by the airport,â he said. âThe big pictures we have placed quite unorthodoxly, on
the ground. We are quite practical in that wayâ¦ we are just happy that we were
able to set it up at all."" The charge was â¬4.50 (Â£4) per car, per hour. The grounding of most flights meant the car park had plenty of free space Fifty artists displayed about 300 paintings and sculptures Jonathan MarcusBBC Diplomatic and defence correspondent Will
the world that emerges from the Covid-19 pandemic be more peaceful, or, will it
be more divided, more unstable and more open to conflict? This debate has been
raging in the pages of the worldâs leading foreign policy journal, Foreign Affairs. And the latest contribution is
decidedly pessimistic. The authors argue that there is unlikely to
be a âcoronavirus peace dividendâ. In many countries - even in some of the most
developed - the crisis has highlighted inequalities and contributed to domestic
unrest. In authoritarian states (and beyond) the technological opportunities
for monitoring have raised additional concerns about civil liberties. Social
media spreads conspiracy theories and racism as contagious as the virus itself.
Economic instability promises tensions for some years to come as nations turn
inward. There is, of course, a contrary view - that good will indeed come from
this crisis. But look around. For now the pessimists seem more realistic. Soread the article,externaland join the debate.

The traffic spike also coincided with a rise in online searches for information on symptoms like ""cough"" and âdiarrheaâ. Dr John Brownstein, who led the research, said the evidence was circumstantial, but told ABC News that it would provide important context in the search for the virus' origins. âSomething was happening in October,â said Dr Brownstein. âClearly, there was some level of social disruption taking place well before what was previously identified as the start of the novel coronavirus pandemic.â On 31 December 2019, China reported a cluster of pneumonia cases with an unknown cause to the World Health Organization.

Microsoft has yet to reveal the cost of the forthcoming Xbox Series X The biggest challenge facing Microsoft and Sony's next generation consoles - the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 - might not be proving the most powerful or having the best games at launch but the fallout from Covid-19.

A cut in public funding has left the arts sector in England more exposed to the threat of Covid-19,new figures suggest. The latest Arts Index, which is published annually by the National Campaign for the Arts (NCA), showed public investment in the arts per head of the population fell by 35% in the last decade. The NCA said the sector had been ""brought to its knees"" amid the coronavirus pandemic, adding that many companies now face ""ruinous losses"". While galleries and cinemas are putting plans in place to reopen, theatres and concert venues will remain closed for the foreseeable future. The government said it had announced ""unprecedented financial aid"" for the sector and was working with it on how to reopen safely and plan for the future. The economic downturn in the US triggered by the pandemic has been officially declared a recession.

Adam EastonWarsaw Correspondent Poland has recorded 599 new coronavirus cases on Monday, the highest daily rise in the country since the start of the pandemic. The cause of the spike has been an outbreak among coal miners in Upper Silesia. Just one coal mine, Zofiowka, run by state coking coal producer JSW, accounted for 60% of the new cases on Saturday and 34% on Sunday. On Monday, 54% of all new cases were recorded in Upper Silesia, southern Poland, home to the majority of Polandâs coal mines. In response, the government has announced that it will temporarily close 12 mines for three weeks to allow it to conduct mass testing. Poland is the biggest hard coal producer in the EU and the country generates about 50% of its electricity from hard coal. Power generation is not under threat, though, because coal stockpiles are at a very high level. Polish authorities have recorded far fewer cases and deaths than many western European countries.

"The UK has been warned by the pharmaceutical industry that some stockpiles of medical supplies have been ""used up entirely"" by the virus. A memo seen by the BBC advises the government to buy and store ""critical"" medicines to treat the virus. Drug makers fear stockpiles cannot feasibly be built back up again in time, if the UK should fail to strike a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU. The government said ""robust contingency plans are in place"". The spokesperson added: ""We want a relationship with the EU which is based on friendly cooperation between sovereign equals and centred on free trade."" However, firms fear disruption to global supply chains will seriously impact the NHS. The internal pharmaceutical industry memo, which was prepared for the government in May, warns that after the pandemic ends, there will be ""less or zero product available in the market to allow for stockpiling a broad range of products"" than there was in 2019, when stockpiling occurred in preparation for a possible no-deal Brexit. At the time, the industry itself paid for six weeks' worth of stockpiles. ""Preparations for the end of the transition period must complement plans to secure the supply of coronavirus therapeutic and supportive products,"" the memo says. The pandemic has led to a massive increase in demand for medicines not previously stockpiled for critical care and respiratory medicines, such as inhalers. The pharmaceutical industry is predicting a massive disruption to supply chains in the event of a no-deal Brexit At the same time, coronavirus lockdown measures imposed by governments have caused significant supply bottlenecks due to factory closures and export bans, as well as a drastic decline in air freight. The memo was put together by a cross section of pharmaceutical industry groups anticipating preparations for a failure to strike a trade deal with the EU, alongside a refusal to extend the negotiating period. If this happens,the UK would trade on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms, which would mean trade barriers from the start of next year. The memo goes on to remind the government that the flow of medicines has been kept going through the pandemic thanks to ""international coordination and information sharing within global companies to ramp up, and where necessary, redirect manufacturing"". As a result, the pharmaceutical industry writes: ""We would warn against any drastic policies mandating wholesale changes to global supply chains, as this could fundamentally disrupt the supply of medicines for the NHS and patients in other countries."" The pharmaceutical industryhas long anticipated that a no-deal Brexit could cause congestionat the ports of Dover and Calais, which is the route that 90% of imported drugs and medicines from the EU take to get to the UK. As a result, the industry has advised that the government itself will have to buy and store a longer list of ""critical products"" where ""supply could be challenging due to either COVID-19 or the end of the [Brexit] transition period"". No-deal Brexit: Drug supply plans not yet clear UK's chief medical officers dashed PM's 'hopes' to lower coronavirus alert Why a billion items of PPE is not enough The need for trading stability is even more important this year, because the pattern of demand for medicines is likely to be very different to normal. That means, the memo says, that the government needs to develop a new broader list of critical products which ""reflect the challenges posed by both the end of the transition period and continues response"" to the coronavirus crisis. The memo also emphasises that the government needs to be storing a much broader list of medicines going forward, because of the joint challenge of the pandemic and in the event of a no-deal Brexit deal at the end of this year. But the pharmaceutical industry says that to have significant impact, the stockpiling will have to start in the next few weeks, and even after the pandemic ends, stockpiling will not be possible for every medicine required. Drug makers say they have been working ""round the clock"" to keep medicine supply chains running through the pandemic In a normal year, Christmas would be ""the worst time of year to ask companies to increase their stockpile levels"", the memo says. The pharmaceutical industry is expecting the system of no-deal government-chartered freight ferries and aeroplanes to be re-established, given that border disruption is expected at the end of the Brexit transition period. It says the government needs to signal that this will be the case by next month. And it has requested ""urgent clarity"" on the implementation of arrangements for Irish Sea trade, under the Northern Ireland Protocol. The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI), one of the organisations involved in drafting the report, says firms had ""worked around the clock"" during the pandemic to make sure medicine supply chains held up. ""With this pressure likely to continue over the coming months, the pandemic has reinforced why it is essential that the UK and EU reach a deal on their future relationship,"" said ABPI's chief executive Dr Richard Torbett. In the meantime, he said its members would continue to work closely with government to put detailed plans in place. ""But not everything is in the gift of industry. Stockpiling is one element - having alternative supply routes and making sure that goods can continue to flow uninterrupted across borders is also critical,"" he stressed.

"Colin Powell was the US chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1989-93 Former US Secretary of State Colin Powell has strongly criticised President Donald Trump's handling of anti-racism protests, saying he has ""drifted away"" from the constitution. The Republican, a former top military officer, is the latest to condemn Mr Trump's response, including his threats to use the army to quell unrest. He said he would vote for Democratic candidate Joe Biden in November's poll. President Trump responded by calling Mr Powell ""highly overrated"". Mr Powell, the only African American so far to have served as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has joined a growing list of former top military officials to have launched scathing attacks on President Trump. Breonna Taylor: Protesters call on people to 'say her name' Why I decided not to watch Floyd's video It comes amid days of nationwide protests against racism and police brutality sparked by the death of African-American George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis on 25 May. On Sunday, nine of 13 Minneapolis City Council members pledged in front of hundreds of protesters to dismantle the local police department and instead create ""a new model of public safety that actually keeps our community safe"". Meanwhile, security measures across the US were lifted as unrest started to ease. New York ended its nearly week-long curfew, and Mr Trump said he was ordering the National Guard to start withdrawing from Washington DC. Speaking on CNN's State of the Union on Sunday, Mr Powell said:,external""We have a constitution. And we have to follow that constitution. And the president has drifted away from it."" Referring to President Trump, the retired four-star general said: ""He lies about things, and he gets away with it because people will not hold him accountable."" This video can not be played ""Keep pushing"": Washington DC protesters on keeping the momentum going Mr Powell also said the president's rhetoric is a danger to American democracy and said, referring to this year's presidential election: ""I certainly cannot in any way support President Trump this year."" He added: ""I'm very close to Joe Biden in a social matter and political matter. I worked with him for 35, 40 years. And he is now the candidate, and I will be voting for him."" Mr Powell, who is seen as a moderate Republican, did not vote for Mr Trump in the 2016 poll. In the interview, he also backed America's military leaders who had criticised Mr Trump in recent days. Gen Martin Dempsey, Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman under Barack Obama, told ABC's The Week earlier on Sunday that the president's words had hurt relations between the US public and the military. Andformer Defence Secretary James Mattis last week accused Mr Trump of deliberately stoking division,saying he ""angry and appalled"" by Mr Trump's handling of the protests. On Twitter, Mr Trump said Colin Powell was ""a real stiff who was very responsible for getting us into the disastrous Middle East Wars"", referring to the 1990-93 Gulf War and the US-led invasion in Iraq in 2003.

This video can not be played The US's history of racial inequality has paved the way for modern day police brutality George Floyd, 46, died in police custody in Minneapolis on 25 May. Video showed him pinned to the floor, with a white police officer kneeling on his neck for almost nine minutes. Officer Derek Chauvin has been dismissed and charged with murder. Three other officers who were at the scene have also been sacked and charged with aiding and abetting. Mr Floyd's funeral is scheduled for Tuesday in Houston, his home city before he moved to Minneapolis. 25 May 2020 George Floyd dies after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Footage shows a white officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floydâs neck for several minutes while he is pinned to the floor. Mr Floyd is heard repeatedly saying ""I canât breathe"". He is pronounced dead later in hospital. 26 May Four officers involved in the arrest of George Floyd are fired. Protests begin as the video of the arrest is shared widely on social media. Hundreds of demonstrators take to the streets of Minneapolis and vandalise police cars and the police station with graffiti. 27 May Protests spread to other cities including Memphis and Los Angeles. In some places, like Portland, Oregon, protesters lie in the road, chanting ""I canât breathe"". Demonstrators again gather around the police station in Minneapolis where the officers involved in George Floydâs arrest were based and set fire to it. The building is evacuated and police retreat. 28 May President Trump blames the violence on a lack of leadership in Minneapolis and threatens to send in the National Guard in a tweet. Â He follows it up in a second tweet with a warning ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"". The second tweet is hidden by Twitter for ""glorifying violence"". 29 May A CNN reporter, Omar Jimenez, is arrested while covering the Minneapolis protest. Mr Jimenez was reporting live when police officers handcuffed him. A few minutes later several of his colleagues are also arrested. They are all later released once they are confirmed to be members of the media. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, 44, is charged with murder and manslaughter. The charges carry a combined maximum 35-year sentence. 31 May Violence spreads across the US on the sixth night of protests. A total of at least five people are reported killed in protests from Indianapolis to Chicago. More than 75 cities have seen protests. At least 4,400 people have been arrested. Â Curfews are imposed across the US to try to stem the unrest. 1 June President Trump threatens to send in the military to quell growing civil unrest. He says if cities and states fail to control the protests and ""defend their residents"" he will deploy the army and ""quickly solve the problem for them"". Mr Trump poses in front of a damaged church shortly after police used tear gas to disperse peaceful protesters nearby. 2 June Tens of thousands of protesters again take to the streets. One of the biggest protests is in George Floydâs hometown of Houston, Texas. Many defy curfews in several cities, but the demonstrations are largely peaceful. 4 June A memorial service for George Floyd is held in Minneapolis. Â Those gathered in tribute stand in silence for eight minutes, 46 seconds, the amount of time Mr Floyd is alleged to have been on the ground under arrest. Hundreds attended the service, which heard a eulogy from civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton. 7 June As the US saw another weekend of protests, with tens of thousands marching in Washington DC, anti-racism demonstrations were held around the world. In Australia, there were major protests in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane that focused on the treatment of indigenous Australians. There were also demonstrations in France, Germany, Spain and the UK. In Bristol, protesters tore down the statue of a 17th century slave trader and threw it into the harbour. 9 June A funeral service for George Floyd is held in Houston, Mr Floydâs home town. Just over two weeks after his death in Minneapolis and worldwide anti-racism protests, about 500 guests invited by the Floyd family are in attendance at the Fountain of Praise Church.

"This video can not be played ""No clarity"" over driving lesson restart Learner drivers have been left without clear guidance about when they will be able to take their tests, driving instructors have said. They say there has been ""no communication"" from the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA). Steve Britton, a driving instructor from Bridgend, said instructors were ""frustrated"". The DVSA said it was keeping the situation under ""constant review"" in line with guidance. Ela Owen, 17, of Llanrwst in Conwy, had her test cancelled in March and rearranged for 28 July.

Rhydian Hughes says he would not consider installing a plastic screen in his car The DVSA, which is responsible for driving tests and approving driving instructors, has suspended tests until 20 June at the earliest, to help prevent the spread of coronavirus. The latest figures available show that between July and September 2019, 32,340 driving tests took place in Wales. Instructor Steve Britton said the backlog could be ""four, five even six months"" and he found it difficult to see how to make lessons safe. ""I've got a visor and masks but no information from anybody about how it's going to be used,"" he said. Aaron Farmer, 18, who is one of Mr Britton's students, said he was waiting for his cancelled test to be rearranged. He said his frustration had been increasing as lockdown measures have been easing. Mr Farmer, who has not driven a car for two months, said: ""It would probably take me a good few weeks again to get back into it and a lot of hours behind the wheel."" Instructor Steve Britton says he cannot see how you can make lessons safe The Driving Instructors Association said it was concerned at a lack of information available for instructors and students. A spokesman said: ""Throughout this crisis there has been a disappointing lack of communication from the regulator. ""We've excused some of that in the earlier phase of this crisis as we are dealing with an unprecedented pandemic and every government agency is on the back foot to some degree in terms of issuing guidance. ""However, we are at a point now where guidance in crucial."" He added: ""If the regulator knows now that they are not in a position to resume testing at the end of this month, then communicate that to trainers and their pupils now."" In a statement the DVSA said: ""We understand how challenging the current situation is for the industry but our top priority is to stop the spread of coronavirus and keep everyone safe.

"Demonstrators have defended the dismantling of the police department in Minneapolis A majority of Minneapolis City Council has pledged to dismantle the local police department, a significant move amid nationwide protests sparked by George Floyd's death last month. Nine of the 13 councillors said a ""new model of public safety"" would be created in a city where law enforcement has been accused of racism. Mayor Jacob Frey earlier opposed the move, drawing boos from the crowds. Activists, who for years have demanded such a step, called it a turning point. But commentators say Minneapolis can now expect a long and complex debate over policing, and it remains unclear what form structural reform will take. Mr Floyd's death in police custody triggered mass protests against racism and police brutality. What Trump states make of unrest Five pieces of context to understand protests Why I decided not to watch Floyd's video Timeline: From Kaepernick kneeling to NFL apology Officer Derek Chauvin, who knelt on Mr Floyd's neck for almost nine minutes, has been dismissed and charged with second-degree murder. He will make his first court appearance later on Monday. Three other officers who were at the scene have also been sacked and charged with aiding and abetting. The nine councillors read a statement to hundreds of protesters on Sunday. ""We are here because here in Minneapolis and in cities across the United States it is clear that our existing system of policing and public safety is not keeping our communities safe,"" City Council President Lisa Bender was quoted as saying. ""Our efforts at incremental reform have failed. Period."" Ms Bender said details of the overhaul plan needed to be discussed further, adding that she would try to shift police funding towards community based strategies. Meanwhile,councillor Alondra Cano tweeted that ""a veto-proof majority"" in the council,externalhad agreed that the city police department was ""not reformable and that we're going to end the current policing system"". This video can not be played The history of police violence in the US Last week, Minnesota launched a civil rights investigation of the Minneapolis Police Department, with Governor Tim Walz saying he wanted to root out ""systemic racism that is generations deep"". The city council later voted for a number of policing changes, including the ban on chokeholds and neck restraints by police officers. The reform plan in Minneapolis sets up what is likely to be a complicated discussion over new ways of policing across the US. But the process of setting up a new system will probably take months, and is not guaranteed because of the mayor's opposition. Reacting to the announcement, Kandace Montgomery, the director of the Minnesota-based campaign group Black Vision, said: ""It shouldn't have taken so much death to get us here. We're safer without armed, unaccountable patrols supported by the state hunting black people."" On Monday, Democrats in Congress are expected to present sweeping legislation on police reform. VIEWPOINT:Tipping point for racially divided nation WATCH:'This is why we are protesting' TIMELINE:Recent black deaths at hands of police BACKGROUND:Five pieces of context to understand the protests CRIME AND JUSTICE:How are African Americans treated? New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio had already said he would divert money from the city's police department to social services. ""Defund the police"" was a rallying cry during the latest street protests, that occasionally spilled into violence and looting. This video can not be played The US's history of racial inequality has paved the way for modern day police brutality ""Defunding"" advocates have for years been condemning what they describe as the aggressive militarised policing in the US. They argue that police departments' budgets should be slashed and funds diverted to social programmes to avoid unnecessary confrontation and heal the racial divide. Entire city police departments have been disbanded before in the country: in Compton, California, in 2000, and 12 years later in Camden, New Jersey. In both cases they were replaced with bigger new forces that covered local counties. Demonstrators gathered again on Sunday in US cities including Washington DC, New York, and Los Angeles - where a local broadcaster estimated 20,000 people had rallied down Hollywood Boulevard. Republican Senator Mitt Romney tweeted pictures of himself marching towards the White House with Christian protesters, with the caption ""Black Lives Matter."" The protests were mostly peaceful, and security measures across the US were lifted as unrest started to ease. However, Seattle Police Department said a man drove a car into a demonstration there on Sunday night, before shooting and wounding a 27-year-old bystander. The UK also saw sizeable weekend protests in support of Black Lives Matter, with demonstrations in cities including London, Manchester, Cardiff, Leicester and Sheffield. Protesters tear down statue amid anti-racism demos Protesters in London knelt for a minute's silence before chanting ""no justice, no peace"". In Australia, tens of thousands joined anti-racism protests in Brisbane, Melbourne, Hobart, Adelaide and elsewhere, despite warnings from officials over the coronavirus. 25 May 2020 George Floyd dies after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Footage shows a white officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floydâs neck for several minutes while he is pinned to the floor. Mr Floyd is heard repeatedly saying ""I canât breathe"". He is pronounced dead later in hospital. 26 May Four officers involved in the arrest of George Floyd are fired. Protests begin as the video of the arrest is shared widely on social media. Hundreds of demonstrators take to the streets of Minneapolis and vandalise police cars and the police station with graffiti. 27 May Protests spread to other cities including Memphis and Los Angeles. In some places, like Portland, Oregon, protesters lie in the road, chanting ""I canât breathe"". Demonstrators again gather around the police station in Minneapolis where the officers involved in George Floydâs arrest were based and set fire to it. The building is evacuated and police retreat. 28 May President Trump blames the violence on a lack of leadership in Minneapolis and threatens to send in the National Guard in a tweet. Â He follows it up in a second tweet with a warning ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"". The second tweet is hidden by Twitter for ""glorifying violence"". 29 May A CNN reporter, Omar Jimenez, is arrested while covering the Minneapolis protest. Mr Jimenez was reporting live when police officers handcuffed him. A few minutes later several of his colleagues are also arrested. They are all later released once they are confirmed to be members of the media. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, 44, is charged with murder and manslaughter. The charges carry a combined maximum 35-year sentence. 31 May Violence spreads across the US on the sixth night of protests. A total of at least five people are reported killed in protests from Indianapolis to Chicago. More than 75 cities have seen protests. At least 4,400 people have been arrested. Â Curfews are imposed across the US to try to stem the unrest. 1 June President Trump threatens to send in the military to quell growing civil unrest. He says if cities and states fail to control the protests and ""defend their residents"" he will deploy the army and ""quickly solve the problem for them"". Mr Trump poses in front of a damaged church shortly after police used tear gas to disperse peaceful protesters nearby. 2 June Tens of thousands of protesters again take to the streets. One of the biggest protests is in George Floydâs hometown of Houston, Texas. Many defy curfews in several cities, but the demonstrations are largely peaceful. 4 June A memorial service for George Floyd is held in Minneapolis. Â Those gathered in tribute stand in silence for eight minutes, 46 seconds, the amount of time Mr Floyd is alleged to have been on the ground under arrest. Hundreds attended the service, which heard a eulogy from civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton. 7 June As the US saw another weekend of protests, with tens of thousands marching in Washington DC, anti-racism demonstrations were held around the world. In Australia, there were major protests in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane that focused on the treatment of indigenous Australians. There were also demonstrations in France, Germany, Spain and the UK. In Bristol, protesters tore down the statue of a 17th century slave trader and threw it into the harbour. 9 June A funeral service for George Floyd is held in Houston, Mr Floydâs home town. Just over two weeks after his death in Minneapolis and worldwide anti-racism protests, about 500 guests invited by the Floyd family are in attendance at the Fountain of Praise Church. Â Many more gather outside to show their support.

"New rules requiring all people arriving in the UK to self-isolate for 14 days have come into effect. Those arriving by plane, ferry or train - including UK nationals - must give an address where they will self-isolate. Rule breakers will be fined. Home Secretary Priti Patel has said the laws were designed ""to prevent a second wave"" of coronavirus. But the boss of Ryanair has said the rules are a ""political stunt"" and are not a quarantine. Michael O'Leary told the BBC: ""You could be in Sainsbury's, you could be on the beach, you could be on the golf course in the unlikely event the Home Office calls you - all they will have is a mobile number."" He claimed even the Home Office acknowledged the rules were unenforceable. Some industries have warned they will be severely impacted by the rules, and Mr O'Leary warned of devastation. What's the chance of going on holiday? Ryanair boss's face mask claim fact-checked BA refuses to meet Home Secretary over quarantine plans Quarantine rules a 'killer blow' for travel sector Despite criticism from businesses, Ms Patel has said the measures are ""proportionate"" and being implemented ""at the right time"". People arriving in the UK should drive their own car to their destination, where possible, and once there they must not use public transport or taxis. Arrivals must not go to work, school, or public areas, or have visitors - except for essential support. They are also not allowed to go out to buy food, or other essentials, where they can rely on others. Those arriving in England, Wales and Northern Ireland could face a fine of Â£1,000 if they fail to self-isolate for the full 14 days, while they face a Â£480 finein Scotland.The maximum fine for repeat offenders in Scotland is Â£5,000. For more on the rulesclick here. Almost all travellers have to fill in a ""public health passenger locator"" form on arrival. Failure to do so could lead to a penalty of Â£100, or travellers may be refused entry. If they are unable to provide an address, the government will arrange accommodation at the traveller's expense. It says there will also be checks to see whether the rules are being followed. One airline passenger who was flying out to Germany from Stansted for work but lives in the UK, said he may have to stay overseas for longer because of the 14-day quarantine rule. He told the BBC: ""I have to consider coming back or not."" He also said the UK's quarantine rule ""makes no sense because in Germany [there is] a rate less than here and infection is more likely here in the UK than in Germany so for me it makes no sense."" Anyone arriving from the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man does not have to complete a form or enter quarantine.

The union representing UK Border Force staff said the rules were complex and they were not fully prepared. Lucy Moreton, professional officer at the Immigration Services Union, told the BBC that technical papers explaining what to check for only arrived on Friday and were still not available to those operating on the front line. She said there 42 categories that were exempt from the quarantine rules. Ms Moreton added there was no system for checking addresses and only flagrant rule-flouters - such as using the name Mickey Mouse - would be picked up. An internal memo, seen by the BBC, told Border Force agents that the fines would not apply to passengers arriving in the UK through Ireland, who are covered by a separate set of rules. The travel industry has been vocal in its criticism of the government's quarantine rules, warning that the isolation period will deter visitors and put jobs at risk. The manufacturing industry has also highlighted that fewer flights will restrict imports and exports, which will have a knock-on effect for the freight industry, as well as hampering the recovery of some businesses. Stansted Airport encourages passengers in the departure lounge to practice social distancing and disinfects seating areas British Airways, EasyJet and Ryanair have written to Procurator General Sir Jonathan Jones, the government's most senior legal official - the first stage required when taking legal action against the government. The airlines say they are prepared to ask for a judicial reviewinto the government's travel quarantine rules. Travel trade body Abta has called on the government to urgently create a roadmap for restarting international travel, while the UK's biggest airport services company, Swissport, has warned it could deliver a ""killer blow"" to the tourism sector. Industry leaders wrote to Prime Minister Boris Johnsonin May asking that the government avoid taking a ""blanket approach"" to quarantine, suggesting so-called ""air bridges"" with countries that have low coronavirus rates. Aviation, maritime and rail industry leaders were invited to discuss the new quarantine plans butBritish Airways refused to attend the meeting, and aviation bosses told the BBC that they were not impressed by the content of the call.

Separately, Heathrow Airport's chief executive has warned that about 25,000 jobs could be at risk at Heathrow Airport. Government sources have told the BBC that the UK is hoping to secure air bridge agreements with certain countries, such as Portugal, Spain and France, as well as Australia and Singapore.

"Colin Powell was the US chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1989-93 Former US Secretary of State Colin Powell has strongly criticised President Donald Trump's handling of anti-racism protests, saying he has ""drifted away"" from the constitution. The Republican, a former top military officer, is the latest to condemn Mr Trump's response, including his threats to use the army to quell unrest. He said he would vote for Democratic candidate Joe Biden in November's poll. President Trump responded by calling Mr Powell ""highly overrated"". Mr Powell, the only African American so far to have served as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has joined a growing list of former top military officials to have launched scathing attacks on President Trump. Breonna Taylor: Protesters call on people to 'say her name' Why I decided not to watch Floyd's video It comes amid days of nationwide protests against racism and police brutality sparked by the death of African-American George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis on 25 May. On Sunday, nine of 13 Minneapolis City Council members pledged in front of hundreds of protesters to dismantle the local police department and instead create ""a new model of public safety that actually keeps our community safe"". Meanwhile, security measures across the US were lifted as unrest started to ease. New York ended its nearly week-long curfew, and Mr Trump said he was ordering the National Guard to start withdrawing from Washington DC. Speaking on CNN's State of the Union on Sunday, Mr Powell said:,external""We have a constitution. And we have to follow that constitution. And the president has drifted away from it."" Referring to President Trump, the retired four-star general said: ""He lies about things, and he gets away with it because people will not hold him accountable."" This video can not be played ""Keep pushing"": Washington DC protesters on keeping the momentum going Mr Powell also said the president's rhetoric is a danger to American democracy and said, referring to this year's presidential election: ""I certainly cannot in any way support President Trump this year."" He added: ""I'm very close to Joe Biden in a social matter and political matter. I worked with him for 35, 40 years. And he is now the candidate, and I will be voting for him."" Mr Powell, who is seen as a moderate Republican, did not vote for Mr Trump in the 2016 poll. In the interview, he also backed America's military leaders who had criticised Mr Trump in recent days. Gen Martin Dempsey, Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman under Barack Obama, told ABC's The Week earlier on Sunday that the president's words had hurt relations between the US public and the military. Andformer Defence Secretary James Mattis last week accused Mr Trump of deliberately stoking division,saying he ""angry and appalled"" by Mr Trump's handling of the protests. On Twitter, Mr Trump said Colin Powell was ""a real stiff who was very responsible for getting us into the disastrous Middle East Wars"", referring to the 1990-93 Gulf War and the US-led invasion in Iraq in 2003.

One benefit of viewing from your car: no huddling around artworks Pandemic-required lockdowns have prompted drive-in meals,

the world that emerges from the Covid-19 pandemic be more peaceful, or, will it
be more divided, more unstable and more open to conflict? This debate has been
raging in the pages of the worldâs leading foreign policy journal, Foreign Affairs. And the latest contribution is
decidedly pessimistic. The authors argue that there is unlikely to
be a âcoronavirus peace dividendâ. In many countries - even in some of the most
developed - the crisis has highlighted inequalities and contributed to domestic
unrest. In authoritarian states (and beyond) the technological opportunities
for monitoring have raised additional concerns about civil liberties. Social
media spreads conspiracy theories and racism as contagious as the virus itself.
Economic instability promises tensions for some years to come as nations turn
inward. There is, of course, a contrary view - that good will indeed come from
this crisis. But look around. For now the pessimists seem more realistic. Soread the article,externaland join the debate.

Adam EastonWarsaw Correspondent Poland has recorded 599 new coronavirus cases on Monday, the highest daily rise in the country since the start of the pandemic. The cause of the spike has been an outbreak among coal miners in Upper Silesia. Just one coal mine, Zofiowka, run by state coking coal producer JSW, accounted for 60% of the new cases on Saturday and 34% on Sunday. On Monday, 54% of all new cases were recorded in Upper Silesia, southern Poland, home to the majority of Polandâs coal mines. In response, the government has announced that it will temporarily close 12 mines for three weeks to allow it to conduct mass testing. Poland is the biggest hard coal producer in the EU and the country generates about 50% of its electricity from hard coal. Power generation is not under threat, though, because coal stockpiles are at a very high level. Polish authorities have recorded far fewer cases and deaths than many western European countries.

Thousands of people have flocked to the area's beaches in recent weeks,with local groups complaining about ""horrendous"" amounts of litter left behind Volunteers from clean-up group GoPladdle said they also found discarded PPE items and food wrappers at Lake Pier in Hamwothy, Poole. ""While we can commend the great effort some people went to, to disguise their faeces inside takeaway containers, yoghurt pots, towels, blankets, socks and crisp packets, we did not enjoy clearing it up,"" a spokesman for the group said, describing the job as ""stomach churning"". One benefit of viewing from your car: no huddling around artworks Pandemic-required lockdowns have prompted drive-in meals,
drive-in cinemas, even drive-in church services. And now: a drive-in art
gallery. At the weekend a car park at Germanyâs Cologne/Bonn airport
became a space for artists to display their creations, as big indoor
exhibitions have been cancelled. It is one way to support artists hit hard by the freeze on artistic events, said organiser and artist Dieter Nusbaum. ""We saw the trolleys and they have the perfect
height should you look at a painting from the car, so we were given 300
trolleys by the airport,â he said. âThe big pictures we have placed quite unorthodoxly, on
the ground. We are quite practical in that wayâ¦ we are just happy that we were
able to set it up at all."" The charge was â¬4.50 (Â£4) per car, per hour. The grounding of most flights meant the car park had plenty of free space Fifty artists displayed about 300 paintings and sculptures Jonathan MarcusBBC Diplomatic and defence correspondent Will
the world that emerges from the Covid-19 pandemic be more peaceful, or, will it
be more divided, more unstable and more open to conflict? This debate has been
raging in the pages of the worldâs leading foreign policy journal, Foreign Affairs. And the latest contribution is
decidedly pessimistic. The authors argue that there is unlikely to
be a âcoronavirus peace dividendâ. In many countries - even in some of the most
developed - the crisis has highlighted inequalities and contributed to domestic
unrest. In authoritarian states (and beyond) the technological opportunities
for monitoring have raised additional concerns about civil liberties. Social
media spreads conspiracy theories and racism as contagious as the virus itself.
Economic instability promises tensions for some years to come as nations turn
inward. There is, of course, a contrary view - that good will indeed come from
this crisis. But look around. For now the pessimists seem more realistic. Soread the article,externaland join the debate.

"This video can not be played Protesters in Bristol pull down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston A slave trader's statue in Bristol has been torn down and thrown into the harbour during a second day of anti-racism protests across the UK. It comes after largely peaceful demonstrations across the weekend saw some clashes with police. On Sunday evening, police in central London issued a dispersal order for the City of Westminster compelling people to leave the area after skirmishes. Boris Johnson tweeted that the protests had been""subverted by thuggery"",external. Thousands of protesters massed for a second day in London, as well as cities across the UK including Bristol, Manchester,Wolverhampton, Nottingham, Glasgowand Edinburgh. Protests were generally peaceful, with aerial footage showing thousands of demonstrators flooding the roads outside the US embassy in Vauxhall, south London, before marching towards Parliament Square and Downing Street. But there were some disturbances, leading to 12 arrests in London - the majority for public order offences and one for criminal damage. Eight officers were injured, police said. Met police issued a dispersal order on Sunday evening compelling people to leave the area One police officer sustained a head injury The Metropolitan Police's Superintendent Jo Edwards said following a ""predominantly peaceful protest"" in the capital, officers were faced with further ""scenes of violence and disorder"" which were ""entirely unacceptable"". At around 20:00 BST, bottles were thrown at police and there were clashes near Parliament. The crowd shouted ""no justice, no peace"" as they moved down Whitehall and let off smoke bombs. As darkness fell, lines of police in riot gear took up positions to contain a small group of protesters in Westminster, the BBC's Tom Symonds said. A police officer received a head injury and a Section 35 dispersal order was issued until 06:00 on Monday. The Prime Minister later tweeted: ""People have a right to protest peacefully & while observing social distancing but they have no right to attack the police. These demonstrations have been subverted by thuggery - and they are a betrayal of the cause they purport to serve. Those responsible will be held to account."" This video can not be played Aerials show thousands of protesters in London, from the US embassy to Parliament Square Earlier in the day, in Bristol, protesters used ropes to pull down the bronze statue ofEdward Colston, a prominent 17th Century slave trader, who has been a source of controversy in the city for many years. Colston was a member of the Royal African Company, which transported about 80,000 men, women and children from Africa to the Americas. On his death in 1721, he bequeathed his wealth to charities and his legacy can still be seen on Bristol's streets, memorials and buildings. After the statue was toppled, a protester was pictured with his knee on the figure's neck - reminiscent of the video showing George Floyd, the black man who died while being restrained by a Minnesota police officer. Protesters knelt on the neck of the bronze statue of Colston The statue was later dragged through the streets of Bristol and thrown into the harbour. The empty plinth was used as a makeshift stage for protesters. Anger, not joy, as slave trader's statue toppled Edward Colston: The city divided by a slave trader's legacy Slave trader plaque axed in wording row Home Secretary Priti Patel called the tearing down of the statue ""utterly disgraceful"", adding that ""it speaks to the acts of public disorder that have become a distraction from the cause people are protesting about"". ""It's right the police follow up and make sure that justice is undertaken with those individuals that are responsible for such disorderly and lawless behaviour,"" she said. In a statement, Avon and SomersetPolice confirmed there would be an investigation into the ""act of criminal damage"",external. Historian Prof David Olusoga told BBC News that the statue should have been taken down long before. He said: ""Statues are about saying 'This was a great man who did great things.' That is not true, he [Colston] was a slave trader and a murderer."" In a statement the Mayor of Bristol Marvin Rees said he knew the removal of the statue would divide opinion but it was ""important to listen to those who found the statue to represent an affront to humanity"". Thousands took part in a protest on College Green in Bristol city centre People also gathered in Edinburgh, with some describing racism as a ""pandemic"" The Parliament Square statue of Sir Winston Churchill was sprayed with graffiti In Parliament Square, the statue of Sir Winston Churchill was sprayed with graffiti, and a Black Lives Matter sign attached - an actdescribed as ""stupid and counterproductive"",externalby foreign office minister James Cleverly. And in Warwickshire, protesters caused the closure of the M6 for around an hour following on from the demonstrations in Coventry city centre. Thousands join Scottish anti-racism protests Campaigners rename streets linked to slave owners Thousands turn out for UK anti-racism protests It comes after clashes on Saturday night between police and protesters saw missiles and fireworks aimed at police and bikes thrown by some demonstrators. The Metropolitan Police said 14 officers were injured, including a mounted officer who came off a horse as it bolted down Whitehall. Met Chief Dame Cressida Dick said she was ""appalled"" by the scenes of unrest on Saturday night, which led to 14 arrests. Ms Patel said there was ""no excuse for violent behaviour"" and said the protests should stop. Protesters chant ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""no justice, no peace"" George Floyd's death in May has sparked worldwide anti-racism protests Thousands of protesters have made their way to the US Embassy near Vauxhall, south London However, speaking on Sunday morning, shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy backed the demonstrations, saying people ""cannot be silent in the face of racism"", but she urged protesters to take precautions and socially distance.

"The protests have taken place in the background of a pandemic that has disproportionately affected African Americans For more than a week, protests have shaken cities across the US following the death of a black man in police custody. George Floyd, 46, was arrested in the city of Minneapolis on 25 May for allegedly using counterfeit money to buy a pack of cigarettes. He died after a white police officer kneeled on his neck for nearly nine minutes, while he pleaded that he could not breathe. The officer, Derek Chauvin, 44, has been dismissed from the police department and charged with murder. Three other officers who were on the scene were also sacked and later charged with abetting the crime. Unrest has broken out across the country. Police have used tear gas and force against demonstrators and President Donald Trump has threatened to send in the military. Here, we look at some of the context that will help you understand the fuller picture of what is happening. There are numerous recent examples of African-American people being killed by law enforcement officers in the US. High-profile cases from recent years includePhilando Castile,Terence Crutcher,Michael BrownandAlton Sterling. In these cases the officers involved were not convicted of any criminal offence. ""I'm tired of hearing about black people dying,"" one protester in Washington DC said. ""I'm tired of being afraid just by being stopped by the cops."" George Floyd and his young daughter: his death echoed that of Eric Garner six years earlier In particular, the George Floyd case has drawn comparisons with the death of Eric Garner in July 2014. Garner, a 43-year-old father of six, was arrested in New York on suspicion of illegally selling loose cigarettes. In a video recorded by a bystander, white police officer Daniel Pantaleo can be seen with his arm wrapped around Garner's neck in a chokehold. Garner, an asthmatic, was heard repeatedly saying ""I can't breathe"" before appearing to lose consciousness. He was later pronounced dead in hospital. A state grand jury declined to charge the officer with murder. The case sparked nationwide protests, but the officer never faced any criminal charges andlost his job in 2019 - five years after Garner's death. 25 May 2020 George Floyd dies after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Footage shows a white officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floydâs neck for several minutes while he is pinned to the floor. Mr Floyd is heard repeatedly saying ""I canât breathe"". He is pronounced dead later in hospital. 26 May Four officers involved in the arrest of George Floyd are fired. Protests begin as the video of the arrest is shared widely on social media. Hundreds of demonstrators take to the streets of Minneapolis and vandalise police cars and the police station with graffiti. 27 May Protests spread to other cities including Memphis and Los Angeles. In some places, like Portland, Oregon, protesters lie in the road, chanting ""I canât breathe"". Demonstrators again gather around the police station in Minneapolis where the officers involved in George Floydâs arrest were based and set fire to it. The building is evacuated and police retreat. 28 May President Trump blames the violence on a lack of leadership in Minneapolis and threatens to send in the National Guard in a tweet. Â He follows it up in a second tweet with a warning ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"". The second tweet is hidden by Twitter for ""glorifying violence"". 29 May A CNN reporter, Omar Jimenez, is arrested while covering the Minneapolis protest. Mr Jimenez was reporting live when police officers handcuffed him. A few minutes later several of his colleagues are also arrested. They are all later released once they are confirmed to be members of the media. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, 44, is charged with murder and manslaughter. The charges carry a combined maximum 35-year sentence. 31 May Violence spreads across the US on the sixth night of protests. A total of at least five people are reported killed in protests from Indianapolis to Chicago. More than 75 cities have seen protests. At least 4,400 people have been arrested. Â Curfews are imposed across the US to try to stem the unrest. 1 June President Trump threatens to send in the military to quell growing civil unrest. He says if cities and states fail to control the protests and ""defend their residents"" he will deploy the army and ""quickly solve the problem for them"". Mr Trump poses in front of a damaged church shortly after police used tear gas to disperse peaceful protesters nearby. 2 June Tens of thousands of protesters again take to the streets. One of the biggest protests is in George Floydâs hometown of Houston, Texas. Many defy curfews in several cities, but the demonstrations are largely peaceful. 4 June A memorial service for George Floyd is held in Minneapolis. Â Those gathered in tribute stand in silence for eight minutes, 46 seconds, the amount of time Mr Floyd is alleged to have been on the ground under arrest. Hundreds attended the service, which heard a eulogy from civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton. 7 June As the US saw another weekend of protests, with tens of thousands marching in Washington DC, anti-racism demonstrations were held around the world. In Australia, there were major protests in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane that focused on the treatment of indigenous Australians. There were also demonstrations in France, Germany, Spain and the UK. In Bristol, protesters tore down the statue of a 17th century slave trader and threw it into the harbour. 9 June A funeral service for George Floyd is held in Houston, Mr Floydâs home town. Just over two weeks after his death in Minneapolis and worldwide anti-racism protests, about 500 guests invited by the Floyd family are in attendance at the Fountain of Praise Church. Â Many more gather outside to show their support. In the case of George Floyd, the speed with which the officers involved were fired, and with which Derek Chauvin was arrested and charged, was unusual. Former US President Barack Obama said the protests over Floyd's deathrepresented a ""genuine and legitimate frustration over a decades-long failure to reform police practices and the broader criminal justice system."",external Datacollated by the BBC's Reality Check teamhighlights how the experience of African Americans differs from white Americans when it comes to law and order. In 2019, African Americans made up less than 14% of the population but accounted for more than 23% of the just over 1,000 fatal shootings by the police. African Americans are arrested for drug abuse at a much higher rate than white Americans even though surveys show drug use at similar levels for both groups. In 2018, African Americans represented almost a third of the country's prison population. This means there are more than 1,000 African-American inmates in federal or state prisons for every 100,000 African Americans, while there are about 200 white inmates for every 100,000 white Americans. Data from Minneapolis, where Floyd lived, also reflect these law enforcement trends. George Floyd death: Why has a US city gone up in flames? George Floyd's death did not happen in a vacuum. It came on the heels of several other high-profile incidents just in the past few weeks that have provoked debates about racism in the country. On the same day as his death, a video went viral ofa white woman in New York's Central Park calling the police after a black man asked her to put her dog on a lead. An exchange between the two started because Christian Cooper, a bird watcher, was concerned that the dog could endanger wildlife. He filmed Amy Cooper (no relation) threatening to call the police and tell them ""there's an African-American man threatening my life"". After calling the emergency operator she repeated, ""He's African American,"" before pleading for them to send an officer. Ms Cooper was fired from her job and widely condemned. In a later interview with NBC News, Mr Cooperraised the recent high-profile shooting of Ahmaud Arbery,external, a 25-year-old black man who was out jogging when he was killed by two white men in February. A third man filmed the shooting. Ahmaud Arbery was shot dead during a confrontation on 23 February The case gained widespread attention in the national media and provoked outrage. It took more than two monthsfor the suspects to be charged. ""We live in an age of Ahmaud Arbery, where black men are gunned down because of assumptions people make about black men, black people, and I'm just not going to participate in that,"" Mr Cooper said. VIEWPOINT:Tipping point for racially-divided nation WATCH:'This is why we are protesting' TIMELINE:Recent black deaths at hands of police CRIME AND JUSTICE:How are African-Americans treated? HOW IT HAPPENED:The last moments of his life Racial divisions in US society are also prevalent in areas such as housing, healthcare and employment. In 2016, the typical net worth of a white family was found to benearly 10 times greater than that of a black family,external. Compared with white Americans,African Americans are almost twice as likely not to have medical insurance,external. African Americans are more likely to work in service industry jobs and to live in densely populated areas. These issues have all contributed to African Americans being disproportionately affected by the coronavirus outbreak, which is happening at the same time as the Floyd protests. George Floyd's autopsy concluded he had coronavirus, although this played no part in his death. This video can not be played 'I'm tired of being afraid': Why Americans are protesting According to the most recent government datamore than 34% of those in hospital with coronavirus are black,external, out of 19,775 cases where race and ethnicity data were available. New York City has reported that rates of Covid-19 deaths are substantially higher among African Americans than white Americans. Rates of unemployment during the pandemic, as before,are also higher among African Americans than white Americans,external. George Floyd lost his job as a bouncer as a result of the coronavirus shutdown. ""Social conditions place black people and their neighbourhoods at risk"" ""The coronavirus does not discriminate, but our housing, economic, and health care policies do,"" said Andre Perry, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of Know Your Price: Valuing Black Lives and Property in America's Black Cities. ""Environmental racism, unaffordable housing, a lack of job opportunities, poverty, and inadequate health care are underlying social conditions, strongly influenced by policy, which place black people and their neighbourhoods at risk."" Such socio-economic inequalityalso exists in Minneapolis- the city where Floyd died and where the protests began. Minneapolis has a population of about 430,000 people, less than 20% of whom are black. Even before layoffs caused by the pandemic, 10% of black residents of the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St Paul were unemployed compared with 4% of whites. In 2016, 32% of black people living there fell below the poverty line compared with 6.5% of whites. Neighbourhoods there are highly segregated and black home ownership is among the lowest in the country. ""The same attitudes that led a cop to kneel in the back of a black man's neck, choking him out are the same attitudes held by people in housing markets who facilitate the region's black-white homeownership gap of 46% to 79%,"" said Mr Perry. Donald Trump's presidency began with massive, nationwide protests. Now, it could be ending with them. The women's marches of January 2017 brought hundreds of thousands to US streets for largely peaceful demonstrations. Following George Floyd's death, the protests in the nation's capital, and across the country, have at times turned violent. And while the 2017 events were in direct reaction to Trump's inauguration, the purpose of latest uprising - addressing racial injustice and policing practices - are not specifically about the president. The president has taken the demonstrations personally, however. Like the women's marches, his actions suggest he views the Floyd marches as an attempt to undermine his presidency. The first set the stage for his administration, and these latest come just five months before he hopes to be re-elected to a second four-year term. The politics of the situation has clearly influenced the tenor of his response. He echoed a pledge to restore ""law and order"" that Richard Nixon used successfully in his 1968 and 1972 presidential victories. Trump's controversial decision to clear protesters and stand for photographs with a Bible in front of a church near the White House hints at a desire to court the evangelical voters he needs in November. Although the root causes of the Floyd protests predate the Trump presidency, the president - by his words and actions, intentional or not - have added fuel the storm. The protests over George Floyd's death have drawn attention to the use of military equipment by police officers. While images of military vehicles being used for crowd control may appear shocking to some, it is not a new phenomenon in the US. The Department of Defense began a programme in the 1990s allowing the transfer of excess military equipment to police departments. Preference is meant to be given to anti-drug and counter-terror needs. Todaymore than 8,000 federal and state law enforcement agencies participate in the programme,external. It is overseen by the Defense Logistics Agency, which has the final authority over the type and quantity of equipment made available to different agencies. It does not specify how such equipment should be used. ""With less need for such equipment in Iraq, the equipment needed to go somewhere"" Data show that surplus military equipment transferred to local law enforcement agencies under the 1033 programme has been rising since the mid-2000s, with spikes after 2010. As of 2015, more than $5bn worth of military equipment had been distributed to law enforcement agencies under the programme. Paul Poast, a political science professor at the University of Chicago, said prior to the mid-2000s much US military equipment was ""simply not as usable for law enforcement"". ""With the start of counter-insurgency fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, manufacturers began to develop weapons that one could say had more 'dual-use': be usable in urban counter-insurgency environments and usable by urban law enforcement. ""The surge starting in the 2010s can be explained by both the popularity of the equipment and the beginning of drawing down troops in Iraq. With less need for such equipment in Iraq, the equipment needed to go somewhere,"" he said. Former President Barack Obama barred the military from handing over some types of equipment after criticism that police were too heavy-handed in dealing withprotests in Ferguson, Missouri, that followed the killing of an unarmed black teenager by a white police officer in 2014. But Mr Trump lifted the restrictions in 2017. Equipment given out under the programme includes aircraft, armoured vehicles and bullet-proof helmets. Mr Poast said the use of military equipment by police was a key example of how large-scale counter-insurgency campaigns abroad can influence domestic security policy.

"New rules requiring all people arriving in the UK to self-isolate for 14 days have come into effect. Those arriving by plane, ferry or train - including UK nationals - must give an address where they will self-isolate. Rule breakers will be fined. Home Secretary Priti Patel has said the laws were designed ""to prevent a second wave"" of coronavirus. But the boss of Ryanair has said the rules are a ""political stunt"" and are not a quarantine. Michael O'Leary told the BBC: ""You could be in Sainsbury's, you could be on the beach, you could be on the golf course in the unlikely event the Home Office calls you - all they will have is a mobile number."" He claimed even the Home Office acknowledged the rules were unenforceable. Some industries have warned they will be severely impacted by the rules, and Mr O'Leary warned of devastation.

Ryanair boss's face mask claim fact-checked BA refuses to meet Home Secretary over quarantine plans Quarantine rules a 'killer blow' for travel sector Despite criticism from businesses, Ms Patel has said the measures are ""proportionate"" and being implemented ""at the right time"". People arriving in the UK should drive their own car to their destination, where possible, and once there they must not use public transport or taxis. Arrivals must not go to work, school, or public areas, or have visitors - except for essential support. They are also not allowed to go out to buy food, or other essentials, where they can rely on others. Those arriving in England, Wales and Northern Ireland could face a fine of Â£1,000 if they fail to self-isolate for the full 14 days, while they face a Â£480 finein Scotland.The maximum fine for repeat offenders in Scotland is Â£5,000. For more on the rulesclick here. Almost all travellers have to fill in a ""public health passenger locator"" form on arrival. Failure to do so could lead to a penalty of Â£100, or travellers may be refused entry. If they are unable to provide an address, the government will arrange accommodation at the traveller's expense. It says there will also be checks to see whether the rules are being followed. One airline passenger who was flying out to Germany from Stansted for work but lives in the UK, said he may have to stay overseas for longer because of the 14-day quarantine rule. He told the BBC: ""I have to consider coming back or not."" He also said the UK's quarantine rule ""makes no sense because in Germany [there is] a rate less than here and infection is more likely here in the UK than in Germany so for me it makes no sense.""

Lucy Moreton, professional officer at the Immigration Services Union, told the BBC that technical papers explaining what to check for only arrived on Friday and were still not available to those operating on the front line. She said there 42 categories that were exempt from the quarantine rules. Ms Moreton added there was no system for checking addresses and only flagrant rule-flouters - such as using the name Mickey Mouse - would be picked up. An internal memo, seen by the BBC, told Border Force agents that the fines would not apply to passengers arriving in the UK through Ireland, who are covered by a separate set of rules. The travel industry has been vocal in its criticism of the government's quarantine rules, warning that the isolation period will deter visitors and put jobs at risk. The manufacturing industry has also highlighted that fewer flights will restrict imports and exports, which will have a knock-on effect for the freight industry, as well as hampering the recovery of some businesses. Stansted Airport encourages passengers in the departure lounge to practice social distancing and disinfects seating areas British Airways, EasyJet and Ryanair have written to Procurator General Sir Jonathan Jones, the government's most senior legal official - the first stage required when taking legal action against the government.

Travel trade body Abta has called on the government to urgently create a roadmap for restarting international travel, while the UK's biggest airport services company, Swissport, has warned it could deliver a ""killer blow"" to the tourism sector. Industry leaders wrote to Prime Minister Boris Johnsonin May asking that the government avoid taking a ""blanket approach"" to quarantine, suggesting so-called ""air bridges"" with countries that have low coronavirus rates.

"Colin Powell was the US chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1989-93 Former US Secretary of State Colin Powell has strongly criticised President Donald Trump's handling of anti-racism protests, saying he has ""drifted away"" from the constitution. The Republican, a former top military officer, is the latest to condemn Mr Trump's response, including his threats to use the army to quell unrest. He said he would vote for Democratic candidate Joe Biden in November's poll. President Trump responded by calling Mr Powell ""highly overrated"". Mr Powell, the only African American so far to have served as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has joined a growing list of former top military officials to have launched scathing attacks on President Trump. Breonna Taylor: Protesters call on people to 'say her name' Why I decided not to watch Floyd's video It comes amid days of nationwide protests against racism and police brutality sparked by the death of African-American George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis on 25 May. On Sunday, nine of 13 Minneapolis City Council members pledged in front of hundreds of protesters to dismantle the local police department and instead create ""a new model of public safety that actually keeps our community safe"". Meanwhile, security measures across the US were lifted as unrest started to ease. New York ended its nearly week-long curfew, and Mr Trump said he was ordering the National Guard to start withdrawing from Washington DC. Speaking on CNN's State of the Union on Sunday, Mr Powell said:,external""We have a constitution. And we have to follow that constitution. And the president has drifted away from it."" Referring to President Trump, the retired four-star general said: ""He lies about things, and he gets away with it because people will not hold him accountable."" This video can not be played ""Keep pushing"": Washington DC protesters on keeping the momentum going Mr Powell also said the president's rhetoric is a danger to American democracy and said, referring to this year's presidential election: ""I certainly cannot in any way support President Trump this year."" He added: ""I'm very close to Joe Biden in a social matter and political matter. I worked with him for 35, 40 years. And he is now the candidate, and I will be voting for him."" Mr Powell, who is seen as a moderate Republican, did not vote for Mr Trump in the 2016 poll. In the interview, he also backed America's military leaders who had criticised Mr Trump in recent days. Gen Martin Dempsey, Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman under Barack Obama, told ABC's The Week earlier on Sunday that the president's words had hurt relations between the US public and the military. Andformer Defence Secretary James Mattis last week accused Mr Trump of deliberately stoking division,saying he ""angry and appalled"" by Mr Trump's handling of the protests. On Twitter, Mr Trump said Colin Powell was ""a real stiff who was very responsible for getting us into the disastrous Middle East Wars"", referring to the 1990-93 Gulf War and the US-led invasion in Iraq in 2003.

"This video can not be played Protesters in Bristol pull down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston A slave trader's statue in Bristol has been torn down and thrown into the harbour during a second day of anti-racism protests across the UK. It comes after largely peaceful demonstrations across the weekend saw some clashes with police. On Sunday evening, police in central London issued a dispersal order for the City of Westminster compelling people to leave the area after skirmishes. Boris Johnson tweeted that the protests had been""subverted by thuggery"",external. Thousands of protesters massed for a second day in London, as well as cities across the UK including Bristol, Manchester,Wolverhampton, Nottingham, Glasgowand Edinburgh. Protests were generally peaceful, with aerial footage showing thousands of demonstrators flooding the roads outside the US embassy in Vauxhall, south London, before marching towards Parliament Square and Downing Street. But there were some disturbances, leading to 12 arrests in London - the majority for public order offences and one for criminal damage. Eight officers were injured, police said. Met police issued a dispersal order on Sunday evening compelling people to leave the area One police officer sustained a head injury The Metropolitan Police's Superintendent Jo Edwards said following a ""predominantly peaceful protest"" in the capital, officers were faced with further ""scenes of violence and disorder"" which were ""entirely unacceptable"". At around 20:00 BST, bottles were thrown at police and there were clashes near Parliament. The crowd shouted ""no justice, no peace"" as they moved down Whitehall and let off smoke bombs. As darkness fell, lines of police in riot gear took up positions to contain a small group of protesters in Westminster, the BBC's Tom Symonds said. A police officer received a head injury and a Section 35 dispersal order was issued until 06:00 on Monday. The Prime Minister later tweeted: ""People have a right to protest peacefully & while observing social distancing but they have no right to attack the police. These demonstrations have been subverted by thuggery - and they are a betrayal of the cause they purport to serve. Those responsible will be held to account."" This video can not be played Aerials show thousands of protesters in London, from the US embassy to Parliament Square Earlier in the day, in Bristol, protesters used ropes to pull down the bronze statue ofEdward Colston, a prominent 17th Century slave trader, who has been a source of controversy in the city for many years. Colston was a member of the Royal African Company, which transported about 80,000 men, women and children from Africa to the Americas. On his death in 1721, he bequeathed his wealth to charities and his legacy can still be seen on Bristol's streets, memorials and buildings. After the statue was toppled, a protester was pictured with his knee on the figure's neck - reminiscent of the video showing George Floyd, the black man who died while being restrained by a Minnesota police officer. Protesters knelt on the neck of the bronze statue of Colston The statue was later dragged through the streets of Bristol and thrown into the harbour. The empty plinth was used as a makeshift stage for protesters. Anger, not joy, as slave trader's statue toppled Edward Colston: The city divided by a slave trader's legacy Slave trader plaque axed in wording row Home Secretary Priti Patel called the tearing down of the statue ""utterly disgraceful"", adding that ""it speaks to the acts of public disorder that have become a distraction from the cause people are protesting about"". ""It's right the police follow up and make sure that justice is undertaken with those individuals that are responsible for such disorderly and lawless behaviour,"" she said. In a statement, Avon and SomersetPolice confirmed there would be an investigation into the ""act of criminal damage"",external. Historian Prof David Olusoga told BBC News that the statue should have been taken down long before. He said: ""Statues are about saying 'This was a great man who did great things.' That is not true, he [Colston] was a slave trader and a murderer."" In a statement the Mayor of Bristol Marvin Rees said he knew the removal of the statue would divide opinion but it was ""important to listen to those who found the statue to represent an affront to humanity"".
