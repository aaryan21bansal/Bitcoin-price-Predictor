"Andrew Broadhead and his daughter Kiera both died in the blaze at their family home A burglar who killed a father and daughter in a fire he started in an attempt to cover his tracks has been jailed for 20 years. Daniel Jones, 29, set a house in Stanley, Wakefield, alight in October 2016 in a bid to destroy CCTV evidence of a nearby break-in. Andrew Broadhead, 42, and his daughter Kiera, eight, died in the fire. At Leeds Crown Court, Jones, of Knottingley, was cleared by a jury of murder but convicted of manslaughter. This video can not be played Burglar Daniel Jones was seen on CCTV buying fuel at a petrol station and setting fire to a house. More on this story and others in Leeds and West Yorkshire The court heard Mr and Mrs Broadhead and their two daughters were asleep in their home in the early hours of 19 October when Jones poured petrol through their front door letterbox and set it alight. Daniel Jones was cleared by a jury of murder but convicted of manslaughter Mrs Broadhead and Mia managed to escape, but Mr Broadhead and Kiera were overcome by the rapidly spreading smoke and were later pronounced dead at the scene in Ash Crescent. The jury heard how Jones was worried that CCTV footage from the home would reveal a raid he carried out three days earlier. Judge Mr Justice Morris gave special permission for Kiera's 13-year-old sister Mia to read a statement, in which she described her sibling as the ""world's brightest star"". Usually, children aged under 14 are not allowed to sit in the public gallery at crown court hearings. Daniel Jones set fire to the house on Ash Crescent in an attempt to destroy CCTV footage The teenager wiped away tears as she said her father was ""the world's greatest superhero"". Speaking at the witness box, she told the court: ""He was my hero. ""I am thankful for his happiness, kindness and his love for everyone - the way he was positive and how he always lifted everybody's spirits."" Speaking about her sister Kiera, she said: ""I am thankful for the eight years we had with her - for her kindness, her funniness, her caring for one another and her humour. ""She didn't deserve this, neither of them did."" Jones, of Spawd Bone Lane, thought a camera may have recorded him stealing a safe from a friend's home on the same road a few days earlier. It later turned out the camera was not even working properly. Police arrested Jones three days after the fire in Stanley During the trial, CCTV was shown of Jones buying fuel at a petrol station, then arriving at the Broadhead's home and setting fire to it. Tracker evidence was also used from his van to confirm his movements on the night of the fire, the Crown Prosecution Service said. Det Ch Insp Nicola Bryar, of West Yorkshire Police, said the crime had shocked ""the whole of West Yorkshire"". ""It is difficult to know where to start to describe the sheer madness and callousness of Jones's actions in trying to cover up a burglary by setting fire to a family home,"" she said. ""It is no exaggeration to say he has left the Broadhead family facing a lifetime of loss.""

"Twitter has suspended its verified-profile scheme and described it as ""broken"", following complaints over the type of accounts being verified. Typically, prominent people, including musicians, journalists and company executives, get a blue icon on their profile after proving their identity. However, some far-right and white-supremacist accounts have now also been verified. Twitter founderJack Dorsey,externalsaid the scheme would now be ""reconsidered"". Verified profiles display a blue badge next to their name In a statement, the company said: ""Verification was meant to authenticate identity and voice, but it is interpreted as an endorsement or an indicator of importance. ""We recognise that we have created this confusion and need to resolve it."" The company said no further ""general"" accounts would be verified, while it worked on a fix.

"The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse has admitted breaching its own procedures by publishing a victim's name despite his right to anonymity. The man's name appeared on its website in the title of a document. The inquiry said it removed the name as soon as it was brought to its attention. It was the seventh time the inquiry had been alerted to such a breach. It notified the privacy watchdog - the Information Commissioner - and said it was reviewing its practices. The inquiry, which was set up in the aftermath of the Jimmy Savile scandal, aims to investigate claims against local authorities, religious organisations, the armed forces and public and private institutions - as well as people in the public eye. The inquiry (IICSA) is protecting the identities of more than 1,000 children or victims of child sexual abuse. The life-long anonymity of victims of sexual offences is protected by law. How the child sexual abuse inquiry works Thursday's breach was spotted by a BBC journalist who alerted the inquiry to the fact that it had named a man who was applying for so-called ""core participation"" status at the inquiry. The name was given in the title of a document, published for about a day, but had redacted that information elsewhere. The inquiry said: ""We understand that the document was viewed five times during that period. ""It was removed as soon as it was brought to our attention and the individual is being contacted and will be offered support."" Since the inquiry began in March 2015, it has been alerted to seven breaches of anonymity and on four occasions, including this one, it reported itself to the Information Commissioner. There are 1,150 people taking part in the inquiry who have had their identities hidden through the use of code numbers - this includes 200 core participants who have the right to take part directly in inquiry hearings. The names of another 575 people are also protected because they are alleged perpetrators in cases where there has been no conviction or findings suggesting their guilt. Richard Scorer, specialist abuse lawyer at Slater & Gordon solicitors who acts for many core participants at the inquiry, said: ""This breach is totally unacceptable and it is extremely worrying that such a serious breach could occur. ""Such a breach would constitute contempt of court under the inquiry's own rules. ""They need to review their procedures very urgently and ensure there  is absolutely no repetition.""

"Theresa May has outlined plans to set the UK's departure date and time from the EU in law, warning she will not ""tolerate"" any attempt to block Brexit. She said the EU Withdrawal Bill would be amended to formally commit to Brexit at 23:00 GMT on Friday 29 March 2019. The bill will be scrutinised by MPs next week - but the PM warned against attempts to stop it or slow it down. Mrs May waswriting in the Daily Telegraph,externalas a fresh round of Brexit negotiations are due to begin later. The UK is due to leave the European Union after 2016's referendum in which 51.9% of voters backed Brexit. Gordon Brown predicts Brexit 'crisis point' Barnier: 'Time is pressing' in Brexit talks NI must 'abide by EU rules' to avoid hard border Brexit: All you need to know The prime minister said the decision to put the specific time of Brexit ""on the front page"" of the Brexit bill showed the government was determined to see the process through. ""Let no-one doubt our determination or question our resolve, Brexit is happening,"" she wrote. ""It will be there in black and white on the front page of this historic piece of legislation: the United Kingdom will be leaving the EU on March 29, 2019 at 11pm GMT."" The draft legislation has already passed its second reading, and now faces several attempts to amend it at the next part of its parliamentary journey - the committee stage. Mrs May said most people wanted politicians to ""come together"" to negotiate a good Brexit deal, adding that MPs ""on all sides"" should help scrutinise the bill. She said the government would listen to MPs if they had ideas for improving the bill, but warned against attempts to halt the process. Post-Brexit trade proposals published Corbyn: Agree transition deal now Rudd: Brexit without deal 'unthinkable' ""We will not tolerate attempts from any quarter to use the process of amendments to this Bill as a mechanism to try to block the democratic wishes of the British people by attempting to slow down or stop our departure from the European Union."" MPs have previously been told there have been 300 amendments and 54 new clauses proposed. David Davis is due to take part in a fresh round of Brexit negotiations The PM said the ""historic"" bill was ""fundamental to delivering a smooth and orderly Brexit"" and would give ""the greatest possible clarity and certainty for all businesses and families across the country"". Labour MP and remain campaigner, Chuka Umunna, said many experts believed the March 2019 leaving date did not give much time for negotiations. He told BBC Radio 5 live: ""Lord Bridges said he could not see the government being able to negotiate the transition arrangement, like the bridge to us leaving, and the divorce bill, by 2019.  So we may actually need more time."" Lord Kerr, the former diplomat who helped draft Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty - the mechanism the UK has used to exit the EU - said putting the Brexit date on the bill did not mean the withdrawal process was irreversible. The cross-bench peer told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that decisions such as these were being made in Westminster, and ""had nothing to do with the treaty, and they have nothing to do with the views of our partners in Brussels"". But the Conservative MP and leave campaigner, Peter Bone, welcomed the decision to enshrine the leaving date in law, saying it was a ""really big, important step"". It comesas a leaked account of a meeting of EU diplomats this weeksuggested that Northern Ireland may have to abide by the EU's rules on the customs union and single market after Brexit - in order to avoid the introduction of border checks. Both Britain and the EU say they are committed to ensuring that Brexit does not undermine the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement or lead to the emergence of hard-border with the Republic of Ireland. However, BBC correspondent Adam Fleming said the commission's suggestion appeared to be at odds with comments made by the Northern Ireland Secretary, James Brokenshire, this week. Mr Brokenshire said it was ""difficult to imagine"" Northern Ireland remaining in either the customs union or the single market after Brexit.

"Charlie Elphicke has denied any ""criminal wrongdoing"" A Conservative MP suspended by his party after ""serious allegations"" were made against him says he still does not know what he is accused of. Charlie Elphicke, a former party whip who has been the MP for Dover and Deal since 2010, has denied any ""criminal wrongdoing"". In a statement, the married 46-year-old said: ""So what then is [the] explanation for what I am accused of?"" The Conservative Party has not yet commented on his statement. Referring to an explanation for his suspension, Mr Elphicke said: ""I cannot give one. Because I do not know what I am accused of."" He claimed the process being followed by the party was ""fundamentally wrong"". The Conservatives have recently published anew code of conductfor MPs and other elected representatives. Mr Elphicke,who was suspended last Friday, added: ""The fact is that this whole area of reporting misconduct and managing allegations of misconduct is a mess."" He said he had received no further information since being told by the chief whip that serious allegations made against him had been passed to the police. ""I asked what the allegations were and he would not tell me,"" he said. ""He only said that he and the prime minister had decided the whip should be suspended from me. ""So extraordinary as it may seem, I am no wiser now than I was on Friday evening."" It is not clear which police force is dealing with the allegations, but when asked for a statement the Metropolitan Police said: ""The Met does not identify any person who may, or may not be, subject to an investigation. ""Following the receipt of any allegation, investigating officers will only make contact with potential suspects if and when it is operationally appropriate to do so."" Mr Elphicke said it was ""a denial of justice when people who have had allegations made against them, lose their job or their party whip without knowing what those allegations are"". He said this was ""fundamentally wrong"" and an ""injustice to those who stand accused"". Everyone should be ""equal before the law"", and was ""innocent until proven otherwise"". Mr Elphicke concluded: ""Whatever it turns out I stand accused of, I deny any criminal wrongdoing.""

"The comments were inadvertently left on a family answerphone by officers who had been called out to deal with a ""vulnerable child"" Two police officers have been sacked after they left a message on a woman's answer machine saying they hoped her child ""would get raped"". The Avon and Somerset officers left the recording after being called to deal with a ""vulnerable child"", a misconduct hearing was told. PC Samuel Dexter and PC Hannah Mayo are heard laughing and saying they did not care what happened to the child. Both officers admitted gross misconduct and were dismissed without notice. The hearing on Tuesday at police headquarters was told the child had been reported missing before being found by PC Dexter and reunited with the family. But a short while later,according to the hearing outcome notice,external, the child's mother called the police again to report the child was ""causing problems at the family home"". En-route to the property, PC Dexter and PC Mayo phoned the mother for more information and inadvertently activated the answerphone. In the recorded message the officers can be heard laughing and saying they had ""no interest whatsoever"" in the child and both then said they hoped the child would ""get raped"". In his verdict at the hearing, Chief Constable Andy Marsh said the comments had ""broken the trust"" the child's family had in the police. He said: ""[The comments] go way beyond the boundaries that could be described as dark humour. ""I cannot accept the comments were a mistake, they were far more serious than that, and the people we serve will be appalled to hear that police officers spoke in such a way about a child."" Ch Insp Mark Edgington, of the professional standards department, said the officers had ""failed to treat the child and their family with respect"". ""Both officers used appalling and horrific language about a vulnerable missing child and their family,"" he said. ""There are no excuses for their behaviour and their actions are not reflective of our force or the officers and staff who work extremely hard every day to safeguard and protect vulnerable people."" Both officers have offered ""fulsome apologies"" to the child and their family.

"Charlie Elphicke has denied any ""criminal wrongdoing"" A Conservative MP suspended by his party after ""serious allegations"" were made against him says he still does not know what he is accused of. Charlie Elphicke, a former party whip who has been the MP for Dover and Deal since 2010, has denied any ""criminal wrongdoing"". In a statement, the married 46-year-old said: ""So what then is [the] explanation for what I am accused of?"" The Conservative Party has not yet commented on his statement. Referring to an explanation for his suspension, Mr Elphicke said: ""I cannot give one. Because I do not know what I am accused of."" He claimed the process being followed by the party was ""fundamentally wrong"". The Conservatives have recently published anew code of conductfor MPs and other elected representatives. Mr Elphicke,who was suspended last Friday, added: ""The fact is that this whole area of reporting misconduct and managing allegations of misconduct is a mess."" He said he had received no further information since being told by the chief whip that serious allegations made against him had been passed to the police. ""I asked what the allegations were and he would not tell me,"" he said. ""He only said that he and the prime minister had decided the whip should be suspended from me. ""So extraordinary as it may seem, I am no wiser now than I was on Friday evening."" It is not clear which police force is dealing with the allegations, but when asked for a statement the Metropolitan Police said: ""The Met does not identify any person who may, or may not be, subject to an investigation. ""Following the receipt of any allegation, investigating officers will only make contact with potential suspects if and when it is operationally appropriate to do so."" Mr Elphicke said it was ""a denial of justice when people who have had allegations made against them, lose their job or their party whip without knowing what those allegations are"". He said this was ""fundamentally wrong"" and an ""injustice to those who stand accused"". Everyone should be ""equal before the law"", and was ""innocent until proven otherwise"". Mr Elphicke concluded: ""Whatever it turns out I stand accused of, I deny any criminal wrongdoing.""

"Robin Hood Gardens was built in 1972 The Victoria & Albert Museum is to display a three-storey section of an east London council estate as an example of Brutalist architecture. The section, which includes two flats, exterior facades and two interior staircases, has been acquired from Robin Hood Gardens in Poplar. Designed by renowned British architects Alison and Peter Smithson, the block is due to be demolished and redeveloped. The V&A has called it a ""significant example of the Brutalist movement"". Brutalism, a movement characterised by exposed concrete in geometric patterns, arose in the 1950s. Demolition was approved in 2015 It is regarded as a reaction to modernism, which consisted of elegant glass and steel structures. Robin Hood Gardens was built in 1972 by the Greater London Council (GLC) and was later transferred to the local authority of Tower Hamlets. The choice of Alison and Peter Smithson as architects gave the husband and wife team their only opportunity to create a council estate. Allow Twitter content?

"The duty-free sales to staff and retired workers raise revenue for the Vatican Pope Francis has ordered a ban on the sale of cigarettes inside the Vatican, beginning next year. Vatican spokesman Greg Burke said the Holy See could not co-operate with a practice that clearly harmed people's health. About 5,000 employees and retired staff of the Vatican are currently allowed to buy discounted cigarettes. The sales are estimated to bring in millions of euros every year to the Vatican. But Mr Burke said no amount of profit could be legitimate if it was costing people their lives. He cited World Health Organization figures that blame smoking for more than seven million deaths worldwide every year . ""I think many people enjoyed it as sort of a fringe benefit,"" he said. ""It comes as a bit of a sacrifice for the Holy See, this was a source of revenue, but it's obviously much more important to do what is right."" Pope Francis, who had a lung removed as a teenager, does not smoke. Vatican staff and pensioners are permitted to buy five cartons of cigarettes every month from a duty-free shop, housed in a former railway station, which is only open to those with a special pass. Correspondents say many non-smokers inside the Vatican are asked by friends outside to buy cigarettes for them because they are cheaper than in Italy where they are heavily taxed.

"Penny Mordaunt has become the UK's first female defence secretary afterGavin Williamson was sacked. She was previously international development secretary, in charge of a multi-billion pound annual budget. With a background as a naval reservist, and having served as an armed forces minister under David Cameron, Ms Mordaunt seems well prepared for the role. She was seen as a frontrunner for the defence secretary position in 2017 when Michael Fallon was forced to quit the post, but lost out to Mr Williamson. Theresa May's letter in full to Gavin Williamson Huawei - the world's most controversial company Ms Mordaunt was a high-profile campaigner for the Leave campaign during the 2016 EU referendum and underlined her pro-Brexit credentials by backing Andrea Leadsom in the subsequent Conservative leadership contest. During the referendum campaign - while a defence minister - she prompted a row by telling the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that the UK could not veto Turkey joining the European Union. The then-prime minister contradicted her on ITV's Peston on Sunday an hour later. This video can not be played Penny Mordaunt: ""We're not going to be consulted... they are going to join, it's a matter of when"" This video can not be played David Cameron: ""Britain and every other country in the EU has a veto on another country joining. That is a fact"" The daughter of a paratrooper and a special needs teacher, Ms Mordaunt has two brothers, Edward and James, who is her twin, and has lived in her home town of Portsmouth since the age of two. She was educated at Oaklands RC Comprehensive School and was the first member of her family to go to university. Before studying philosophy at Reading University, she worked as a magician's assistant for a member of the Portsmouth and District Magic Circle, Will Ayling, author of The Art of Illusion and Oriental Conjuring and Magic. She says on her website that she first became interested in politics working in hospitals and orphanages in post-revolutionary Romania during her gap year. But Ms Mordaunt, 46, is probably best known outside Westminster for her appearance on ITV's celebrity diving show Splash! to raise money for charity. This video can not be played Penny Mordaunt relives her moment diving in to a swimming pool on TV and admits ""it hurt a bit"" as she hit the water She exited the contest in January 2014 after twice mistiming her back somersault from the 7.5m board but earned praise from Tom Daley and the other judges for her have-a-go attitude. Later that year she was in the headlines again for a speech she gave in the Commons on poultry welfare, which turned out to be an excuse to slip some very un-parliamentary language into proceedings. She admitted she had made the speech - with its liberal use of ""lay"", ""laid"" and ""cock welfare"" - as a bet. ""When I was at Dartmouth doing my reservist training, some of my marine training officers thought it would be a good idea to try and break the ladylike persona that I maintained throughout the whole of my course by getting me to yell particular rude words during the most gruelling part of our training, and I'm happy to say that they failed in that,"" she said. ""But during our mess dinner at the end of the course I was fined for a misdemeanour, and the fine was to say a particular word, the abbreviation of cockerel, several times during a speech on the floor of the House of Commons and mention all of the officers' names present."" MP for Portsmouth North since 2010, Ms Mordaunt is a former head of the Conservative Party's youth wing and was a press officer for William Hague when he was party leader, during which time she was seconded to work on George W Bush's 2000 election campaign in Washington. ""I was amazed at the similarities of the issues and tactics,""she told The Daily Telegraph.,external Before entering the world of Westminster politics, she was a press officer for Kensington and Chelsea Council and the Freight Transport Association, when she supported British truckers during French blockades. She has also worked in the charity sector as a director of the Big Lottery Fund and Diabetes UK, where she set up services in developing countries particularly prone to the condition. She was also involved in David Willetts' abortive campaign to be Conservative leader in 2005 as his chief of staff. On Twitter, Ms Mordaunt describes her two main interests as ""freedom and cats"". And, in her maiden speech to Parliament in June 2010, she revealed that she had been named after the Royal Navy cruiser HMS Penelope. ""I point out to my critics,"" she added, ""that HMS Penelope latterly became known as HMS Pepperpot because of her ability to endure massive amounts of shelling and remain afloat and able to return fire.""

"Choosing ministers is about more than just who is best for the job. There are good reasons why Penny Mordaunt has been promoted to the Department for International Development. She has worked in humanitarian aid, she has been a minister in two different departments, former colleagues rate her abilities and she was tipped last week to be elevated to running the Ministry of Defence. She has slipped up at times, in the EU referendum campaign, for example, sheclaimed that the UK wouldn't be able to veto Turkey's future membership of the EUand wasproperly told off by David Cameron. But there is a lot more to her than meets the eye, and a lot more that is interesting about her thangoing on TV in a swimsuit, although no doubt, for many voters, that is the way they will have come across her before. She also has a different political qualification - she was prominent campaigning Brexiteer. By promoting her, rather than others, Theresa May has opted to preserve the precarious balance around the cabinet table. There has been an almost equal split, not so much between those who were tagged as Leavers or Remainers in 2016, but the two sides of the argument now - those who want a future closely tied to the European Union and those who want a much looser arrangement. In Whitehall's technical lingo it's now known as ""high or low alignment"". And by keeping the balance roughly 50-50, disregarding what one cabinet minister described as the ""swing voters"" - those like Sajid Javid, Liz Truss and Jeremy Hunt who are not considered to be dogmatic on the issue - it means that in effect, Theresa May has the decisive vote. In theory that allows her, in a position with little authority, to be able to tip the balance relatively easily in either direction when the big Brexit decisions have to be made. Time for that is clearly pressing, with Brussels giving the UK only a couple of weeks to show movement, in particular on the Brexit bill. It's not clear if the UK will feel able to move forward on the bill that soon - that is a difficult debate to come. The very limited changes to government today however won't obstruct the path of those decisions. Ms Mordaunt has a sense of humour, and is far from a political drone - but her appointment is also about Theresa May trying to quietly hold the current cabinet equilibrium together. With this appointment, after the eight days of turmoil, the prime minister is not looking for drama. PS: It's worth noting too, that the first MP from the Tories' 2015 intake was brought into government today.

"Those caught up in the anti-corruption drive are reportedly being held at Riyadh's Ritz-Carlton Saudi Arabia's attorney general says at least $100bn (Â£76bn) has been misused through systemic corruption and embezzlement in recent decades. Sheikh Saud al-Mojeb said 201 people were being held for questioning,externalas part of a sweeping anti-corruption drive that began on Saturday night. He did not name any of them, but they reportedly include senior princes, ministers and influential businessmen. ""The evidence for this wrongdoing is very strong,"" Sheikh Mojeb said. He also stressed that normal commercial activity in the kingdom had not been affected by the crackdown, and that only personal bank accounts had been frozen. Young Saudis weigh up crown prince's crackdown Ritzy Riyadh 'prison' for Saudi princes Sheikh Saud al-Mojeb said investigations by the newly-formed supreme anti-corruption committee, which is headed by 32-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, were ""progressing very quickly"". He announced that 208 individuals had been called in for questioning so far, and that seven of them had been released without charge. ""The potential scale of corrupt practices which have been uncovered is very large,"" the attorney general said. ""Based on our investigations over the past three years, we estimate that at least $100bn has been misused through systematic corruption and embezzlement over several decades."" This video can not be played Five things about Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Sheikh Mojeb said the committee had a clear legal mandate to move on to the next phase of its investigation and that it had suspended the bank accounts of ""persons of interest"" on Tuesday. ""There has been a great deal of speculation around the world regarding the identities of the individuals concerned and the details of the charges against them,"" he added. ""In order to ensure that the individuals continue to enjoy the full legal rights afforded to them under Saudi law, we will not be revealing any more personal details at this time."" Among those reportedly detained are the billionaire investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal; Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, a son of the late king who was also removed from his post as National Guard chief on Saturday; and his brother Prince Turki bin Abdullah, a former governor of Riyadh province. By Frank Gardner, BBC security correspondent It is the Saudi weekend now and the country is still reeling from the monumental changes taking place. So far, so good, as far as the crown prince and his supporters are concerned. ""Phase One"", as the attorney-general calls it, is complete. Around 200 leading royal and business figures have been ""called in for questioning"" and there has been no visible resistance, no disaffected army hammering at the palace gates, no calls to arms on social media. Quite the opposite, in fact. Saudi Arabia's overwhelmingly young population has largely welcomed this clean-out of the kingdom's notoriously profligate elite. The more hardline Wahhabi religious clerics, still licking their wounds from the crown prince's recent announcement that the country needs to become more tolerant of other religions, will also be welcoming the purge. The questions on everyone's mind though, are how far will it go and who will be next? Purge demonstrates ruthlessness of crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, power behind the throne Others are said to include Alwalid al-Ibrahim, owner of the television network MBC; Amr al-Dabbagh, former head of the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority; Khalid al-Tuwaijri, former chief of the Royal Court; and Bakr Binladen, chairman of the Saudi Binladen Group. At least some of them are believed to be held at the five-star Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh's diplomatic quarter. Paying guests were asked to vacate their rooms late on Saturday and the hotel's exterior gate has been shuttered since Sunday. On Tuesday, the US said it had urged the Saudi government to handle any prosecutions stemming from the probe in a ""fair and transparent"" manner. Human Rights Watch meanwhile called on Saudi officials to ""immediately reveal the legal and evidentiary basis for each person's detention and make certain that each person detained can exercise their due process rights"". The detentions follow a wave of other recent arrests of clerics, human rights activists and intellectuals, for which the authorities have not given specific reasons.

"This video can not be played Sainsbury's chief executive Mike Coupe says Christmas food prices are no higher than 2015 The boss of Sainsbury's has said the UK is ""probably through the worst"" of a weaker pound fuelling food inflation. After years of deflation, Brexit currency movements meant there had been a ""little bit of food price inflation"" this year, chief executive Mike Coupe told the BBC. But he said food prices this Christmas would still be ""about the same as they were two years ago"". His comments came as the retailer reported a 9% fall in interim profits. However, the decline was not as bad as expected and sales rose. The UK's second largest supermarket chain said profits came in at Â£251m in the 28 weeks to the 23 September, while like-for-like sales excluding fuel went up by 1.6%. It said the fall in profits was due to price cutting, wage cost inflation and the consolidation of Argos. Chief executive Mike Coupe said,externalhe was ""very pleased with progress"". The value of sterling has fallen sharply since last year's Brexit referendum, pushing up the cost of imports. Initially, retailers were protected against those increased costs because they buy in advance, but more recently they have felt the effects of the currency devaluation. However, Mr Coupe said the ""impact on customers had been relatively limited"". He said the retailer was aiming to limit price rises, despite the recent pick-up in inflation. ""Food price inflation as measured by the government is around 2% and inevitably the things that we import - so they tend to be things like fresh foods - get a little bit more expensive on the back of that,"" Mr Coupe said. ""But we're probably through the worst, if the truth be told, and actually even today's prices are about the same as they were two years ago, so we as a business have done a very good job of protecting our customers from the more extreme challenges of inflation and the currency movements."" The supermarket chain took over catalogue retailer Argos and Habitat last year in a Â£1.4bn deal. In the past six months, Sainsbury's has opened a further 73 Argos concessions in its stores, bringing the total to 112. It plans to have 165 by Christmas. Mr Coupe said: ""We have delivered a good performance across the group in the last six months. ""We are now three years into delivering our differentiated strategy and are seeing clear results."" Sainsbury's is looking to make cost savings amid fierce competition from discounters and rising food costs. It says it has exceeded its cost savings target and will have managed to have saved Â£540m over the three years to the end of the current financial year. It also plans to make a further Â£500m of savings during the next three years. Mr Coupe said the chain was continuing to ""focus on offering our customers great value, supported by our removal of multibuys"". Sales at Sainsbury's convenience stores are growing strongly He was also asked whether discounters such as Aldi and Lidl were still making inroads into Sainsbury's customer base. ""We have always worked on the assumption that the discounters will continue to grow... but we have planned our business on that basis and the way our customers are shopping is changing. ""They're shopping with us more frequently and you can see that in our convenience store business - it's grown at 8%, they're shopping online, that's grown at 7% and increasingly they're shopping non-food with Sainsbury's, so for instance, our clothing business grew by 7%."" The company said its full-year profit forecast remained ""in line"" with market expectations. However, Sainsbury's share price fell more than 3% following the release of the results. It subsequently recovered some ground and closed 2.1% lower. Molly Johnson-Jones, senior Retail Analyst at GlobalData, said Sainsbury's ""momentum"" from the first quarter had not been maintained. ""Of all of the grocers, Sainsbury's improvement seems the most muted, and a focus on profitability must be maintained in order to prevent further investor discontent.""

"Thousands of children and teenagers were referred to the government's anti-terror programme in England and Wales last year, Home Office figures show. The Prevent programme aims to stop people being drawn into terrorism. There were 7,631 referrals in 2015-16, a quarter of which were of under-15s, but only 381 required specialist help. Labour's Naz Shah said the figures reinforced her concerns about the scheme, but security minister Ben Wallace said it had got ""real results"". Chief Constable Simon Cole, the national policing lead for Prevent, said the number of referrals showed that ""trust and support is growing"" for the programme. In one case a nine-year-old boy was helped by the Prevent programme after he stood up in class and said he supported so-called Islamic state. He found their propaganda online after searching for news coverage of the Paris attacks, the Home Office said, but received support from the government's intensive de-radicalisation scheme, known as Channel. Reality Check: What is the Prevent strategy? Teachers' fears over Prevent strategy 'Prevent not just about Muslim community' It is the first time the government has published detailed figures on the initiative, created in 2003. They reveal that 2,127 of those referred to the scheme in 2015-16 were under 15, including more than 500 girls. This video can not be played Rahmaan Mohammadi was referred to Prevent aged 14, describing it as ""toxic"" Another 2,147 people reported were aged between 15 and 20 - meaning more than half of the 7,631 people referred in the 12 months to March 2016 were aged 20 or under. The figures suggest there has been an increase in cases involving under-15s, but officials believe this could be due to a greater awareness among teachers of the potential warning signs - a third of the referrals came from the education sector. Home Office officials said academic research indicated that while there had been some initial concerns about ""over-zealous"" referrals by teachers, they now had a good grasp of which young people needed help. Every time a case is referred to a local Prevent panel, experts consider the evidence - such as a report from a teacher - and decide whether the individual needs to be steered away from extremist ideology. The latest figures show that the vast majority of people referred to Prevent required either no official support, or were given help with a problem unrelated to violent extremism. But 1,072 individuals caused such alarm they were assessed for inclusion in Channel, the government's intensive de-radicalisation programme, which is voluntary and provides tailored support to individuals in England and Wales. Of those cases, 381 went on to receive specialist help in an attempt to change their thinking - and 302 were later given the all-clear. Sixteen of those were still in the process at the time the figures were collated, but a further 63 people withdrew from the scheme - meaning they stopped co-operating with expert mentors altogether. By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent All the indications are that the number of Prevent referrals for 2017, when they are eventually collated and published, is likely to be considerably higher than this historical data. Having said that, we have learnt a lot today about the character of those causing the most concern. For a start, 2016 wasn't all about Syria. The figures show how the emergence of new far-right groups is causing concern. In Wales, for example, the ratio of far-right referrals to Islamist was the highest of anywhere in the UK. Across England and Wales, only a small number of all Prevent referrals cases ended up requiring intensive de-radicalisation, but a sixth of all those who were offered this specialist counselling - 63 people - refused to take part and withdrew. What we don't know for sure is what happens next to those people. Ministers suggest they are neither abandoned nor forgotten. And that means there will be someone watching - and some of these people will end up in court. Approximately 65% of the Prevent referrals related to Islamist/jihadist extremism and 10% concerned right-wing extremism. The remaining cases were either impossible to initially categorise, because the individual was flitting between ideologies, or involved smaller threats relating to Northern Ireland, or Sikh extremism. The highest number of cases came from London - 1,915 individuals - followed by 1,273 the North East, an area covering Yorkshire to the Scottish border. Security minister Ben Wallace said the Channel scheme was helping to ""save lives"" and had seen ""real results"" in helping divert people away from terrorism. Labour's Naz Shah, who sits on the Commons Home Affairs committee, said the fact the majority of Islamic extremism referrals required no further action reinforced suggested problems with the scheme. She said: ""If you've referred a child, a young person, and there turns out to be actually nothing that they're doing that's wrong - that's really worrying for me and it's very alarming."" But Dr Usama Hasan, head of Islamic Studies at the counter-extremism organisation Quilliam, said it was not surprising there had been lots of ""false"" referrals. She said: ""This is a new duty on schools and a lot of teachers are worried that if they miss somebody, they could lose their job for missing a potential terrorist.""

"This video can not be played A trailer for All the Money in the World, featuring Spacey as Jean Paul Getty, had already been released US actor Kevin Spacey is to be erased from a completed Hollywood film following the allegations of predatory sexual behaviour against him. His role in All the Money in the World is to be recast and his scenes reshot. The release is expected to go ahead as planned on 22 December. Spacey, who was late oil tycoon Jean Paul Getty in the film, will be replaced by Christopher Plummer. The claims against Spacey span from the mid-1980s to last year. How do you reshoot a film to replace an actor? All the Money in the World, directed by Ridley Scott, is about the 1973 kidnapping of Getty's teenage grandson. Variety said,externalthat Spacey had shot about two weeks of footage and there were many scenes in the film where he was the only actor on screen. He alreadyappears in the film's trailer,external, which was released in September. Veteran actor Christopher Plummer (left) will replace Spacey in the film Mark Wahlberg and Michelle Williams, who also star in the film, are expected to take part in the reshooting. The movie has also been withdrawn from the American Film Institute's (AFI) annual festival in Los Angeles later this month. Kevin Spacey: How the story unfolded Missing in action: The films affected by actors' deaths Actress Valentina Violo, who plays a secretary in Ridley Scott's film, said she had met Spacey at a party held at the end of shooting this summer. ""He was very nice and kind and very human,"" she told BBC News. ""He was enjoying himself drinking, eating, speaking with people."" Spacey's career has nosedived since the first allegation of sexual advances were made by actor Anthony Rapp on 30 October. US network Netflix has axed further production of Mr Spacey's House of Cards drama, the International Academy of Television Arts and Sciences announced it would no longer give the actor a special Emmy award, and his agent and publicist dropped him as a client. This video can not be played 'To Kevin Spacey: Shame on you for what you did to my son' Rapp accused Spacey of trying to seduce him when he was aged 14. In response to Mr Rapp's claims, Mr Spacey said he had no memory of the incident and offered an apology. Since thenseveral others have come forwardaccusing him of predatory behaviour, including a woman who said Spacey had sexually assaulted her 18-year-old son last year. Spacey's representatives say he is seeking unspecified treatment. It is not uncommon for actors to have their roles recast or their performances adjusted in the case of death, illness and other unavoidable circumstances. Nor is it rare for actors to be replaced before or during production, for a whole range of reasons. Yet it is virtually unprecedented for a living performer to be removed from a completed film and have their character recreated by another actor. It is even rarer for that decision to be made so close to a film's release, or in a film whose trailer contains copious footage of the actor concerned. Yes, Woody Allen once reshot an entire film - 1987's September - with some recast actors. Woody Allen once reshot an entire film from scratch But that was because he was dissatisfied with the first version and not all of the original cast were available for reshoots. Spacey spent just two weeks working on All the Money in the World, so it is possible reshoots may be relatively straightforward. Yet they are likely to be costly and include more than one actor. One scene in the trailer, for example, sees Spacey's Getty striding away from a horde of news reporters. With or without Spacey, Scott's film has already achieved a notoriety that is sure to make it a constant source of fascination. The fact that it already concerns a famous cause celebre - the 1973 kidnapping of John Paul Getty III - adds yet another twist to the tale.

"Charlie Elphicke has denied any ""criminal wrongdoing"" A Conservative MP suspended by his party after ""serious allegations"" were made against him says he still does not know what he is accused of. Charlie Elphicke, a former party whip who has been the MP for Dover and Deal since 2010, has denied any ""criminal wrongdoing"". In a statement, the married 46-year-old said: ""So what then is [the] explanation for what I am accused of?"" The Conservative Party has not yet commented on his statement. Referring to an explanation for his suspension, Mr Elphicke said: ""I cannot give one. Because I do not know what I am accused of."" He claimed the process being followed by the party was ""fundamentally wrong"". The Conservatives have recently published anew code of conductfor MPs and other elected representatives. Mr Elphicke,who was suspended last Friday, added: ""The fact is that this whole area of reporting misconduct and managing allegations of misconduct is a mess."" He said he had received no further information since being told by the chief whip that serious allegations made against him had been passed to the police. ""I asked what the allegations were and he would not tell me,"" he said. ""He only said that he and the prime minister had decided the whip should be suspended from me. ""So extraordinary as it may seem, I am no wiser now than I was on Friday evening."" It is not clear which police force is dealing with the allegations, but when asked for a statement the Metropolitan Police said: ""The Met does not identify any person who may, or may not be, subject to an investigation. ""Following the receipt of any allegation, investigating officers will only make contact with potential suspects if and when it is operationally appropriate to do so."" Mr Elphicke said it was ""a denial of justice when people who have had allegations made against them, lose their job or their party whip without knowing what those allegations are"". He said this was ""fundamentally wrong"" and an ""injustice to those who stand accused"". Everyone should be ""equal before the law"", and was ""innocent until proven otherwise"". Mr Elphicke concluded: ""Whatever it turns out I stand accused of, I deny any criminal wrongdoing.""

"Robin Hood Gardens was built in 1972 The Victoria & Albert Museum is to display a three-storey section of an east London council estate as an example of Brutalist architecture. The section, which includes two flats, exterior facades and two interior staircases, has been acquired from Robin Hood Gardens in Poplar. Designed by renowned British architects Alison and Peter Smithson, the block is due to be demolished and redeveloped. The V&A has called it a ""significant example of the Brutalist movement"". Brutalism, a movement characterised by exposed concrete in geometric patterns, arose in the 1950s. Demolition was approved in 2015 It is regarded as a reaction to modernism, which consisted of elegant glass and steel structures. Robin Hood Gardens was built in 1972 by the Greater London Council (GLC) and was later transferred to the local authority of Tower Hamlets. The choice of Alison and Peter Smithson as architects gave the husband and wife team their only opportunity to create a council estate. Allow Twitter content?

"For the first time, you can find out at the click of button exactly how the land is used in your local authority area. Your browser does not support this Lookup The percentages above are estimates. For a detailed methodology see note at bottom of article page. Maps produced by Alasdair Rae from the University of Sheffield using data from Corine and Ordnance Survey. If you can't see the area search,click or tap here,external. Every council area in the UK has been analysed and individual maps produced showing how much of the area falls into four land categories: Farmland Natural Built on Green urban More than half of the UK land area is farmland (fields, orchards etc), just over a third might be termed natural or semi-natural (moors, heathland, natural grassland etc), a little under 6% is built on (roads, buildings, airports, quarries etc) and 2.5% is green urban (parks, gardens, golf courses, sports pitches etc). The four categories are drawn from 44 different land use codes used by theCo-ordination of Information on the Environment,external(Corine) project initiated by the European Commission in 1985. Using high-definition satellite images and detailed local maps, Corine offers a comprehensive picture of every corner of the United Kingdom. Now that information is readily available to everyone. The local authorities with the highest proportion of farmland are the Isles of Scilly (96%) and Mid Suffolk (95%). The council area with the greatest quantity of ""natural"" landscape is Highland (91%). The City of London has the highest amount of land that is built on (98%) and the local authority with the greatest proportion of green urban is Richmond upon Thames (58%). Read Mark's blog about the research findingshere. The data has been produced with the help of Dr Alasdair Rae from the Urban Studies and Planning Department at the University of Sheffield.  All the original local authority data and maps are available in A Land Cover Atlas of the United Kingdom and can be foundhere,externalandhere,external. The largest component of the ""built on"" category is ""discontinuous urban fabric"", within which 20-50% of the surface area may be green space. To account for this we have reassigned the minimum 20% of ""discontinuous urban fabric"" to ""green urban"", which in many cases may be an underestimate.

"This video can not be played Trump spoke about North Korea and US-China trade US President Donald Trump has lavished praise on Chinese leader Xi Jinping, a marked contrast to his previous criticism of China on the flashpoint issues of North Korea and trade. But he also urged Mr Xi to ""work very hard"" on persuading North Korea to denuclearise. On China's trade surplus, Mr Trump surprised many when he said he did ""not blame China"" for ""taking advantage"". China has said it will lower market entry barriers to some sectors. The US president was speaking in Beijing while on a state visit. He is in the Chinese capital as part of his five-nation tour of Asia. The two leaders held talks earlier on Thursday after a grand welcome for Mr Trump. Trump says trade deficit not China's fault Trump, China and Twitter - what's going on? Watch:Chinese citizens describe America in one phrase China will further lower entry barriers in the banking, insurance, and finance sectors, and gradually reduce vehicle tariffs, the Chinese foreign ministry said. Deals worth $250bn (Â£190bn) have also been announced, although it is unclear how much of that figure includes past deals or potential future deals. But Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told journalists the deals were ""pretty small"" in terms of tackling the trade imbalance. Discussion on how to deal with North Korea's threats to the region has dominated Mr Trump's agenda, and China is Pyongyang's main economic supporter. Mr Trump said China could fix the problem of North Korea's nuclear programme ""easily and quickly"". He added: ""I am calling on [Mr Xi] to work very hard. I know one thing about your president. If he works on it hard, it'll get done."" Mr Xi, for his part, said both sides would ""continue to work towards"" fully implementing UN sanctions and ""enduring peace"" on the Korean peninsula. Mr Trump has previously been more critical andtweeted in July,externalthat Beijing was doing ""NOTHING for us with North Korea, just talk"". Just before his arrival in Beijing he urged China to sever ties with the North. Beijing has consistently said it is doing all it can. ""I don't blame China - after all, who can blame a country for taking advantage of another country for the benefit of its citizens... I give China great credit,"" said Mr Trump while addressing a room of business leaders. Instead, the US leader said previous US administrations were responsible for what he called ""a very unfair and one-sided"" trade relationship with China. This video can not be played Why the US president keeps mentioning Indo-Pacific Mr Trump has in the past accused China of stealing American jobs and threatened to label it a currency manipulator, thoughhe has since rowed back on such rhetoric. Mr Xi on Thursday promised ""healthy"" and ""balanced"" economic and trade relations. The two leaders also said they would work together to tackle terrorism and drug trafficking. Mr Trump upheld the""one China"" policyin his talks with Mr Xi, Xinhua state news agency reported. Since arriving in Beijing, Mr Trump has been fulsome in his praise for the Chinese leader, saying at one point: ""You are a very special man."" He has also enthusiastically thanked Mr Xi for his hospitality in several tweets. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Trump flew into Beijing on Wednesday and was greeted withgreat pomp and ceremony, in what was billed as a ""state visit-plus"". He has tweeted several times since arriving in China - where Twitter is banned. But a White House official told reporters that he would ""tweet whatever he wants"". As part of his Asia trip Mr Trump has already visited South Korea and Japan, and will go on to Vietnam and the Philippines later in the week. Trump vs Xi: The two men compared What has Trump said about your country? By BBC's John Sudworth in Beijing You'd be forgiven for forgetting that the two men at the centre of this blossoming bromance are meant to be strategic rivals. Across the negotiating table, Mr Trump held Mr Xi's gaze. ""My feeling towards you is incredibly warm,"" he said. It's a statement that in many other circumstances might lead the recipient to glance nervously in the direction of the exit. Mr Xi just smiled and nodded. At the ceremony where US and Chinese businesses signed a number of deals, the US president appeared to have dropped his old China-bashing ways completely. His ""I don't blame China"" declaration over the trade imbalance was met with an audible gasp. Even here, one year on and 6,000 miles from the US presidential campaign trail, the audience couldn't quite believe what they were hearing. Is President Trump softening China up for tougher action on the trade imbalance further down the line? Maybe. But as the two men left the podium he had another gift for his Chinese host. Both men refused to take questions from the press. US presidents used to stand up for press freedom on visits to China. Not this one. He's warned North Korea to""not try"" the US and the world. But he also called on Pyongyang to""come to the table""for a disarmament deal. He said Japan and South Korea will be buying US military equipment whichcould shoot down Pyongyang's missiles- the two countries said they are considering it.

Sheikh Saud al-Mojeb said 201 people were being held for questioning,externalas part of a sweeping anti-corruption drive that began on Saturday night. He did not name any of them, but they reportedly include senior princes, ministers and influential businessmen. ""The evidence for this wrongdoing is very strong,"" Sheikh Mojeb said.

""In order to ensure that the individuals continue to enjoy the full legal rights afforded to them under Saudi law, we will not be revealing any more personal details at this time."" Among those reportedly detained are the billionaire investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal; Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, a son of the late king who was also removed from his post as National Guard chief on Saturday; and his brother Prince Turki bin Abdullah, a former governor of Riyadh province. By Frank Gardner, BBC security correspondent It is the Saudi weekend now and the country is still reeling from the monumental changes taking place. So far, so good, as far as the crown prince and his supporters are concerned. ""Phase One"", as the attorney-general calls it, is complete. Around 200 leading royal and business figures have been ""called in for questioning"" and there has been no visible resistance, no disaffected army hammering at the palace gates, no calls to arms on social media. Quite the opposite, in fact. Saudi Arabia's overwhelmingly young population has largely welcomed this clean-out of the kingdom's notoriously profligate elite. The more hardline Wahhabi religious clerics, still licking their wounds from the crown prince's recent announcement that the country needs to become more tolerant of other religions, will also be welcoming the purge. The questions on everyone's mind though, are how far will it go and who will be next? Purge demonstrates ruthlessness of crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, power behind the throne Others are said to include Alwalid al-Ibrahim, owner of the television network MBC; Amr al-Dabbagh, former head of the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority; Khalid al-Tuwaijri, former chief of the Royal Court; and Bakr Binladen, chairman of the Saudi Binladen Group. At least some of them are believed to be held at the five-star Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh's diplomatic quarter. Paying guests were asked to vacate their rooms late on Saturday and the hotel's exterior gate has been shuttered since Sunday. On Tuesday, the US said it had urged the Saudi government to handle any prosecutions stemming from the probe in a ""fair and transparent"" manner. Human Rights Watch meanwhile called on Saudi officials to ""immediately reveal the legal and evidentiary basis for each person's detention and make certain that each person detained can exercise their due process rights"". The detentions follow a wave of other recent arrests of clerics, human rights activists and intellectuals, for which the authorities have not given specific reasons.

"Niels H hid behind a folder as he awaited sentence at his 2015 trial Toxicology tests suggest a German former nurse murdered at least 100 people at two hospitals where he worked, prosecutors say. Detectives believe Niels Hoegel, who is already serving a life sentence for two murders, systematically administered fatal doses of heart medication to people in his care. He wanted to impress colleagues by resuscitating them but many died. Fresh charges against him are expected next year. Hoegel is now said to have killed 38 patients in Oldenburg and 62 in Delmenhorst, both in northern Germany, between 1999 and 2005. Investigators say he may have killed more but potential victims have been cremated. If found guilty of all the deaths, he would become one of Germany's worst post-war serial killers. The investigation into Hoegel was widened when he admitted killing up to 30 people during his 2015 trial, when he was convicted of two murders, two attempted murders and harming patients. Investigators exhumed 130 former patients, looking for traces of medication that could have shut down their cardiovascular systems. They also pored over records in the hospitals he worked at. Records at the Oldenburg clinic showed rates of deaths and resuscitations had risen when Hoegl was on shift, Der Spiegel magazine reports (in German),external Yet he received a good reference and went on to work at a hospital in nearby Delmenhorst, where an unusual number of patients began dying while he was on shift.

"This video can not be played A trailer for All the Money in the World, featuring Spacey as Jean Paul Getty, had already been released US actor Kevin Spacey is to be erased from a completed Hollywood film following the allegations of predatory sexual behaviour against him. His role in All the Money in the World is to be recast and his scenes reshot. The release is expected to go ahead as planned on 22 December. Spacey, who was late oil tycoon Jean Paul Getty in the film, will be replaced by Christopher Plummer. The claims against Spacey span from the mid-1980s to last year. How do you reshoot a film to replace an actor? All the Money in the World, directed by Ridley Scott, is about the 1973 kidnapping of Getty's teenage grandson. Variety said,externalthat Spacey had shot about two weeks of footage and there were many scenes in the film where he was the only actor on screen. He alreadyappears in the film's trailer,external, which was released in September. Veteran actor Christopher Plummer (left) will replace Spacey in the film Mark Wahlberg and Michelle Williams, who also star in the film, are expected to take part in the reshooting. The movie has also been withdrawn from the American Film Institute's (AFI) annual festival in Los Angeles later this month. Kevin Spacey: How the story unfolded Missing in action: The films affected by actors' deaths Actress Valentina Violo, who plays a secretary in Ridley Scott's film, said she had met Spacey at a party held at the end of shooting this summer. ""He was very nice and kind and very human,"" she told BBC News. ""He was enjoying himself drinking, eating, speaking with people."" Spacey's career has nosedived since the first allegation of sexual advances were made by actor Anthony Rapp on 30 October. US network Netflix has axed further production of Mr Spacey's House of Cards drama, the International Academy of Television Arts and Sciences announced it would no longer give the actor a special Emmy award, and his agent and publicist dropped him as a client. This video can not be played 'To Kevin Spacey: Shame on you for what you did to my son' Rapp accused Spacey of trying to seduce him when he was aged 14. In response to Mr Rapp's claims, Mr Spacey said he had no memory of the incident and offered an apology. Since thenseveral others have come forwardaccusing him of predatory behaviour, including a woman who said Spacey had sexually assaulted her 18-year-old son last year. Spacey's representatives say he is seeking unspecified treatment. It is not uncommon for actors to have their roles recast or their performances adjusted in the case of death, illness and other unavoidable circumstances. Nor is it rare for actors to be replaced before or during production, for a whole range of reasons. Yet it is virtually unprecedented for a living performer to be removed from a completed film and have their character recreated by another actor. It is even rarer for that decision to be made so close to a film's release, or in a film whose trailer contains copious footage of the actor concerned. Yes, Woody Allen once reshot an entire film - 1987's September - with some recast actors. Woody Allen once reshot an entire film from scratch But that was because he was dissatisfied with the first version and not all of the original cast were available for reshoots. Spacey spent just two weeks working on All the Money in the World, so it is possible reshoots may be relatively straightforward. Yet they are likely to be costly and include more than one actor. One scene in the trailer, for example, sees Spacey's Getty striding away from a horde of news reporters. With or without Spacey, Scott's film has already achieved a notoriety that is sure to make it a constant source of fascination. The fact that it already concerns a famous cause celebre - the 1973 kidnapping of John Paul Getty III - adds yet another twist to the tale.

"Thousands of children and teenagers were referred to the government's anti-terror programme in England and Wales last year, Home Office figures show. The Prevent programme aims to stop people being drawn into terrorism. There were 7,631 referrals in 2015-16, a quarter of which were of under-15s, but only 381 required specialist help. Labour's Naz Shah said the figures reinforced her concerns about the scheme, but security minister Ben Wallace said it had got ""real results"". Chief Constable Simon Cole, the national policing lead for Prevent, said the number of referrals showed that ""trust and support is growing"" for the programme. In one case a nine-year-old boy was helped by the Prevent programme after he stood up in class and said he supported so-called Islamic state. He found their propaganda online after searching for news coverage of the Paris attacks, the Home Office said, but received support from the government's intensive de-radicalisation scheme, known as Channel. Reality Check: What is the Prevent strategy? Teachers' fears over Prevent strategy 'Prevent not just about Muslim community' It is the first time the government has published detailed figures on the initiative, created in 2003. They reveal that 2,127 of those referred to the scheme in 2015-16 were under 15, including more than 500 girls. This video can not be played Rahmaan Mohammadi was referred to Prevent aged 14, describing it as ""toxic"" Another 2,147 people reported were aged between 15 and 20 - meaning more than half of the 7,631 people referred in the 12 months to March 2016 were aged 20 or under. The figures suggest there has been an increase in cases involving under-15s, but officials believe this could be due to a greater awareness among teachers of the potential warning signs - a third of the referrals came from the education sector. Home Office officials said academic research indicated that while there had been some initial concerns about ""over-zealous"" referrals by teachers, they now had a good grasp of which young people needed help. Every time a case is referred to a local Prevent panel, experts consider the evidence - such as a report from a teacher - and decide whether the individual needs to be steered away from extremist ideology. The latest figures show that the vast majority of people referred to Prevent required either no official support, or were given help with a problem unrelated to violent extremism. But 1,072 individuals caused such alarm they were assessed for inclusion in Channel, the government's intensive de-radicalisation programme, which is voluntary and provides tailored support to individuals in England and Wales. Of those cases, 381 went on to receive specialist help in an attempt to change their thinking - and 302 were later given the all-clear. Sixteen of those were still in the process at the time the figures were collated, but a further 63 people withdrew from the scheme - meaning they stopped co-operating with expert mentors altogether. By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent All the indications are that the number of Prevent referrals for 2017, when they are eventually collated and published, is likely to be considerably higher than this historical data. Having said that, we have learnt a lot today about the character of those causing the most concern. For a start, 2016 wasn't all about Syria. The figures show how the emergence of new far-right groups is causing concern. In Wales, for example, the ratio of far-right referrals to Islamist was the highest of anywhere in the UK. Across England and Wales, only a small number of all Prevent referrals cases ended up requiring intensive de-radicalisation, but a sixth of all those who were offered this specialist counselling - 63 people - refused to take part and withdrew. What we don't know for sure is what happens next to those people. Ministers suggest they are neither abandoned nor forgotten. And that means there will be someone watching - and some of these people will end up in court. Approximately 65% of the Prevent referrals related to Islamist/jihadist extremism and 10% concerned right-wing extremism. The remaining cases were either impossible to initially categorise, because the individual was flitting between ideologies, or involved smaller threats relating to Northern Ireland, or Sikh extremism. The highest number of cases came from London - 1,915 individuals - followed by 1,273 the North East, an area covering Yorkshire to the Scottish border. Security minister Ben Wallace said the Channel scheme was helping to ""save lives"" and had seen ""real results"" in helping divert people away from terrorism. Labour's Naz Shah, who sits on the Commons Home Affairs committee, said the fact the majority of Islamic extremism referrals required no further action reinforced suggested problems with the scheme. She said: ""If you've referred a child, a young person, and there turns out to be actually nothing that they're doing that's wrong - that's really worrying for me and it's very alarming."" But Dr Usama Hasan, head of Islamic Studies at the counter-extremism organisation Quilliam, said it was not surprising there had been lots of ""false"" referrals. She said: ""This is a new duty on schools and a lot of teachers are worried that if they miss somebody, they could lose their job for missing a potential terrorist.""

"Those caught up in the anti-corruption drive are reportedly being held at Riyadh's Ritz-Carlton Saudi Arabia's attorney general says at least $100bn (Â£76bn) has been misused through systemic corruption and embezzlement in recent decades.

"A logo but no footage has been released for the new game The maker of Pokemon Go has revealed it is working on a Harry Potter-themed follow-up that will also include augmented reality features. Niantic said players would find and fight fantasy beasts in real-world neighbourhoods in the smartphone game, which has yet to get a release date. Pokemon Go reportedly hadabout 45 million daily playersat its peak and generatedmore than $1.2bn (Â£915m) in sales.,external One expert said the Harry Potter brand had the potential for similar success. Publisher Warner Bros Interactive owns the video game rights to the Harry Potter series. It has previously developed Lego-branded tie-in titles via its TT Games subsidiary as well partnering with Electronic Arts to create action-adventures that launched alongside the movies. Warner said Niantic's Harry Potter: Wizards Unite was justone of several new games,externalbased on JK Rowling's characters that are planned. They will all be released under a new label - Portkey Games - so-named because Portkeys transport wizards from place to place in the books. Niantic continues to add features and characters to Pokemon Go Claims that Niantic would make aHarry Potter-themed game were first reported in July 2016,externalbut weredismissed as a hoax,external, not least because the San Francisco-based developer was still rolling out Pokemon Go at the time. The Pokemon title became the first mainstream hit for augmented reality, in which real-world views captured via a camera are mixed together with computer graphics on the screen. Niantic had previously attempted to popularise AR with Ingress, a location-based sci-fi game released in 2012. But it was only after it took on an established brand that it caught the wider public's attention. Lego-themed Harry Potter titles have already proved to be highly popular on games consoles ""I think the Harry Potter game is a huge deal,"" commented Piers Harding-Rolls from the IHS Markit consultancy. ""If you look at the different major franchises out there, I don't think there are many that could do Pokemon Go justice as a follow-up."" Relativelyfew details have been provided,externalat this point about the forthcoming game, except that it will involve players learning spells before exploring their neighbourhoods to search for mysterious artefacts and fight ""legendary beasts"" with the option to team up with others to ""take down powerful enemies"". Potter fans have been told they will have to wait until next year to discover more. The title is likely to take advantage of enhanced augmented reality features provided by Apple and Google via their ARKit and ARCore developer tools, which were not available when Pokemon Go launched. But Niantic may be mindful that many of Pokemon Go's remaining fans play it with its AR features switched off because it makes the game easier to play and helps save battery life. ""I expect the Harry Potter augmented reality experiences will be more robust and complex than they were in Pokemon Go, which should make the game more dynamic and the experience more engaging,"" Mr Harding-Rolls predicted.

Designed by renowned British architects Alison and Peter Smithson, the block is due to be demolished and redeveloped. The V&A has called it a ""significant example of the Brutalist movement"". Brutalism, a movement characterised by exposed concrete in geometric patterns, arose in the 1950s. Demolition was approved in 2015 It is regarded as a reaction to modernism, which consisted of elegant glass and steel structures. Robin Hood Gardens was built in 1972 by the Greater London Council (GLC) and was later transferred to the local authority of Tower Hamlets. The choice of Alison and Peter Smithson as architects gave the husband and wife team their only opportunity to create a council estate. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Carwyn Jones said he had ""no alternative"" but to sack Carl Sargeant First Minister Carwyn Jones has said he had no alternative but to sack Carl Sargeant following allegations about his conduct. Mr Sargeant's body was found on Tuesday, four days after he was dismissed as communities minister and suspended from the Welsh Labour party. It is understood he took his own life but Mr Jones said he had acted ""by the book"" over the matter. He said he would try to provide answers which Mr Sargeant's family deserved. There has beencriticism of the way Mr Sargeant was treatedand his family has called for an independent inquiry. Ex-Welsh Government minister Leighton Andrews, Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies and Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood also want an inquiry, which Mr Jones suggested could take place in future. Claims about inappropriate behaviour were made to the first minister's office last week and following Friday's sacking, the Alyn and Deeside AM had vowed to clear his name even though he said he did not know the details of the allegations. An inquest into Mr Sargeant's death will be opened and adjourned on Monday. As it happened: Jones' statement over Sargeant death 'Carl Sargeant not given natural justice' - family Sacked Labour minister found dead Profile of long-serving AM's career Minister removed over conduct claims Mr Jones met Labour AMs on Thursday to explain how he handled the conduct allegations against Mr Sargeant. Mr Jones then made a statement from Welsh Government headquarters in Cardiff on Thursday afternoon. He called the situation ""the darkest days"" any of those at the assembly could remember, but said they were the ""darkest of all for the family"". A relentless drip-drip of disinformation had a strain on Mr Sargeant and others, Leighton Andrews says Despite speculation Mr Jones could have resigned on Thursday, the speech made no reference to his own political future. Speaking publicly for the first time since Mr Sargeant's death, he said: ""There are a lot of inaccuracies in the press and many of you have questions to ask about what happened last week."" He said precise details ""will need to be properly disclosed"" at the inquest. ""I and my team will of course be cooperating fully with any questions that are raised there,"" he said. ""The family deserve to have their questions answered and if that isn't possible through the inquest then I will endeavour to make that happen through other means. ""I welcome any scrutiny of my actions in the future and it is appropriate for that to be done independently."" Paying tribute to Mr Sargeant, he said: ""Carl was a true force of nature - he drove through more legislation than any other minister. Not just through force of argument, but through force of personality."" When Carwyn Jones finally appeared in front of the cameras today to deliver a statement on the death of Carl Sargeant and the events that led up to it, there was an expectation that the first minister would attempt to answer at least some of the many questions that have been raised since the former secretary's death. Instead, while paying tribute to the man he described as a ""true force of nature"" he did little to answer the questions raised by Mr Sargeant's family and others. A reference to a possible independent inquiry seemed equivocal at best. The first minister's reference to ""inaccuracies in the press"" again raises more questions than answers. If reports are inaccurate - why not correct them and why refuse to answer questions from journalists who are trying their best to report the situation accurately? Carwyn Jones is human, of course, and I have no doubt that his grief and shock is genuine. That may explain why a statement which would have been perfectly apt in the hours following Mr Sargeant's death seems insufficient and vague when delivered two and half days later. Following the news conference, opponents rounded on Mr Jones. Mr Davies said the episode has ""significantly undermined public confidence in the first minister"", while Ms Wood said the statement ""was not adequate"". UKIP Wales said it would call for a motion of no confidence in the first minister. And Mr Sargeant's lifelong friend and Flintshire council's deputy leader Bernie Attridge, called for Mr Jones to resign saying he ""had not done the decent thing"". Mr Andrews said a number of people were expecting a ""definite commitment to an independent inquiry"" from Mr Jones' statement. Earlier on Thursday, Mr Andrews alleged Mr Sargeant had been the target of bullying in the Welsh Government. This video can not be played Leighton Andrews wants answers from the first minister Former public services minister Mr Andrews - claimed there was ""minor bullying"" and ""mind games"" during his time in government -  and said the atmosphere was ""toxic"" during the last assembly term. ""The undermining was of ministers, deputy ministers and special advisers,"" Mr Andrews said in a statement issued on Thursday. He said Mr Sargeant ""was unquestionably the target of some of this behaviour. The relentless drip-drip of disinformation - and worse - had a strain on his and others' mental health."" The ex-Rhondda AM said he had raised one particular issue with Mr Jones, of which he had direct evidence, but claimed due process was not followed. The Welsh Government has declined to respond to Mr Andrews' claims.

"This video can not be played Sainsbury's chief executive Mike Coupe says Christmas food prices are no higher than 2015 The boss of Sainsbury's has said the UK is ""probably through the worst"" of a weaker pound fuelling food inflation. After years of deflation, Brexit currency movements meant there had been a ""little bit of food price inflation"" this year, chief executive Mike Coupe told the BBC. But he said food prices this Christmas would still be ""about the same as they were two years ago"". His comments came as the retailer reported a 9% fall in interim profits. However, the decline was not as bad as expected and sales rose. The UK's second largest supermarket chain said profits came in at Â£251m in the 28 weeks to the 23 September, while like-for-like sales excluding fuel went up by 1.6%. It said the fall in profits was due to price cutting, wage cost inflation and the consolidation of Argos. Chief executive Mike Coupe said,externalhe was ""very pleased with progress"". The value of sterling has fallen sharply since last year's Brexit referendum, pushing up the cost of imports. Initially, retailers were protected against those increased costs because they buy in advance, but more recently they have felt the effects of the currency devaluation. However, Mr Coupe said the ""impact on customers had been relatively limited"". He said the retailer was aiming to limit price rises, despite the recent pick-up in inflation. ""Food price inflation as measured by the government is around 2% and inevitably the things that we import - so they tend to be things like fresh foods - get a little bit more expensive on the back of that,"" Mr Coupe said. ""But we're probably through the worst, if the truth be told, and actually even today's prices are about the same as they were two years ago, so we as a business have done a very good job of protecting our customers from the more extreme challenges of inflation and the currency movements."" The supermarket chain took over catalogue retailer Argos and Habitat last year in a Â£1.4bn deal. In the past six months, Sainsbury's has opened a further 73 Argos concessions in its stores, bringing the total to 112. It plans to have 165 by Christmas. Mr Coupe said: ""We have delivered a good performance across the group in the last six months. ""We are now three years into delivering our differentiated strategy and are seeing clear results."" Sainsbury's is looking to make cost savings amid fierce competition from discounters and rising food costs. It says it has exceeded its cost savings target and will have managed to have saved Â£540m over the three years to the end of the current financial year. It also plans to make a further Â£500m of savings during the next three years. Mr Coupe said the chain was continuing to ""focus on offering our customers great value, supported by our removal of multibuys"". Sales at Sainsbury's convenience stores are growing strongly He was also asked whether discounters such as Aldi and Lidl were still making inroads into Sainsbury's customer base. ""We have always worked on the assumption that the discounters will continue to grow... but we have planned our business on that basis and the way our customers are shopping is changing. ""They're shopping with us more frequently and you can see that in our convenience store business - it's grown at 8%, they're shopping online, that's grown at 7% and increasingly they're shopping non-food with Sainsbury's, so for instance, our clothing business grew by 7%."" The company said its full-year profit forecast remained ""in line"" with market expectations. However, Sainsbury's share price fell more than 3% following the release of the results. It subsequently recovered some ground and closed 2.1% lower. Molly Johnson-Jones, senior Retail Analyst at GlobalData, said Sainsbury's ""momentum"" from the first quarter had not been maintained. ""Of all of the grocers, Sainsbury's improvement seems the most muted, and a focus on profitability must be maintained in order to prevent further investor discontent.""

"Mark van Dongen died 15 months after being attacked in Bristol An acid attack victim shouted ""I want to die"" as he could not bear to live with his injuries, his father has told a court. Mark van Dongen, 29, was left paralysed from the neck down and lost his left leg, ear and eye following the attack. Bristol Crown Court heard the Dutch national ended his life in a Belgian euthanasia clinic 15 months later. His ex-girlfriend, Berlinah Wallace, 48, of Bristol, denies murdering him. Speaking through an interpreter, Mr van Dongen's father Cornelius told the court that after suffering his injuries his son had to communicate by using an alphabet board to spell out words. Mr van Dongen said he asked Mark who had attacked him and his son spelled out his former girlfriend's name on the board. Prosecutors allege Ms Wallace became upset when the couple's five-year relationship ended and threw a corrosive substance over Mr van Dongen as he was lying in bed. Mr van Dongen told the jury his son was scared of Ms Wallace and had called the police ""several times"" about her but ""received no support"". In the weeks before he died he said his son developed an acute lung infection and was unable to move his arms. It was ""the straw that broke the camel's back"" that led him to apply for euthanasia, Mr van Dongen said. He said Mark told him: ""My life has come to nothing and there is nothing left"". He died at the clinic in Belgium on 2 January this year. Berlinah Wallace denies murder and applying a corrosive substance The court heard Thomas Sweet, who lived near Ms Wallace's flat in Ladysmith Road, found Mr van Dongen in the street in September 2015. He said he heard what sounded like ""foxes fighting"" and then realised it was someone shouting ""help me"" in an ""agonised"" way. Mr van Dongen was wearing just his boxer shorts and said he had ""acid chucked on him"", Mr Sweet said. He told the court Mr van Dongen said: ""This bitch, this bitch did it to me. My ex did it"". Mr Sweet then called an ambulance and took Mr van Dongen to a neighbour's flat and helped him shower. Mr Sweet said he asked him: ""Do you want the police here?"" and Mr van Dongen replied: ""They need to be here, she needs to pay."" The attack happened on Ladysmith Road in Westbury Park, Bristol Another neighbour, Dr Nicola White, told the court she was woken up by ""the sound of a gentleman outside in the street screaming"". Dr White said she went out and saw Mr van Dongen, who was ""grey from his head to his chest"". She helped Mr Sweet take Mr van Dongen in to shower him and said he turned to her, pointed to an open door and screamed: ""She did it to me in there. She did it to me."" Dr White said as they passed the door, she looked in and saw ""a lady sitting on the sofa on her mobile phone appearing to talk. She looked sullen and serious"". Police officers told the court Mr van Dongen had ""significant injuries"" from a ""substance poured over his body"". PC Thomas Green travelled in the ambulance to hospital and said the victim was ""clearly in a lot of pain and screaming in agony"". ""I asked him who the offender was, he said Berlinah and pointed to a tattoo [of her name] near his belly button. ""He said he was concerned for V's [his then girlfriend] safety and concerned she would target her as well."" PC Daniel Fortune described a ""chemical acrid smell, which was quite strong"" in the flat. He told the jury Ms Wallace was sat on the sofa, ""calm and collected"". Ms Wallace admits throwing a substance over Mr van Dongen but denies any intent to cause him harm. She says she believed she was throwing a glass of water over him and denies murder and applying a corrosive substance. The trial continues.

"Those caught up in the anti-corruption drive are reportedly being held at Riyadh's Ritz-Carlton Saudi Arabia's attorney general says at least $100bn (Â£76bn) has been misused through systemic corruption and embezzlement in recent decades. Sheikh Saud al-Mojeb said 201 people were being held for questioning,externalas part of a sweeping anti-corruption drive that began on Saturday night. He did not name any of them, but they reportedly include senior princes, ministers and influential businessmen. ""The evidence for this wrongdoing is very strong,"" Sheikh Mojeb said. He also stressed that normal commercial activity in the kingdom had not been affected by the crackdown, and that only personal bank accounts had been frozen. Young Saudis weigh up crown prince's crackdown Ritzy Riyadh 'prison' for Saudi princes Sheikh Saud al-Mojeb said investigations by the newly-formed supreme anti-corruption committee, which is headed by 32-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, were ""progressing very quickly"". He announced that 208 individuals had been called in for questioning so far, and that seven of them had been released without charge. ""The potential scale of corrupt practices which have been uncovered is very large,"" the attorney general said. ""Based on our investigations over the past three years, we estimate that at least $100bn has been misused through systematic corruption and embezzlement over several decades."" This video can not be played Five things about Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Sheikh Mojeb said the committee had a clear legal mandate to move on to the next phase of its investigation and that it had suspended the bank accounts of ""persons of interest"" on Tuesday. ""There has been a great deal of speculation around the world regarding the identities of the individuals concerned and the details of the charges against them,"" he added. ""In order to ensure that the individuals continue to enjoy the full legal rights afforded to them under Saudi law, we will not be revealing any more personal details at this time."" Among those reportedly detained are the billionaire investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal; Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, a son of the late king who was also removed from his post as National Guard chief on Saturday; and his brother Prince Turki bin Abdullah, a former governor of Riyadh province. By Frank Gardner, BBC security correspondent It is the Saudi weekend now and the country is still reeling from the monumental changes taking place. So far, so good, as far as the crown prince and his supporters are concerned. ""Phase One"", as the attorney-general calls it, is complete. Around 200 leading royal and business figures have been ""called in for questioning"" and there has been no visible resistance, no disaffected army hammering at the palace gates, no calls to arms on social media. Quite the opposite, in fact. Saudi Arabia's overwhelmingly young population has largely welcomed this clean-out of the kingdom's notoriously profligate elite. The more hardline Wahhabi religious clerics, still licking their wounds from the crown prince's recent announcement that the country needs to become more tolerant of other religions, will also be welcoming the purge. The questions on everyone's mind though, are how far will it go and who will be next? Purge demonstrates ruthlessness of crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, power behind the throne Others are said to include Alwalid al-Ibrahim, owner of the television network MBC; Amr al-Dabbagh, former head of the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority; Khalid al-Tuwaijri, former chief of the Royal Court; and Bakr Binladen, chairman of the Saudi Binladen Group. At least some of them are believed to be held at the five-star Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh's diplomatic quarter. Paying guests were asked to vacate their rooms late on Saturday and the hotel's exterior gate has been shuttered since Sunday. On Tuesday, the US said it had urged the Saudi government to handle any prosecutions stemming from the probe in a ""fair and transparent"" manner. Human Rights Watch meanwhile called on Saudi officials to ""immediately reveal the legal and evidentiary basis for each person's detention and make certain that each person detained can exercise their due process rights"".

"This video can not be played Trump spoke about North Korea and US-China trade US President Donald Trump has lavished praise on Chinese leader Xi Jinping, a marked contrast to his previous criticism of China on the flashpoint issues of North Korea and trade. But he also urged Mr Xi to ""work very hard"" on persuading North Korea to denuclearise. On China's trade surplus, Mr Trump surprised many when he said he did ""not blame China"" for ""taking advantage"". China has said it will lower market entry barriers to some sectors. The US president was speaking in Beijing while on a state visit. He is in the Chinese capital as part of his five-nation tour of Asia. The two leaders held talks earlier on Thursday after a grand welcome for Mr Trump. Trump says trade deficit not China's fault Trump, China and Twitter - what's going on? Watch:Chinese citizens describe America in one phrase China will further lower entry barriers in the banking, insurance, and finance sectors, and gradually reduce vehicle tariffs, the Chinese foreign ministry said. Deals worth $250bn (Â£190bn) have also been announced, although it is unclear how much of that figure includes past deals or potential future deals. But Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told journalists the deals were ""pretty small"" in terms of tackling the trade imbalance. Discussion on how to deal with North Korea's threats to the region has dominated Mr Trump's agenda, and China is Pyongyang's main economic supporter. Mr Trump said China could fix the problem of North Korea's nuclear programme ""easily and quickly"". He added: ""I am calling on [Mr Xi] to work very hard. I know one thing about your president. If he works on it hard, it'll get done."" Mr Xi, for his part, said both sides would ""continue to work towards"" fully implementing UN sanctions and ""enduring peace"" on the Korean peninsula. Mr Trump has previously been more critical andtweeted in July,externalthat Beijing was doing ""NOTHING for us with North Korea, just talk"". Just before his arrival in Beijing he urged China to sever ties with the North. Beijing has consistently said it is doing all it can. ""I don't blame China - after all, who can blame a country for taking advantage of another country for the benefit of its citizens... I give China great credit,"" said Mr Trump while addressing a room of business leaders. Instead, the US leader said previous US administrations were responsible for what he called ""a very unfair and one-sided"" trade relationship with China. This video can not be played Why the US president keeps mentioning Indo-Pacific Mr Trump has in the past accused China of stealing American jobs and threatened to label it a currency manipulator, thoughhe has since rowed back on such rhetoric. Mr Xi on Thursday promised ""healthy"" and ""balanced"" economic and trade relations. The two leaders also said they would work together to tackle terrorism and drug trafficking. Mr Trump upheld the""one China"" policyin his talks with Mr Xi, Xinhua state news agency reported. Since arriving in Beijing, Mr Trump has been fulsome in his praise for the Chinese leader, saying at one point: ""You are a very special man."" He has also enthusiastically thanked Mr Xi for his hospitality in several tweets. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Trump flew into Beijing on Wednesday and was greeted withgreat pomp and ceremony, in what was billed as a ""state visit-plus"". He has tweeted several times since arriving in China - where Twitter is banned. But a White House official told reporters that he would ""tweet whatever he wants"". As part of his Asia trip Mr Trump has already visited South Korea and Japan, and will go on to Vietnam and the Philippines later in the week. Trump vs Xi: The two men compared What has Trump said about your country? By BBC's John Sudworth in Beijing You'd be forgiven for forgetting that the two men at the centre of this blossoming bromance are meant to be strategic rivals. Across the negotiating table, Mr Trump held Mr Xi's gaze. ""My feeling towards you is incredibly warm,"" he said. It's a statement that in many other circumstances might lead the recipient to glance nervously in the direction of the exit. Mr Xi just smiled and nodded. At the ceremony where US and Chinese businesses signed a number of deals, the US president appeared to have dropped his old China-bashing ways completely. His ""I don't blame China"" declaration over the trade imbalance was met with an audible gasp. Even here, one year on and 6,000 miles from the US presidential campaign trail, the audience couldn't quite believe what they were hearing. Is President Trump softening China up for tougher action on the trade imbalance further down the line? Maybe. But as the two men left the podium he had another gift for his Chinese host. Both men refused to take questions from the press. US presidents used to stand up for press freedom on visits to China. Not this one. He's warned North Korea to""not try"" the US and the world. But he also called on Pyongyang to""come to the table""for a disarmament deal. He said Japan and South Korea will be buying US military equipment whichcould shoot down Pyongyang's missiles- the two countries said they are considering it.

"Seven days after the rise in base rates, just 17 out of 150 providers have passed on improved returns to their savers. The Bank of England raised rates by 0.25% to 0.5% last Thursday, the first rise in a decade. Many banks are still considering whether to pass on the benefits. But even if their provider does choose to increase rates in full, some savers will still find themselves worse off than when rates were last at 0.5%. NS&I is among the providers that have announced an increase. The returns on all its variable rate products, including premium bonds, will rise by 0.25% from 1 December. Why haven't my savings rates gone up? Some savings rates start to creep up However Virgin Money actually cut savings rates on one of its ISAs on the same day that the Bank of England was raising rates. Those with Virgin's ISA Saver saw rates reduced to 0.75% last Thursday. That compares to an interest rate of 1.3% when base rates were last at 0.5% in August 2016, leaving savers worse off. Another Virgin ISA, the Defined Access E- ISA, now pays just 0.51%, compared to 1.56% last August. ""Some people could be worse off than before the base rate was cut last year,"" said Tom Adams of consumer website Savings Champion. It comes in spite of a plea by the governor of the Bank of England for banks to pass on the benefits of the rise. According to Savings Champion, Virgin Money is not the only provider whose rates have fallen since August 2016. Savers with the Clydesdale and Yorkshire Banks currently receive as little as  0.2% a year on a Flexi Cash ISA. Even if those banks do pass on the rise in full, savers will only get 0.45%, less than the 0.7% return they were getting 15 months ago. Nationwide has promised to pass on the 0.25% rise to all savers whose rates were cut by 0.25% in 2016. Nevertheless customers who had a Flexclusive ISA Issue 10 will now expect to get a 1% return, compared to 1.5% last year. Santander has announced that it will not raise the 1.5% credit savings rate on its popular 123 account. It will raise rates on some of its savings products from 4 December, but most adults will not see the 0.25% passed on in full. Lloyds has also announced that it will increase savings rates, but most of its customers will see a rise of just 0.15%. Virgin Money said customers were warned about last Thursday's ISA rate cut back in July. Because it is a 120 day notice account, savers had to be told four months in advance. Virgin also said it had paid rates that were above the market average over the last few years. By contrast, lenders have been quick to raise the cost of mortgages. Most customers with tracker mortgages have seen an immediate rise of 0.25%. So far 20 banks have announced increases to their Standard Variable Rate (SVR) mortgages, including Barclays, Halifax, Lloyds, Nationwide, Santander and TSB. HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland and NatWest are still considering their plans. ""Although not all are increasing their rates that may well be because they didn't pass on the last cut, so borrowers should still be considering whether they could be getting a better deal by shopping around,"" said David Hollingworth, associate communications director at London and Country Mortgages. ""Those that have been eyeing a fixed rate will also have begun to notice that fixed deals have already been nudging up."" TSB, Metro, Tesco and Atom Bank are among those whose fixed rate products have gone up, although this will only affect new customers. Rate Tracker - Find the best rate.

"Mark van Dongen died 15 months after being attacked in Bristol An acid attack victim shouted ""I want to die"" as he could not bear to live with his injuries, his father has told a court. Mark van Dongen, 29, was left paralysed from the neck down and lost his left leg, ear and eye following the attack. Bristol Crown Court heard the Dutch national ended his life in a Belgian euthanasia clinic 15 months later. His ex-girlfriend, Berlinah Wallace, 48, of Bristol, denies murdering him. Speaking through an interpreter, Mr van Dongen's father Cornelius told the court that after suffering his injuries his son had to communicate by using an alphabet board to spell out words. Mr van Dongen said he asked Mark who had attacked him and his son spelled out his former girlfriend's name on the board. Prosecutors allege Ms Wallace became upset when the couple's five-year relationship ended and threw a corrosive substance over Mr van Dongen as he was lying in bed. Mr van Dongen told the jury his son was scared of Ms Wallace and had called the police ""several times"" about her but ""received no support"". In the weeks before he died he said his son developed an acute lung infection and was unable to move his arms. It was ""the straw that broke the camel's back"" that led him to apply for euthanasia, Mr van Dongen said. He said Mark told him: ""My life has come to nothing and there is nothing left"". He died at the clinic in Belgium on 2 January this year. Berlinah Wallace denies murder and applying a corrosive substance The court heard Thomas Sweet, who lived near Ms Wallace's flat in Ladysmith Road, found Mr van Dongen in the street in September 2015. He said he heard what sounded like ""foxes fighting"" and then realised it was someone shouting ""help me"" in an ""agonised"" way. Mr van Dongen was wearing just his boxer shorts and said he had ""acid chucked on him"", Mr Sweet said. He told the court Mr van Dongen said: ""This bitch, this bitch did it to me. My ex did it"". Mr Sweet then called an ambulance and took Mr van Dongen to a neighbour's flat and helped him shower. Mr Sweet said he asked him: ""Do you want the police here?"" and Mr van Dongen replied: ""They need to be here, she needs to pay."" The attack happened on Ladysmith Road in Westbury Park, Bristol Another neighbour, Dr Nicola White, told the court she was woken up by ""the sound of a gentleman outside in the street screaming"". Dr White said she went out and saw Mr van Dongen, who was ""grey from his head to his chest"". She helped Mr Sweet take Mr van Dongen in to shower him and said he turned to her, pointed to an open door and screamed: ""She did it to me in there. She did it to me."" Dr White said as they passed the door, she looked in and saw ""a lady sitting on the sofa on her mobile phone appearing to talk. She looked sullen and serious"". Police officers told the court Mr van Dongen had ""significant injuries"" from a ""substance poured over his body"". PC Thomas Green travelled in the ambulance to hospital and said the victim was ""clearly in a lot of pain and screaming in agony"". ""I asked him who the offender was, he said Berlinah and pointed to a tattoo [of her name] near his belly button. ""He said he was concerned for V's [his then girlfriend] safety and concerned she would target her as well."" PC Daniel Fortune described a ""chemical acrid smell, which was quite strong"" in the flat. He told the jury Ms Wallace was sat on the sofa, ""calm and collected"". Ms Wallace admits throwing a substance over Mr van Dongen but denies any intent to cause him harm. She says she believed she was throwing a glass of water over him and denies murder and applying a corrosive substance. The trial continues.

"It was precisely a week ago that I was summoned to the Ministry of Defence to ask Sir Michael Fallon why he was resigning. Seven days on, for an unconnected reason, Theresa May has just lost another one of her ministers. That time the resignation was rather differently handled - some private speculation through the day, then a discreet summoning to a quiet room in the department until one of the minister's team came to say: ""Be ready, the secretary of state is resigning, we are finalising the letters between us and Number 10 right now."" This time, the process has been more like a pantomime, with speculation rife for nearly 24 hours that she was on her way out, no-one in government moving to quash it, leaving journalists, on the first day of parliament's recess, free to track Priti Patel's plane online then her journey back to Westminster. Goodness knows what Ms Patel's Ugandan hosts, who were expecting her to visit today, make of it all. Beyond today's palaver, though, her exit throws up problems for Mrs May. It is never as simple as one out, one in. Mrs May, who hoped to earn her authority back through competence, and orderly government, needs to restore a sense of calm after a chaotic week. To convey even a limp grip on power, misbehaving ministers need to be brought in line, and a restive Tory party needs to be able to believe Number 10 has some capability left. But with Ms Patel's departure, the prime minister must try most importantly to preserve the delicate balance around the cabinet table. Ministers' make up is finely tuned between those who desire a loose arrangement with the European Union after Brexit and those who want to stay tightly bound. With the balance more or less equal between those factions, it's as if the prime minister has the casting vote. For as long as that formula is preserved, both sides will preserve her. Upset that equilibrium with the wrong choices in a reshuffle, even of one, and the way through the most challenging decisions the government faces becomes more complicated, and the prime minister's own position more precarious still.

"This video can not be played Carwyn Jones said he had ""no alternative"" but to sack Carl Sargeant First Minister Carwyn Jones has said he had no alternative but to sack Carl Sargeant following allegations about his conduct. Mr Sargeant's body was found on Tuesday, four days after he was dismissed as communities minister and suspended from the Welsh Labour party. It is understood he took his own life but Mr Jones said he had acted ""by the book"" over the matter. He said he would try to provide answers which Mr Sargeant's family deserved. There has beencriticism of the way Mr Sargeant was treatedand his family has called for an independent inquiry. Ex-Welsh Government minister Leighton Andrews, Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies and Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood also want an inquiry, which Mr Jones suggested could take place in future. Claims about inappropriate behaviour were made to the first minister's office last week and following Friday's sacking, the Alyn and Deeside AM had vowed to clear his name even though he said he did not know the details of the allegations. An inquest into Mr Sargeant's death will be opened and adjourned on Monday. As it happened: Jones' statement over Sargeant death 'Carl Sargeant not given natural justice' - family Sacked Labour minister found dead Profile of long-serving AM's career Minister removed over conduct claims Mr Jones met Labour AMs on Thursday to explain how he handled the conduct allegations against Mr Sargeant. Mr Jones then made a statement from Welsh Government headquarters in Cardiff on Thursday afternoon. He called the situation ""the darkest days"" any of those at the assembly could remember, but said they were the ""darkest of all for the family"". A relentless drip-drip of disinformation had a strain on Mr Sargeant and others, Leighton Andrews says Despite speculation Mr Jones could have resigned on Thursday, the speech made no reference to his own political future. Speaking publicly for the first time since Mr Sargeant's death, he said: ""There are a lot of inaccuracies in the press and many of you have questions to ask about what happened last week."" He said precise details ""will need to be properly disclosed"" at the inquest. ""I and my team will of course be cooperating fully with any questions that are raised there,"" he said. ""The family deserve to have their questions answered and if that isn't possible through the inquest then I will endeavour to make that happen through other means. ""I welcome any scrutiny of my actions in the future and it is appropriate for that to be done independently."" Paying tribute to Mr Sargeant, he said: ""Carl was a true force of nature - he drove through more legislation than any other minister. Not just through force of argument, but through force of personality."" When Carwyn Jones finally appeared in front of the cameras today to deliver a statement on the death of Carl Sargeant and the events that led up to it, there was an expectation that the first minister would attempt to answer at least some of the many questions that have been raised since the former secretary's death. Instead, while paying tribute to the man he described as a ""true force of nature"" he did little to answer the questions raised by Mr Sargeant's family and others. A reference to a possible independent inquiry seemed equivocal at best. The first minister's reference to ""inaccuracies in the press"" again raises more questions than answers. If reports are inaccurate - why not correct them and why refuse to answer questions from journalists who are trying their best to report the situation accurately? Carwyn Jones is human, of course, and I have no doubt that his grief and shock is genuine. That may explain why a statement which would have been perfectly apt in the hours following Mr Sargeant's death seems insufficient and vague when delivered two and half days later. Following the news conference, opponents rounded on Mr Jones. Mr Davies said the episode has ""significantly undermined public confidence in the first minister"", while Ms Wood said the statement ""was not adequate"". UKIP Wales said it would call for a motion of no confidence in the first minister. And Mr Sargeant's lifelong friend and Flintshire council's deputy leader Bernie Attridge, called for Mr Jones to resign saying he ""had not done the decent thing"". Mr Andrews said a number of people were expecting a ""definite commitment to an independent inquiry"" from Mr Jones' statement. Earlier on Thursday, Mr Andrews alleged Mr Sargeant had been the target of bullying in the Welsh Government. This video can not be played Leighton Andrews wants answers from the first minister Former public services minister Mr Andrews - claimed there was ""minor bullying"" and ""mind games"" during his time in government -  and said the atmosphere was ""toxic"" during the last assembly term. ""The undermining was of ministers, deputy ministers and special advisers,"" Mr Andrews said in a statement issued on Thursday. He said Mr Sargeant ""was unquestionably the target of some of this behaviour. The relentless drip-drip of disinformation - and worse - had a strain on his and others' mental health."" The ex-Rhondda AM said he had raised one particular issue with Mr Jones, of which he had direct evidence, but claimed due process was not followed. The Welsh Government has declined to respond to Mr Andrews' claims.

"This video can not be played Barack Obama excited a few potential jurors when he reported for jury duty in Chicago Former US President Barack Obama has turned up for jury duty at a Chicago courthouse, but was dismissed by the judge without being called on to serve. Crowds thronged the Daley Center municipal building to catch a glimpse of the 44th US president. There was no official explanation for his dismissal, but it is not uncommon for people called to perform jury service not to be assigned a case. Mr Obama arrived at court on Wednesday morning and left around midday. The former president, who was once a law professor, has a house in Chicago. Each potential juror is paid about $17.20 (Â£13.11) from the county. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Katie Hill, communications director for Mr Obama, said in a statement that the former Democratic president ""believes the most important office in our democracy is that of citizen, and he considers jury duty a core obligation of citizenship"". Mr Obama had previously been summoned in 2010, during his first four-year term as US president, but he managed to get a postponement from the court. His reason was that he had a previously scheduled meeting with the president of the Kurdistan region of Iraq. In 2015 former President George W Bush was called to jury duty in Dallas, Texas. After posing for photos with other jurors, he was also dismissed. In 2013, Bill Clinton was also dismissed from serving on a New York City jury hearing a gang shooting case.

"This video can not be played Carwyn Jones said he had ""no alternative"" but to sack Carl Sargeant First Minister Carwyn Jones has said he had no alternative but to sack Carl Sargeant following allegations about his conduct. Mr Sargeant's body was found on Tuesday, four days after he was dismissed as communities minister and suspended from the Welsh Labour party. It is understood he took his own life but Mr Jones said he had acted ""by the book"" over the matter. He said he would try to provide answers which Mr Sargeant's family deserved. There has beencriticism of the way Mr Sargeant was treatedand his family has called for an independent inquiry. Ex-Welsh Government minister Leighton Andrews, Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies and Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood also want an inquiry, which Mr Jones suggested could take place in future. Claims about inappropriate behaviour were made to the first minister's office last week and following Friday's sacking, the Alyn and Deeside AM had vowed to clear his name even though he said he did not know the details of the allegations. An inquest into Mr Sargeant's death will be opened and adjourned on Monday. As it happened: Jones' statement over Sargeant death 'Carl Sargeant not given natural justice' - family Sacked Labour minister found dead Profile of long-serving AM's career Minister removed over conduct claims Mr Jones met Labour AMs on Thursday to explain how he handled the conduct allegations against Mr Sargeant. Mr Jones then made a statement from Welsh Government headquarters in Cardiff on Thursday afternoon. He called the situation ""the darkest days"" any of those at the assembly could remember, but said they were the ""darkest of all for the family"". A relentless drip-drip of disinformation had a strain on Mr Sargeant and others, Leighton Andrews says Despite speculation Mr Jones could have resigned on Thursday, the speech made no reference to his own political future. Speaking publicly for the first time since Mr Sargeant's death, he said: ""There are a lot of inaccuracies in the press and many of you have questions to ask about what happened last week."" He said precise details ""will need to be properly disclosed"" at the inquest. ""I and my team will of course be cooperating fully with any questions that are raised there,"" he said. ""The family deserve to have their questions answered and if that isn't possible through the inquest then I will endeavour to make that happen through other means. ""I welcome any scrutiny of my actions in the future and it is appropriate for that to be done independently."" Paying tribute to Mr Sargeant, he said: ""Carl was a true force of nature - he drove through more legislation than any other minister. Not just through force of argument, but through force of personality."" When Carwyn Jones finally appeared in front of the cameras today to deliver a statement on the death of Carl Sargeant and the events that led up to it, there was an expectation that the first minister would attempt to answer at least some of the many questions that have been raised since the former secretary's death. Instead, while paying tribute to the man he described as a ""true force of nature"" he did little to answer the questions raised by Mr Sargeant's family and others. A reference to a possible independent inquiry seemed equivocal at best. The first minister's reference to ""inaccuracies in the press"" again raises more questions than answers. If reports are inaccurate - why not correct them and why refuse to answer questions from journalists who are trying their best to report the situation accurately? Carwyn Jones is human, of course, and I have no doubt that his grief and shock is genuine. That may explain why a statement which would have been perfectly apt in the hours following Mr Sargeant's death seems insufficient and vague when delivered two and half days later. Following the news conference, opponents rounded on Mr Jones. Mr Davies said the episode has ""significantly undermined public confidence in the first minister"", while Ms Wood said the statement ""was not adequate"". UKIP Wales said it would call for a motion of no confidence in the first minister. And Mr Sargeant's lifelong friend and Flintshire council's deputy leader Bernie Attridge, called for Mr Jones to resign saying he ""had not done the decent thing"". Mr Andrews said a number of people were expecting a ""definite commitment to an independent inquiry"" from Mr Jones' statement. Earlier on Thursday, Mr Andrews alleged Mr Sargeant had been the target of bullying in the Welsh Government. This video can not be played Leighton Andrews wants answers from the first minister Former public services minister Mr Andrews - claimed there was ""minor bullying"" and ""mind games"" during his time in government -  and said the atmosphere was ""toxic"" during the last assembly term. ""The undermining was of ministers, deputy ministers and special advisers,"" Mr Andrews said in a statement issued on Thursday. He said Mr Sargeant ""was unquestionably the target of some of this behaviour. The relentless drip-drip of disinformation - and worse - had a strain on his and others' mental health."" The ex-Rhondda AM said he had raised one particular issue with Mr Jones, of which he had direct evidence, but claimed due process was not followed. The Welsh Government has declined to respond to Mr Andrews' claims.

"Theresa May has said the UK honours its commitments - but payment details remain vague So, here we are, poised to begin round six of Brexit talks, and it might move you to raise an eyebrow or two to hear that the two sides can't even agree what to call these meetings now: negotiating rounds, stock-taking exercises or an information exchange. These days I'd call them a dance around a standstill. UK negotiators have long been frustrated with the format of the (so far) monthly rounds of talks. They feel that sitting in Brussels for days at a stretch doesn't allow them the opportunity to consult London when an impasse is reached in order to - maybe - come up with a plan B and - hopefully - move forward. But EU negotiators ruled out a more flexible style of talks because, instead of consulting with one capital city, they've got 27 of them that would want to chip in, plus the European Parliament. Simply not practicable, they say. Perhaps then you won't fall off your chair in shock when I tell you expectations of round six of  - whatever these talks should be labelled as - are low on the Brussels side of the Channel. Yet that's not met here with a sea of EU shoulder shrugs. Quite the opposite. People I speak to are agitated. EU sources close to the negotiations have told me they believe the UK has only two weeks left to make progress on the Brexit divorce issues. Otherwise, I've been told, EU leaders are extremely unlikely to vote at their December summit to widen talks to include trade and transition deals - as the UK so dearly wants. David Davis says a lot of progress has been made Now there are three main divorce issues on the table: The rights of EU citizens in the UK and vice versa Irish borders Money the EU says the UK owes because of long and short-term financial commitments made while an EU member While the UK's chief negotiator David Davis insists a lot of progress has been made, his EU counterparts are less effusive. Imagine the three issues were traffic lights, citizens' rights would be green (although there are key issues still to be ironed out), Ireland would be amber and money would be a screaming, honking red. And frankly, money is what it boils down to. All 27 EU members agree that the UK must pay Some EU countries, such as Poland and Sweden, are keen to move on to talks of a future relationship with the UK - while others, like Germany and France, are more cautious. But there is unanimity amongst all 27 that the UK must pay. Brussels insists it doesn't need a precise figure right now. It does, however, want far more detail than what is perceived here as the vague promise Theresa May made in late September in her Florence speech that the UK is a country which honours its commitments. And why are there only two weeks left for the UK to move on the money, according to the EU? Because that is when the 27 EU capitals start discussing the draft conclusions to the leaders' summit which takes place mid-December. They need those two weeks to more or less agree a position. ""And there's no way they'll agree to talk trade or transition with the UK in December, if the money issue hasn't been put to bed beforehand. Forget it,"" a high-level contact told me. ""Then the Brexit situation becomes dramatic."" Because if the December summit comes and goes, the earliest talks of a future EU-UK relationship could start would be at the next EU leaders summit in March 2018. Far too late for businesses on both sides of the Channel which are desperate for some clarity. March 2018 would also be one year after the UK triggered Article 50 - the formal process to leave the EU. And it's six months from the time the EU wants to formally close Brexit negotiations in order to be able to vote on any agreement reached. ""All I know,"" a source close to the negotiations told me, ""is that I don't know the UK as I thought I did."" ""Are they so clouded by sex scandals and losing ministers in Westminster that they don't see: Brexit time is running out? ""They want a deal. Fine. Then now's the time to rip off the Band Aid. To admit to the UK public and the Conservative Party: 'We want to leave and it's time to pay'."" The EU wants a deal, too. Very much so. But the mantra ""No deal is better than a bad deal"" also rings true this side of the Channel. No 'magical solutions' for May's Brexit talks Reality Check: Does the UK owe the EU money?

"Wounds heal more quickly if they occur during the day rather than after dark, a study suggests. It found burns sustained at night took an average of 28 days to heal, but just 17 for those that happened in daytime. The team, at the UK's MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, said they were astounded by the difference they saw in 118 burns patients they studied. The effect was explained by the way body clock ticks inside nearly every human cell across a 24-hour cycle. The research,published in Science Translational Medicine,external, examined 118 patients at NHS burns units. It showed the average 11-day difference in healing times between people hurt at night and during the day. Detailed lab work showed skin cells called fibroblasts were changing their abilities in a 24-hour pattern. Fibroblasts are the body's first responders, rushing to the site of injury to close a wound. During the day they are primed to react, but they lose this ability at night. Dr John O'Neill, one of the researchers, told the BBC: ""It is like the 100m. The sprinter down on the blocks, poised and ready to go, is always going to beat the guy going from a standing start."" Heart surgery survival chances 'better in the afternoon' Speed Up Wound-healing With Expressive Writing Ultrasound may heal chronic wounds, suggests study The researchers think they could use this knowledge to improve surgery. Some drugs, such as the steroid cortisol, can reset an individual cell's body clock and may be helpful in night-time procedures. And everybody's body clock runs to a slightly different pattern or ""chronotype"". So, it might make sense to schedule operations to keep in time with the patients' 24-hour ""circadian rhythms"". Both ideas are still untested, though. Dr John Blaikley, a clinician scientist at the University of Manchester, said: ""Treatment of wounds costs the NHS around Â£5bn, which is partly due to a lack of effective therapies targeting wound closure. ""By taking these [circadian factors] into account, not only could novel drug targets be identified, but also the effectiveness of established therapies might be increased through changing what time of day they are given.""

"The technology was first tested in Vegas at the start of this year A self-driving shuttle bus in Las Vegas was involved in a crash on its first day of service. The vehicle - carrying âseveralâ passengers - was hit by a lorry driving at slow speed. Nobody was injured in the incident which city officials say was the fault of the human driver of the lorry. The man was subsequently given a ticket by police. The shuttle is the first of its kind to be used on public roads in the US. The collision comes a day after Waymo - owned by Google's parent company Alphabet - announced it is launching a fully self-driving fleet of taxis in Phoenix, Arizona. The Las Vegas shuttle, designed to ferry passengers to the famous strip, uses a system developed by Navya, a French company alsotesting its technology in London. The shuttle carries up to 15 people and has a maximum speed of 30 mph (48km/h), but typically travels at around 15 mph (24km/h). A spokesman for the City of Las Vegas told the BBC the crash was a âfender benderâ - a minor collision - and that the shuttle would likely be back out on the road on Thursday after some routine diagnostics tests. âA delivery truck was coming out of an alley,â public information officer Jace Radke said. ""The shuttle did what it was supposed to do and stopped. Unfortunately the human element, the driver of the truck, didnât stop.â Self-driving technology has been involved in crashes before, but almost all reported incidents have been due to human error. Earlier this year an autonomous vehicle being tested by ride-sharing company Uber in Arizona rolled over after another driver on the road failed to give way.

An incident involving a Tesla Model S, which has some autonomous functions, killed a man in 2016. An investigation ruled that computer failings were partly to blame.

Experts have said that even with these incidents, self-driving technology could still make our roads significantly safer.A study from the RAND Corporation, published this week,external, argued that self-driving technology should be rolled out despite its imperfections. âWaiting for highly autonomous vehicles that are many times safer than human drivers misses opportunities to save lives,â the report said.

"A logo but no footage has been released for the new game The maker of Pokemon Go has revealed it is working on a Harry Potter-themed follow-up that will also include augmented reality features. Niantic said players would find and fight fantasy beasts in real-world neighbourhoods in the smartphone game, which has yet to get a release date. Pokemon Go reportedly hadabout 45 million daily playersat its peak and generatedmore than $1.2bn (Â£915m) in sales.,external One expert said the Harry Potter brand had the potential for similar success. Publisher Warner Bros Interactive owns the video game rights to the Harry Potter series. It has previously developed Lego-branded tie-in titles via its TT Games subsidiary as well partnering with Electronic Arts to create action-adventures that launched alongside the movies. Warner said Niantic's Harry Potter: Wizards Unite was justone of several new games,externalbased on JK Rowling's characters that are planned. They will all be released under a new label - Portkey Games - so-named because Portkeys transport wizards from place to place in the books. Niantic continues to add features and characters to Pokemon Go Claims that Niantic would make aHarry Potter-themed game were first reported in July 2016,externalbut weredismissed as a hoax,external, not least because the San Francisco-based developer was still rolling out Pokemon Go at the time. The Pokemon title became the first mainstream hit for augmented reality, in which real-world views captured via a camera are mixed together with computer graphics on the screen. Niantic had previously attempted to popularise AR with Ingress, a location-based sci-fi game released in 2012. But it was only after it took on an established brand that it caught the wider public's attention. Lego-themed Harry Potter titles have already proved to be highly popular on games consoles ""I think the Harry Potter game is a huge deal,"" commented Piers Harding-Rolls from the IHS Markit consultancy. ""If you look at the different major franchises out there, I don't think there are many that could do Pokemon Go justice as a follow-up."" Relativelyfew details have been provided,externalat this point about the forthcoming game, except that it will involve players learning spells before exploring their neighbourhoods to search for mysterious artefacts and fight ""legendary beasts"" with the option to team up with others to ""take down powerful enemies"". Potter fans have been told they will have to wait until next year to discover more. The title is likely to take advantage of enhanced augmented reality features provided by Apple and Google via their ARKit and ARCore developer tools, which were not available when Pokemon Go launched. But Niantic may be mindful that many of Pokemon Go's remaining fans play it with its AR features switched off because it makes the game easier to play and helps save battery life. ""I expect the Harry Potter augmented reality experiences will be more robust and complex than they were in Pokemon Go, which should make the game more dynamic and the experience more engaging,"" Mr Harding-Rolls predicted. ""But I still don't think they will be essential to the experience.""

But he said food prices this Christmas would still be ""about the same as they were two years ago"". His comments came as the retailer reported a 9% fall in interim profits. However, the decline was not as bad as expected and sales rose. The UK's second largest supermarket chain said profits came in at Â£251m in the 28 weeks to the 23 September, while like-for-like sales excluding fuel went up by 1.6%. It said the fall in profits was due to price cutting, wage cost inflation and the consolidation of Argos. Chief executive Mike Coupe said,externalhe was ""very pleased with progress"". The value of sterling has fallen sharply since last year's Brexit referendum, pushing up the cost of imports. Initially, retailers were protected against those increased costs because they buy in advance, but more recently they have felt the effects of the currency devaluation. However, Mr Coupe said the ""impact on customers had been relatively limited"". He said the retailer was aiming to limit price rises, despite the recent pick-up in inflation. ""Food price inflation as measured by the government is around 2% and inevitably the things that we import - so they tend to be things like fresh foods - get a little bit more expensive on the back of that,"" Mr Coupe said. ""But we're probably through the worst, if the truth be told, and actually even today's prices are about the same as they were two years ago, so we as a business have done a very good job of protecting our customers from the more extreme challenges of inflation and the currency movements."" The supermarket chain took over catalogue retailer Argos and Habitat last year in a Â£1.4bn deal. In the past six months, Sainsbury's has opened a further 73 Argos concessions in its stores, bringing the total to 112. It plans to have 165 by Christmas. Mr Coupe said: ""We have delivered a good performance across the group in the last six months. ""We are now three years into delivering our differentiated strategy and are seeing clear results."" Sainsbury's is looking to make cost savings amid fierce competition from discounters and rising food costs. It says it has exceeded its cost savings target and will have managed to have saved Â£540m over the three years to the end of the current financial year. It also plans to make a further Â£500m of savings during the next three years. Mr Coupe said the chain was continuing to ""focus on offering our customers great value, supported by our removal of multibuys"". Sales at Sainsbury's convenience stores are growing strongly He was also asked whether discounters such as Aldi and Lidl were still making inroads into Sainsbury's customer base. ""We have always worked on the assumption that the discounters will continue to grow... but we have planned our business on that basis and the way our customers are shopping is changing. ""They're shopping with us more frequently and you can see that in our convenience store business - it's grown at 8%, they're shopping online, that's grown at 7% and increasingly they're shopping non-food with Sainsbury's, so for instance, our clothing business grew by 7%."" The company said its full-year profit forecast remained ""in line"" with market expectations. However, Sainsbury's share price fell more than 3% following the release of the results. It subsequently recovered some ground and closed 2.1% lower. Molly Johnson-Jones, senior Retail Analyst at GlobalData, said Sainsbury's ""momentum"" from the first quarter had not been maintained. ""Of all of the grocers, Sainsbury's improvement seems the most muted, and a focus on profitability must be maintained in order to prevent further investor discontent.""

"The memorial to the Enniskillen bomb victims was removed hours after being unveiled A man whose father was killed in the Enniskillen bomb has said uncertainty over where a permanent memorial is to be sited has been very hurtful. The bomb exploded at the town's cenotaph on 8 November 1987. A memorial to the 12 killed, which was to stand on land beside the Clinton Centre, has been put in storage. The Catholic Church trust which owns the land said it had not been consulted by the council and had not yet made a decision on the matter. Enniskillen Poppy Day bomb memorial unveiled Together or apart after IRA atrocity? 'Injuries were horrific - worse came later' The memorial was unveiled on Wednesday Thememorial was unveiled on Wednesdayin an event marking 30 years since the attack. Stephen Gault, whose father, Samuel, was killed in the atrocity, said that it had been a very stressful time for the families. St Michael's Diocesan Trust, which owns the land on which the proposed memorial was to be placed, has said it only received documentation about the memorial in late September. It added that it cannot make a decision before all of the trustees meet and discuss the proposal. However, Mr Gault and his wife, Sharon, as well as the Ely Centre, which supported the memorial proposal, have all said that discussions and consultations had been ongoing with the diocesan trust. In a statement, the Ely Centre said that St Michael's was informed of the proposal when the original planning application was submitted in January. The area in red is where the original planning application proposed to site the memorial, before it was revised to be placed at the area in yellow Theplanning documents held online,externalconfirm that the diocesan trust was informed when the original application was submitted. However, the original application proposed situating the memorial on an area that is not owned by the trust - a footpath at a wall of the Clinton Centre. Transport NI objected to this plan because it could potentially obstruct a pavement, so the plans were revised. In the new application, the memorial was proposed for a paved area at the entrance of the Clinton Centre - an area owned by the diocesan trust. ""With red tape, in the very last minutes leading up the anniversary, the consent hasn't come from the people who actually own the ground that the memorial will go on,"" he said. He added that planning permission was granted in July and that there had been ""six months of dialogue and investigations into getting planning permission and those who own the land never objected in any way"". Stephen Gault said the uncertainty over where the memorial will be sited has been very hurtful ""But all of a sudden, some several weeks before the anniversary, we came up against this final hurdle and obviously the memorial then had to be removed, it wasn't allowed to stay."" He said the memorial being taken away in the back of a lorry was ""just disgraceful"". Sharon Gault, Mr Gault's wife and a Catholic parishioner at the church that owns the land, has written to St Michael's Diocesan Trust asking what ""valid objections"" it could have. In the letter, seen by the BBC, she wrote: ""I am bewildered as to why there would be any hesitation and opposition from St Michael's trustees not to support having a memorial."" The scene at the cenotaph in Enniskillen after the 1987 bombing Speaking to Good Morning Ulster on Wednesday, Mrs Gault said that local clergy ""were well aware of plans for the memorial"" and there was ""absolutely no indication at that stage that there was going to be any objections"". However, St Michael's Diocesan Trust said it had only received initial documentation regarding the memorial in late September. ""The trust wishes to place on record that, as owner of the property concerned, it was not consulted by the council in relation to the granting of planning permission. ""Nonetheless, the trust is in the process of giving due and careful consideration to all aspects of the request and has yet to come to any decision. ""There has been engagement between representatives of St Michael's Diocesan Trust and the Ely Centre since the submission of the above-mentioned documentation and we look forward to the continuation of that in the future."" It said that it was ""sensitive to the memories and grief being experienced during these days by the families and relatives"". The Ely Centre, a Troubles-victims charity based in Enniskillen, said that the families had worked ""tirelessly to resolve the issue"" and that it would ""encourage the landowner to reach a decision swiftly to ensure that the families suffer no more during this exceptionally emotive time"".

"Thousands of children and teenagers were referred to the government's anti-terror programme in England and Wales last year, Home Office figures show. The Prevent programme aims to stop people being drawn into terrorism. There were 7,631 referrals in 2015-16, a quarter of which were of under-15s, but only 381 required specialist help. Labour's Naz Shah said the figures reinforced her concerns about the scheme, but security minister Ben Wallace said it had got ""real results"". Chief Constable Simon Cole, the national policing lead for Prevent, said the number of referrals showed that ""trust and support is growing"" for the programme. In one case a nine-year-old boy was helped by the Prevent programme after he stood up in class and said he supported so-called Islamic state. He found their propaganda online after searching for news coverage of the Paris attacks, the Home Office said, but received support from the government's intensive de-radicalisation scheme, known as Channel. Reality Check: What is the Prevent strategy? Teachers' fears over Prevent strategy 'Prevent not just about Muslim community' It is the first time the government has published detailed figures on the initiative, created in 2003. They reveal that 2,127 of those referred to the scheme in 2015-16 were under 15, including more than 500 girls. This video can not be played Rahmaan Mohammadi was referred to Prevent aged 14, describing it as ""toxic"" Another 2,147 people reported were aged between 15 and 20 - meaning more than half of the 7,631 people referred in the 12 months to March 2016 were aged 20 or under. The figures suggest there has been an increase in cases involving under-15s, but officials believe this could be due to a greater awareness among teachers of the potential warning signs - a third of the referrals came from the education sector. Home Office officials said academic research indicated that while there had been some initial concerns about ""over-zealous"" referrals by teachers, they now had a good grasp of which young people needed help. Every time a case is referred to a local Prevent panel, experts consider the evidence - such as a report from a teacher - and decide whether the individual needs to be steered away from extremist ideology. The latest figures show that the vast majority of people referred to Prevent required either no official support, or were given help with a problem unrelated to violent extremism. But 1,072 individuals caused such alarm they were assessed for inclusion in Channel, the government's intensive de-radicalisation programme, which is voluntary and provides tailored support to individuals in England and Wales. Of those cases, 381 went on to receive specialist help in an attempt to change their thinking - and 302 were later given the all-clear. Sixteen of those were still in the process at the time the figures were collated, but a further 63 people withdrew from the scheme - meaning they stopped co-operating with expert mentors altogether. By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent All the indications are that the number of Prevent referrals for 2017, when they are eventually collated and published, is likely to be considerably higher than this historical data. Having said that, we have learnt a lot today about the character of those causing the most concern. For a start, 2016 wasn't all about Syria. The figures show how the emergence of new far-right groups is causing concern. In Wales, for example, the ratio of far-right referrals to Islamist was the highest of anywhere in the UK. Across England and Wales, only a small number of all Prevent referrals cases ended up requiring intensive de-radicalisation, but a sixth of all those who were offered this specialist counselling - 63 people - refused to take part and withdrew. What we don't know for sure is what happens next to those people. Ministers suggest they are neither abandoned nor forgotten. And that means there will be someone watching - and some of these people will end up in court. Approximately 65% of the Prevent referrals related to Islamist/jihadist extremism and 10% concerned right-wing extremism. The remaining cases were either impossible to initially categorise, because the individual was flitting between ideologies, or involved smaller threats relating to Northern Ireland, or Sikh extremism. The highest number of cases came from London - 1,915 individuals - followed by 1,273 the North East, an area covering Yorkshire to the Scottish border. Security minister Ben Wallace said the Channel scheme was helping to ""save lives"" and had seen ""real results"" in helping divert people away from terrorism. Labour's Naz Shah, who sits on the Commons Home Affairs committee, said the fact the majority of Islamic extremism referrals required no further action reinforced suggested problems with the scheme. She said: ""If you've referred a child, a young person, and there turns out to be actually nothing that they're doing that's wrong - that's really worrying for me and it's very alarming."" But Dr Usama Hasan, head of Islamic Studies at the counter-extremism organisation Quilliam, said it was not surprising there had been lots of ""false"" referrals. She said: ""This is a new duty on schools and a lot of teachers are worried that if they miss somebody, they could lose their job for missing a potential terrorist.""

"Houses in Norfolk are among those falling in value, according to the RICS survey House prices are now falling in four areas of the country, according to the latest report from chartered surveyors. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) has said that prices are declining in London, the South East, East Anglia and north-east England. However, other parts of the UK are seeing an improvement in activity. Scotland, Wales, north-west England and Northern Ireland have continued to see rising prices, according to RICS. At the same time the UK's largest estate agent reported a 7% fall in revenues in the three months to the end of September. Shares in Countrywide fell by 6%. The RICS report on the housing market is gloomy overall, citing fewer buyers and sellers, as well as falling sales. House prices 'continuing to rise' Across the country as a whole, it said prices were flat, with just 1% more surveyors reporting rises in October than those reporting falls. The survey appears to contrast with data from the Halifax, which said earlier this week that house price growth had risen to 4.5% in the year to October. The surveyors thought the short-term outlook for prices was even more negative. When asked what they thought would happen to house prices over the next three months, a majority reported falling values in London, the South East, East Anglia, the South West, the North East and the West Midlands. RICS said that last week's rise in base rates was one factor behind the ""stuttering"" market. Around four million mortgage holders will see a rise in interest rates as a result of the Bank of England's decision to increase rates by 0.25% to 0.5%. ""The combination of the increased cost of moving, a lack of fresh stock coming to the market, uncertainly over the political climate and now an interest rate hike appears to be taking its toll on activity in the housing market,"" said Simon Rubinsohn, RICS' chief economist. ""A stagnant second-hand market is bad news for the wider economy, not just in terms of spending, but also because it restricts mobility."" Countrywide, which owns 600 branches of estate agents, said its full year results were likely to be at the lower end of market expectations. ""The market for housing transactions remains challenging,"" said chief executive Alison Platt.

"Wounds heal more quickly if they occur during the day rather than after dark, a study suggests. It found burns sustained at night took an average of 28 days to heal, but just 17 for those that happened in daytime. The team, at the UK's MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, said they were astounded by the difference they saw in 118 burns patients they studied. The effect was explained by the way body clock ticks inside nearly every human cell across a 24-hour cycle. The research,published in Science Translational Medicine,external, examined 118 patients at NHS burns units. It showed the average 11-day difference in healing times between people hurt at night and during the day. Detailed lab work showed skin cells called fibroblasts were changing their abilities in a 24-hour pattern. Fibroblasts are the body's first responders, rushing to the site of injury to close a wound. During the day they are primed to react, but they lose this ability at night. Dr John O'Neill, one of the researchers, told the BBC: ""It is like the 100m. The sprinter down on the blocks, poised and ready to go, is always going to beat the guy going from a standing start."" Heart surgery survival chances 'better in the afternoon' Speed Up Wound-healing With Expressive Writing Ultrasound may heal chronic wounds, suggests study The researchers think they could use this knowledge to improve surgery. Some drugs, such as the steroid cortisol, can reset an individual cell's body clock and may be helpful in night-time procedures. And everybody's body clock runs to a slightly different pattern or ""chronotype"". So, it might make sense to schedule operations to keep in time with the patients' 24-hour ""circadian rhythms"". Both ideas are still untested, though. Dr John Blaikley, a clinician scientist at the University of Manchester, said: ""Treatment of wounds costs the NHS around Â£5bn, which is partly due to a lack of effective therapies targeting wound closure. ""By taking these [circadian factors] into account, not only could novel drug targets be identified, but also the effectiveness of established therapies might be increased through changing what time of day they are given.""

"The station is temporary and will be taken down in December Live weather data is being recorded again at the top of Ben Nevis, the UK's highest peak, after a 113-year gap. Researchers have installed an automatic meteorological station that digitally collects information on temperatures, wind speeds and rainfall levels. Until 1904, the same measurements were gathered by men who lived in a shelter at the summit. The weather station was carried up the mountain, in the Scottish Highlands, by a team of researchers on Tuesday. Solar panels and batteries drive the station The new station means visitors to theUnEarthed exhibition in Edinburgh,externalnext week will be able to take a look in real-time at weather conditions on the mountain, something that was not possible previously. Dr Barbara Brooks and her team from theNERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science,externalcarried the equipment up the mountain on Tuesday - and were able to be precise in their observations on the weather they encountered. ""We had some blue sky and then as we crested the summit the cloud banks rolled in and we got some light snow flurries. The temperature was -3.6C with a wind chill of -12C,"" she told BBC News. Escorted by local guide Ron Walker, the team of five set up a solar-and battery-powered Vaisala WXT536 station to record wind speed and direction, pressure, temperature, humidity, and precipitation - specifically rain and sleet. These are the measurements that the famous ""Weathermen of Ben Nevis"" would take by hand on the hour, every hour, during the period from 1883 to 1904. They lived in a small shelter and telegraphed their observations to the town of Fort William down below. Their original logs are now being digitised by volunteers for theOperation Weather Rescue: Ben Nevis,externalproject. The Ben Nevis weather observatory was manned from 1883 to 1904 The NCAS team got all types of weather as they went up Ben Nevis The old information is still useful because it can shed light on past storms in the Scottish Highlands as well as providing ongoing insights into how weather systems evolve as they pass over Scotland's largest mountains. In addition, scientists say, it is all part of the broader archive of data that is needed to inform our understanding of Britain's climate. ""Next year, the UKCP18 report will be released and it will contain very detailed projections of how the UK climate could change,"" explained NCAS scientist Prof Ed Hawkins from the University of Reading. ""As part of that there are updated observations and these will include a gridded daily rainfall data-set back to 1891. That's brand new and it will include the recovered Ben Nevis information."" A 4G modem is used to send the weather data to NCAS at Leeds University The newly installed weather station on the peak of Ben Nevis will only be in place until December, when it will be taken away again. It has been bolted to some old metal caging about 15m from the pillar that in the past was used to measurethe height of the mountain's summit (1,345m/4,411ft)and the surrounding peaks. A permanently installed weather station would require a more secure footing.

"""I can name six names, one of them who is still very powerful today,"" Feldman said recently Eighties child star Corey Feldman has filed a report with police after vowing to expose an alleged paedophile ring in Hollywood. Los Angeles Police Department confirmed they are launching an investigation after receiving the actor's report. LAPD did not confirm the nature of the allegations. Feldman's spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment. Feldman, now 46, has long alleged Hollywood figures molested young actors including himself and Corey Haim. New allegations against Spacey emerge He appeared last week on The Dr Oz Show, announcing a $10m (Â£7.6m) fundraising campaign for a film he wants to produce about the alleged abuse scandal.

In his 2013 autobiography, Coreyography, Feldman detailed abuse he says he and Haim suffered in Hollywood. He blamed it for Haim's drug problems and untimely death in 2010 at the age of 38. Feldman told ABC's Nightline in 2011: ""There is one person to blame in the death of Corey Haim, and that person happens to be a Hollywood mogul. ""And that person needs to be exposed but unfortunately I can't be the one to do it."" Feldman and Haim (R) were known as the Two Coreys Feldman has always declined to reveal names, citing fears of lawsuits. But he said he had been emboldened to speak out by revelations of Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein's alleged serial sexual abuse. It is not clear if there could be a statute of limitations on prosecutions for offences alleged by Feldman. Weinstein spy report is 'terrifying' While he has attracted much support online, Haim's mother, Judy Haim, is among those who doubt Feldman's claims. She told the Hollywood Reporter: ""If he was serious about this, he'd share the information he has with the police."" Feldman posted an essay rebutting Ms Haim's allegation,externalthat his movie project plan is a ""long con"". He and Haim starred in several films together between 1987-96, including The Lost Boys and Dream a Little Dream.

"The station is temporary and will be taken down in December Live weather data is being recorded again at the top of Ben Nevis, the UK's highest peak, after a 113-year gap. Researchers have installed an automatic meteorological station that digitally collects information on temperatures, wind speeds and rainfall levels. Until 1904, the same measurements were gathered by men who lived in a shelter at the summit. The weather station was carried up the mountain, in the Scottish Highlands, by a team of researchers on Tuesday. Solar panels and batteries drive the station The new station means visitors to theUnEarthed exhibition in Edinburgh,externalnext week will be able to take a look in real-time at weather conditions on the mountain, something that was not possible previously. Dr Barbara Brooks and her team from theNERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science,externalcarried the equipment up the mountain on Tuesday - and were able to be precise in their observations on the weather they encountered. ""We had some blue sky and then as we crested the summit the cloud banks rolled in and we got some light snow flurries. The temperature was -3.6C with a wind chill of -12C,"" she told BBC News. Escorted by local guide Ron Walker, the team of five set up a solar-and battery-powered Vaisala WXT536 station to record wind speed and direction, pressure, temperature, humidity, and precipitation - specifically rain and sleet. These are the measurements that the famous ""Weathermen of Ben Nevis"" would take by hand on the hour, every hour, during the period from 1883 to 1904. They lived in a small shelter and telegraphed their observations to the town of Fort William down below. Their original logs are now being digitised by volunteers for theOperation Weather Rescue: Ben Nevis,externalproject. The Ben Nevis weather observatory was manned from 1883 to 1904 The NCAS team got all types of weather as they went up Ben Nevis The old information is still useful because it can shed light on past storms in the Scottish Highlands as well as providing ongoing insights into how weather systems evolve as they pass over Scotland's largest mountains. In addition, scientists say, it is all part of the broader archive of data that is needed to inform our understanding of Britain's climate. ""Next year, the UKCP18 report will be released and it will contain very detailed projections of how the UK climate could change,"" explained NCAS scientist Prof Ed Hawkins from the University of Reading. ""As part of that there are updated observations and these will include a gridded daily rainfall data-set back to 1891. That's brand new and it will include the recovered Ben Nevis information."" A 4G modem is used to send the weather data to NCAS at Leeds University The newly installed weather station on the peak of Ben Nevis will only be in place until December, when it will be taken away again. It has been bolted to some old metal caging about 15m from the pillar that in the past was used to measurethe height of the mountain's summit (1,345m/4,411ft)and the surrounding peaks. A permanently installed weather station would require a more secure footing. The scientists, however, are hopeful the interest around the digitisation project will inspire a successful long-term funding proposal. This would enable a bigger installation to be flown up by helicopter. Additional instruments such as snow-depth sensors could be included. Dr Brooks' team left a webcam in position on Tuesday, but a permanent station could have several looking out in all directions.

"This video can not be played Trump spoke about North Korea and US-China trade US President Donald Trump has lavished praise on Chinese leader Xi Jinping, a marked contrast to his previous criticism of China on the flashpoint issues of North Korea and trade. But he also urged Mr Xi to ""work very hard"" on persuading North Korea to denuclearise. On China's trade surplus, Mr Trump surprised many when he said he did ""not blame China"" for ""taking advantage"". China has said it will lower market entry barriers to some sectors. The US president was speaking in Beijing while on a state visit. He is in the Chinese capital as part of his five-nation tour of Asia. The two leaders held talks earlier on Thursday after a grand welcome for Mr Trump. Trump says trade deficit not China's fault Trump, China and Twitter - what's going on? Watch:Chinese citizens describe America in one phrase China will further lower entry barriers in the banking, insurance, and finance sectors, and gradually reduce vehicle tariffs, the Chinese foreign ministry said. Deals worth $250bn (Â£190bn) have also been announced, although it is unclear how much of that figure includes past deals or potential future deals. But Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told journalists the deals were ""pretty small"" in terms of tackling the trade imbalance. Discussion on how to deal with North Korea's threats to the region has dominated Mr Trump's agenda, and China is Pyongyang's main economic supporter. Mr Trump said China could fix the problem of North Korea's nuclear programme ""easily and quickly"". He added: ""I am calling on [Mr Xi] to work very hard. I know one thing about your president. If he works on it hard, it'll get done."" Mr Xi, for his part, said both sides would ""continue to work towards"" fully implementing UN sanctions and ""enduring peace"" on the Korean peninsula. Mr Trump has previously been more critical andtweeted in July,externalthat Beijing was doing ""NOTHING for us with North Korea, just talk"". Just before his arrival in Beijing he urged China to sever ties with the North. Beijing has consistently said it is doing all it can. ""I don't blame China - after all, who can blame a country for taking advantage of another country for the benefit of its citizens... I give China great credit,"" said Mr Trump while addressing a room of business leaders. Instead, the US leader said previous US administrations were responsible for what he called ""a very unfair and one-sided"" trade relationship with China. This video can not be played Why the US president keeps mentioning Indo-Pacific Mr Trump has in the past accused China of stealing American jobs and threatened to label it a currency manipulator, thoughhe has since rowed back on such rhetoric. Mr Xi on Thursday promised ""healthy"" and ""balanced"" economic and trade relations. The two leaders also said they would work together to tackle terrorism and drug trafficking. Mr Trump upheld the""one China"" policyin his talks with Mr Xi, Xinhua state news agency reported. Since arriving in Beijing, Mr Trump has been fulsome in his praise for the Chinese leader, saying at one point: ""You are a very special man."" He has also enthusiastically thanked Mr Xi for his hospitality in several tweets. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Trump flew into Beijing on Wednesday and was greeted withgreat pomp and ceremony, in what was billed as a ""state visit-plus"". He has tweeted several times since arriving in China - where Twitter is banned. But a White House official told reporters that he would ""tweet whatever he wants"". As part of his Asia trip Mr Trump has already visited South Korea and Japan, and will go on to Vietnam and the Philippines later in the week. Trump vs Xi: The two men compared What has Trump said about your country? By BBC's John Sudworth in Beijing You'd be forgiven for forgetting that the two men at the centre of this blossoming bromance are meant to be strategic rivals. Across the negotiating table, Mr Trump held Mr Xi's gaze. ""My feeling towards you is incredibly warm,"" he said. It's a statement that in many other circumstances might lead the recipient to glance nervously in the direction of the exit. Mr Xi just smiled and nodded. At the ceremony where US and Chinese businesses signed a number of deals, the US president appeared to have dropped his old China-bashing ways completely. His ""I don't blame China"" declaration over the trade imbalance was met with an audible gasp. Even here, one year on and 6,000 miles from the US presidential campaign trail, the audience couldn't quite believe what they were hearing. Is President Trump softening China up for tougher action on the trade imbalance further down the line? Maybe. But as the two men left the podium he had another gift for his Chinese host. Both men refused to take questions from the press. US presidents used to stand up for press freedom on visits to China. Not this one. He's warned North Korea to""not try"" the US and the world. But he also called on Pyongyang to""come to the table""for a disarmament deal. He said Japan and South Korea will be buying US military equipment whichcould shoot down Pyongyang's missiles- the two countries said they are considering it. He's alsolashed out at ""unfair"" trade ties with Japan- while in Tokyo What has Trump said about your country? Trump, China and Twitter - what's going on?

"The BBC is to scrap its plan to cut Â£10m from its local radio budget, in a bid to become ""more local"", director general Lord Hall has said. Speaking at an event marking the 50th birthday of BBC local radio, he promised a ""renaissance"" for the broadcaster's 39 regional stations. He said the savings target - previously announced after a review of the BBC's local services -  had been cancelled. The BBC will instead invest in local radio to boost creativity, he added. BBC local radio at 50: relive the big stories Speaking at the event in Coventry, Lord Hall said local radio was becoming ""more important, not less"" and held a key role in battling fake news. ""I'm a director general who believes in local radio,"" he said. ""For many years the BBC has been reducing its investment in local radio. ""The development of new technology and the growth of smartphones has seen many people getting their local news, weather and traffic information digitally."" With many of the radio stations operating on reduced budgets over the past decade, a number of distinctive local shows and presenters were dropped from their evening slots and replaced by a ""shared broadcast"" across all of England's stations. A BBC statement said this show,currently presented by Georgey Spanswick,would be ending and there would be a return to ""local programming"". Lord Hall said: ""Local Radio is in the DNA of our communities. I think that is more important than ever. ""England's changing. It's always been a patchwork of communities, with quite distinct identities. ""While Newcastle's population is getting older, Bradford's is getting younger and Birmingham is becoming one of the most diverse cities in Europe."" He pointed out that with political decision-making increasingly being devolved to councils and directly elected mayors, it was important that the BBC was ready to assess the impact this was having. ""I want to hear the sound of England as it changes. So while other media are becoming creatively less local, I want us to become even more so and to connect with our audiences in new ways."" Lord Hall stressed the BBC had a duty to reach out to the so-called smartphone generation. ""That's why the role of BBC local radio is actually becoming more important - not less,"" he said. ""Local radio should be for everybody. It's there to serve the Facebook generation every bit as much as the rest of us."" The BBC will instead rely on savings elsewhere to protect the local radio budgets. Detailed plans will be set out next year, it said. Earlier in the day, Lord Hall was in Leicester to mark the launch of the first BBC local radio station, BBC Radio Leicester, which went live on 8 November, 1967.

"This video can not be played The seizure was the largest in Colombia's history Colombian police have discovered 12 tonnes of cocaine in the largest single drug seizure in the country's history. The drugs were found buried in four banana plantations in the north of the country, close to the routes used to smuggle cocaine to the US. President Juan Manuel Santos said it was the largest drugs haul in a single police operation. The operation is part of an offensive against the powerful Gulf Clan, a drug trafficking gang. Police said the drug stash belonged to Dairo Ãsuga, also known as Otoniel, leader of the Gulf Clan, one of Colombia's most dangerous criminal organisations. The hunt for Otoniel The security forces have been trying to capture Otoniel for years. Police said they had also arrested four people and estimated that the value of the haul was around $360m (Â£275m). In the last two months the security forces have seized 20 tonnes of cocaine in Antioquia. The Gulf Clan emerged from the remnants of right-wing paramilitary groups that demobilized in 2006 following a government peace deal. In September, Otoniel told the government he wanted to turn himself in. The government says more than 1,500 members of the gang have been arrested this year and its second-in-command has been killed.

"This video can not be played Priti Patel is filmed leaving the back entrance of 10 Downing Street Priti Patel has resigned as UK international development secretary amid controversy over her unauthorised meetings with Israeli officials. She was ordered back from an official trip in Africa by the PM and summoned to Downing Street over the row. In her resignation letter, Ms Patel said her actions ""fell below the standards of transparency and openness that I have promoted and advocated"". The PM said her decision was ""right"" as ""further details have come to light"". Ms Patel had apologised to Theresa May on Monday after unauthorised meetings in August with Israeli politicians - including prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu - came to light. But it later emerged she had two further meetings without government officials present in September. Laura Kuenssberg: Exit poses problems for May Rolling updates: Reaction to Patel quitting Profile: Priti Patel A guide for international readers to UK political scandal Ms Patel arrived at 10 Downing Street via the back door - after earlier flying back to the UK from Africa for her meeting with Mrs May - and she left some 45 minutes later. She was accused of breaching the ministerial code, which sets out the standards of conduct expected of government ministers. Her resignation from the cabinet is the second in seven days, after Sir Michael Fallon quit as defence secretary on Wednesday last week amid allegations about his behaviour. This video can not be played What went wrong for Priti Patel? The BBC's James Landale explains In her letter to the PM, Ms Patel said: ""While my actions were meant with the best of intentions, my actions also fell below the standards of transparency and openness that I have promoted and advocated. ""I offer a fulsome apology to you and to the government for what has happened and offer my resignation."" Priti Patel's resignation letter In her reply, Mrs May said: ""Now that further details have come to light, it is right that you have decided to resign and adhere to the high standards of transparency and openness that you have advocated."" She added that Ms Patel should ""take pride"" in what had been achieved during her time as secretary of state. The BBC's chief political correspondent Vicki Young said Theresa May ""decided to give her colleague the dignity of resigning"". But she said the response from Mrs May was ""interesting"", saying: ""It was clear from Theresa May that if she hadn't resigned, she would have been sacked."" This video can not be played The foreign secretary called Priti Patel a ""first class"" international development secretary Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told the BBC: ""Priti Patel has been a very good colleague and friend for a long time and a first class secretary of state for international development. ""It's been a real pleasure working with her and I'm sure she has a great future ahead of her."" Meanwhile, Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson has written to Mrs May over claims passed to him that Ms Patel met Foreign Office officials in Jerusalem, which he says makes it ""impossible to sustain the claim that the FCO was not aware of Ms Patel's presence in Israel"". Mr Watson said he was ""pleased"" that Ms Patel had resigned as her undisclosed meetings were ""a clear breach of the ministerial code, and of diplomatic protocol"". By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor It was precisely a week ago that I was summoned to the Ministry of Defence to ask Sir Michael Fallon why he was resigning. Seven days on, for an unconnected reason, Theresa May has just lost another one of her ministers. That time the resignation was rather differently handled - some private speculation through the day, then a discreet summoning to a quiet room in the department until one of the minister's team came to say: ""Be ready, the secretary of state is resigning, we are finalising the letters between us and Number 10 right now."" This time, the process has been more like a pantomime, with speculation rife for nearly 24 hours that she was on her way out, no-one in government moving to quash it, leaving journalists, on the first day of parliament's recess, free to track Priti Patel's plane online then her journey back to Westminster. Goodness knows what Ms Patel's Ugandan hosts, who were expecting her to visit today, make of it all. Beyond today's palaver, though, her exit throws up problems for Mrs May. It is never as simple as one out, one in. Read more from Laura Ms Patel was formally reprimanded in Downing Street on Monday, where she was asked to give details about a dozen meetings she had with Israeli officials while on holiday, which were not sanctioned by the Foreign Office. She was thenforced to correct the record earlier this week,externalabout the number of meetings that she had attended and when the Foreign Office had been notified about them. The MP admitted she had been wrong to suggest to the Guardian that Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson knew of the trip in advance when he had only learnt about it while it was under way. Elected as Conservative MP for Witham in May 2010 Served as a Treasury minister from July 2014 to May 2015 She then became employment minister from May 2015 to July 2016 Appointed International Development Secretary in July 2016 A longstanding Eurosceptic, she was a leading figure in the Vote Leave campaign during the EU referendum Read more: A profile of Priti Patel Then, details of two other meetings emerged. Ms Patel met Israeli public security minister Gilad Erdan in Westminster on 7 September. And on 18 September she met foreign ministry official Yuval Rotem in New York. It is thought Lord Polak, honorary president of the Conservative Friends of Israel, was present at both meetings. It is not yet clear whether or when Ms Patel had informed the prime minister about these meetings or of her plans to look into giving tax-payers' money to the Israeli military to treat wounded Syrian refugees in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights region - a request that was turned down as ""inappropriate"" by officials. In a further development on Wednesday the Israeli Haaretz newspaper reported that during August she visited an Israeli military field hospital in the Golan Heights - the UK, like other members of the international community, has never recognised Israeli control of the area seized from Syria in the 1967 Six-Day War. In her letter to Ms Patel, the prime minister wrote: ''As you know the UK and Israel are close allies, and it is right that we should work closely together. But that must be done formally, and through official channels.

"Theresa May is embarking on a second cabinet reshuffle in a week after Priti Patel resigned over her unauthorised meetings with Israeli officials. The international development secretary - who was in charge of the UK's foreign aid budget - admitted her actions ""lacked transparency"". Mrs May is facing calls to replace her with another MP who voted for Brexit. Ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said the PM would want to keep a ""balance"" of views on the EU in her top team. He predicted she would not make ""big changes"" to the cabinet line-up and although Ms Patel's replacement would have to be ""capable"", their views on Britain's future relationship with the EU would also be a factor. Kuenssberg: Exit poses problems for May Who is Priti Patel? What is the scandal about? ""We are all Brexiteers now,"" the leading Leave campaigner told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""So the question is to what degree do you want someone in that job to be in support of (Brexit Secretary) David Davis and others, and I think therefore the balance on having strong Brexit views is one that in all probability the prime minister will certainly look for."" Ms Patel is the second cabinet minister to quit in the space of seven days, after Sir Michael Fallon resigned as defence secretary last week. He was replaced by one of Mrs May's closest allies, Gavin Williamson. According to The Times, European Union leaders are preparing for the possible ""fall of Theresa May before the new year"" and either ""a change of leadership or elections leading to a Labour victory"". Mr Duncan Smith said it was ""a bit rich"" for EU leaders to suggest Mrs May's position was precarious, at a time when the Netherlands and Germany faced difficulties forming governments, there was ""chaos"" in Italy and arrests of Catalonian separatists in Spain. Priti Patel's difficulties began last week, when the BBC revealed Ms Patel arranged a number of private meetings with business and political figures during a family holiday to Israel in August. This video can not be played What went wrong for Priti Patel? The BBC's James Landale explains It later emerged that after Ms Patel's visit to Israel, she asked her officials to look into whether Britain could support humanitarian operations conducted by the Israeli army in the occupied Golan Heights area. But Foreign Office officials strongly advised against this as the need for humanitarian aid was greater elsewhere and giving aid to the military broke aid rules, BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale said. Ms Patel, who has served as the Tory MP for Witham in Essex since 2010, was formally reprimanded in Downing Street on Monday and had to correct her initial media statements about the August meetings. But on Wednesday two further meetings arranged without government officials present came to light, one with Israeli public security minister Gilad Erdan in Westminster early in September and one with Israeli foreign ministry official Yuval Rotem in New York. Asked if Ms Patel had been foolish or had made a concerted attempt at freelance foreign policy, the BBC's James Landale told the Today programme: ""I think it's pretty clear that the view within the government is there was an attempt to try to shape British policy within the Middle East."" Ms Patel was accused of breaching the ministerial code - which sets out the standards of conduct expected of government ministers. In her resignation letter, she said: ""While my actions were meant with the best of intentions, my actions also fell below the standards of transparency and openness that I have promoted and advocated."" In her reply, Mrs May said: ''As you know the UK and Israel are close allies, and it is right that we should work closely together. But that must be done formally, and through official channels. ''That is why, when we met on Monday I was glad to accept your apology and welcomed your clarification about your trip to Israel over the summer. ""Now that further details have come to light it is right you have decided to resign.'' Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg suggested disgruntled Remainers could be behind the leak that led to the downfall of Ms Patel. He told BBC's Newsnight that some people were ""still very bitter"" about the referendum result and ""inevitably that colours their behaviour"". Meanwhile, Labour deputy leader Tom Watson has suggested there were more questions to answer:  ""I have been informed that while she was in Israel, Ms Patel met officials from the British consulate general Jerusalem, but that the fact of this meeting has not been made public. ""If this were the case, then it would surely be impossible to sustain the claim that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office was not aware of Ms Patel's presence in Israel.""

"This video can not be played 'To Kevin Spacey: Shame on you for what you did to my son' New allegations of sexual harassment and predatory behaviour towards men and women by Kevin Spacey have emerged. The claims, spanning from the mid-1980s to 2016, raise further questions about the US actor's conduct in the decades he worked in Hollywood and as artistic director at London's Old Vic theatre. The BBC has contacted Mr Spacey for comment. On Wednesday, the journalist whose October tweet triggered a series of accusations about Mr Spacey spoke out. Allow Twitter content?

Former television news anchor Heather Unruh told a press conference in Boston that her son had been sexually assaulted by Mr Spacey, at the age of 18 in a bar in Nantucket, Massachusetts, in July 2016. She said Mr Spacey had bought her son alcohol - the drinking age in Massachusetts is 21. After getting him drunk, Mr Spacey had ""stuck his hand inside my son's pants and grabbed his genitals"", she said. She said Mr Spacey had invited her son to a party, but he had run away from the bar when Mr Spacey had gone to the lavatory. A criminal investigation was now under way, Mrs Unruh said. ""Shame on you for what you did to my son. Your actions are criminal,"" Mrs Unruh said through her tears. Since the first allegation of sexual advances were made by actor Anthony Rapp on 30 October, US network Netflix axed further production of Mr Spacey's House of Cards drama, the International Academy of Television Arts and Sciences announced it will no longer give the actor a special Emmy award, and his agent and publicist dropped him as a client. In response to Mr Rapp's claims, Mr Spacey said he has no memory of the incident and offered an apology. On 3 November police in the UK confirmed they were investigating an alleged assault on a man from 2008. Mr Spacey said he was seeking treatmentafter facing the allegations but did not give information about the type. This video can not be played Former London barman Kris Nixon says he was groped by Kevin Spacey Since then more men have come forward. Barman Kris Nixon, from Belfast, Northern Ireland, said he had been working near the Old Vic in 2007 when Mr Spacey groped him at a party. ""Kevin Spacey sat down next to me on a sofa, then reached over and grabbed my penis,"" he said. The actor had then suggested he perform a sexual act on Mr Nixon, according to the barman, who then left the party. Kevin Spacey: How the story unfolded Two weeks later, Mr Nixon was in the basement of the bar he had been working in, when, he said, he realised Spacey was two feet (60cm) behind him. The actor grabbed Mr Nixon's waistband and offered to ""make it up"" to him, he said. ""I didn't want to make a scene about it - he was a customer. I didn't want to get fired. ""Until Anthony Rapp spoke out, I never felt able to tell anyone."" Spacey was dropped from his House of Cards series after new allegations Meanwhile, an American film-maker has told the BBC that he was groped and sexually harassed by Mr Spacey as a 22-year-old junior crew member. The man, now 44, who does not want to be identified, said the ""powerful"" director had made advances towards him on the shoot of Albino Alligator in 1995. ""He was very affable and nice to everybody. We shook hands and he took an interest in me. He offered to watch one of my student films, which I was very flattered by,"" he said. But, he said, Mr Spacey had quickly become ""creepy"" and one day insisted he sit in his director's chair. ""He started massaging my neck and my shoulders, and I felt incredibly uncomfortable."" The film-maker, from California, said he had been singled out as a target because of his youth and inexperience. ""On one of the last days of shootingâ¦ he sat down next to me and put his thigh against mine and put his hand on my thigh and moved it towards my inner thigh,"" he said. He told the BBC he had decided to come forward after hearing the allegations by actor Anthony Rapp but felt nervous about revealing his identity because of the influential position Mr  Spacey continued to hold in the industry. At the time, Mr Spacey's powerful position had made him feel conflicted about his encounters with the director, he said. ""I was getting the attention of the most powerful person on the movie set, and I wanted to work in Hollywood,"" he said. ""But it was an interest that made me feel totally uneasy, uncomfortable, confused. I didn't know what to do, I felt trapped. I felt harassed, sexually harassed."" The film-maker said he hoped coming forward would encourage others. ""I hope it makes those people who come forward feel less alone if they are feeling alone and confused, like I was when I was 22."" One woman told the BBC that she suffered depression after an encounter with Mr Spacey. Kate Edwards, now a performing arts teacher in London, claims Mr Spacey made advances towards her when she had been a production assistant on Broadway show Long Day's Journey Into Night in 1986. Ms Edwards, who was 17 at the time, said she had been alone in a lift with the 27-year-old Mr Spacey when he had invited her to a ""James Dean birthday party"" in his flat. Kate Edwards (second left, back row) with the cast and crew of Long Day's Journey Into Night, starring Kevin Spacey, in 1986 When she had arrived, she said, there had been no-one else there. Ms Edwards said she had consensually kissed Mr Spacey, but then had started to feel uncomfortable and asked when others would arrive.. ""I said I want to go home and change. I felt pressured, and it became quite clear that his intention was to have sex with me. ""He became cold and said, 'Find your own way.' She was left ""confused, completely isolated, ashamed."" She said the actor had ""cut her dead"" after the encounter, she had become depressed, had gained weight, and had eventually been unable to continue working on the show. Ms Edwards said her message to Mr Spacey today would be: ""I would like you to know that what you did hurt me, it affected me for years afterwards. ""What you did to me and what you did to other young people was unacceptable.""

"The assault triggered protests by the students of the convent in Ranaghat A court in eastern India has sentenced a Bangladeshi man to life in prison for raping an elderly nun in March 2015. The court in Kolkata (Calcutta) found Nazrul Islam guilty of rape and attempted murder. Five other men were jailed for 10 years for robbery during the assault in Ranaghat, West Bengal state. A sixth men was handed a seven-year term for harbouring the attackers. The 71-year-old nun was attacked after the robbers ransacked her convent. The gang also stole cash and other items during the attack that sent shockwaves across India and triggered mass protests. ""What happened to the elderly nun is a blot on West Bengal's legacy where Mother Teresa worked for the poor,"" Judge Kumkum Singha told a packed court on Wednesday. The nun - who has not been named for legal reasons - underwent surgery after the assault in the Convent of Jesus and Mary. She later moved out of West Bengal. India has in recent years seen a number of attacks on churches of the country's small Christian community. The authorities have also strengthened its laws on sexual violence following a fatal gang-rape of a student in the capital Delhi in 2012. However, campaigners say such assaults remain widespread.

"The technology was first tested in Vegas at the start of this year A self-driving shuttle bus in Las Vegas was involved in a crash on its first day of service. The vehicle - carrying âseveralâ passengers - was hit by a lorry driving at slow speed. Nobody was injured in the incident which city officials say was the fault of the human driver of the lorry. The man was subsequently given a ticket by police. The shuttle is the first of its kind to be used on public roads in the US. The collision comes a day after Waymo - owned by Google's parent company Alphabet - announced it is launching a fully self-driving fleet of taxis in Phoenix, Arizona. The Las Vegas shuttle, designed to ferry passengers to the famous strip, uses a system developed by Navya, a French company alsotesting its technology in London. The shuttle carries up to 15 people and has a maximum speed of 30 mph (48km/h), but typically travels at around 15 mph (24km/h). A spokesman for the City of Las Vegas told the BBC the crash was a âfender benderâ - a minor collision - and that the shuttle would likely be back out on the road on Thursday after some routine diagnostics tests. âA delivery truck was coming out of an alley,â public information officer Jace Radke said. ""The shuttle did what it was supposed to do and stopped. Unfortunately the human element, the driver of the truck, didnât stop.â Self-driving technology has been involved in crashes before, but almost all reported incidents have been due to human error. Earlier this year an autonomous vehicle being tested by ride-sharing company Uber in Arizona rolled over after another driver on the road failed to give way.

An incident involving a Tesla Model S, which has some autonomous functions, killed a man in 2016. An investigation ruled that computer failings were partly to blame. Tesla was instructed to make the limitations of its technology clearer to drivers. Experts have said that even with these incidents, self-driving technology could still make our roads significantly safer.A study from the RAND Corporation, published this week,external, argued that self-driving technology should be rolled out despite its imperfections. âWaiting for highly autonomous vehicles that are many times safer than human drivers misses opportunities to save lives,â the report said.

"This video can not be played The seizure was the largest in Colombia's history Colombian police have discovered 12 tonnes of cocaine in the largest single drug seizure in the country's history. The drugs were found buried in four banana plantations in the north of the country, close to the routes used to smuggle cocaine to the US. President Juan Manuel Santos said it was the largest drugs haul in a single police operation. The operation is part of an offensive against the powerful Gulf Clan, a drug trafficking gang. Police said the drug stash belonged to Dairo Ãsuga, also known as Otoniel, leader of the Gulf Clan, one of Colombia's most dangerous criminal organisations. The hunt for Otoniel The security forces have been trying to capture Otoniel for years. Police said they had also arrested four people and estimated that the value of the haul was around $360m (Â£275m). In the last two months the security forces have seized 20 tonnes of cocaine in Antioquia. The Gulf Clan emerged from the remnants of right-wing paramilitary groups that demobilized in 2006 following a government peace deal. In September, Otoniel told the government he wanted to turn himself in. The government says more than 1,500 members of the gang have been arrested this year and its second-in-command has been killed.

"Mark van Dongen died 15 months after being attacked in Bristol An acid attack victim has told jurors, in testimony recorded before his death, how the ""jealous"" ex accused of his murder laughed as she doused him in a corrosive liquid. In video evidence, Mark van Dongen, 29, said Berlinah Wallace, 48, shouted ""if I can't have you, no-one else can"" as she threw sulphuric acid at him. Bristol Crown Court heard he ended his life in a euthanasia clinic due to unbearable pain from his injuries. Ms Wallace denies murder. The court heard Dutch national Mr van Dongen was left paralysed from the neck down and lost his left leg, the sight in his left eye and most of the sight in his right eye, after the September 2015 attack in Bristol. He was later told he would require a ""lifetime of constant and dedicated care"". In January this year, he travelled to Belgium where he ended his life in a euthanasia clinic. A picture of Mark van Dongen taken before the attack Jurors were shown the video interview with Mr van Dongen, filmed in hospital in July 2016, where he gave his account of the attack, Trial judge Mrs Justice May warned them they may find the footage, which showed the extent of the scarring to the victim's body, ""shocking and disturbing"". In the video, Mr van Dongen struggles to speak as he describes Ms Wallace waking him up and laughing as she threw acid over him, saying ""if I can't have you, no one else can"". When the interviewer asks if he knew why she had attacked him, he says it was because she was jealous. In a second video shown to the court, Mr van Dongen tells police Ms Wallace threw boiling water over him after an argument in 2014. He also says Ms Wallace hit herself in the face, and told him she would tell police he had caused her injuries if he left her. At the time of the attack, prosecutor Adam Vaitilingam QC told jurors, Mr van Dongen had begun seeing another woman and moved into a hotel. The victim visited the defendant at her flat in Ladysmith Road, Bristol, because he was concerned that she was ""in a bad way and self-harming"", the court was told. He fell asleep, jurors heard, and Ms Wallace laughed as she threw a glass of sulphuric acid over him. The court heard Mr van Dongen ran into the street ""screaming for help"", where neighbours tried to help him, and he was taken to a specialist burns unit at Southmead Hospital. Mr Vaitilingam said: ""The physical and mental suffering that he sustained from that calculated acid attack were what drove him to euthanasia. ""Put simply, he could not bear to live in that condition. ""If that is right, we say, then she is guilty of murder."" Ms Wallace wept in the dock as the jury were told Mr van Dongen was ""genuinely frightened"" of her, and the couple's relationship had become ""volatile"". Berlinah Wallace denies murder and applying a corrosive substance The jury heard computer records showed Ms Wallace had bought the acid online on 2 September. She also carried out internet searches, including ""can I die drinking sulphuric acid?"", and browsed news stories on acid attack victims. Ms Wallace admits throwing a substance over Mr van Dongen but denies any intent to cause him harm. She claims she believed that she was throwing a glass of water over him. Richard Smith QC, defending, told the jury ""to keep an open mind"". ""Yes, she threw the glass over him, but defence claims Mr van Dongen put the acid in the cup without her knowledge, and encouraged her to drink it resulting in a mirror image of what we now have."" He said the couple had a ""turbulent and complicated relationship"" and Ms Wallace was going to blackmail Mr van Dongen with personal information, which was why he put the acid in the glass and encouraged her to drink it. Ms Wallace denies murder and applying a corrosive substance. The trial continues on Thursday.

"Seven days after the rise in base rates, just 17 out of 150 providers have passed on improved returns to their savers. The Bank of England raised rates by 0.25% to 0.5% last Thursday, the first rise in a decade. Many banks are still considering whether to pass on the benefits. But even if their provider does choose to increase rates in full, some savers will still find themselves worse off than when rates were last at 0.5%. NS&I is among the providers that have announced an increase. The returns on all its variable rate products, including premium bonds, will rise by 0.25% from 1 December. Why haven't my savings rates gone up? Some savings rates start to creep up However Virgin Money actually cut savings rates on one of its ISAs on the same day that the Bank of England was raising rates. Those with Virgin's ISA Saver saw rates reduced to 0.75% last Thursday. That compares to an interest rate of 1.3% when base rates were last at 0.5% in August 2016, leaving savers worse off. Another Virgin ISA, the Defined Access E- ISA, now pays just 0.51%, compared to 1.56% last August. ""Some people could be worse off than before the base rate was cut last year,"" said Tom Adams of consumer website Savings Champion. It comes in spite of a plea by the governor of the Bank of England for banks to pass on the benefits of the rise. According to Savings Champion, Virgin Money is not the only provider whose rates have fallen since August 2016. Savers with the Clydesdale and Yorkshire Banks currently receive as little as  0.2% a year on a Flexi Cash ISA. Even if those banks do pass on the rise in full, savers will only get 0.45%, less than the 0.7% return they were getting 15 months ago. Nationwide has promised to pass on the 0.25% rise to all savers whose rates were cut by 0.25% in 2016. Nevertheless customers who had a Flexclusive ISA Issue 10 will now expect to get a 1% return, compared to 1.5% last year. Santander has announced that it will not raise the 1.5% credit savings rate on its popular 123 account. It will raise rates on some of its savings products from 4 December, but most adults will not see the 0.25% passed on in full. Lloyds has also announced that it will increase savings rates, but most of its customers will see a rise of just 0.15%. Virgin Money said customers were warned about last Thursday's ISA rate cut back in July. Because it is a 120 day notice account, savers had to be told four months in advance. Virgin also said it had paid rates that were above the market average over the last few years. By contrast, lenders have been quick to raise the cost of mortgages. Most customers with tracker mortgages have seen an immediate rise of 0.25%. So far 20 banks have announced increases to their Standard Variable Rate (SVR) mortgages, including Barclays, Halifax, Lloyds, Nationwide, Santander and TSB. HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland and NatWest are still considering their plans. ""Although not all are increasing their rates that may well be because they didn't pass on the last cut, so borrowers should still be considering whether they could be getting a better deal by shopping around,"" said David Hollingworth, associate communications director at London and Country Mortgages. ""Those that have been eyeing a fixed rate will also have begun to notice that fixed deals have already been nudging up."" TSB, Metro, Tesco and Atom Bank are among those whose fixed rate products have gone up, although this will only affect new customers. Rate Tracker - Find the best rate.

"The assault triggered protests by the students of the convent in Ranaghat A court in eastern India has sentenced a Bangladeshi man to life in prison for raping an elderly nun in March 2015. The court in Kolkata (Calcutta) found Nazrul Islam guilty of rape and attempted murder. Five other men were jailed for 10 years for robbery during the assault in Ranaghat, West Bengal state. A sixth men was handed a seven-year term for harbouring the attackers. The 71-year-old nun was attacked after the robbers ransacked her convent. The gang also stole cash and other items during the attack that sent shockwaves across India and triggered mass protests. ""What happened to the elderly nun is a blot on West Bengal's legacy where Mother Teresa worked for the poor,"" Judge Kumkum Singha told a packed court on Wednesday. The nun - who has not been named for legal reasons - underwent surgery after the assault in the Convent of Jesus and Mary. She later moved out of West Bengal. India has in recent years seen a number of attacks on churches of the country's small Christian community. The authorities have also strengthened its laws on sexual violence following a fatal gang-rape of a student in the capital Delhi in 2012. However, campaigners say such assaults remain widespread.
