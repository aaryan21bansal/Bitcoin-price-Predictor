"A second data breach by the Ministry of Defence, potentially compromising the safety of Afghans who may be eligible to relocate to the UK, has been uncovered by the BBC. Dozens of people were mistakenly copied in to an email earlier this month, with their email addresses visible to all recipients. It is the second such breach to come to light. An investigation is under way. The MoD has apologised and said extra support was being offered to them. In the latest data breach to be uncovered, defence officials sent an email that had the email addresses and some names of 55 people which could be seen by everyone who was sent the message. The recipients - at least one of whom is from the Afghan National Army - were told UK relocation officials had been unable to contact them and they were asked to update their details. An MoD spokeswoman said: ""We have been made aware of a data breach that occurred earlier this month by the Afghan Relocation and Assistance Policy (Arap) team. ""This week, the defence secretary instigated an investigation into data handling within that team. ""Steps have now been taken to ensure this does not happen in the future."" Defence secretary angered over Afghan data breach MoD shared 250 Afghan interpreters' details on email It comes just a day after the defence secretary apologised for a separate breach involving the email addresses of dozens of Afghan interpreters who worked for British forces. Speaking in the House of Commons on Tuesday, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said it had been ""an unacceptable level of service"" that had let down thousands of members of the armed forces and veterans. More than 250 people seeking relocation to the UK - many of whom are in hiding - were mistakenly copied into the email. Their email addresses could be seen by all recipients, showing people's names and some associated profile pictures. Mr Wallace said an investigation had been launched and one official suspended. Defence sources told the BBC that Mr Wallace did not know about this second breach when he spoke in the Commons on Tuesday. Former Conservative defence minister Johnny Mercer, who served in Afghanistan, said he feared there may be more to come. ""I've been concerned from the start as to how these individuals have been treated - the whole thing was such a rush to the door when Kabul fell that these mistakes were inevitable,"" he said. ""I personally think we've taken out people we really shouldn't have, and failed to bring out the majority of those we should - I think we are only beginning to learn the scale of what has gone on here."" On Tuesday, Labour shadow defence secretary John Healey welcomed the defence secretary's apology but told the Commons that action now mattered most. Additional reporting by Marie Jackson.

"A user-built Nazi concentration camp in Minecraft Extremists are using mainstream video games and gaming chat platforms to spread hate, BBC Click has found. Over three months, researchers found anti-Semitism, racism and homophobia on platforms, including DLive and Odysee, where users stream and chat about games such as Call of Duty and Minecraft. Campaigners say including extremist narratives among everyday conversations can be a pathway to radicalisation. These conversations then move to spaces such as private Telegram channels. ""Once you're in that world, then the radicalisation starts to happen,"" Joe Mulhall, of anti-fascist organisation Hope Not Hate, said. ""That's when you start to go to other meetings, to smaller groups that aren't necessarily playing games, talking about politics more explicitly."" In response, Telegram told BBC News it used a ""combination of proactive monitoring of public spaces and user reports"" to remove content breaching its terms of service. DLive and Odysee have not responded to BBC News's requests for comment. Their policies cite zero tolerance against hate and violent extremism and both say they are proactive at removing any content violating guidelines. Extreme view were slipped into chats on DLive and Odysee Call of Duty said: ""The actions we have taken to confront racist behaviour include banning players for racist and hate-oriented names, implementing new technology and making it easier for players to report offensive in-game behaviour."" But the researchers also found extremist ""roleplay"" scenarios within games on various platforms that let players create and share their own custom maps and environments. These included Nazi concentration camps and a Uyghur detainment camp in games such as Roblox and Minecraft. One Roblox driving game invited players to ""become a racist"" and simulate the murder of people belonging to ethnic minorities by running them over in a car. A user-generated game in Roblox let players run over non-white characters ""These are small and not played by a huge amount of people but what they do is allow extremists to create role-playing experiences... to live out radicalised fantasies online,"" Jacob Davey, from the Institute of Strategic Dialogue, said. Roblox said: ""We work relentlessly to ensure our platform remains a safe and civil space, and with a combination of machine learning and a team of over 2,000 moderators, we monitor for safety 24-7 to detect and swiftly act on any inappropriate content or behaviour."" Minecraft said: ""Terrorist or violent extremist content is strictly forbidden by our community standards and we take action to remove such content if it appears on our systems."" But extremists may have turned to gaming spaces after the social-media giants increased enforcement of their rules, according to the researchers. Mr Davey said: ""The extreme right-wing have potentially found safe harbours to broadcast their ideology or to engage in more traditional propagandising - the sorts of things that they would have done a few years ago on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. ""Online gaming basically forms a means for people to connect over a shared hobby online, and this includes extremists. ""It's a way for them to connect with like-minded individuals, to socialise and ultimately form firmer social bonds, which can be really important in terms of advancing and furthering extremist movements globally."" Mr Mulhall said: ""You sit at home after school and play games, so the gaming element can create a sense that it's normal, not extremist, not dangerous."" The Royal United Services Institute is part of a team of counter-extremism experts launching a large-scale investigation into online gaming. The defence think tank' s Dr Jessica White said: ""The online and chat space where moderation tends to be poor is being increasingly encroached upon by extremists but we need to get widespread evidence of its scale."" The government is also in talks with industry bodies to discuss steps to tackle the exploitation of gaming spaces by extremists. A representative of Ukie, the UK's gaming trade body, said:  ""We use sophisticated AI [artificial-intelligence] moderation tools and trained community managers to build safe spaces. ""We also work closely with government and law enforcement to further protect players. ""We know the challenges we face are shared by other forms of digital entertainment and we continue to adopt a positive and proactive approach to protecting players.""

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: It's time for humanity to grow up A climate summit of world leaders in 40 days' time will be the ""turning point for humanity"", PM Boris Johnson has said in a speech to the United Nations. He warned that global temperature rises were already inevitable, but called on his fellow leaders to commit to major changes to curb further warming. Four areas needed tackling - ""coal, cars, cash and trees"", he said. Countries must take responsibility for ""the destruction we are inflicting, not just upon our planet but ourselves"". ""It's time for humanity to grow up,"" he added ahead of the UK hosting the COP26 summit in Glasgow. The prime minister also said it was time to listen to the warnings of scientists. ""Look at Covid if you want an example of gloomy scientists being proved right."" Boris Johnson at the UN fact-checked What do world leaders need to agree to stop climate change? World on course to heat up to dangerous levels Setting the tone for November's meeting, he said countries must make ""substantial changes"" by the end of the decade if the world is to stave off further temperature rises. ""I passionately believe that we can do it by making commitments in four areas - coal, cars, cash and trees,"" he said. Mr Johnson praised China's President Xi Jinping for hisrecent pledgeto stop building new coal-fire energy plants abroad. But he called on the country - which produces 28% of global greenhouse gas emissions - to go further and end its domestic use of coal, saying the UK was proof that it could be done. The UK used coal to generate 25% of its electricity five years ago - but that is now down to 2%. Mr Johnson said it would be ""gone altogether"" by 2024. But Labour's shadow energy secretary Ed Miliband accused the UK government of ""facing both ways"" on climate change, urging other nations to take action while it considered plans for a new coal mine in Cumbria and cut money for improving home insulation. He told BBC Radio 4's World at One that a UK trade deal had also allowed Australia to renege on their climate commitments. ""It undermines our moral standing as the host. I want the prime minister to succeed, but I'm afraid he's left it very late and he's not handled this presidency well,"" he said. In his speech, the prime minister also said he did not see a conflict between the green movement and capitalism, saying: ""The whole experience of the Covid pandemic is that the way to fix the problem is through science and innovation, the breakthroughs and the investment that are made possible by capitalism and by free markets."" ""We have the tools for a green industrial revolution but time is desperately short,"" he added. Elsewhere, the prime minister made a series of calls for action to his fellow leaders, including: to allow only zero-emission vehicles to be on sale across the world by 2040 for every country to cut carbon emissions by 68% by 2030, compared to levels in 1990 to pledge collectively to achieve carbon neutrality - ornet zero- by the middle of the century to end the use of coal power in the developing world by 2040 and in the developed world by 2030 to halt and reverse the loss of trees and biodiversity by 2030. Amid the serious warnings, Mr Johnson also attempted to strike a humorous note at points, including saying Kermit the Frog had been wrong when he sang It's Not Easy Bein' Green. The prime minister reiterated that the world must curb the rise in global average temperatures to 1.5C - the stricter of the two targets set by the UN in the 2015 Paris agreement. However, the world is already 1C hotter compared with pre-industrial levels. ""If we keep on the current track then the temperatures will go up by 2.7 degrees or more by the end of the century,"" Mr Johnson said. ""And never mind what that will do to the ice floes... we will see desertification, drought, crop failure, and mass movements of humanity on a scale not seen before, not because of some unforeseen natural event or disaster but because of us, because of what we are doing now. ""And our grandchildren will know that we are the culprits and... that we were warned and they will know that it was this generation that came centre stage to speak and act on behalf of posterity and that we missed our cue and they will ask themselves what kind of people we were to be so selfish and so short sighted."" Boris Johnson is fashioning himself as a leader on climate change. He has set a benchmark by phasing out sales of most new conventional vehicles by 2030. The international alliance he's formed to get rid of coal power is gathering support - though not yet enough. And by setting aggressive targets to cut carbon emissions overall (78% by 2035) he is encouraging others to follow. Yet, in his own backyard, the prime minister is stumbling. He previously pledged ""never to be lagging on lagging"". But his plan for insulating homes is badly delayed - along with other vital initiatives on issues including aviation, farming and financing the low carbon revolution. Recent research showed his government had imposedless than a quarter of the policies neededto clean up the economy. And some policies - likenot opposing a coal mine in Cumbria,cutting taxes on flyingandbuilding HS2- will send emissions up when they are supposed to be going down. At COP26, leaders from 196 countries will be asked to agree action to limit climate change and its effects, like rising sea levels and extreme weather. A recent report from UN scientists warned that global temperatures have risen faster since 1970 than at any point in the past 2,000 years.

"Avro Energy and Green have collapsed, becoming the latest firms to be brought down by the sharp rise in gas prices. Combined with other recent failures, it means 1.5 million people are now facing a switch to a new, more expensive firm. All affected customers will continue to receive energy while a new supplier is appointed by regulator Ofgem. Its price cap limits how much firms can charge. Ofgem's boss earlier warned the rise in gas prices was ""unprecedented"" and meant more firms would go bust, Avro Energy, the biggest supplier to exit the market so far, has 580,000 customers, while Green has 250,000. Green, which employs 180 people, blamed ""unprecedented market conditions and regulatory failings"" for its collapse. Since the sharp rise in wholesale gas prices - which firms complain they are unable to pass on to customers because of the price cap on energy bills - a number of small companies have collapsed. They include People's Energy, Utility Point, PfP Energy and MoneyPlus Energy. Together, the recently failed companies account for more than 5% of the market, about 1.5 million customers. Meanwhile Bulb, the UK's sixth largest energy company with 1.7 million customers, is seeking financing. And another firm, Igloo, has said it is working with restructuring consultants Alvarez & Marsal. But Igloo told the BBC it had not appointed administrators. If an energy firm collapses, customers are automatically switched to a tariff provided by the new supplier. This is a payment plan agreed with the regulator Ofgem, but it may well be more expensive than the deal they had with the former company which went bust. Customers are advised to not try and switch to a new supplier until they are contacted by whoever Ofgem appoints to take over their account. Ofgem boss Jonathan Brearley, warned earlier more customers would be affected. ""We've already seen hundreds of thousands of customers affected, that may well go well above that. It's very hard for me to put a figure on it."" Appearing before the cross-party Business Committee on Wednesday, he declined to say if the number of customers that would eventually need new suppliers could run into ""millions"". Is the UK headed for a gas shortage this winter? Why are gas prices rising and what if my supplier goes bust? Gas prices: 'I'm just watching the meter go up' Mr Brearley insisted that Ofgem had plans in place to cope as the crisis developed. He told MPs that Ofgem ""war-gamed"" various scenarios. A six-fold rise in wholesale gas prices since last year meant if was likely more firms would go under, Mr Brearley said, although he said commercial talks with the firms prevented him from speculating how many. ""It's not unusual for suppliers to go out of the market,"" he said. ""I think what is different this time is that dramatic change in the costs that those suppliers are facing. ""We do expect more (suppliers) not to be able to face the circumstances we're in, but it's genuinely hard to say more than that, partly because that means predicting what may happen to the gas price."" Hundreds of thousands of savvy switchers who followed advice to shop around for a cheap energy deal will be left frustrated at the demise of suppliers of many of the most competitive tariffs. As they are automatically shifted from a bust supplier to a surviving one, they will need to put that tendency to keep switching to one side. Citizens Advice, the official consumer advocate for energy, says it is best to do nothing while that transfer is made. Any credit they have built up will be honoured. While the continuation of their energy supply is guaranteed, their old contract is not. They, and anyone else whose fixed rate is coming to an end, will find they are potentially paying hundreds of pounds more per year for their energy - although the damage is limited by Ofgem's price cap. The problem is, if they look around for anything better, right now they are likely to draw a blank. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation charity has warned that millions of low-income households will face a squeeze on their finances from October, when energy companies will be allowed to lift the maximum amount they charge for gas and electricity by as much as 12%. And from next month, Universal Credit claimants face losing Â£20 a week. Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng admitted the cut to Universal Credit could make it ""a very difficult winter"" for low-income families, and said he was speaking to Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey ""a great deal"" on the subject. Customers will still continue to receive gas or electricity even if the energy supplier goes bust. Ofgem will move your account to a new supplier, but it may take a few weeks. Your new supplier should then contact you to explain what is happening with your account While you wait to hear from your new supplier: check your current balance and - if possible - download any bills; take a photo of your meter reading If you pay by direct debit, there is no need to cancel it straight away, Citizens Advice says. Wait until your new account is set up before you cancel it If you are in credit, your money is protected and you'll be paid back. If you were in debt to the old supplier, you'll still have to pay the money back to your new supplier instead Read more about the next best steps to take here. Emma Pinchbeck said the gas crisis had exposed the need for market reforms The head of trade body Energy UK Emma Pinchbeck said earlier that the sector had been fragile for a couple of years and the current gas crisis had exposed fault-lines in the market. She said: ""There's a short-term crisis here, which is in some ways out of our control - it's to do with the gas prices - but it's been exacerbated and arguably caused by our regulatory design."" Wholesale gas prices have spiked as economies reopened from Covid-19 lockdowns and high demand for liquefied natural gas in Asia pushed down supplies to Europe. The surge in demand has sent shockwaves through industries reliant on natural gas. On Tuesday, the governmentagreed to pay out tens of millions of poundsto US fertiliser firm CF Industries to restart carbon dioxide production. Its shutdown, due to high energy costs, had sparked concerns over food shortages. Carbon dioxide, a by-product of fertiliser manufacturing, is used to stun animals, in fizzy drinks, and in food packaging. In the energy market, small providers that had launched in recent years had been hit by the jump in costs even before the recent spike.

"Ofgem acknowledged that ""this is a worrying time for many people"" Nearly 1.5 million customers have been hit in just two weeks by energy firms collapsing under soaring gas prices. Avro Energy and Green ceased trading on Wednesday and their 830,000 combined customers face being switched to a new, potentially more expensive, provider. Green's boss, Peter McGirr, told the BBC he had done nothing wrong and said bigger firms would soon face problems. However, the government has cooled on the idea of loans to the industry, says BBC business editor Simon Jack. Mr McGirr predicted: ""You will see larger suppliers feeling the pain as well and they will come cap in hand for a bailout."" He criticised the government for supportingUS fertiliser firm CF Industries to restart its fertiliser factory, which produced carbon dioxide used in the food industry as a by-product, while allowing energy firms to fail. Its closure had raised fears over food supplies and the nuclear industry. ""Why do they need a bailout and we don't?"" he asked. He apologised to staff and customers, but said: ""I don't think we did anything wrong as a supplier."" Small business minister Paul Scully told the BBC that the government had not treated CF Industries and Green in the same way because there were ""different solutions to different problems"". He said there was ""a mature system"" in place to deal with the collapse of energy firms, ""protecting customers both in continuity of supply and prices"". This video can not be played Ros Atkins on... the UK's rising energy bills Mr McGirr's comments came amid signs of a change of direction in government policy on the energy crisis. The BBC's Simon Jack says that while the government had been talking of state-backed loans for larger energy firms, that idea is now ""very much on the back burner"" and its intention is to ""tough this one out"". The BBC has been told that ministers believe the current system for managing the failure of energy companies, which allows companies to recoup losses through an industry-wide levy, is working satisfactorily, even though it will add costs to millions of customers' bills. Our business editor says ministers do accept that the existing system of reallocating customers would not work if one of the bigger challenger firms went bust. In that case, the government has the power to appoint a special administrator, in what would be a quasi-temporary nationalisation. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng is having daily calls with the chief executive of Ofgem to monitor which firm might be next, a government spokesperson said. Where does the UK get its gas and is it facing a shortage this winter? What is the energy price cap and what if my supplier goes bust? Gas prices: 'I'm just watching the meter go up' It is not yet clear which supplier will take on the 580,000 customers from Avro Energy, the biggest firm to fail so far. Regulator Ofgem has also not yet appointed a new provider for Green customers either. All affected customers will still receive energy while a new supplier is appointed by Ofgem. Neil Lawrence, director of retail at Ofgem, said its ""number one priority is to protect customers"". The regulator's price cap, which covers 15 million households across England, Wales and Scotland, protects customers on some tariffs by limiting how much firms can charge per unit of gas. But providers have complained that they are unable to pass on rising costs to customers because of the cap on energy bills. The plight of Avro customers is a good illustration of what may befall hundreds of thousands of people in the coming weeks. An Avro customer in a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity, who got a fixed rate deal in August, would have been paying Â£1,087 a year, according to price comparison site Uswitch. In March, they could have got a deal costing Â£920 a year. Now Avro has collapsed, they are likely to be paying Â£1,277 a year at their new supplier from 1 October, in line with Ofgem's price cap. The price cap does not mean it is impossible to pay more than Â£1,277 a year. It is a cap on the price, not the final bill. That figure is an illustration of the cap's effect on a gas and electricity customer's annual bill, assuming they have an average level of energy consumption. So, a household with heavy energy use will have a higher annual bill. Price comparison site Uswitch has acknowledged there is currently no point in energy customers shopping around. Justina Miltienyte, the site's energy policy expert, said: ""Rising wholesale costs are putting a big strain on suppliers, which has had a knock-on effect on the value of the deals available in the market. ""What we're able to offer is constantly changing and will vary by customer. ""If you are coming to the end of your fixed deal, our advice is to hold tight, stay put and be rolled over on to your supplier's standard variable rate. Your supplier may try to offer you a new fixed deal, but this is unlikely to be the best option right now. ""However, people can leave their contact details so we could contact them once the situation improves. They can still head to Uswitch.com to compare deals across the whole of the energy market."" Sara Pilgrim was originally an Npower customer but has changed supplier twice since then One Green customer, 52-year-old Sara Pilgrim of North Lincolnshire, switched to the firm just a week ago. ""My contract switched on the 16 September. I went from E.On. I was with Npower, who transferred to E.On,"" she told the BBC. ""When my contract was due to renew a couple of weeks ago, E.On had really hiked their prices up. ""I went around and looked at different companies. Green weren't the lowest, but I decided to go with them. ""How can they have been allowed to take on new contracts that close to them going bust? They must have known something was going on six days ago. ""I'm just angry really that they've been allowed to do that. You know if you have to cease trading. That's my gripe really, that they've been allowed to take on new contracts so close to them ceasing trading."" Since wholesale gas prices have started to spike, a number of firms have collapsed. People's Energy, Utility Point, PfP Energy and MoneyPlus Energy ceased trading in September. These smaller companies, including Avro Energy and Green Supplier Limited, account for more than 5% of the UK energy market - about 1.5 million customers. Customers will still continue to receive gas or electricity even if the energy supplier goes bust. Ofgem will move your account to a new supplier, but it may take a few weeks. Your new supplier should then contact you to explain what is happening with your account While you wait to hear from your new supplier: check your current balance and - if possible - download any bills; take a photo of your meter reading If you pay by direct debit, there is no need to cancel it straight away, Citizens Advice says.

Other small companies could fold in the coming days and weeks. Igloo, for example, has said it is working with restructuring consultants Alvarez & Marsal, although it told the BBC it had not appointed administrators. Bulb, the UK's sixth largest energy company with 1.7 million customers, is also seeking additional financing. Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice, told the BBC there had been a big increase in people seeking their help. ""We're seeing people come to us because they're seeing family finances being really squeezed,"" she added. Smaller providers launched in recent years have been overwhelmed by a spike in the cost of wholesale gas prices as economies have reopened from lockdowns and high demand from Asia pushed down supplies to Europe. Gas prices are rising all across Europe, but Britain has also been affected by lower winds than usual - denting renewable energy supplies - as well asa recent fire at a National Grid sitein Kent. In the UK, firms had already been hit by a jump in costs even before the recent spike. From more than 70 suppliers in 2018, there are just over 30 now. Industry sources fear there may be as few as 10 suppliers left by the end of the year. What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust?

"Gas and electricity bills are going up again on 1 January, when the latest energy price cap takes effect. Customers are encouraged to submit a meter reading to ensure they are charged the correct amount. The energy price cap covers 26 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and is setevery three months,externalby the energy regulator Ofgem. It fixes the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of energy on a standard - or default - tariff for a typical dual-fuel household which pays by direct debit. Between 1 January and 31 March 2025,gas prices will be capped at 6.34p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 24.86 per kWh.,external This means the annual bill for a dual-fuel direct debit household using a typical amount of energywill go up to Â£1,738 per year, an increase of Â£21 from the previous cap. Those who pay their bills every three months by cash or cheque will pay Â£1,851. Analysts at forecaster Cornwall Insight, which tracks the energy market, expect prices to fall slightly in April and October 2025, but says thathigh domestic energy prices are likely to be ""the new normal"". The cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market. Your energy bill depends on the overall amount of gas and electricity you use, and how you pay for it. The type of property you live in, how energy efficient it is, how many people live there and the weather all make a difference. The Ofgem cap is based on a ""typical household"" using 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year with a single bill for gas and electricity, settled by direct debit. The vast majority of people pay their bill this way to help spread payments across the year. Those who pay every three months by cash or cheque are charged more. Energy prices could vary at different times of day Submitting a meter reading when the cap changes means you will not be charged for estimated usage at the wrong rate. This is especially important when prices go up. Customers withworking smart metersdo not need to submit a reading as their bill is calculated automatically. Fixed-priced deals offer certainty for a set period - often a year, or longer - but if prices drop, you could be stuck at a higher price. Ofgem says customers who want the security of a set price should consider fixed deals. However, it recommends getting independent advice. The price comparison site Uswitch says it is important to check whether fixed deals have exit fees before signing up and to make sure you fully understand the terms of the contract. Because the price cap changes every three months, it is difficult to know with any certainty whether a fixed tariff is a good deal. The longer the fixed term, the greater the uncertainty. Between January and March, households on prepayment meters will pay slightly less than those on direct debit, with a typical bill of Â£1,690, a rise of Â£21 from the previous quarter. About four million households had prepayment meters in April 2024, according to Ofgem. Many have been in place for years, but some were installed more recently after customers struggled to pay higher bills. Rulesintroduced in November 2023,externalmean suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts before switching them to a meter. They cannot be installed at all in certain households. Energy firms pay out over force-fitting of meters Standing charges are a fixed daily fee to cover the costs of connecting to a supply. They are typically 61p a day for electricity and 32p a day for gas, although they vary slightly by region. Under the energy price cap, they have risen by 43% since 2019. Campaigners argue standing charges are unfair because they make up a larger proportion of the bill of low energy users. Ofgem has proposed thatenergy firms must provide a choice of price-capped tariffsfrom winter 2025, one which has a standing charge and unit rate - as is the case now - and another with no standing charge but a higher unit rate. Customers would be able to choose which suits them best. Separately, it wants a consistent approach from suppliers on how to deal with unpaid bills totalling Â£3.8bn. Changes to the winter fuel payment mean more than 10 million pensioners are not receiving the money this winter. Previously, it was paid to all pensioners in England and Wales born before 25 September 1957. However, in July, the government said future payments would be made only to those on low incomes who receivedcertain benefits, including pension credit. The 2024 payment - worth Â£200 or Â£300 depending on individual circumstances - is paid automatically to eligible pensioners. However, hundreds of thousands of people who are entitled to pension credit do not claim it, which means they will miss out on the winter fuel payment too. How much is the winter fuel payment and who can still get it? TheÂ£500m Household Support Fund,,externalwhich was introduced in September 2021 to help vulnerable customershas been extended until March 2025. TheWarm Home Discount scheme,externalcontinues to offer a discount to eligible pensioners and low income households. The government'sFuel Direct Scheme,externalcan help people to repay an energy debt directly from their benefit payments. In addition, suppliers must offer customers affordable payment plans or repayment holidays if they are struggling with bills. Most suppliers also offer hardship grants.

"The cost of protecting customers from failing energy providers could lead to higher bills, the boss of the energy regulator Ofgem has told the BBC. It comes as energy firm Green said it was on the brink of collapse due to soaring wholesale gas prices. ""As underlying costs rise, pressure on bills does go up"", Jonathan Brearley, Ofgem chief executive said. The government has said it is looking at lending money to bigger firms to help them take on stranded customers. If an energy firm collapses, customers are automatically switched to a tariff provided by the new supplier. This is a tariff agreed with the regulator Ofgem, but it may well be more expensive than the deal they had with the former company which went bust. Mr Brearley said protecting customers of failed energy firms was the regulator's ""number one priority"". However, he said it was too early to predict how expensive it would be to ensure that they were transferred to other suppliers in an orderly way. Peter McGirr, founder and chief executive of Green, told the BBC it had appointed a restructuring firm in an attempt to survive the current crisis. Mr McGirr said the firm was in ""deep, deep trouble and our heads are unlikely to bob back to the surface"". Is the UK headed for a gas shortage this winter? What happens if my energy supplier goes bust? Why are gas prices rising? Green has 180 staff based in Newcastle upon Tyne and has 250,000 UK customers. Mr McGirr said the appointment of Alvarez and Marsal was currently on an ""advisory and restructuring"" basis, but admitted Green could fall into administration within weeks. ""We need to try to hold on long enough to get some support"", he added. The company has been in discussions with the government and energy regulator Ofgem, but has not been offered any support. Mr McGirr said he believed the larger energy suppliers had too much influence in the crisis talks being held with government and said the big companies had an interest in more of the smaller suppliers going to the wall. Asked whether these costs would be met by the taxpayer, or spread across all energy customers' bills, he said: ""We have to first of all make sure that customers are transferred and looked after and then as we see the market evolve we will understand better the cost implications."" Customers on some tariffs are protected from sudden hikes in wholesale gas prices through the energy price cap, which limits how much firms can charge per unit of gas. The price cap covers 15 million households across England, Wales and Scotland. Mr Brearley said it was too early to predict how much the energy price cap would rise next year. So far, four energy firms have gone to the wall, including People's Energy and Utility Point, and four more are expected to follow in the coming days. Industry sources fear there may be as few as 10 energy suppliers left by the end of the year, down from 70 in January. But Mr Brearley predicted that a number of small suppliers would survive the current crisis, as well as larger ones, maintaining a diverse market with plenty of choice for consumers. When asked if Ofgem was ""asleep at the wheel"" and should have prevented suppliers from making promises to customers which they wouldn't be able to keep if prices rose, Mr Brearley replied: ""No - we have always protected customers interests and we work very closely with the companies. ""We work closely with all companies to assess their financial position. And if they need to exit the market we have well-rehearsed systems and processes to manage that."" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng earlier denied that failed energy companies would get government bailouts, saying: ""I do not think it's the right thing for taxpayers' money to be injected into companies that have been badly run."" However, he said the government was exploring the possibility of lending money to bigger energy firms to help them absorb the cost of taking on new customers from companies that had gone bust. ""If we do have this policy, they will be expected to pay back the loans,"" he added. Mr Kwarteng alsowarned many UK households could face a ""very difficult winter"",with fuel prices surging and the Â£20-a-week temporary uplift in universal credit due to end in October. How could the CO2 shortage hit food supplies? Farmers fear gas price crisis may spark pig cull The government and Ofgem have both dismissed suggestions that the cap on energy prices would be lifted ahead of an agreed 12% rise in October, saying that keeping it was the ""clear and agreed position"". The price cap is reviewed twice a year. It applies only to standard variable or default tariffs. These types of tariff are typically the most expensive plan that a supplier offers. When fixed energy deals expire, as they generally do after one or two years, customers are likely to be put on these tariffs. Customers will still continue to receive gas or electricity even if the energy supplier goes bust. Ofgem will move your account to a new supplier, but it may take a few weeks. Your new supplier should then contact you to explain what is happening with your account While you wait to hear from your new supplier: check your current balance and - if possible - download any bills; take a photo of your meter reading If you pay by direct debit, there is no need to cancel it straight away, Citizens Advice says. Wait until your new account is set up before you cancel it If you are in credit, your money is protected and you'll be paid back. If you were in debt to the old supplier, you'll still have to pay the money back to your new supplier instead Read more about the next best steps to take here. Mr Brearley said the industry had seen ""an unprecedented rise in gas prices"". ""They are almost four times what they normally are and that would put any industry under strain,"" he added. The government and Ofgem say the UK does not have gas supply problems because of a diverse range of sources ""that can more than meet demand"". However, energy bills are facing particular pressures in Great Britain because of a dip in renewable energy supplies due to low wind, as well as the outage of a power cable supplying electricity from France. The International Energy Agency has called on Russia to supply more gas to Europe, saying ""it could do more to increase gas availability to Europe and ensure storage is filled to adequate levels"", in preparation for the winter. It added: ""Based on the available information, Russia is fulfilling its long-term contracts with European counterparts - but its exports to Europe are down from their 2019 level. ""This is also an opportunity for Russia to underscore its credentials as a reliable supplier to the European market."" Stacey Stothard is waiting to see how much more she will have to pay Stacey Stothard followed all the advice. Aware that energy prices were rising, she shopped around to find a decent fixed deal for her gas and electricity. She saved Â£300 - or so she thought. Her new energy supplier went bust and now she will be switched automatically to another one, and she is facing much higher bills, potentially amounting to hundreds of pounds more a year. ""It is just like watching the meter go up and up,"" she says. ""I did the right thing - not going for the cheapest deal, but choosing a company with a decent customer service record.""

"The US is to donate 500 million more doses of the Pfizer vaccine to developing nations from next year. President Joe Biden made the pledge at a virtual Covid-19 summit on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, promising an ""arsenal of vaccines"". The additional jabs will see the total US commitment on vaccine sharing exceed one billion jabs. Experts say some 11 billion doses are required to vaccinate at least 70% of the global population. The World Health Organisation has set a minimum target of 40% vaccine coverage in every country by the end of 2021. But the goal is unlikely to be met. While many high-income countries have now given at least one shot to more than half their populations, only 2% of people in low-income countries have had their first dose, according to data from the University of Oxford. Covid vaccine tracker: How's my country doing? Could 241m vaccine doses go to waste? Analysis by Stephanie Hegarty, BBC population correspondent It's a big pledge but it'll be met with a fair share of scepticism from countries still waiting to vaccinate even 2% of their population. The US had already pledged 580m doses but delivered only 160m of those so far. So what's different now? Well, global production has picked up in the past few months and there are doses available. Rich countries could have 1.2bn spare doses by the end of the year, even if they run booster campaigns, according to science analytics firm Airfinity. 241m of those could go to waste if they're not donated. But these need to be sent very soon. Covax, the WHO-backed scheme to help distribute vaccines fairly, has told the BBC that too many of the donations it's receiving have come in small quantities, at the last minute and with little time left before they expire. That makes their job of getting them to where they are needed very hard. If Biden want to meet this ambitious goal of vaccinating the world by this time next year, that will have to change. The White House's Covid summit comes as research shows rich countries are still holding surpluses of vaccines, many of which could soon be thrown out. In June, members of the G7 - Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US - pledged to donate one billion doses to poor countries over the next year. President Biden pledged 580m at the time, of which the US has delivered only 160m so far. The donated vaccines are routed through Covax, the global scheme supported by the WHO to get doses where they're needed most. Covax purchases and then sells vaccines at low-cost to middle income countries and donates to poor countries. In the US - where more than 76% of adults have received at least one dose - criticism that the country is doing too little to help the rest of the world has grown. On Friday, a panel advising the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended booster shots - third doses - of the Pfizer vaccine for people 65 and over. The WHO has previously called on wealthier nations to hold off on providing boosters until vaccination rates go up in lesser developed countries. Last week, in a letter to Mr Biden, eight lawmakers of his own party wrote: ""Clearly, there is an inequitable distribution of Covid-19 vaccine doses, and it is getting worse.""

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says there's ""every chance"" of a UK-US trade deal â just not ""right now"" The United States is lifting its decades-old ban on imports of British lamb, Boris Johnson has announced. The PM, who is in the US for talks with UN leaders and President Joe Biden, said the ban was ""unjustified"". But he admitted the UK was now focused on making ""incremental steps"" on US trade access, rather than aiming for a full agreement. Mr Biden appeared to play down the chances of a wider deal during a meeting with Mr Johnson on Tuesday. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Mr Johnson said the Biden administration ""is not doing free trade deals around the world right now"". But he added he had ""every confidence that a great deal is there to be done"". Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner mocked the lack of movement, saying the PM had made ""absolutely zero progress"" on a trade deal during his US trip. UK beef served up in the US after a 20-year ban BBC specialists on the prospects for UK-US trade Biden plays down chances of UK-US trade deal The United States has banned British lamb imports since 1989, following the first outbreaks of BSE, commonly known as mad cow disease. A similar ban on British beef imports, imposed in 1996, waslifted in September last year. There is no indication yet of when the US will start accepting lamb and lamb products from the UK, and an official announcement has not been made. The US Department for Agriculture has been consulting on lifting the ban since 2016 - and there were originally hopes it would be lifted the following year. At the time, the UK government estimated the change would be worth an extra Â£35m a year to the UK economy. Analysis by Damian Grammaticas , BBC political correspondent When it comes to trade, the big deal that's emerged from Boris Johnson's visit to Washington is that there's to be no deal happening any time soon. That's significant, and a setback for Boris Johnson's government. In March 2020, just a few weeks after the UK had left the EU, the then-Trade Secretary Liz Truss said the day marked a ""crucial step in beginning the formal negotiations for a free-trade agreement with our largest bilateral trading partner, the United States."" Today it all looks different. The United States, Boris Johnson told us, is not doing deals. So whilst Ms Truss predicted a ""Â£3.4 billion lift to the economy"" from a US-UK deal, today we had an ""incremental step"" but a tiny one by comparison - a possible opening for lamb exports. A US deal was by far the biggest prize when it came to the promise of post-Brexit trade deals. But under this US administration, it's not happening any time soon. Mr Johnson said the ban was ""totally unjustified"" and ""discriminating on British farmers and British lamb"". The National Sheep Association industry group welcomed the news, adding it had always seen the US as a ""potentially important market"". Its chief executive Phil Stocker cautioned, however, that ""we shouldn't expect to see any sudden surge in volumes going to the US"". He added that Brexit had made it more difficult to sell into the EU - the UK's lamb largest export market - and it was ""important to work on any market that gives us future potential"". Boris Johnson and Joe Biden held face-to-face talks in the White House on Tuesday Mr Johnson cited the lifting of the ban as an example of ""practical steps to help our exports"" the UK was taking, pending progress on wider trade talks. Downing Street has pointed to the resolution of the Airbus-Boeing trade dispute, as well as thelowering of whisky tariffsand the decision to lift the ban on British beef. Securing a trade deal with the United States has been a priority for many Brexit-backing politicians, following the UK's departure from the EU. But on Tuesday, Mr Biden appeared to downplay the chances of an agreement soon, adding he would discuss the issue ""a little bit"" with Mr Johnson during his trip to the White House. ""We're going to have to work that through,"" the US president added. The US is already a significant UK trading partner, accounting for Â£1 in every Â£6 of British trade. The BBC understands the government is considering whether to join an existing trade arrangement between the US, Canada and Mexico - known as the USMCA. However, Downing Street denies this and says it focus remains on a UK-US trade deal. If a USMCA arrangement was pursued, it would limit the UK's ability to sell services. Economists say the overall gains from joining it could be less than 0.1% of the UK's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - a measurement of the size of the economy.

"Food industry bodies have warned of panic-buying this Christmas unless action is taken to address labour shortages. The National Farmers' Union (NFU) called for an emergency visa to allow firms to recruit from outside the UK. UK farmers, hauliers and shops have been struggling with shortages that have been made worse by Covid and Brexit. The government said that the UK has a ""highly resilient food supply chain"". The head of the NFU, Minette Batters, wrote to Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday warning that the food and farming sector is on a ""knife edge"" due to a shortage of workers across the entire supply chain. The letter, signed on behalf of a number of food and drink trade bodies, urged the government to introduce a Covid-19 recovery visa to open up new recruitment opportunities as a matter of urgency. ""Without it, more shelves will go empty and consumers will panic buy to try to get through the winter,"" Ms Batters wrote. ""That is why we must have an urgent commitment from you to enable the industry to recruit from outside the UK over the next 12 months to get us through the winter and to help us save Christmas."" How do I find a new job and who is hiring? How serious is the shortage of lorry drivers? UK worker shortage: Farmers give fruit and veg away for free She said it is ""a travesty that this is happening in parallel with UK food producers disposing of perfectly edible food as it either cannot be picked, packed, processed or transported to the end customer"". ""Every day there are new examples of food waste across the industry, from chicken to pork, fruit and vegetables, dairy and many other products. The food is there, but it needs people to get it to the consumers,"" Ms Batters said. The letter was signed on behalf of other groups such as the British Frozen Food Federation, the British Meat Processors Association, Dairy UK and the Food and Drink Federation. There wasa report in The Grocer,externalthat Tesco, the UK's largest supermarket chain, had warned the government that panic-buying this Christmas could be worse than during lockdown. However, Tesco later said: ""We have good availability, with deliveries arriving at our stores and distribution centres across the UK every day. ""While the industry-wide shortage of HGV drivers has led to some distribution challenges, we're working hard to address these and to plan for the months ahead, so that customers can get everything they need."" This video can not be played The prime minister says he does ânot believe people will be short of foodâ amid reports of some empty supermarket shelves. Some farmershave resorted to giving fruit and vegetables awayrather than let it rot in their fields. The NFU has said that only 11% of seasonal workers in the 2020 season were UK residents. Robert Newbery from NFU East Midlands said earlier this month: ""Brexit is certainly having an impact. The people that could move freely within Europe before now can't."" In response to the NFU's call for support, the government increased the number of visas available under the Seasonal Worker Pilot (SWP) from 10,000 in 2020 to 30,000 this year. There are also labour shortages in meat production, with a shortfall of abattoir workers and butchers. The Association of Independent Meat Suppliers told the BBC in August the industry had about 14,000 job vacancies. It said Covid, the UK's exit from the European Union (EU) and perceptions over career paths had caused a looming ""recruitment crisis"". Hauliers and food firms have also been warning of a chronic shortage of lorry drivers, which they also ascribe to the pandemic and Brexit. A government spokesperson said that the UK's supply chain is ""highly resilient"" and has coped well when faced with recent pressures. They pointed out that the government earlier this year expanded its Seasonal Workers Pilot to 30,000 visas for workers to come to the UK for up to six months. ""We continue to work closely with industry to understand labour demand and supply, including both permanent and seasonal workforce requirements,"" they said. Separately, the government has said it has taken action to prevent supermarket shortages with a deal to restart production at CF Industries, the UK's biggest producer of carbon dioxide. Why is there a CO2 shortage and how will it hit food supplies? The gas is widely used by the food industry to prolong shelf life. Restarting production at the carbon dioxide plants is set to cost taxpayers tens of millions of pounds, after the government agreed to meet the full operating costs for three weeks.

""That involves the loss of all that we cherish, our society, our way of life and law and order,"" she said. Ina reply to Mr Shapps' tweet,external, Insulate Britain said the government ""is reckless and is putting lives at risk with its inaction on #insulation"". M25 protesters 'may cause serious injury or death' Priti Patel calls M25 climate protesters selfish Arrest tally over M25 protests reaches 77 Mr Shapps told MPs he believed the injunction would bring an end to the demonstrations. ""It barely goes without saying, it's irresponsible, dangerous and completely counterproductive,"" he said. ""Earlier in the process there was a somewhat different approach being taken. ""Yesterday the police were on the scene much more quickly. The injunction will greatly strengthen their hand."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Home Secretary Priti Patel, wholast week described protesters' actions as ""selfish"", said the injunction would mean ""people can get moving again"" on the London orbital motorway. ""We will not tolerate lives being put at risk,"" she said. Insulate Britain campaigners protested on the M25 near Cobham in Surrey on Tuesday Mr Shapps added the government would be reviewing the powers, but it was ""unacceptable for people to be able to walk on to not just a major highway but a motorway, stop traffic, be released the next day and do the same thing again"". ""An injunction may just be an interim way of doing [stopping] that,"" he said. Police chiefs have warned that the protests are putting officers in danger Assistant Chief Constable for Humberside Police, Chris Noble, who is the National Police Chiefs' Council lead for policing protests, told the Today programme police ""aren't anti-protest but we are pro-responsibility"". ""This is not a benign supermarket car park that this is taking place on,"" he said. He said police officers were most likely to come to harm as a result of the protests because they were having to run across motorways to try to remove the campaigners. In his High Court order, Mr Justice Lavender ruled it should last until 21 March, but there would be a hearing to review the situation on 5 October. The order covers every part of the M25 and the Dartford Crossing, including slip roads and bridges, and states that demonstrators are banned from ""causing damage to the surface of or to any apparatus on or around the M25 including but not limited to painting, damaging by fire, or affixing any item or structure thereto"". The order means that breaching it could lead to a civil court hearing. In a statement, Insulate Britain said it would continue its protests and ""as soon as the government makes a meaningful statement that we can trust, we will leave the motorway"". During the recent protests,the government saidit was ""investing Â£1.3bn this year alone to support people to install energy efficiency measures, and our upcoming Heat and Buildings Strategy will set out how we decarbonise the nation's homes in a way that is fair, practical and affordable"".

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says there's ""every chance"" of a UK-US trade deal â just not ""right now"" The United States is lifting its decades-old ban on imports of British lamb, Boris Johnson has announced. The PM, who is in the US for talks with UN leaders and President Joe Biden, said the ban was ""unjustified"". But he admitted the UK was now focused on making ""incremental steps"" on US trade access, rather than aiming for a full agreement. Mr Biden appeared to play down the chances of a wider deal during a meeting with Mr Johnson on Tuesday. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Mr Johnson said the Biden administration ""is not doing free trade deals around the world right now"". But he added he had ""every confidence that a great deal is there to be done"". Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner mocked the lack of movement, saying the PM had made ""absolutely zero progress"" on a trade deal during his US trip. UK beef served up in the US after a 20-year ban BBC specialists on the prospects for UK-US trade Biden plays down chances of UK-US trade deal The United States has banned British lamb imports since 1989, following the first outbreaks of BSE, commonly known as mad cow disease. A similar ban on British beef imports, imposed in 1996, waslifted in September last year. There is no indication yet of when the US will start accepting lamb and lamb products from the UK, and an official announcement has not been made. The US Department for Agriculture has been consulting on lifting the ban since 2016 - and there were originally hopes it would be lifted the following year. At the time, the UK government estimated the change would be worth an extra Â£35m a year to the UK economy. Analysis by Damian Grammaticas , BBC political correspondent When it comes to trade, the big deal that's emerged from Boris Johnson's visit to Washington is that there's to be no deal happening any time soon. That's significant, and a setback for Boris Johnson's government. In March 2020, just a few weeks after the UK had left the EU, the then-Trade Secretary Liz Truss said the day marked a ""crucial step in beginning the formal negotiations for a free-trade agreement with our largest bilateral trading partner, the United States."" Today it all looks different. The United States, Boris Johnson told us, is not doing deals. So whilst Ms Truss predicted a ""Â£3.4 billion lift to the economy"" from a US-UK deal, today we had an ""incremental step"" but a tiny one by comparison - a possible opening for lamb exports. A US deal was by far the biggest prize when it came to the promise of post-Brexit trade deals. But under this US administration, it's not happening any time soon. Mr Johnson said the ban was ""totally unjustified"" and ""discriminating on British farmers and British lamb"". The National Sheep Association industry group welcomed the news, adding it had always seen the US as a ""potentially important market"". Its chief executive Phil Stocker cautioned, however, that ""we shouldn't expect to see any sudden surge in volumes going to the US"". He added that Brexit had made it more difficult to sell into the EU - the UK's lamb largest export market - and it was ""important to work on any market that gives us future potential"". Boris Johnson and Joe Biden held face-to-face talks in the White House on Tuesday Mr Johnson cited the lifting of the ban as an example of ""practical steps to help our exports"" the UK was taking, pending progress on wider trade talks. Downing Street has pointed to the resolution of the Airbus-Boeing trade dispute, as well as thelowering of whisky tariffsand the decision to lift the ban on British beef. Securing a trade deal with the United States has been a priority for many Brexit-backing politicians, following the UK's departure from the EU. But on Tuesday, Mr Biden appeared to downplay the chances of an agreement soon, adding he would discuss the issue ""a little bit"" with Mr Johnson during his trip to the White House. ""We're going to have to work that through,"" the US president added. The US is already a significant UK trading partner, accounting for Â£1 in every Â£6 of British trade. The BBC understands the government is considering whether to join an existing trade arrangement between the US, Canada and Mexico - known as the USMCA. However, Downing Street denies this and says it focus remains on a UK-US trade deal. If a USMCA arrangement was pursued, it would limit the UK's ability to sell services. Economists say the overall gains from joining it could be less than 0.1% of the UK's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - a measurement of the size of the economy.

"Derby were relegated from the Premier League in 2008 and have spent 13 seasons in the second tier Derby County have entered administration and been deducted 12 points by the English Football League. The Championship club announced theirintention to call in administratorson Friday, with owner Mel Morris saying the coronavirus pandemic had cost them about Â£20m in lost revenue. Morris has spent the past two days talking to players and staff, whose jobs are now uncertain. Wayne Rooney's Rams drop to the foot of the table, on minus two points. Andrew Hosking, Carl Jackson and Andrew Andronikou, managing directors at business advisory firm Quantuma, have been appointed joint administrators. ""We are in the early stages of assessing the options available to the club and would invite any interested parties to come forward,"" said Hosking. ""Our immediate objectives are to ensure the club completes all its fixtures in the Championship this season and finding interested parties to safeguard the club and its employees."" The EFL said it had already had ""constructive discussions"" with Quantuma and would remain in ""regular dialogue"" about the situation. EFL chief executive Trevor Birch said: ""I appreciate that this is a challenging and concerning period for everyone associated with the club, particularly the staff and supporters, and it is our intention to work proactively with the administrators and all relevant parties with the objective of securing a long-term and viable future for Derby County."" Derby Q&A - the debt, the mess, the timeline, the future Morris became Derby's sole owner in 2015 but has actively been looking to sell since June 2019 following their Championship play-off final defeat by Aston Villa under Frank Lampard. Morris says the club has lost him ""in excess of Â£200m"" to date. A first takeover deal is said to have collapsed in the aftermath of an EFL charge in January 2020 relating to thesale of Derby's Pride Park to Morrisfor Â£80m, despite it previously being listed as worth Â£41m. Morris sorry over Derby administration The stadium sale allowed the club to post a pre-tax profit of Â£14.6m in 2017-18 and therefore meet the EFL's spending rules. The charge wasdismissed in August 2020but the Rams face a possible separate points deduction, speculated to be nine points, over their accounting policies - withno decision yet madeon the punishment. In March of this year Derventio Holdings, who were backed by the Abu Dhabi-based Bin Zayed Group, sawtheir takeover bid endwhile another fromSpanish businessman Erik Alonsowas called off in May. Derby have been under a transfer embargo since before the summer window opened, meaning the Rams have only been allowed to sign free agents with strict conditions on salaries. Morris told BBC Radio Derby on Sunday that there had been ""something in the region"" of 15 enquiries for the club over the weekend, two or three of which he said were ""very serious"". On the pitch, Derby had been 12th in the Championship under the management of England's record goalscorer Rooney, who has been in permanent charge since he officially retired as a player in January. However the automatic penalty for going into administration will put the Rams six points adrift of second-bottom Nottingham Forest, their East Midlands rivals. Derby are now nine points from safety in the Championship - table correct as of 24 September 2021 Derby were also in serious financial trouble in 1984 - less than a decade after the second of their Division One title wins - when former chairman Stuart Webb was a member of the board, and he criticised Morris' decision to ""walk away"" from the current situation. ""We worked relentlessly to keep the club alive which in the end we were able to do,"" Webb told BBC Radio Derby. ""We all worked together to keep it going but at this point it looks as though it's come to the end, and that really is worrying for everyone. Once the administrator is appointed, then we'll really find out what the extent of the problems is and how it's going to be dealt with, and that's not going to be pleasant."" Under Morris, the only other board members werecompany secretary Stephen Pearce and former Derby captain and manager Roy McFarland.,external Webb added: ""Mel Morris came in as a highly successful businessman but was clueless about the running of a football club. You need experienced people who can manage a huge business. You need to get the club on an even footing and if you go deeper down into a financial mire, take advice but don't walk away."" Derby are now facing the prospect of relegation to League One and insolvency expert, and former Leeds United chairman, Gerald Krasner, told BBC Derby: ""If they don't sell the club, then it's liquidation and expulsion like Bury and clubs before them. That would be a great shame with a history like Derby's."" Ed Dawes, Derby County commentator for BBC Radio Derby: Disbelief, tears, anger and frustration. The emotions of supporters of Derby County since Friday evening. Saturday's win over Stoke City and the atmosphere at Pride Park was a stopgap to the eventual reality that the Rams would be placed bottom of the Championship, which is now where they are. Questions surrounding chairman Mel Morris' 'cut and run', as it has been called by many supporters, still need to be answered and perhaps we will only find out now what state the football club is in. A debt of more than Â£50m is not going to be turned around by the likes of a Lionel Pickering, the Rams' former chairman who spent his entire local newspaper fortune on the club. It will need to be a global multi-millionaire who can run a business and a football club, but be happy to wipe out the debt owed in one fell swoop. The worry for supporters is not only the immediate 12-point deduction, it is the next move by the EFL regarding the unsubmitted accounts. Morris told me exclusively on Sunday that there is a failure of profit and sustainability rules in the recalculated documents following the amortisation saga, which in turn could lead to more points being taken off. The one thing that is obvious around Derby right now is the togetherness of the fans and support for Wayne Rooney. Every battle needs a leader and Rooney is that man. He is unlikely to keep Derby in the Championship, but he told me on Saturday he is committed to the club and to navigate this journey. Whether that will be up to him and his price, rather than his ability, we will have to wait. The club nearly went bust in 1984 in their centenary season, while the 2021-22 season marks 50 years since Brian Clough's side won their first old First Division title. A penny for his thoughts.

"The British food industry will be forced to pay five times more for carbon dioxide as part of a government deal with a US company to restart production in the UK. Environment Secretary George Eustice said carbon dioxide prices would rise from Â£200 per tonne to Â£1,000. The government has agreed to pay out tens of millions of pounds to CF Industries to reopen a plant in the UK. The closure had raised fears over food supplies and the nuclear industry. US-owned CF Industries recently shut two UK sites that produce 60% of the country's commercial carbon dioxide supplies, because of a sharp rise in gas prices. This video can not be played Ros Atkins on... the UK's rising energy bills Farms, food producers and supermarkets have warned that a shortage of carbon dioxide will lead to significant disruption to the manufacture and supply of fresh produce. The Times also reported,externalthat ministers were concerned that the UK might have to close its six advanced gas-cooled nuclear reactors, which also use CO2. The government announced late on Tuesday night that it would meet the full operating costs to run CF Industries' Billingham plant in Teesside for three weeks. The costs are expected to be in the ""low tens of millions"" and will be below Â£50m. Mr Eustice said that the deal with CF Industries ""will be not a loan, it will be a payment to underwrite some of their fixed costs"". At the end of the three-week period, it is hoped that the price of carbon dioxide will have risen sufficiently to make it economically viable for CF Industries to keep production running. Mr Eustice said the food industry would have to accept ""a big, sharp rise"" carbon dioxide prices from Â£200 to Â£1,000 a tonne. ""The critical thing was to get the production up and running expeditiously. That's why we've needed this government intervention,"" he said. ""But we've had meetings with the food industry. They all recognise that the price of carbon dioxide is going to increase substantially and when that price increases, then the market signal will be then for these plants to continue producing."" Mr Eustice insisted that the rise in cost would not have a ""significant impact"" on food prices. He said that while food prices were increasing ""due to global commodity prices, oil prices and also other factors such as labour shortages"", carbon dioxide was ""a tiny proportion"" of the industry's overall costs. CF Industries had halted two of its fertiliser factories - which produce carbon dioxide as a by-product - because of gas prices. Carbon dioxide is used in the slaughter of animals such as chickens CF Industries' Billingham plant will need up to three days to start producing new CO2. The company told the BBC it had ""no estimate"" on when its second UK plant at Ince in Cheshire would  resume production. The British Meat Processors Association said the deal to open CF Industries' Teesside plant was a ""huge relief"" and said it was now ""focused on re-establishing supplies before Friday this week, which is when around 25% of pork production was in danger of shutting down"". Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, welcomed the decision, but said the timetable to restart CF Industries' factory and begin producing carbon dioxide ""will still be tight"". He told the BBC's Today programme: ""Our understanding is that provided that carbon dioxide starts to get through to food producers by the end of the week, then we can avert major and significant disruption in our stores."" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the ""exceptional short-term arrangement"" would ensure industries that rely on a stable supply of CO2 ""have the resources they require to avoid disruption"". He said: ""With regards to the CO2 situation, it was abundant, it was very cheap and I think a lot of people were surprised at what happened."" The government intends to publish the letter from Mr Kwarteng to Tony Will, chief executive of CF Industries, which sets out the terms of the taxpayer support. Commenting on the three-week deal, Mr Kwarteng said: ""In a critical intervention you have to have a way of exiting the arrangement. ""It is not a case of just trying to nationalise it or supporting it indefinitely, and that is why in the critical period we needed to have a short term arrangement I am confident that we can get other sources of CO2 in that period. Mr Eustice said that the shortage of carbon dioxide had been caused by a ""perfect storm"" of circumstances where CF Industries had shut its two plants because ""an increase in gas price means they are not profitable"", while two other providers had closed their sites for maintenance. But the British Meat Processors Association (BMPA) said the current difficulties showed how exposed the UK is, because of its reliance on such a small number of carbon dioxide producers. ""Over many years, we have had a major consolidation of the industry resulting in sectors like food and drink, nuclear and health being reliant on a very small number of very large suppliers,"" the BMPA said. ""If a market-based solution is to be found, it will likely involve longer-term higher prices for CO2, which will be sustainable for some, but not all users of the gas."" Ian Wright, the chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, also called on the government to support other fertiliser producers and help food producers to look for alternatives to CO2. Mr Will, who flew from the US to the UK on Sunday to meet Mr Kwarteng, said: ""We look forward to working with Secretary Kwarteng and the UK government on developing a longer-term solution, including the development of alternative suppliers of CO2 for the UK market."" Farmers fear gas price crisis may spark pig cull How could the CO2 shortage hit food supplies? Gas price crisis: Government poised to step in The BBC understands that the deal with CF Industries has been drafted so that other companies who stop production because of high commodity prices will not be able to ask the government for similar help. Norwegian firm Yara has also cut production at a number of European factories, including one in Hull. This video can not be played The prime minister says he does ânot believe people will be short of foodâ amid reports of some empty supermarket shelves. Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged people not to worryabout putting food on the table this winter, amid rising energy and food bills and a cut to universal credit. Wholesale prices for gas have surged 250% since January, with a 70% rise since August alone, leading to calls for support from the industry and the collapse of some smaller energy firms. Mr Opie added that the government should also take action on other issues affecting food retailers in recent weeks, such as the shortage of HGV drivers, which has been exacerbated by the pandemic and many drivers returning to the European Union after Brexit. The government has been keen to stress that this is very much an emergency measure, time-limited, and with a cap on the amount it is prepared to pay. It had to do something. Food producers were warning that shortages would become apparent within days, at a time when supply chains have already been disrupted by other issues, such as a lack of lorry drivers. But the fact remains that it has agreed to give a large US-owned company tens of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money, just to operate one of its own plants. That isn't a particularly good look - and it has cast a glaring spotlight on the vulnerability of a key part of the economy.

"The US is to donate 500 million more doses of the Pfizer vaccine to developing nations from next year. President Joe Biden made the pledge at a virtual Covid-19 summit on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, promising an ""arsenal of vaccines"". The additional jabs will see the total US commitment on vaccine sharing exceed one billion jabs. Experts say some 11 billion doses are required to vaccinate at least 70% of the global population. The World Health Organisation has set a minimum target of 40% vaccine coverage in every country by the end of 2021. But the goal is unlikely to be met. While many high-income countries have now given at least one shot to more than half their populations, only 2% of people in low-income countries have had their first dose, according to data from the University of Oxford. Covid vaccine tracker: How's my country doing? Could 241m vaccine doses go to waste? Analysis by Stephanie Hegarty, BBC population correspondent It's a big pledge but it'll be met with a fair share of scepticism from countries still waiting to vaccinate even 2% of their population. The US had already pledged 580m doses but delivered only 160m of those so far. So what's different now? Well, global production has picked up in the past few months and there are doses available. Rich countries could have 1.2bn spare doses by the end of the year, even if they run booster campaigns, according to science analytics firm Airfinity. 241m of those could go to waste if they're not donated. But these need to be sent very soon. Covax, the WHO-backed scheme to help distribute vaccines fairly, has told the BBC that too many of the donations it's receiving have come in small quantities, at the last minute and with little time left before they expire. That makes their job of getting them to where they are needed very hard. If Biden want to meet this ambitious goal of vaccinating the world by this time next year, that will have to change. The White House's Covid summit comes as research shows rich countries are still holding surpluses of vaccines, many of which could soon be thrown out. In June, members of the G7 - Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US - pledged to donate one billion doses to poor countries over the next year. President Biden pledged 580m at the time, of which the US has delivered only 160m so far. The donated vaccines are routed through Covax, the global scheme supported by the WHO to get doses where they're needed most. Covax purchases and then sells vaccines at low-cost to middle income countries and donates to poor countries. In the US - where more than 76% of adults have received at least one dose - criticism that the country is doing too little to help the rest of the world has grown. On Friday, a panel advising the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended booster shots - third doses - of the Pfizer vaccine for people 65 and over. The WHO has previously called on wealthier nations to hold off on providing boosters until vaccination rates go up in lesser developed countries. Last week, in a letter to Mr Biden, eight lawmakers of his own party wrote: ""Clearly, there is an inequitable distribution of Covid-19 vaccine doses, and it is getting worse.""

"Covishield has been added to the UK's list of recognised vaccines, recipients of which are able to enter the country without isolating from next month But its still unclear whether Indian travellers or those from African countries, including Kenya, which use also Covishield, will avoid the need to isolate They are not listed among the countries whose citizens will be recognised as vaccinated by the UK even if they have had two doses However, the United Arab Emirates has been added to this list this morning, so travellers from there will not have to isolate in the UK Global cases fell significantly to 3.6 million last week from 4 million the week before, WHO reports Brazil's health minister has tested positive for Covid-19, after attending the UN General Assembly in New York Pret A Manger aims to hire 3,000 staff by the end of 2022 after cutting the same number of jobs last year Edited by Martha Buckley Speaking of new UK data, there's good news on the latest hospital figures, which are the lowest in six weeks. The total patient count for people in hospital with Covid has also been updated and stood at 7,567 yesterday - the lowest figure for 18 days.  It was above 8,000 every day last week. The numbers in ventilator beds have also fallen. After being above 1,000 throughout September they now stand at 943, after falling in recent days. The government has reported 34,460 new coronavirus cases in figures released today. A further 166 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test were also reported. The case figures are a jump from the 31,564 new cases recorded yesterday, though deaths fell from 203 on Tuesday. As we reported earlier, there are protests in India as it has not been added to the list of countries where people fully jabbed with an approved vaccine can avoid having to isolate if they want to travel to the UK. Many other countries are affected after the UK government clarified the jab widely distributed by Covax - Covishield - was an approved vaccine but arrivals from some places were not added to the exempt-from-quarantine list. Covishield is the Indian-made AstraZeneca jab and identical to the one used in the UK. The Kenyan and British governments say they are working on a system to recognise Covid vaccine certificates issued in both countries, to facilitate travel between them. Under the UK's new rules effective from 4 October, fully vaccinated people from countries that are not on the red list will be exempt from the compulsory quarantine. But despite being removed from the UK's red list, Kenyans intending to travel there will still have to take a test three days before travelling, quarantine for 10 days on arrival, as well as pay for Covid tests while in isolation. People from other African countries that remain on the UK red list have also criticised the new travel rules saying they are discriminatory.

Razia IqbalPresenter, Newshour, BBC World Service We told you earlier about a llama named Fifi and her ""nanobodies"" which are showing ""significant potential"" in Covid therapy trials. Prof James Naismith is director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute in Oxford, which has been doing this research. I asked him, Why llamas? This video can not be played Germany's health minister has announced that, from 1 November, Germans will no longer receive compensation for lost pay if they are unvaccinated and forced to quarantine. The government has been helping to pay workers sent into quarantine after being in contact with an infected person or returning from a ""high risk"" area abroad. But minister Jens Spahn says this support will be withdrawn, in an effort to encourage more people to get the jab. Getting vaccinated will remain a ""personal decision"", he says, but that decision will now ""also come with the responsibility to bear the financial consequences"". ""Some people will say this means pressure for the unvaccinated. I think we have to look at it the other way around - it is also a question of fairness,"" he added. More than 60% of Germany's population have been fully vaccinated, according to official data. While compulsory vaccination has been ruled out by the government, many German states have introduced restrictions for unvaccinated residents in public places. Those who've had their jabs are no longer required to quarantine. US officials have announced announced that all staff at San Francisco International Airport must be fully vaccinated to carry on working. In a statement on Tuesday, airport authorities and city mayor London Breed said the mandate was the first of its kind in the US, and would take effect immediately. âAs SFO prepares for the upcoming holiday travel season and the return of pre-pandemic passenger levels, we have an obligation to provide a safe airport facility for the traveling public and our on-site employees,"" said airport director Ivar Satero. Under the new rules, every airport tenant or contractor must ensure their on-site staff are fully vaccinated. Employees can be granted exemptions based on ""either medical disability or sincerely held religious belief"". The airport offers free vaccines at an on-site medical centre. The announcement has been welcomed by one local workers' union that represents several food and beverage staff at the airport. Speaking to the San Francisco Chronicle, Anand Singh, president of Unite Here Local 2, which represents several food and beverage workers at the airport, said: ""Our union is working with employers to ensure fair implementation because vaccines are critical to keeping workers safe and building a recovery where everyone comes back stronger."" BBC Storyteller Chanise Evans tells her story Some 250,000 school pupils will be supported to tell their own stories in a BBC scheme to help recovery from the pandemic. The BBC 100 Share Your Story project will see BBC stars and staff visiting secondary schools across the UK to improve students' well-being and story-telling skills. Director general Tim Davie said the BBC had supported ""an entire nation of home learners during the coronavirus pandemic"". He says: ""In 2022 - our centenary year - we will harness the unique power of the BBC to provide educational support to inspire millions of children and students across the UK."" Pupils will be supported to tell their own stories in class, in the form of a poem, a rap, a film or a speech. BBC hosts will then conduct a series of interactive assemblies in whichBBC stars and staff reveal how they have overcome challengesin their own lives. Deputy chief medical officer for England Professor Jonathan Van-Tam tells the Education Committee the dominant Delta variant is 60% more infectious than the Alpha variant, so it is really quite likely that teenagers will be infected at some point. He adds that he has in mind particularly the impact of being ill at a time not of their choosing, such as around their GCSEs. ""Because the Delta variant is so infectious we're not looking at a theoretical risk of children 12 to 17 becoming infected. I think it is really quite inevitable that they will be so at some point."" England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty and his deputy Jonathan Van-Tam are answering questions from the Education Committee. Prof Whitty says children are currently driving the spread of the virus, with ""substantial transmission"" in children. The 12-17 age group is the highest transmission group ""as far as we can tell"", he says. All children in that age group are due to be offered a Covid-19 vaccine - a decision Whitty insists has not been
made for political reasons or for the benefit of more vulnerable
adults. Asked about vaccination he says the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) and the chief medical officers agree the risk to children from Covid is small and the risk of vaccination is small. But he says it is the view of the JCVI that the benefits of vaccinating them are marginally greater than the potential for harm. He adds that vaccinating children would help prevent disruption in schools. ""The great majority of children who have not currently had
Covid are going to get it at some point,"" he says. ""It won't be necessary in the next two or three months but
they will get it sooner or later because this is incredibly
infectious... vaccination will reduce that risk."" Boris Johnson is in New York for the UN General Assembly No 10 says Boris Johnson is fully vaccinated - after being asked whether the prime minister had taken any extra precautions since coming into contact with a positive coronavirus case at the United Nations general assembly (UNGA). According to reports, Brazil's health minister Marcelo Queiroga has tested positive for Covid and gone into isolation, only 24 hours after being filmed shaking hands with Johnson in New York on Monday. Asked whether the prime minister had taken a Covid test since Queiroga's result, a spokesman for the prime minister says there are ""strict"" Covid measures in place at UNGA ""which the prime minister will obviously adhere to"". ""As you know he is double jabbed,"" he adds. An unvaccinated former councillor who became seriously ill with Covidfeared his mother would die after she caught the virus from him. Andrew Girvan, 48, was infected at the start of August and within a week 19 family members had the virus, including his grandparents and six-year-old daughter. He says he was given a 50/50 chance of survival and his mother was put on a ventilator,the Belfast Telegraph reports,external. ""It was without a doubt that it was me who gave it to her,"" the former Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) councillor tells BBC Radio Ulster's The Nolan Show. ""I was lying in bed in hospital and she was in the other hospital and she looked a lot worse than I was. ""To think that you've given your mum something that could eventually kill her isn't a nice place to be."" He says ""procrastination"" got in the way of getting his jab. As we've heard a bit earlier today, PCR tests for fully
vaccinated travellers arriving in the UK will be replaced by lateral flow
tests undernew foreign travel rules. But a leading immunologist says it is ""critical"" that the government ensures at-home testing is overseen by professional and any positive tests are screened for variants of concern. Professor Denis Kinane, immunologist and founding scientist at Cignpost Diagnostics, says: âIf we are to use lateral flow, letâs make it as robust as we can, which means
the swabbing should be administered by a capable agent and the authenticity of
the individual being tested should be verified. ""Any positives picked up in this
way should be reported to PHE and the individual retested and genomically
sequenced by the NHS.  
âLateral flow tests can also be performed at home but observed online by a
medical professional. ""This would ensure that the test is conducted correctly
and that the person being tested is who they say they are. ""The government
has to reduce spread and new variants coming into the UK and if lateral flow
tests are used, they need to be performed authentically.â A group representing nightclubs is launching a legal challenge to the Scottish government's plans for vaccine passports. From October, people will need proof they have had two doses of vaccine to enter certain venues and large events. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says the scheme will help reduce transmission of the virus and keep clubs open. But the Night Time Industries Association Scotland says there are ""serious flaws"" with the plans. The government's definition of a nightclub is a venue which is open between midnight and 05:00, serves alcohol, and which has a designated area for dancing and provides live or recorded music for this purpose. However, industry groups have voiced concerns that the definition could also cover arange of other hospitality venues, including bars, pubs and hotel function rooms. As policy makers look for creative ways to encourage people to get their vaccines, Romania's government has announced a new vaccination lottery. Any fully-vaccinated residents with an EU digital Covid certificate can enter the scheme, which is running from 1 October until the end of the year. A total of 19 draws will be made during the period, with 1,139 prizes totalling 15m Romanian leu ($3.6m; Â£2.6m). Dozens of other weekly prizes will also be given out, some up to 500,000 Romanian leu (Â£118,433; Â£86,825). Funding for the lottery will be given by Romania's economic ministry. âIn this epidemiological context, with significant increases in the number of people infected with Covid-19, it is important to support the vaccination process, including by granting rewards,â said Cseke Attila, Romania's interim health minister,in a statement on Monday.,external Authorities are struggling with vaccine hesitancy in the eastern European country. Just over a quarter of eligible citizens have been fully vaccinated - one of the lowest rates in the EU. Officials have blamed the low pick-up on logistical issues, and a general mistrust of medicine, made worse by online fake news. Hello and thanks for following our rolling coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. If you're just joining us, here are some of the biggest developments:  The World Health Organisation says that the global number of Covid-19 cases continued to fall last week. In its latest update,external, the UN health body said 3.6 million new cases were reported last week, down from 4 million the week before. It's the first substantial drop in over two months, with infections falling in every region of the world. There were major decreases in two regions especially: the Middle East, with a 22% fall, and a 16% drop in south east Asia. Most cases were reported in the US, the UK, India, Turkey and the Philippines. Global coronavirus-related deaths also declined 7% to just under 60,000. The WHO has revised its list of ""variants of interest"" and said it is tracking Lamba and Mu variants. Both have a Latin American origin, but haven't yet caused widespread epidemics. Meanwhile the Delta variant has spread to 185 countries. We've got a bit more detail now on Transport Secretary Grant Shapps's comments to the Transport Committee. Earlier, he said the government was working as ""quickly as possible"" to remove PCR Covid testing for international travellers and to replacethe PCR test taken two days after arrival with a cheaper and simpler lateral flow test. The expense of paying for private PCR testing is widely blamed for discouraging people from travelling abroad - withmost private providers charging above Â£60 for PCR tests and Â£30 for lateral flow tests. The government has warned more than 80 providers over misleading prices. Asked why the switch from PCR to lateral flow tests for arrivals into England would not happen until the end of October, Shapps said it would take several weeks to implement because private testing firms did not have enough lateral flow tests to meet demand. âThis is a Department of Health [and Social Care] responsibility rather than mine, but my understanding is that the ramp up of supply of lateral flow through the private testing sector has some way to go in as much as they have been almost entirely involved in providing PCRs currently,â he says. When questioned by Ben Bradshaw MP about why this was an issue as many test providers also offered lateral flow tests, Shapps responded that he thought it was a question of scale. âWe go from a situation where they are providing low number of thousands to probably millions of tests very quickly and need a few weeks to scale up on it,â he said. The transport secretary could not provide a more specific date for the switch but said his Department of Health colleagues were aware of the upcoming October half-term school holidays and understood the speed required to bring in the changes. Scottish tourism bodies are worried that visitors from overseas will be put off by the Covid-testing requirements Scotland's next tourism season is at ""serious risk"" becauserigorous Covid-testing requirements are being retainedfor international visitors, industry leaders have claimed. Visitor testing rules arebeing relaxed in Englandbut the Scottish government has raised health concerns. The Scottish Tourism Alliance claims the divergence is harming its industry. The Scottish government said it would be guided by clinical advice as well as economic implications. The Scottish Tourism Alliance has put its name to an open letter signed by more than 40 tourism businesses calling for an urgent meeting with the Scottish government. SinceCovid restrictions lifted in England on 19 July, people have been told they no longer have to work from home. However, there have been warnings that this could change if there is a surge in coronavirus cases this winter. Staff in the rest of the UK are still advised to remain at home where possible. The government'sCovid Autumn and Winter Plan for England,externalhas two proposals. Much ofPlan Afocuses onthe vaccine rollout: But if the NHS struggles,Plan B(or parts of it) could start - including advice to work from home again for ""a limited period"". Some businesses - but not all - have embraced the remote-working model seen during the pandemic, with some firms putting in place hybrid working arrangements that would see employees work part of the week from home. Other companies have said they want workers to return to the office or workplace full-time. You can ask to continue to work from home by making a flexible working request, but employers don't have to agree, even if you've worked from home throughout the pandemic. The government is expected to launch a consultation shortly onproposals to give all employees the right to request flexible working as soon as they start a job. At the moment, workers have to wait for six months. You can read morehere.

Officials said some sites would be shut for up to two weeks after construction workers and other protesters clashed. Property was damaged and police said several people were arrested. Hundreds gathered in Melbourne for another anti-vaccination protest on Tuesday, setting off flares and reportedly throwing urine at reporters. On Monday, riot police were deployed and reportedly used rubber bullets and pepper spray to disperse crowds. Of those acting aggressively, state premier Daniel Andrews said: ""They're not there to protest, they're there for a fight."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"Health Secretary Humza Yousaf says he is ""working urgently"" to free up bed space in Scotland's NHS. The Scottish government has enlisted the help of the Army, fire service, British Red Cross and taxi firms to ease pressure on the ambulance service. Mr Yousaf told BBC Scotland that efforts are also under way to move more people into social care. Nursing and social care groups say more help is needed - and that reintroducing some restrictions should be considered. Donald Macaskill, the chief executive of Scottish Care, which represents care homes in Scotland, claimed his sector was in ""dire straits"" and needed an ""emergency intervention"". Soldiers to drive ambulances from this weekend What is being done to ease the ambulance 'crisis'? NHS needs 1,000 more hospital beds say A&E doctors He added: ""With all the focus on the NHS the crisis in the care system has gone largely unnoticed. ""This is an ecosystem. To free up capacity in hospitals, you have to attend to social care. The NHS will collapse next week if social care collapses today. ""We need an immediate injection of cash into the sector. If we can increase the salary of lorry drivers we should be able to do it for frontline social care workers who fought their way through this pandemic."" The warning comes as the Royal College of Nursing Scotland said ministers need to consider reintroducing Covid restrictions in order to alleviate the pressure on the NHS. Norman Provan, the trade union's associate director, said: ""The government have to consider whether further restrictions have to be put back in place. ""I know that that is really unpopular with the general public, who are just beginning to think that things are getting back to normal, but it's not for people who work providing care. ""It is absolutely desperate out there and if their relatives were seeking care just now they would approach that quite differently."" Soldiers will be drafted in to drive ambulances from this weekend following reports that some patients have faced very long waits for emergency help to arrive. They include a pensioner who died in Glasgow after having to wait 40 hours for an ambulance, and an86-year-old womanwho had to lie on her kitchen for eight hours after falling and breaking her hip. In some cases the problem is caused byambulances queuing for hoursbefore being are able to hand over their patients to accident and emergency, due to the volume of patients in the hospital. The health secretary told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandhe was aware a ""whole systems approach"" was required address the current problems. He said: ""I can give absolute assurance that we are working urgently, and hopefully I can give some detail of this very imminently, in terms of a winter plan to free up beds back into social care. ""We know that there's about 1,500 people who are delayed discharge - they're clinically safe to discharge from hospital - but a portion of them don't have a care package in their local communities and we're working really hard to quickly try to resolve that to free up bed space."" Mr Yousaf described the situation as ""the biggest crisis that anybody has ever faced in our lifetime and certainly in the NHS' existence"". Just over 100 military personnel will be brought in to help the ambulance service He refused to rule out setting up field hospitals to cope with patient numbers but stressed they would present challenges. ""The difficulty is you could easily set up beds - we have beds and equipment to do that - what we don't have is the workforce,"" the health secretary added. ""And the Army don't have a huge pool of doctors that are just sitting there not doing anything. In fact the full-time doctors are very much based in the NHS and then if they have to go to deployment in armed service they get permission from the NHS to go and join army personnel overseas."" Mr Yousaf added: ""I definitely wouldn't rule it out entirely but we have to look at whether or not we would end up pulling people out of acute sites at the moment to staff those beds."" The Scottish government also said it was continuing to work with health and social care partnerships to provide support around the current challenges facing the sector. Dr Daniel Beckett, of the Society for Acute Medicine, said many patients could not leave hospital as they do not have a package of care in place. The acute care consultant said the main challenge was not Covid patients, who are generally younger and unvaccinated, but those suffering from conditions such as cancer, heart disease and diabetes. ""The numbers of patients that are coming through the front door and being admitted into acute medical units are high, certainly high even for winter, and much higher than we would expect at this time of year,"" Dr Beckett said. ""And those patients are sicker and more complex than normal and that's as a result of chronic disease management being different over the past 18 months."" Dr Beckett added patients are spending longer in hospital as a result and when they are medically fit for discharge, staff are struggling to access packages of care.

"Derby were relegated from the Premier League in 2008 and have spent 13 seasons in the second tier Derby County have entered administration and been deducted 12 points by the English Football League. The Championship club announced theirintention to call in administratorson Friday, with owner Mel Morris saying the coronavirus pandemic had cost them about Â£20m in lost revenue. Morris has spent the past two days talking to players and staff, whose jobs are now uncertain. Wayne Rooney's Rams drop to the foot of the table, on minus two points. Andrew Hosking, Carl Jackson and Andrew Andronikou, managing directors at business advisory firm Quantuma, have been appointed joint administrators. ""We are in the early stages of assessing the options available to the club and would invite any interested parties to come forward,"" said Hosking. ""Our immediate objectives are to ensure the club completes all its fixtures in the Championship this season and finding interested parties to safeguard the club and its employees."" The EFL said it had already had ""constructive discussions"" with Quantuma and would remain in ""regular dialogue"" about the situation. EFL chief executive Trevor Birch said: ""I appreciate that this is a challenging and concerning period for everyone associated with the club, particularly the staff and supporters, and it is our intention to work proactively with the administrators and all relevant parties with the objective of securing a long-term and viable future for Derby County."" Derby Q&A - the debt, the mess, the timeline, the future Morris became Derby's sole owner in 2015 but has actively been looking to sell since June 2019 following their Championship play-off final defeat by Aston Villa under Frank Lampard. Morris says the club has lost him ""in excess of Â£200m"" to date. A first takeover deal is said to have collapsed in the aftermath of an EFL charge in January 2020 relating to thesale of Derby's Pride Park to Morrisfor Â£80m, despite it previously being listed as worth Â£41m. Morris sorry over Derby administration The stadium sale allowed the club to post a pre-tax profit of Â£14.6m in 2017-18 and therefore meet the EFL's spending rules. The charge wasdismissed in August 2020but the Rams face a possible separate points deduction, speculated to be nine points, over their accounting policies - withno decision yet madeon the punishment. In March of this year Derventio Holdings, who were backed by the Abu Dhabi-based Bin Zayed Group, sawtheir takeover bid endwhile another fromSpanish businessman Erik Alonsowas called off in May. Derby have been under a transfer embargo since before the summer window opened, meaning the Rams have only been allowed to sign free agents with strict conditions on salaries. Morris told BBC Radio Derby on Sunday that there had been ""something in the region"" of 15 enquiries for the club over the weekend, two or three of which he said were ""very serious"". On the pitch, Derby had been 12th in the Championship under the management of England's record goalscorer Rooney, who has been in permanent charge since he officially retired as a player in January. However the automatic penalty for going into administration will put the Rams six points adrift of second-bottom Nottingham Forest, their East Midlands rivals. Derby are now nine points from safety in the Championship - table correct as of 24 September 2021 Derby were also in serious financial trouble in 1984 - less than a decade after the second of their Division One title wins - when former chairman Stuart Webb was a member of the board, and he criticised Morris' decision to ""walk away"" from the current situation. ""We worked relentlessly to keep the club alive which in the end we were able to do,"" Webb told BBC Radio Derby. ""We all worked together to keep it going but at this point it looks as though it's come to the end, and that really is worrying for everyone. Once the administrator is appointed, then we'll really find out what the extent of the problems is and how it's going to be dealt with, and that's not going to be pleasant."" Under Morris, the only other board members werecompany secretary Stephen Pearce and former Derby captain and manager Roy McFarland.,external Webb added: ""Mel Morris came in as a highly successful businessman but was clueless about the running of a football club. You need experienced people who can manage a huge business. You need to get the club on an even footing and if you go deeper down into a financial mire, take advice but don't walk away."" Derby are now facing the prospect of relegation to League One and insolvency expert, and former Leeds United chairman, Gerald Krasner, told BBC Derby: ""If they don't sell the club, then it's liquidation and expulsion like Bury and clubs before them. That would be a great shame with a history like Derby's."" Ed Dawes, Derby County commentator for BBC Radio Derby: Disbelief, tears, anger and frustration. The emotions of supporters of Derby County since Friday evening. Saturday's win over Stoke City and the atmosphere at Pride Park was a stopgap to the eventual reality that the Rams would be placed bottom of the Championship, which is now where they are. Questions surrounding chairman Mel Morris' 'cut and run', as it has been called by many supporters, still need to be answered and perhaps we will only find out now what state the football club is in. A debt of more than Â£50m is not going to be turned around by the likes of a Lionel Pickering, the Rams' former chairman who spent his entire local newspaper fortune on the club. It will need to be a global multi-millionaire who can run a business and a football club, but be happy to wipe out the debt owed in one fell swoop. The worry for supporters is not only the immediate 12-point deduction, it is the next move by the EFL regarding the unsubmitted accounts. Morris told me exclusively on Sunday that there is a failure of profit and sustainability rules in the recalculated documents following the amortisation saga, which in turn could lead to more points being taken off. The one thing that is obvious around Derby right now is the togetherness of the fans and support for Wayne Rooney. Every battle needs a leader and Rooney is that man. He is unlikely to keep Derby in the Championship, but he told me on Saturday he is committed to the club and to navigate this journey. Whether that will be up to him and his price, rather than his ability, we will have to wait. The club nearly went bust in 1984 in their centenary season, while the 2021-22 season marks 50 years since Brian Clough's side won their first old First Division title. A penny for his thoughts.

"BBC Storyteller Chanise Evans tells her story Some 250,000 school pupils will be supported to tell their own stories in a BBC scheme to improve their well-being and story-telling skills. TheBBC 100 Share Your Story projectwill see BBC stars and staff visiting secondary schools across the UK, targeting recovery from the pandemic. It aims to build pupils' confidence and resilience and improve learning as well as relationships within schools. Director general Tim Davie said the BBC had a history of supporting education. ""The BBC has played a vital role in education throughout the last century - from Children's Hour broadcasts in 1922, introducing the BBC Micro computer to schools in the 1980s, to supporting an entire nation of home learners during the coronavirus pandemic,"" he said. ""In 2022 - our centenary year - we will harness the unique power of the BBC to provide educational support to inspire millions of children and students across the UK. ""Hundreds of thousands of school children will be visited by BBC stars and staff, and all educators and students will gain access to cultural treasures in our digitised archive to aid their studies."" BBC Radio 1's Breakfast programme host Greg James said: ""Telling stories is what humans are best at. ""Whether it's brilliant novels, hilarious comedies or just a good old gossip, stories make the world go round. ""I'm looking forward to sharing my own story with young people and helping them develop the skills and confidence to tell their own, because storytelling is one of the most enjoyable things you can do with your brain."" The BBC has teamed up with the National Literacy Trust, oracy charity Voice 21 and the British Film Institute's Into Film programme. Pupils will be supported to tell their own stories in class, in the form of a poem, a rap, a film or a speech. Then BBC hosts will conduct a series of interactive assemblies in which BBC stars and staff reveal how they have overcome challenges. And some of pupil's stories will be showcased at BBC Share Your Story events, to inspire other young people. Teacher Sarah Reardon said personal storytelling helped students understand each other better One teacher involved in a pilot at a school in Runcorn, Cheshire, Sarah Reardon, said: ""It's just been such a great way to build relationships between the students and the teachers. ""A student has shared their story with you, and you've built a completely different type of relationship with them, and suddenly they're working very hard in their lessons."" Emily Kasriel, who is leading the initiative, said: ""Stories help us make meaning of the world around us, our past and where we might go in the future. ""Sharing stories helps us to build connections and fosters trust between us - and allows us to discover ways we are similar and different from others, as well as helping us all develop greater resilience. ""Plus, of course, storytelling is at the heart of the BBC. ""So it feels exciting and fitting to be rolling out the project to schools across all four nations to mark the BBC's centenary."" Throughout 2022 more than 100 student stories will be featured across the BBC via BBC Young Reporter. As part of the centenary celebrations, the entire digitised BBC broadcast archive is being made available to students in formal education in the UK. The millions of TV and radio programmes - from Planet Earth and Tomorrow's World to BBC Radio 4's The History of the World in 100 Objects - include interviews and features with almost every major cultural, artistic, political and sporting figure of the last century, as well as influential dramas and landmark comedy programmes.

"More than Â£4m on average was stolen by fraudsters every day in the UK during the first half of the year as losses skyrocketed during the pandemic. Fraud committed when individuals are tricked into handing over money and personal details surged by 71% compared with the first six months of last year. Less than half of the money lost in these cases was refunded by banks. Banking trade body UK Finance said teenage criminals buying fraud kits online were among the con-artists. The influencers promoting online scams Delivery text scams and how to deal with them In total, Â£754m was stolen through fraud in the first half of the year, an increase of 30% compared with the same period last year. Within this total, so-called authorised push payment (APP) fraud - when victims think they are paying a genuine organisation - rose by 71% to Â£355m. Those scams can range from fake delivery texts asking for payment, which were common during the pandemic, to higher-value losses when fraudsters pretend to be solicitors during a house purchase. APP fraud losses have now outstripped fraud losses on bank and credit cards for the first time.Impersonation scamsmore than doubled (up 123%), investment scams rose by 95% and romance scams were up 62%. Negotiations between banks to create a permanent, central pot of money to refund these scam victims collapsed earlier this year. Katy Worobec, managing director of economic crime at UK Finance, said: ""We are calling for coordinated action and increased efforts from government and other sectors to tackle what is now a national security threat."" Rudy is worried about being able to pay his rent after his money was stolen Rudy D'Souza, aged 18, lost the Â£700 left over from his government-backedChild Trust Fundto fraudsters. ""This money was the most important money I could have had,"" he said. ""I'd just moved out and got a new job. But my pay is due after my rent, so I felt really tense and like an idiot for falling for this scam. ""I never even heard of push payment fraud until I became a victim."" Read Rudy's full story Banks and police have discovered that fraudsters range from organised criminals to teenage thieves without any previous convictions operating in their bedrooms. Children as young as 14 have been hired as money mules to launder stolen funds. Cryptocurrency wallets have also been used to shift money out of sight of the authorities, UK Finance said. It estimated that 70% of fraud originated via online platforms, including social media, and technology bosses are being questioned by MPs on the Treasury Committee later about their efforts to prevent economic crime. Ms Worobec said that co-ordination was needed between banks and a range of technology providers to tackle the issue, as well as raising awareness among consumers. However, the banks' and police's own efforts in stopping the rising tide of fraud will also come under the microscope, with ministers promising an overhaul in the fight against fraud.

"Health Secretary Humza Yousaf says he is ""working urgently"" to free up bed space in Scotland's NHS. The Scottish government has enlisted the help of the Army, fire service, British Red Cross and taxi firms to ease pressure on the ambulance service. Mr Yousaf told BBC Scotland that efforts are also under way to move more people into social care. Nursing and social care groups say more help is needed - and that reintroducing some restrictions should be considered. Donald Macaskill, the chief executive of Scottish Care, which represents care homes in Scotland, claimed his sector was in ""dire straits"" and needed an ""emergency intervention"". Soldiers to drive ambulances from this weekend What is being done to ease the ambulance 'crisis'? NHS needs 1,000 more hospital beds say A&E doctors He added: ""With all the focus on the NHS the crisis in the care system has gone largely unnoticed. ""This is an ecosystem. To free up capacity in hospitals, you have to attend to social care. The NHS will collapse next week if social care collapses today. ""We need an immediate injection of cash into the sector. If we can increase the salary of lorry drivers we should be able to do it for frontline social care workers who fought their way through this pandemic."" The warning comes as the Royal College of Nursing Scotland said ministers need to consider reintroducing Covid restrictions in order to alleviate the pressure on the NHS. Norman Provan, the trade union's associate director, said: ""The government have to consider whether further restrictions have to be put back in place. ""I know that that is really unpopular with the general public, who are just beginning to think that things are getting back to normal, but it's not for people who work providing care. ""It is absolutely desperate out there and if their relatives were seeking care just now they would approach that quite differently."" Soldiers will be drafted in to drive ambulances from this weekend following reports that some patients have faced very long waits for emergency help to arrive. They include a pensioner who died in Glasgow after having to wait 40 hours for an ambulance, and an86-year-old womanwho had to lie on her kitchen for eight hours after falling and breaking her hip. In some cases the problem is caused byambulances queuing for hoursbefore being are able to hand over their patients to accident and emergency, due to the volume of patients in the hospital. The health secretary told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandhe was aware a ""whole systems approach"" was required address the current problems. He said: ""I can give absolute assurance that we are working urgently, and hopefully I can give some detail of this very imminently, in terms of a winter plan to free up beds back into social care. ""We know that there's about 1,500 people who are delayed discharge - they're clinically safe to discharge from hospital - but a portion of them don't have a care package in their local communities and we're working really hard to quickly try to resolve that to free up bed space."" Mr Yousaf described the situation as ""the biggest crisis that anybody has ever faced in our lifetime and certainly in the NHS' existence"". Just over 100 military personnel will be brought in to help the ambulance service He refused to rule out setting up field hospitals to cope with patient numbers but stressed they would present challenges. ""The difficulty is you could easily set up beds - we have beds and equipment to do that - what we don't have is the workforce,"" the health secretary added. ""And the Army don't have a huge pool of doctors that are just sitting there not doing anything. In fact the full-time doctors are very much based in the NHS and then if they have to go to deployment in armed service they get permission from the NHS to go and join army personnel overseas."" Mr Yousaf added: ""I definitely wouldn't rule it out entirely but we have to look at whether or not we would end up pulling people out of acute sites at the moment to staff those beds."" The Scottish government also said it was continuing to work with health and social care partnerships to provide support around the current challenges facing the sector. Dr Daniel Beckett, of the Society for Acute Medicine, said many patients could not leave hospital as they do not have a package of care in place. The acute care consultant said the main challenge was not Covid patients, who are generally younger and unvaccinated, but those suffering from conditions such as cancer, heart disease and diabetes. ""The numbers of patients that are coming through the front door and being admitted into acute medical units are high, certainly high even for winter, and much higher than we would expect at this time of year,"" Dr Beckett said. ""And those patients are sicker and more complex than normal and that's as a result of chronic disease management being different over the past 18 months."" Dr Beckett added patients are spending longer in hospital as a result and when they are medically fit for discharge, staff are struggling to access packages of care.

"Covishield has been added to the UK's list of recognised vaccines, recipients of which are able to enter the country without isolating from next month But its still unclear whether Indian travellers or those from African countries, including Kenya, which use also Covishield, will avoid the need to isolate They are not listed among the countries whose citizens will be recognised as vaccinated by the UK even if they have had two doses However, the United Arab Emirates has been added to this list this morning, so travellers from there will not have to isolate in the UK Global cases fell significantly to 3.6 million last week from 4 million the week before, WHO reports Brazil's health minister has tested positive for Covid-19, after attending the UN General Assembly in New York Pret A Manger aims to hire 3,000 staff by the end of 2022 after cutting the same number of jobs last year Edited by Martha Buckley Speaking of new UK data, there's good news on the latest hospital figures, which are the lowest in six weeks. The total patient count for people in hospital with Covid has also been updated and stood at 7,567 yesterday - the lowest figure for 18 days.  It was above 8,000 every day last week. The numbers in ventilator beds have also fallen. After being above 1,000 throughout September they now stand at 943, after falling in recent days. The government has reported 34,460 new coronavirus cases in figures released today. A further 166 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test were also reported. The case figures are a jump from the 31,564 new cases recorded yesterday, though deaths fell from 203 on Tuesday. As we reported earlier, there are protests in India as it has not been added to the list of countries where people fully jabbed with an approved vaccine can avoid having to isolate if they want to travel to the UK. Many other countries are affected after the UK government clarified the jab widely distributed by Covax - Covishield - was an approved vaccine but arrivals from some places were not added to the exempt-from-quarantine list. Covishield is the Indian-made AstraZeneca jab and identical to the one used in the UK. The Kenyan and British governments say they are working on a system to recognise Covid vaccine certificates issued in both countries, to facilitate travel between them. Under the UK's new rules effective from 4 October, fully vaccinated people from countries that are not on the red list will be exempt from the compulsory quarantine. But despite being removed from the UK's red list, Kenyans intending to travel there will still have to take a test three days before travelling, quarantine for 10 days on arrival, as well as pay for Covid tests while in isolation. People from other African countries that remain on the UK red list have also criticised the new travel rules saying they are discriminatory.

Razia IqbalPresenter, Newshour, BBC World Service We told you earlier about a llama named Fifi and her ""nanobodies"" which are showing ""significant potential"" in Covid therapy trials. Prof James Naismith is director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute in Oxford, which has been doing this research. I asked him, Why llamas? This video can not be played Germany's health minister has announced that, from 1 November, Germans will no longer receive compensation for lost pay if they are unvaccinated and forced to quarantine. The government has been helping to pay workers sent into quarantine after being in contact with an infected person or returning from a ""high risk"" area abroad. But minister Jens Spahn says this support will be withdrawn, in an effort to encourage more people to get the jab. Getting vaccinated will remain a ""personal decision"", he says, but that decision will now ""also come with the responsibility to bear the financial consequences"". ""Some people will say this means pressure for the unvaccinated. I think we have to look at it the other way around - it is also a question of fairness,"" he added. More than 60% of Germany's population have been fully vaccinated, according to official data. While compulsory vaccination has been ruled out by the government, many German states have introduced restrictions for unvaccinated residents in public places. Those who've had their jabs are no longer required to quarantine. US officials have announced announced that all staff at San Francisco International Airport must be fully vaccinated to carry on working. In a statement on Tuesday, airport authorities and city mayor London Breed said the mandate was the first of its kind in the US, and would take effect immediately. âAs SFO prepares for the upcoming holiday travel season and the return of pre-pandemic passenger levels, we have an obligation to provide a safe airport facility for the traveling public and our on-site employees,"" said airport director Ivar Satero. Under the new rules, every airport tenant or contractor must ensure their on-site staff are fully vaccinated. Employees can be granted exemptions based on ""either medical disability or sincerely held religious belief"". The airport offers free vaccines at an on-site medical centre. The announcement has been welcomed by one local workers' union that represents several food and beverage staff at the airport. Speaking to the San Francisco Chronicle, Anand Singh, president of Unite Here Local 2, which represents several food and beverage workers at the airport, said: ""Our union is working with employers to ensure fair implementation because vaccines are critical to keeping workers safe and building a recovery where everyone comes back stronger.""

Deputy chief medical officer for England Professor Jonathan Van-Tam tells the Education Committee the dominant Delta variant is 60% more infectious than the Alpha variant, so it is really quite likely that teenagers will be infected at some point. He adds that he has in mind particularly the impact of being ill at a time not of their choosing, such as around their GCSEs. ""Because the Delta variant is so infectious we're not looking at a theoretical risk of children 12 to 17 becoming infected. I think it is really quite inevitable that they will be so at some point."" England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty and his deputy Jonathan Van-Tam are answering questions from the Education Committee. Prof Whitty says children are currently driving the spread of the virus, with ""substantial transmission"" in children. The 12-17 age group is the highest transmission group ""as far as we can tell"", he says. All children in that age group are due to be offered a Covid-19 vaccine - a decision Whitty insists has not been
made for political reasons or for the benefit of more vulnerable
adults. Asked about vaccination he says the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) and the chief medical officers agree the risk to children from Covid is small and the risk of vaccination is small. But he says it is the view of the JCVI that the benefits of vaccinating them are marginally greater than the potential for harm. He adds that vaccinating children would help prevent disruption in schools. ""The great majority of children who have not currently had
Covid are going to get it at some point,"" he says. ""It won't be necessary in the next two or three months but
they will get it sooner or later because this is incredibly
infectious... vaccination will reduce that risk."" Boris Johnson is in New York for the UN General Assembly No 10 says Boris Johnson is fully vaccinated - after being asked whether the prime minister had taken any extra precautions since coming into contact with a positive coronavirus case at the United Nations general assembly (UNGA). According to reports, Brazil's health minister Marcelo Queiroga has tested positive for Covid and gone into isolation, only 24 hours after being filmed shaking hands with Johnson in New York on Monday. Asked whether the prime minister had taken a Covid test since Queiroga's result, a spokesman for the prime minister says there are ""strict"" Covid measures in place at UNGA ""which the prime minister will obviously adhere to"". ""As you know he is double jabbed,"" he adds. An unvaccinated former councillor who became seriously ill with Covidfeared his mother would die after she caught the virus from him. Andrew Girvan, 48, was infected at the start of August and within a week 19 family members had the virus, including his grandparents and six-year-old daughter. He says he was given a 50/50 chance of survival and his mother was put on a ventilator,the Belfast Telegraph reports,external. ""It was without a doubt that it was me who gave it to her,"" the former Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) councillor tells BBC Radio Ulster's The Nolan Show. ""I was lying in bed in hospital and she was in the other hospital and she looked a lot worse than I was. ""To think that you've given your mum something that could eventually kill her isn't a nice place to be."" He says ""procrastination"" got in the way of getting his jab. As we've heard a bit earlier today, PCR tests for fully
vaccinated travellers arriving in the UK will be replaced by lateral flow
tests undernew foreign travel rules. But a leading immunologist says it is ""critical"" that the government ensures at-home testing is overseen by professional and any positive tests are screened for variants of concern. Professor Denis Kinane, immunologist and founding scientist at Cignpost Diagnostics, says: âIf we are to use lateral flow, letâs make it as robust as we can, which means
the swabbing should be administered by a capable agent and the authenticity of
the individual being tested should be verified. ""Any positives picked up in this
way should be reported to PHE and the individual retested and genomically
sequenced by the NHS.  
âLateral flow tests can also be performed at home but observed online by a
medical professional. ""This would ensure that the test is conducted correctly
and that the person being tested is who they say they are. ""The government
has to reduce spread and new variants coming into the UK and if lateral flow
tests are used, they need to be performed authentically.â A group representing nightclubs is launching a legal challenge to the Scottish government's plans for vaccine passports. From October, people will need proof they have had two doses of vaccine to enter certain venues and large events. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says the scheme will help reduce transmission of the virus and keep clubs open. But the Night Time Industries Association Scotland says there are ""serious flaws"" with the plans. The government's definition of a nightclub is a venue which is open between midnight and 05:00, serves alcohol, and which has a designated area for dancing and provides live or recorded music for this purpose. However, industry groups have voiced concerns that the definition could also cover arange of other hospitality venues, including bars, pubs and hotel function rooms. As policy makers look for creative ways to encourage people to get their vaccines, Romania's government has announced a new vaccination lottery. Any fully-vaccinated residents with an EU digital Covid certificate can enter the scheme, which is running from 1 October until the end of the year. A total of 19 draws will be made during the period, with 1,139 prizes totalling 15m Romanian leu ($3.6m; Â£2.6m). Dozens of other weekly prizes will also be given out, some up to 500,000 Romanian leu (Â£118,433; Â£86,825). Funding for the lottery will be given by Romania's economic ministry. âIn this epidemiological context, with significant increases in the number of people infected with Covid-19, it is important to support the vaccination process, including by granting rewards,â said Cseke Attila, Romania's interim health minister,in a statement on Monday.,external Authorities are struggling with vaccine hesitancy in the eastern European country. Just over a quarter of eligible citizens have been fully vaccinated - one of the lowest rates in the EU. Officials have blamed the low pick-up on logistical issues, and a general mistrust of medicine, made worse by online fake news. Hello and thanks for following our rolling coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. If you're just joining us, here are some of the biggest developments:  The World Health Organisation says that the global number of Covid-19 cases continued to fall last week. In its latest update,external, the UN health body said 3.6 million new cases were reported last week, down from 4 million the week before. It's the first substantial drop in over two months, with infections falling in every region of the world. There were major decreases in two regions especially: the Middle East, with a 22% fall, and a 16% drop in south east Asia. Most cases were reported in the US, the UK, India, Turkey and the Philippines. Global coronavirus-related deaths also declined 7% to just under 60,000. The WHO has revised its list of ""variants of interest"" and said it is tracking Lamba and Mu variants. Both have a Latin American origin, but haven't yet caused widespread epidemics. Meanwhile the Delta variant has spread to 185 countries. We've got a bit more detail now on Transport Secretary Grant Shapps's comments to the Transport Committee. Earlier, he said the government was working as ""quickly as possible"" to remove PCR Covid testing for international travellers and to replacethe PCR test taken two days after arrival with a cheaper and simpler lateral flow test. The expense of paying for private PCR testing is widely blamed for discouraging people from travelling abroad - withmost private providers charging above Â£60 for PCR tests and Â£30 for lateral flow tests. The government has warned more than 80 providers over misleading prices. Asked why the switch from PCR to lateral flow tests for arrivals into England would not happen until the end of October, Shapps said it would take several weeks to implement because private testing firms did not have enough lateral flow tests to meet demand. âThis is a Department of Health [and Social Care] responsibility rather than mine, but my understanding is that the ramp up of supply of lateral flow through the private testing sector has some way to go in as much as they have been almost entirely involved in providing PCRs currently,â he says. When questioned by Ben Bradshaw MP about why this was an issue as many test providers also offered lateral flow tests, Shapps responded that he thought it was a question of scale. âWe go from a situation where they are providing low number of thousands to probably millions of tests very quickly and need a few weeks to scale up on it,â he said. The transport secretary could not provide a more specific date for the switch but said his Department of Health colleagues were aware of the upcoming October half-term school holidays and understood the speed required to bring in the changes. Scottish tourism bodies are worried that visitors from overseas will be put off by the Covid-testing requirements Scotland's next tourism season is at ""serious risk"" becauserigorous Covid-testing requirements are being retainedfor international visitors, industry leaders have claimed. Visitor testing rules arebeing relaxed in Englandbut the Scottish government has raised health concerns. The Scottish Tourism Alliance claims the divergence is harming its industry. The Scottish government said it would be guided by clinical advice as well as economic implications. The Scottish Tourism Alliance has put its name to an open letter signed by more than 40 tourism businesses calling for an urgent meeting with the Scottish government. SinceCovid restrictions lifted in England on 19 July, people have been told they no longer have to work from home. However, there have been warnings that this could change if there is a surge in coronavirus cases this winter. Staff in the rest of the UK are still advised to remain at home where possible. The government'sCovid Autumn and Winter Plan for England,externalhas two proposals. Much ofPlan Afocuses onthe vaccine rollout: But if the NHS struggles,Plan B(or parts of it) could start - including advice to work from home again for ""a limited period"". Some businesses - but not all - have embraced the remote-working model seen during the pandemic, with some firms putting in place hybrid working arrangements that would see employees work part of the week from home. Other companies have said they want workers to return to the office or workplace full-time. You can ask to continue to work from home by making a flexible working request, but employers don't have to agree, even if you've worked from home throughout the pandemic. The government is expected to launch a consultation shortly onproposals to give all employees the right to request flexible working as soon as they start a job. At the moment, workers have to wait for six months. You can read morehere.

Officials said some sites would be shut for up to two weeks after construction workers and other protesters clashed. Property was damaged and police said several people were arrested. Hundreds gathered in Melbourne for another anti-vaccination protest on Tuesday, setting off flares and reportedly throwing urine at reporters.

"Covishield has been added to the UK's list of recognised vaccines, recipients of which are able to enter the country without isolating from next month But its still unclear whether Indian travellers or those from African countries, including Kenya, which use also Covishield, will avoid the need to isolate They are not listed among the countries whose citizens will be recognised as vaccinated by the UK even if they have had two doses However, the United Arab Emirates has been added to this list this morning, so travellers from there will not have to isolate in the UK Global cases fell significantly to 3.6 million last week from 4 million the week before, WHO reports Brazil's health minister has tested positive for Covid-19, after attending the UN General Assembly in New York Pret A Manger aims to hire 3,000 staff by the end of 2022 after cutting the same number of jobs last year Edited by Martha Buckley Speaking of new UK data, there's good news on the latest hospital figures, which are the lowest in six weeks. The total patient count for people in hospital with Covid has also been updated and stood at 7,567 yesterday - the lowest figure for 18 days.  It was above 8,000 every day last week. The numbers in ventilator beds have also fallen. After being above 1,000 throughout September they now stand at 943, after falling in recent days. The government has reported 34,460 new coronavirus cases in figures released today. A further 166 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test were also reported. The case figures are a jump from the 31,564 new cases recorded yesterday, though deaths fell from 203 on Tuesday. As we reported earlier, there are protests in India as it has not been added to the list of countries where people fully jabbed with an approved vaccine can avoid having to isolate if they want to travel to the UK. Many other countries are affected after the UK government clarified the jab widely distributed by Covax - Covishield - was an approved vaccine but arrivals from some places were not added to the exempt-from-quarantine list. Covishield is the Indian-made AstraZeneca jab and identical to the one used in the UK. The Kenyan and British governments say they are working on a system to recognise Covid vaccine certificates issued in both countries, to facilitate travel between them. Under the UK's new rules effective from 4 October, fully vaccinated people from countries that are not on the red list will be exempt from the compulsory quarantine. But despite being removed from the UK's red list, Kenyans intending to travel there will still have to take a test three days before travelling, quarantine for 10 days on arrival, as well as pay for Covid tests while in isolation. People from other African countries that remain on the UK red list have also criticised the new travel rules saying they are discriminatory.

Razia IqbalPresenter, Newshour, BBC World Service We told you earlier about a llama named Fifi and her ""nanobodies"" which are showing ""significant potential"" in Covid therapy trials. Prof James Naismith is director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute in Oxford, which has been doing this research. I asked him, Why llamas? This video can not be played Germany's health minister has announced that, from 1 November, Germans will no longer receive compensation for lost pay if they are unvaccinated and forced to quarantine. The government has been helping to pay workers sent into quarantine after being in contact with an infected person or returning from a ""high risk"" area abroad. But minister Jens Spahn says this support will be withdrawn, in an effort to encourage more people to get the jab. Getting vaccinated will remain a ""personal decision"", he says, but that decision will now ""also come with the responsibility to bear the financial consequences"". ""Some people will say this means pressure for the unvaccinated. I think we have to look at it the other way around - it is also a question of fairness,"" he added. More than 60% of Germany's population have been fully vaccinated, according to official data. While compulsory vaccination has been ruled out by the government, many German states have introduced restrictions for unvaccinated residents in public places. Those who've had their jabs are no longer required to quarantine. US officials have announced announced that all staff at San Francisco International Airport must be fully vaccinated to carry on working. In a statement on Tuesday, airport authorities and city mayor London Breed said the mandate was the first of its kind in the US, and would take effect immediately. âAs SFO prepares for the upcoming holiday travel season and the return of pre-pandemic passenger levels, we have an obligation to provide a safe airport facility for the traveling public and our on-site employees,"" said airport director Ivar Satero. Under the new rules, every airport tenant or contractor must ensure their on-site staff are fully vaccinated. Employees can be granted exemptions based on ""either medical disability or sincerely held religious belief"". The airport offers free vaccines at an on-site medical centre. The announcement has been welcomed by one local workers' union that represents several food and beverage staff at the airport. Speaking to the San Francisco Chronicle, Anand Singh, president of Unite Here Local 2, which represents several food and beverage workers at the airport, said: ""Our union is working with employers to ensure fair implementation because vaccines are critical to keeping workers safe and building a recovery where everyone comes back stronger."" BBC Storyteller Chanise Evans tells her story Some 250,000 school pupils will be supported to tell their own stories in a BBC scheme to help recovery from the pandemic. The BBC 100 Share Your Story project will see BBC stars and staff visiting secondary schools across the UK to improve students' well-being and story-telling skills. Director general Tim Davie said the BBC had supported ""an entire nation of home learners during the coronavirus pandemic"". He says: ""In 2022 - our centenary year - we will harness the unique power of the BBC to provide educational support to inspire millions of children and students across the UK."" Pupils will be supported to tell their own stories in class, in the form of a poem, a rap, a film or a speech. BBC hosts will then conduct a series of interactive assemblies in whichBBC stars and staff reveal how they have overcome challengesin their own lives. Deputy chief medical officer for England Professor Jonathan Van-Tam tells the Education Committee the dominant Delta variant is 60% more infectious than the Alpha variant, so it is really quite likely that teenagers will be infected at some point. He adds that he has in mind particularly the impact of being ill at a time not of their choosing, such as around their GCSEs. ""Because the Delta variant is so infectious we're not looking at a theoretical risk of children 12 to 17 becoming infected. I think it is really quite inevitable that they will be so at some point."" England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty and his deputy Jonathan Van-Tam are answering questions from the Education Committee. Prof Whitty says children are currently driving the spread of the virus, with ""substantial transmission"" in children. The 12-17 age group is the highest transmission group ""as far as we can tell"", he says. All children in that age group are due to be offered a Covid-19 vaccine - a decision Whitty insists has not been
made for political reasons or for the benefit of more vulnerable
adults. Asked about vaccination he says the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) and the chief medical officers agree the risk to children from Covid is small and the risk of vaccination is small. But he says it is the view of the JCVI that the benefits of vaccinating them are marginally greater than the potential for harm. He adds that vaccinating children would help prevent disruption in schools. ""The great majority of children who have not currently had
Covid are going to get it at some point,"" he says. ""It won't be necessary in the next two or three months but

"Newly appointed Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab takes questions in Boris Johnson's place at today's PMQs Labour's deputy party leader Angela Rayner pressed him on rising prices as she stood in for Keir Starmer Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng is appearing before a committee of MPs considering issues raised by rising gas prices He says protecting consumers from ""exorbitant prices"" is a priority, but the industry must step up to keep prices down He says companies should look at their own management, rather than ""stretch out a hand for taxpayers' money"" Jonathan Brearley from Ofgem says hundreds of thousands of customers may be left in limbo if more energy suppliers go bust The government has agreed to pay millions in operating costs for a factory to restart the production of CO2 - vital for fresh food supply CF industries halted production at two of its factories because of soaring gas prices Edited by Johanna Howitt That's where we end our coverage from Westminster for today. Our writers were Arryn Moy, Doug Falconer, Emma Owen, Kate Whannel, and Sinead Wilson. The next PMQs will be on Wednesday 20 October - as Parliament goes in to a three-week recess to make way for the political party conference season. Do join us then. Adam FlemingChief political correspondent That PMQs felt different - that is partly down to Angela Rayner's presentation style in the House of Commons. Let's be honest, she is much funnier than Keir Starmer. And I hope Dominic Raab had a good time on his holiday in Crete because that holiday is going to potentially follow him around for the rest of his political career. On the serious stuff, we are getting quite use to the battle lines between the parties. Labour is talking about the increase in energy bills, the removal of the Â£20 a week rise to universal credit, then from next April the rise in National Insurance to pay for the health and social care levy. Labour are bundling all that together saying there is going to be a cost of living crisis. The government is responding by saying we are protecting you with the energy price cap and when it comes to jobs and wages, the economy is booming for some people. Both those things might be true at the same time, but by the end of the winter which one of those narratives will have won out? Dominic Raab and Angela Rayner deputised for Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer for today's PMQs: Reality Check At Deputy Prime Ministerâs Questions, Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said to Dominic Raab: âHis government chose to cut the income of a worker on Â£18,000 a year by over Â£1,100.â She gave the example of a shop worker. To get to this figure, Â£1,040 would come from the loss of the Â£20 a week increase to universal credit. And from next April, a worker earning Â£18,000 a year would be paying an extra Â£105 in National Insurance â as part of the rise in the rate of NI to help fund health and social care announced by the government.

Dharshini DavidEconomics Correspondent Prime Minister Boris Johnson meets US President Joe Biden in the Oval Office of the White House Brexit gave the
UK the freedom to strike its own trade deals - and accounting for Â£1 in every
Â£6 of British trade, a pact with the US was the ultimate prize. But Whitehall
officials have for months been scrabbling for an alternative after the Biden
administration indicated it was in no hurry to resume talks. Joining theUnited States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)could give the UK deeper benefits on some goods and digital trade with North
American economies. But it has
limited coverage of what is the UK's biggest strength when it comes to
selling to America, namely services. Economists say the overall gains from
joining USMCA may be very limited, perhaps less than 0.1% of GDP And what would
the price be? The UK already has deals with Canada and Mexico, it would have to
rely heavily on American cooperation to join this trade club - and one where
the rules have already been set, and hasnât allowed for new members. America's price
of admission may include a hurdle already encountered: standards surrounding
food and agricultural goods For President
Biden is explicit that his priority is US workers, not least its farmers. He is also clear
that domestic issues take precedence. Even if the UK does want to sign up to
USMCA, it may still be at the back of a queue - simply to get its application
considered. Reality Check Responding to criticism from Labour that the prime minister had made ""zero progress"" in securing aUK-US free trade dealon his trip to the US, Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab said: âBecause of the engagement weâve had with the US, they have immediately given us the boost to trade and businesses by reinstating travel from the UK to the US.â Itâs true that President Biden announced this change yesterday but it wasnât just for the UK. The resumption oftravel into the US from Novemberis applies to fully vaccinated people from 33 countries. They include China, India, Brazil and most of the European Union (countries in its passport-free Schengen area). Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng also admitted that the recent
crisis in CO2 supply came as a surprise to ""a lot of people"". âWith regards to the CO2 situation, it was abundant it was very
cheap and I think a lot of people were surprised at what happened,"" he told the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee. ""We very rapidly dealt with
that situation I met with the CEO of the relevant company twice - on Sunday and
again on Monday, once each - and we have come up with a solution, which I have to
stress is very much something that is a short term support. ""There is no question of us essentially writing a cheque to
this company indefinitely."" Asked about the three-week limit on support for CF Fertilisers he says in a critical intervention you have to have a way of exiting that arrangement. ""It's not a case of just trying to nationalise it or supporting it indefinitely."" He adds: ""I'm confident that we can get other sources of CO2 in that period, there was an immediate crisis and the deal that we reached solved the immediate problem."" Down the corridor during PMQs, the Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng was still answering questions from the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee. He told the MPs that while he did not predict that gas prices ""would quadruple four times in five months"" the government does have structures in place to deal with ""extreme situations"". ""Now those structures are going to be tested and thatâs why
we are here, and thatâs why we are talking about possible contingency plansâ¦.but
I reject the idea that somehow this was completely unexpected and that we were
completely unprepared,"" he says. He adds it is ""unfair to say this somehow just happened and we were completely at sea"", but he does say there were other elements - such as the CO2 shortage - which were more novel.

Pete SaullPolitical Correspondent, BBC Westminster While the
green benches werenât as full as they usually are on a Wednesday lunchtime, the
head-to-head between the two deputies was a lively affair. Labourâs Angela Rayner is a
straight-talker - and her lines of attack prompted laughter on both sides of the
House. The Conservatives guffawed at
the suggestion that their party âdoes not careâ about working people. Rayner asked how many days someone on a low income would have to work
to pay for a luxury holiday in Crete. The former foreign secretary
faced criticism last month, when he stayed on holiday as the Taliban took control of
Afghanistan. But facing questions about
rising gas prices and the end to the universal credit uplift, he insisted that
the governmentâs plan to increase employment and wages was working. The debate about the cost of
living is likely to be a major feature of our politics as we head into the
autumn and winter. Todayâs 'deputy' PMQs was a chance to
rehearse the arguments before the parties head off for their respective
conferences. The final question comes from Labour MP Anna McMorrin. She asks Dominic Raab - who is justice secretary as well as deputy prime minister - if he will deliver a Victimsâ Bill. Raab says looked at plans ""on day one"" in his new post. He lists investments the government has made and says Labour voted against the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill. He says: ""You can't stand up for victims unless you stand up for tough sentencing"", he says. And that's it for today's deputy PMQs. Conservative MP Derek Thomas says he and fellow Cornish MPs want the seasonal agricultural workers visa scheme urgently renewed for next year - which he says would cover 30,000 people. Dominic Raab says the home secretary is being lobbied from ""various quarters"" and is very mindful of the impact of seasonal workers. He says the government will ""get the right balance"". Labour's George Howarth, who's just returned from illness, says ""town halls know better than Whitehall"" when it comes to levelling up. He wants to know if the PM will host a cross-party summit in Downing Street with local government representatives and mayors to discuss how they can be empowered to unlock potential? Raab welcomes him back and says the agenda for levelling up has got to be a team effort with central and local government and mayors all involved. He says he supports the spirit of the question and will do everything he can to work with him. DUP's Carla Lockhart attacks what she calls the ""ill-informed and partisan comments"" from the US President. During a meeting with Boris Johnson, Joe Bidenwarned that peacein Northern Ireland must not be jeopardised as a result of complications caused by Brexit. She argues that ""far from defending the Belfast agreement, the Northern Ireland Protocol is the single greatest danger to the Northern Ireland institutions"". ""A solution that restores Northern Ireland's place in the UK's internal markets is the only way to avert the collapse of the institutions,"" she says adding ""a solution must be found in weeks rather than months."" Dominic Raab replies that there needs to be ""a smart, pragmatic approach"" and tells MPs that ""the president understands our view."" Conservative Dehenna Davison says much of the reason why she is standing in the chamber as an MP is to do withthe death of her father from a single-punch assault. He is just one of many victims she says, and why she is marking ""one punch awareness week"". Will Raab lend his support she asks by joining her immediately after PMQs as supporters gather in Westminster Hall? Raab says he knows how much the campaign means to her personally and ""of course"" he will join her. Labour's Barry Sheerman notes that the deputy prime minister represents one of the wealthiest constituencies in the country (that's Esher and Walton in Surrey). He asks if he ""really"" believes in levelling-up and the redistribution of wealth in the country. He also seeks assurances that Channel 4 will stay in Leeds and in the public sector. Dominic Raab replies that the levelling up agenda is not just about helping the Midlands and the north of England. He says London and the south-east will also benefit because pressure on resources will be eased. SNP's Deidre Brock asks exactly what does the UK government have against the Scottish government requiring real living wages for Scottish workers  and net zero obligations in its green ports? Raab says net zero is ""at the heart of everything we do"". He says ministers have increased the national living wage to say the full-time worker Â£400 a year. The SNP Westminster deputy leader
calls for an âemergency energy paymentâ to help people on lower pay. Kirsten Oswald blames a âtoxic combinationâ of cuts, tax rises and the âgrowing cost of Brexitâ. She claims energy bills could
âskyrocketâ by Â£550 per household. Deputy PM Dominic Raab says several issues she raises were devolved to the Scottish government and he lists a
series of financial help to lower paid families. She says his answer was âdisappointing
and perplexingâ and adds that âwarm words donât heat homesâ. He calls on her to ""stop this scaremongering"".  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Health Secretary Humza Yousaf says he is ""working urgently"" to free up bed space in Scotland's NHS. The Scottish government has enlisted the help of the Army, fire service, British Red Cross and taxi firms to ease pressure on the ambulance service. Mr Yousaf told BBC Scotland that efforts are also under way to move more people into social care. Nursing and social care groups say more help is needed - and that reintroducing some restrictions should be considered. Donald Macaskill, the chief executive of Scottish Care, which represents care homes in Scotland, claimed his sector was in ""dire straits"" and needed an ""emergency intervention"". Soldiers to drive ambulances from this weekend What is being done to ease the ambulance 'crisis'? NHS needs 1,000 more hospital beds say A&E doctors He added: ""With all the focus on the NHS the crisis in the care system has gone largely unnoticed. ""This is an ecosystem. To free up capacity in hospitals, you have to attend to social care. The NHS will collapse next week if social care collapses today. ""We need an immediate injection of cash into the sector. If we can increase the salary of lorry drivers we should be able to do it for frontline social care workers who fought their way through this pandemic."" The warning comes as the Royal College of Nursing Scotland said ministers need to consider reintroducing Covid restrictions in order to alleviate the pressure on the NHS. Norman Provan, the trade union's associate director, said: ""The government have to consider whether further restrictions have to be put back in place. ""I know that that is really unpopular with the general public, who are just beginning to think that things are getting back to normal, but it's not for people who work providing care. ""It is absolutely desperate out there and if their relatives were seeking care just now they would approach that quite differently."" Soldiers will be drafted in to drive ambulances from this weekend following reports that some patients have faced very long waits for emergency help to arrive. They include a pensioner who died in Glasgow after having to wait 40 hours for an ambulance, and an86-year-old womanwho had to lie on her kitchen for eight hours after falling and breaking her hip. In some cases the problem is caused byambulances queuing for hoursbefore being are able to hand over their patients to accident and emergency, due to the volume of patients in the hospital. The health secretary told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandhe was aware a ""whole systems approach"" was required address the current problems. He said: ""I can give absolute assurance that we are working urgently, and hopefully I can give some detail of this very imminently, in terms of a winter plan to free up beds back into social care. ""We know that there's about 1,500 people who are delayed discharge - they're clinically safe to discharge from hospital - but a portion of them don't have a care package in their local communities and we're working really hard to quickly try to resolve that to free up bed space."" Mr Yousaf described the situation as ""the biggest crisis that anybody has ever faced in our lifetime and certainly in the NHS' existence"". Just over 100 military personnel will be brought in to help the ambulance service He refused to rule out setting up field hospitals to cope with patient numbers but stressed they would present challenges. ""The difficulty is you could easily set up beds - we have beds and equipment to do that - what we don't have is the workforce,"" the health secretary added. ""And the Army don't have a huge pool of doctors that are just sitting there not doing anything. In fact the full-time doctors are very much based in the NHS and then if they have to go to deployment in armed service they get permission from the NHS to go and join army personnel overseas."" Mr Yousaf added: ""I definitely wouldn't rule it out entirely but we have to look at whether or not we would end up pulling people out of acute sites at the moment to staff those beds."" The Scottish government also said it was continuing to work with health and social care partnerships to provide support around the current challenges facing the sector. Dr Daniel Beckett, of the Society for Acute Medicine, said many patients could not leave hospital as they do not have a package of care in place. The acute care consultant said the main challenge was not Covid patients, who are generally younger and unvaccinated, but those suffering from conditions such as cancer, heart disease and diabetes. ""The numbers of patients that are coming through the front door and being admitted into acute medical units are high, certainly high even for winter, and much higher than we would expect at this time of year,"" Dr Beckett said. ""And those patients are sicker and more complex than normal and that's as a result of chronic disease management being different over the past 18 months."" Dr Beckett added patients are spending longer in hospital as a result and when they are medically fit for discharge, staff are struggling to access packages of care.

"Covishield has been added to the UK's list of recognised vaccines, recipients of which are able to enter the country without isolating from next month But its still unclear whether Indian travellers or those from African countries, including Kenya, which use also Covishield, will avoid the need to isolate They are not listed among the countries whose citizens will be recognised as vaccinated by the UK even if they have had two doses However, the United Arab Emirates has been added to this list this morning, so travellers from there will not have to isolate in the UK Global cases fell significantly to 3.6 million last week from 4 million the week before, WHO reports Brazil's health minister has tested positive for Covid-19, after attending the UN General Assembly in New York Pret A Manger aims to hire 3,000 staff by the end of 2022 after cutting the same number of jobs last year Edited by Martha Buckley Speaking of new UK data, there's good news on the latest hospital figures, which are the lowest in six weeks. The total patient count for people in hospital with Covid has also been updated and stood at 7,567 yesterday - the lowest figure for 18 days.  It was above 8,000 every day last week. The numbers in ventilator beds have also fallen. After being above 1,000 throughout September they now stand at 943, after falling in recent days. The government has reported 34,460 new coronavirus cases in figures released today. A further 166 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test were also reported. The case figures are a jump from the 31,564 new cases recorded yesterday, though deaths fell from 203 on Tuesday. As we reported earlier, there are protests in India as it has not been added to the list of countries where people fully jabbed with an approved vaccine can avoid having to isolate if they want to travel to the UK. Many other countries are affected after the UK government clarified the jab widely distributed by Covax - Covishield - was an approved vaccine but arrivals from some places were not added to the exempt-from-quarantine list. Covishield is the Indian-made AstraZeneca jab and identical to the one used in the UK. The Kenyan and British governments say they are working on a system to recognise Covid vaccine certificates issued in both countries, to facilitate travel between them. Under the UK's new rules effective from 4 October, fully vaccinated people from countries that are not on the red list will be exempt from the compulsory quarantine. But despite being removed from the UK's red list, Kenyans intending to travel there will still have to take a test three days before travelling, quarantine for 10 days on arrival, as well as pay for Covid tests while in isolation. People from other African countries that remain on the UK red list have also criticised the new travel rules saying they are discriminatory. Read:UK recognises Covishield jab after India outcry And find more on the rules for entering the UKhere. Razia IqbalPresenter, Newshour, BBC World Service We told you earlier about a llama named Fifi and her ""nanobodies"" which are showing ""significant potential"" in Covid therapy trials. Prof James Naismith is director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute in Oxford, which has been doing this research. I asked him, Why llamas? This video can not be played Germany's health minister has announced that, from 1 November, Germans will no longer receive compensation for lost pay if they are unvaccinated and forced to quarantine. The government has been helping to pay workers sent into quarantine after being in contact with an infected person or returning from a ""high risk"" area abroad. But minister Jens Spahn says this support will be withdrawn, in an effort to encourage more people to get the jab. Getting vaccinated will remain a ""personal decision"", he says, but that decision will now ""also come with the responsibility to bear the financial consequences"". ""Some people will say this means pressure for the unvaccinated. I think we have to look at it the other way around - it is also a question of fairness,"" he added. More than 60% of Germany's population have been fully vaccinated, according to official data. While compulsory vaccination has been ruled out by the government, many German states have introduced restrictions for unvaccinated residents in public places. Those who've had their jabs are no longer required to quarantine. US officials have announced announced that all staff at San Francisco International Airport must be fully vaccinated to carry on working. In a statement on Tuesday, airport authorities and city mayor London Breed said the mandate was the first of its kind in the US, and would take effect immediately. âAs SFO prepares for the upcoming holiday travel season and the return of pre-pandemic passenger levels, we have an obligation to provide a safe airport facility for the traveling public and our on-site employees,"" said airport director Ivar Satero. Under the new rules, every airport tenant or contractor must ensure their on-site staff are fully vaccinated. Employees can be granted exemptions based on ""either medical disability or sincerely held religious belief"". The airport offers free vaccines at an on-site medical centre. The announcement has been welcomed by one local workers' union that represents several food and beverage staff at the airport. Speaking to the San Francisco Chronicle, Anand Singh, president of Unite Here Local 2, which represents several food and beverage workers at the airport, said: ""Our union is working with employers to ensure fair implementation because vaccines are critical to keeping workers safe and building a recovery where everyone comes back stronger."" BBC Storyteller Chanise Evans tells her story Some 250,000 school pupils will be supported to tell their own stories in a BBC scheme to help recovery from the pandemic. The BBC 100 Share Your Story project will see BBC stars and staff visiting secondary schools across the UK to improve students' well-being and story-telling skills. Director general Tim Davie said the BBC had supported ""an entire nation of home learners during the coronavirus pandemic"". He says: ""In 2022 - our centenary year - we will harness the unique power of the BBC to provide educational support to inspire millions of children and students across the UK."" Pupils will be supported to tell their own stories in class, in the form of a poem, a rap, a film or a speech. BBC hosts will then conduct a series of interactive assemblies in whichBBC stars and staff reveal how they have overcome challengesin their own lives. Deputy chief medical officer for England Professor Jonathan Van-Tam tells the Education Committee the dominant Delta variant is 60% more infectious than the Alpha variant, so it is really quite likely that teenagers will be infected at some point. He adds that he has in mind particularly the impact of being ill at a time not of their choosing, such as around their GCSEs. ""Because the Delta variant is so infectious we're not looking at a theoretical risk of children 12 to 17 becoming infected. I think it is really quite inevitable that they will be so at some point."" England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty and his deputy Jonathan Van-Tam are answering questions from the Education Committee. Prof Whitty says children are currently driving the spread of the virus, with ""substantial transmission"" in children. The 12-17 age group is the highest transmission group ""as far as we can tell"", he says. All children in that age group are due to be offered a Covid-19 vaccine - a decision Whitty insists has not been
made for political reasons or for the benefit of more vulnerable
adults. Asked about vaccination he says the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) and the chief medical officers agree the risk to children from Covid is small and the risk of vaccination is small. But he says it is the view of the JCVI that the benefits of vaccinating them are marginally greater than the potential for harm. He adds that vaccinating children would help prevent disruption in schools. ""The great majority of children who have not currently had
Covid are going to get it at some point,"" he says. ""It won't be necessary in the next two or three months but
they will get it sooner or later because this is incredibly
infectious... vaccination will reduce that risk."" Boris Johnson is in New York for the UN General Assembly No 10 says Boris Johnson is fully vaccinated - after being asked whether the prime minister had taken any extra precautions since coming into contact with a positive coronavirus case at the United Nations general assembly (UNGA). According to reports, Brazil's health minister Marcelo Queiroga has tested positive for Covid and gone into isolation, only 24 hours after being filmed shaking hands with Johnson in New York on Monday. Asked whether the prime minister had taken a Covid test since Queiroga's result, a spokesman for the prime minister says there are ""strict"" Covid measures in place at UNGA ""which the prime minister will obviously adhere to"". ""As you know he is double jabbed,"" he adds. An unvaccinated former councillor who became seriously ill with Covidfeared his mother would die after she caught the virus from him. Andrew Girvan, 48, was infected at the start of August and within a week 19 family members had the virus, including his grandparents and six-year-old daughter. He says he was given a 50/50 chance of survival and his mother was put on a ventilator,the Belfast Telegraph reports,external. ""It was without a doubt that it was me who gave it to her,"" the former Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) councillor tells BBC Radio Ulster's The Nolan Show. ""I was lying in bed in hospital and she was in the other hospital and she looked a lot worse than I was. ""To think that you've given your mum something that could eventually kill her isn't a nice place to be."" He says ""procrastination"" got in the way of getting his jab. As we've heard a bit earlier today, PCR tests for fully
vaccinated travellers arriving in the UK will be replaced by lateral flow
tests undernew foreign travel rules. But a leading immunologist says it is ""critical"" that the government ensures at-home testing is overseen by professional and any positive tests are screened for variants of concern. Professor Denis Kinane, immunologist and founding scientist at Cignpost Diagnostics, says: âIf we are to use lateral flow, letâs make it as robust as we can, which means
the swabbing should be administered by a capable agent and the authenticity of
the individual being tested should be verified. ""Any positives picked up in this
way should be reported to PHE and the individual retested and genomically
sequenced by the NHS.  
âLateral flow tests can also be performed at home but observed online by a
medical professional. ""This would ensure that the test is conducted correctly
and that the person being tested is who they say they are. ""The government
has to reduce spread and new variants coming into the UK and if lateral flow
tests are used, they need to be performed authentically.â A group representing nightclubs is launching a legal challenge to the Scottish government's plans for vaccine passports. From October, people will need proof they have had two doses of vaccine to enter certain venues and large events. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says the scheme will help reduce transmission of the virus and keep clubs open. But the Night Time Industries Association Scotland says there are ""serious flaws"" with the plans. The government's definition of a nightclub is a venue which is open between midnight and 05:00, serves alcohol, and which has a designated area for dancing and provides live or recorded music for this purpose. However, industry groups have voiced concerns that the definition could also cover arange of other hospitality venues, including bars, pubs and hotel function rooms. As policy makers look for creative ways to encourage people to get their vaccines, Romania's government has announced a new vaccination lottery. Any fully-vaccinated residents with an EU digital Covid certificate can enter the scheme, which is running from 1 October until the end of the year. A total of 19 draws will be made during the period, with 1,139 prizes totalling 15m Romanian leu ($3.6m; Â£2.6m). Dozens of other weekly prizes will also be given out, some up to 500,000 Romanian leu (Â£118,433; Â£86,825). Funding for the lottery will be given by Romania's economic ministry. âIn this epidemiological context, with significant increases in the number of people infected with Covid-19, it is important to support the vaccination process, including by granting rewards,â said Cseke Attila, Romania's interim health minister,in a statement on Monday.,external Authorities are struggling with vaccine hesitancy in the eastern European country. Just over a quarter of eligible citizens have been fully vaccinated - one of the lowest rates in the EU. Officials have blamed the low pick-up on logistical issues, and a general mistrust of medicine, made worse by online fake news. Hello and thanks for following our rolling coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. If you're just joining us, here are some of the biggest developments:  The World Health Organisation says that the global number of Covid-19 cases continued to fall last week. In its latest update,external, the UN health body said 3.6 million new cases were reported last week, down from 4 million the week before. It's the first substantial drop in over two months, with infections falling in every region of the world. There were major decreases in two regions especially: the Middle East, with a 22% fall, and a 16% drop in south east Asia. Most cases were reported in the US, the UK, India, Turkey and the Philippines. Global coronavirus-related deaths also declined 7% to just under 60,000. The WHO has revised its list of ""variants of interest"" and said it is tracking Lamba and Mu variants. Both have a Latin American origin, but haven't yet caused widespread epidemics. Meanwhile the Delta variant has spread to 185 countries. We've got a bit more detail now on Transport Secretary Grant Shapps's comments to the Transport Committee. Earlier, he said the government was working as ""quickly as possible"" to remove PCR Covid testing for international travellers and to replacethe PCR test taken two days after arrival with a cheaper and simpler lateral flow test. The expense of paying for private PCR testing is widely blamed for discouraging people from travelling abroad - withmost private providers charging above Â£60 for PCR tests and Â£30 for lateral flow tests. The government has warned more than 80 providers over misleading prices. Asked why the switch from PCR to lateral flow tests for arrivals into England would not happen until the end of October, Shapps said it would take several weeks to implement because private testing firms did not have enough lateral flow tests to meet demand. âThis is a Department of Health [and Social Care] responsibility rather than mine, but my understanding is that the ramp up of supply of lateral flow through the private testing sector has some way to go in as much as they have been almost entirely involved in providing PCRs currently,â he says. When questioned by Ben Bradshaw MP about why this was an issue as many test providers also offered lateral flow tests, Shapps responded that he thought it was a question of scale. âWe go from a situation where they are providing low number of thousands to probably millions of tests very quickly and need a few weeks to scale up on it,â he said. The transport secretary could not provide a more specific date for the switch but said his Department of Health colleagues were aware of the upcoming October half-term school holidays and understood the speed required to bring in the changes. Scottish tourism bodies are worried that visitors from overseas will be put off by the Covid-testing requirements Scotland's next tourism season is at ""serious risk"" becauserigorous Covid-testing requirements are being retainedfor international visitors, industry leaders have claimed. Visitor testing rules arebeing relaxed in Englandbut the Scottish government has raised health concerns. The Scottish Tourism Alliance claims the divergence is harming its industry. The Scottish government said it would be guided by clinical advice as well as economic implications. The Scottish Tourism Alliance has put its name to an open letter signed by more than 40 tourism businesses calling for an urgent meeting with the Scottish government. SinceCovid restrictions lifted in England on 19 July, people have been told they no longer have to work from home. However, there have been warnings that this could change if there is a surge in coronavirus cases this winter. Staff in the rest of the UK are still advised to remain at home where possible. The government'sCovid Autumn and Winter Plan for England,externalhas two proposals. Much ofPlan Afocuses onthe vaccine rollout: But if the NHS struggles,Plan B(or parts of it) could start - including advice to work from home again for ""a limited period"". Some businesses - but not all - have embraced the remote-working model seen during the pandemic, with some firms putting in place hybrid working arrangements that would see employees work part of the week from home. Other companies have said they want workers to return to the office or workplace full-time. You can ask to continue to work from home by making a flexible working request, but employers don't have to agree, even if you've worked from home throughout the pandemic. The government is expected to launch a consultation shortly onproposals to give all employees the right to request flexible working as soon as they start a job. At the moment, workers have to wait for six months. You can read morehere.

Officials said some sites would be shut for up to two weeks after construction workers and other protesters clashed. Property was damaged and police said several people were arrested. Hundreds gathered in Melbourne for another anti-vaccination protest on Tuesday, setting off flares and reportedly throwing urine at reporters.

"Newly appointed Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab takes questions in Boris Johnson's place at today's PMQs Labour's deputy party leader Angela Rayner pressed him on rising prices as she stood in for Keir Starmer Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng is appearing before a committee of MPs considering issues raised by rising gas prices He says protecting consumers from ""exorbitant prices"" is a priority, but the industry must step up to keep prices down He says companies should look at their own management, rather than ""stretch out a hand for taxpayers' money"" Jonathan Brearley from Ofgem says hundreds of thousands of customers may be left in limbo if more energy suppliers go bust The government has agreed to pay millions in operating costs for a factory to restart the production of CO2 - vital for fresh food supply CF industries halted production at two of its factories because of soaring gas prices Edited by Johanna Howitt That's where we end our coverage from Westminster for today. Our writers were Arryn Moy, Doug Falconer, Emma Owen, Kate Whannel, and Sinead Wilson. The next PMQs will be on Wednesday 20 October - as Parliament goes in to a three-week recess to make way for the political party conference season. Do join us then. Adam FlemingChief political correspondent That PMQs felt different - that is partly down to Angela Rayner's presentation style in the House of Commons. Let's be honest, she is much funnier than Keir Starmer. And I hope Dominic Raab had a good time on his holiday in Crete because that holiday is going to potentially follow him around for the rest of his political career. On the serious stuff, we are getting quite use to the battle lines between the parties. Labour is talking about the increase in energy bills, the removal of the Â£20 a week rise to universal credit, then from next April the rise in National Insurance to pay for the health and social care levy. Labour are bundling all that together saying there is going to be a cost of living crisis. The government is responding by saying we are protecting you with the energy price cap and when it comes to jobs and wages, the economy is booming for some people. Both those things might be true at the same time, but by the end of the winter which one of those narratives will have won out? Dominic Raab and Angela Rayner deputised for Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer for today's PMQs: Reality Check At Deputy Prime Ministerâs Questions, Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said to Dominic Raab: âHis government chose to cut the income of a worker on Â£18,000 a year by over Â£1,100.â She gave the example of a shop worker. To get to this figure, Â£1,040 would come from the loss of the Â£20 a week increase to universal credit. And from next April, a worker earning Â£18,000 a year would be paying an extra Â£105 in National Insurance â as part of the rise in the rate of NI to help fund health and social care announced by the government.

Dharshini DavidEconomics Correspondent Prime Minister Boris Johnson meets US President Joe Biden in the Oval Office of the White House Brexit gave the
UK the freedom to strike its own trade deals - and accounting for Â£1 in every
Â£6 of British trade, a pact with the US was the ultimate prize. But Whitehall
officials have for months been scrabbling for an alternative after the Biden
administration indicated it was in no hurry to resume talks. Joining theUnited States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)could give the UK deeper benefits on some goods and digital trade with North
American economies. But it has
limited coverage of what is the UK's biggest strength when it comes to
selling to America, namely services. Economists say the overall gains from
joining USMCA may be very limited, perhaps less than 0.1% of GDP And what would
the price be? The UK already has deals with Canada and Mexico, it would have to
rely heavily on American cooperation to join this trade club - and one where
the rules have already been set, and hasnât allowed for new members. America's price
of admission may include a hurdle already encountered: standards surrounding
food and agricultural goods For President
Biden is explicit that his priority is US workers, not least its farmers. He is also clear
that domestic issues take precedence. Even if the UK does want to sign up to
USMCA, it may still be at the back of a queue - simply to get its application
considered. Reality Check Responding to criticism from Labour that the prime minister had made ""zero progress"" in securing aUK-US free trade dealon his trip to the US, Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab said: âBecause of the engagement weâve had with the US, they have immediately given us the boost to trade and businesses by reinstating travel from the UK to the US.â Itâs true that President Biden announced this change yesterday but it wasnât just for the UK. The resumption oftravel into the US from Novemberis applies to fully vaccinated people from 33 countries. They include China, India, Brazil and most of the European Union (countries in its passport-free Schengen area). Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng also admitted that the recent
crisis in CO2 supply came as a surprise to ""a lot of people"". âWith regards to the CO2 situation, it was abundant it was very
cheap and I think a lot of people were surprised at what happened,"" he told the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee. ""We very rapidly dealt with
that situation I met with the CEO of the relevant company twice - on Sunday and
again on Monday, once each - and we have come up with a solution, which I have to
stress is very much something that is a short term support. ""There is no question of us essentially writing a cheque to
this company indefinitely."" Asked about the three-week limit on support for CF Fertilisers he says in a critical intervention you have to have a way of exiting that arrangement. ""It's not a case of just trying to nationalise it or supporting it indefinitely."" He adds: ""I'm confident that we can get other sources of CO2 in that period, there was an immediate crisis and the deal that we reached solved the immediate problem."" Down the corridor during PMQs, the Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng was still answering questions from the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee. He told the MPs that while he did not predict that gas prices ""would quadruple four times in five months"" the government does have structures in place to deal with ""extreme situations"". ""Now those structures are going to be tested and thatâs why
we are here, and thatâs why we are talking about possible contingency plansâ¦.but
I reject the idea that somehow this was completely unexpected and that we were
completely unprepared,"" he says. He adds it is ""unfair to say this somehow just happened and we were completely at sea"", but he does say there were other elements - such as the CO2 shortage - which were more novel.

Pete SaullPolitical Correspondent, BBC Westminster While the
green benches werenât as full as they usually are on a Wednesday lunchtime, the
head-to-head between the two deputies was a lively affair. Labourâs Angela Rayner is a
straight-talker - and her lines of attack prompted laughter on both sides of the
House. The Conservatives guffawed at
the suggestion that their party âdoes not careâ about working people. Rayner asked how many days someone on a low income would have to work
to pay for a luxury holiday in Crete. The former foreign secretary
faced criticism last month, when he stayed on holiday as the Taliban took control of
Afghanistan. But facing questions about
rising gas prices and the end to the universal credit uplift, he insisted that
the governmentâs plan to increase employment and wages was working. The debate about the cost of
living is likely to be a major feature of our politics as we head into the
autumn and winter. Todayâs 'deputy' PMQs was a chance to
rehearse the arguments before the parties head off for their respective
conferences. The final question comes from Labour MP Anna McMorrin. She asks Dominic Raab - who is justice secretary as well as deputy prime minister - if he will deliver a Victimsâ Bill. Raab says looked at plans ""on day one"" in his new post. He lists investments the government has made and says Labour voted against the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill. He says: ""You can't stand up for victims unless you stand up for tough sentencing"", he says. And that's it for today's deputy PMQs. Conservative MP Derek Thomas says he and fellow Cornish MPs want the seasonal agricultural workers visa scheme urgently renewed for next year - which he says would cover 30,000 people. Dominic Raab says the home secretary is being lobbied from ""various quarters"" and is very mindful of the impact of seasonal workers. He says the government will ""get the right balance"". Labour's George Howarth, who's just returned from illness, says ""town halls know better than Whitehall"" when it comes to levelling up. He wants to know if the PM will host a cross-party summit in Downing Street with local government representatives and mayors to discuss how they can be empowered to unlock potential? Raab welcomes him back and says the agenda for levelling up has got to be a team effort with central and local government and mayors all involved. He says he supports the spirit of the question and will do everything he can to work with him. DUP's Carla Lockhart attacks what she calls the ""ill-informed and partisan comments"" from the US President. During a meeting with Boris Johnson, Joe Bidenwarned that peacein Northern Ireland must not be jeopardised as a result of complications caused by Brexit. She argues that ""far from defending the Belfast agreement, the Northern Ireland Protocol is the single greatest danger to the Northern Ireland institutions"". ""A solution that restores Northern Ireland's place in the UK's internal markets is the only way to avert the collapse of the institutions,"" she says adding ""a solution must be found in weeks rather than months."" Dominic Raab replies that there needs to be ""a smart, pragmatic approach"" and tells MPs that ""the president understands our view."" Conservative Dehenna Davison says much of the reason why she is standing in the chamber as an MP is to do withthe death of her father from a single-punch assault. He is just one of many victims she says, and why she is marking ""one punch awareness week"". Will Raab lend his support she asks by joining her immediately after PMQs as supporters gather in Westminster Hall? Raab says he knows how much the campaign means to her personally and ""of course"" he will join her. Labour's Barry Sheerman notes that the deputy prime minister represents one of the wealthiest constituencies in the country (that's Esher and Walton in Surrey). He asks if he ""really"" believes in levelling-up and the redistribution of wealth in the country. He also seeks assurances that Channel 4 will stay in Leeds and in the public sector. Dominic Raab replies that the levelling up agenda is not just about helping the Midlands and the north of England. He says London and the south-east will also benefit because pressure on resources will be eased. SNP's Deidre Brock asks exactly what does the UK government have against the Scottish government requiring real living wages for Scottish workers  and net zero obligations in its green ports? Raab says net zero is ""at the heart of everything we do"". He says ministers have increased the national living wage to say the full-time worker Â£400 a year. The SNP Westminster deputy leader
calls for an âemergency energy paymentâ to help people on lower pay. Kirsten Oswald blames a âtoxic combinationâ of cuts, tax rises and the âgrowing cost of Brexitâ. She claims energy bills could
âskyrocketâ by Â£550 per household. Deputy PM Dominic Raab says several issues she raises were devolved to the Scottish government and he lists a
series of financial help to lower paid families. She says his answer was âdisappointing
and perplexingâ and adds that âwarm words donât heat homesâ. He calls on her to ""stop this scaremongering"".  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"The White House meeting is, for any British prime minister, the big ticket. And because of Covid, Boris Johnson has had to wait for his - the two years since he moved in to Downing Street means a new president here too. Imagine how different today could have been if Donald Trump was still in charge. The two leaders are intensely different, but when the big moment came, both appeared to be content. Mr Johnson and President Joe Biden met for 90 minutes after smiles for the cameras in the Oval Office. Their talks ranged from security, to climate change, Russia and China, and the possibility of closer trade ties. But on the trade deal issue, the president said they needed to ""work through"" it and ""talk a little"" - confirming Downing Street's assumption that the prospect of a major pact is a long way off. Number 10 didn't deny the UK could join an existing agreement between the US, Mexico and Canada - which the BBC understands has been considered - but said the priority was still pursuing a deal with America alone. What's the view from the US? Read Anthony Zurcher's analysis It's really clear from both sides that there is no rapid path to a trade deal - the opportunity that used to be lauded by Brexiteers and by President Trump. Mr Johnson hinted at that realism in his curtain raiser conversations on his way over here. And the president pretty much confirmed that here in their meeting in the Oval Office. This video can not be played Joe Biden and Boris Johnson met on the sidelines of a UN summit in New York The UK seems no longer to want to believe, or pretend, that doing business in a major deal is top of their list. Instead, while the government is still officially pursuing a standalone deal with the US there's a twin track with a more incremental approach - there have already been changes to whisky tariffs and British beef. But Number 10 is now hopeful that the Americans are seriously considering changing tack on British lamb. Biden downplays chances of UK-US trade deal Hotdogs and hand-holding: The US-UK relationship history A Downing Street source said the relationship between the two countries had made ""great strides forward"", hailing the ending of the US travel ban and especially President Biden's extra promises of cash to tackle climate change. Mr Johnson will call for other countries to do the same back in New York, before returning home later today. There aren't perfect outcomes to any relationship as crucial, or as complicated, as the pairing of the US and the UK. There's plenty more that could yet unfold between the two sides before wheels-up late tomorrow. But Mr Johnson's team is pleased and relieved to chalk up their first Oval Office meeting more than unscathed.

"The British food industry will be forced to pay five times more for carbon dioxide as part of a government deal with a US company to restart production in the UK. Environment Secretary George Eustice said carbon dioxide prices would rise from Â£200 per tonne to Â£1,000. The government has agreed to pay out tens of millions of pounds to CF Industries to reopen a plant in the UK. The closure had raised fears over food supplies and the nuclear industry. US-owned CF Industries recently shut two UK sites that produce 60% of the country's commercial carbon dioxide supplies, because of a sharp rise in gas prices. This video can not be played Ros Atkins on... the UK's rising energy bills Farms, food producers and supermarkets have warned that a shortage of carbon dioxide will lead to significant disruption to the manufacture and supply of fresh produce. The Times also reported,externalthat ministers were concerned that the UK might have to close its six advanced gas-cooled nuclear reactors, which also use CO2. The government announced late on Tuesday night that it would meet the full operating costs to run CF Industries' Billingham plant in Teesside for three weeks. The costs are expected to be in the ""low tens of millions"" and will be below Â£50m. Mr Eustice said that the deal with CF Industries ""will be not a loan, it will be a payment to underwrite some of their fixed costs"". At the end of the three-week period, it is hoped that the price of carbon dioxide will have risen sufficiently to make it economically viable for CF Industries to keep production running. Mr Eustice said the food industry would have to accept ""a big, sharp rise"" carbon dioxide prices from Â£200 to Â£1,000 a tonne. ""The critical thing was to get the production up and running expeditiously. That's why we've needed this government intervention,"" he said. ""But we've had meetings with the food industry. They all recognise that the price of carbon dioxide is going to increase substantially and when that price increases, then the market signal will be then for these plants to continue producing."" Mr Eustice insisted that the rise in cost would not have a ""significant impact"" on food prices. He said that while food prices were increasing ""due to global commodity prices, oil prices and also other factors such as labour shortages"", carbon dioxide was ""a tiny proportion"" of the industry's overall costs. CF Industries had halted two of its fertiliser factories - which produce carbon dioxide as a by-product - because of gas prices. Carbon dioxide is used in the slaughter of animals such as chickens CF Industries' Billingham plant will need up to three days to start producing new CO2. The company told the BBC it had ""no estimate"" on when its second UK plant at Ince in Cheshire would  resume production. The British Meat Processors Association said the deal to open CF Industries' Teesside plant was a ""huge relief"" and said it was now ""focused on re-establishing supplies before Friday this week, which is when around 25% of pork production was in danger of shutting down"". Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, welcomed the decision, but said the timetable to restart CF Industries' factory and begin producing carbon dioxide ""will still be tight"". He told the BBC's Today programme: ""Our understanding is that provided that carbon dioxide starts to get through to food producers by the end of the week, then we can avert major and significant disruption in our stores."" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the ""exceptional short-term arrangement"" would ensure industries that rely on a stable supply of CO2 ""have the resources they require to avoid disruption"". He said: ""With regards to the CO2 situation, it was abundant, it was very cheap and I think a lot of people were surprised at what happened."" The government intends to publish the letter from Mr Kwarteng to Tony Will, chief executive of CF Industries, which sets out the terms of the taxpayer support. Commenting on the three-week deal, Mr Kwarteng said: ""In a critical intervention you have to have a way of exiting the arrangement. ""It is not a case of just trying to nationalise it or supporting it indefinitely, and that is why in the critical period we needed to have a short term arrangement I am confident that we can get other sources of CO2 in that period. Mr Eustice said that the shortage of carbon dioxide had been caused by a ""perfect storm"" of circumstances where CF Industries had shut its two plants because ""an increase in gas price means they are not profitable"", while two other providers had closed their sites for maintenance. But the British Meat Processors Association (BMPA) said the current difficulties showed how exposed the UK is, because of its reliance on such a small number of carbon dioxide producers. ""Over many years, we have had a major consolidation of the industry resulting in sectors like food and drink, nuclear and health being reliant on a very small number of very large suppliers,"" the BMPA said. ""If a market-based solution is to be found, it will likely involve longer-term higher prices for CO2, which will be sustainable for some, but not all users of the gas."" Ian Wright, the chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, also called on the government to support other fertiliser producers and help food producers to look for alternatives to CO2. Mr Will, who flew from the US to the UK on Sunday to meet Mr Kwarteng, said: ""We look forward to working with Secretary Kwarteng and the UK government on developing a longer-term solution, including the development of alternative suppliers of CO2 for the UK market."" Farmers fear gas price crisis may spark pig cull How could the CO2 shortage hit food supplies? Gas price crisis: Government poised to step in The BBC understands that the deal with CF Industries has been drafted so that other companies who stop production because of high commodity prices will not be able to ask the government for similar help. Norwegian firm Yara has also cut production at a number of European factories, including one in Hull. This video can not be played The prime minister says he does ânot believe people will be short of foodâ amid reports of some empty supermarket shelves. Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged people not to worryabout putting food on the table this winter, amid rising energy and food bills and a cut to universal credit. Wholesale prices for gas have surged 250% since January, with a 70% rise since August alone, leading to calls for support from the industry and the collapse of some smaller energy firms. Mr Opie added that the government should also take action on other issues affecting food retailers in recent weeks, such as the shortage of HGV drivers, which has been exacerbated by the pandemic and many drivers returning to the European Union after Brexit. The government has been keen to stress that this is very much an emergency measure, time-limited, and with a cap on the amount it is prepared to pay. It had to do something. Food producers were warning that shortages would become apparent within days, at a time when supply chains have already been disrupted by other issues, such as a lack of lorry drivers. But the fact remains that it has agreed to give a large US-owned company tens of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money, just to operate one of its own plants. That isn't a particularly good look - and it has cast a glaring spotlight on the vulnerability of a key part of the economy. Now there is a three-week window for government, supermarkets and food producers to come up with a ""sustainable market-based solution"". In practice, that's likely to mean users paying more for their CO2, a cost which will ultimately be borne by consumers.

"Boris Johnson has held talks with President Biden at the White House - but the American administration has played down the chances of brokering a separate post-Brexit free trade deal with the UK. BBC editors and correspondents look at the prospects of securing a stand-alone agreement with the US and ask if joining an existing North American trade pact instead is a more realistic option. Brexit gave the UK the freedom to strike its own trade deals - and accounting for Â£1 in every Â£6 of British trade, a pact with the US was the ultimate prize. But Whitehall officials have for months been scrabbling for an alternative after the Biden administration indicated it was in no hurry to resume talks. Joining USMCA - the existing trade arrangement between the US, Canada and Mexico - could give the UK deeper benefits on some goods and digital trade with North American economies. But it has limited coverage of what is the U.K.'s biggest strength when it comes to selling to America, namely services. Economists say the overall gains from joining USMCA may be very limited, perhaps less than 0.1% of GDP And what would the price be? The UK already has deals with Canada and Mexico, it would have to rely heavily on American cooperation to join this trade club - and one where the rules have already been set, and hasn't allowed for new members. America's price of admission may include a hurdle already encountered: standards surrounding food and agricultural goods For President Biden is explicit that his priority is US workers, not least its farmers. He is also clear that domestic issues take precedence. Even if the UK does want to sign up to USMCA, it may still be at the back of a queue - simply to get its application considered. The government highlights the fact that it has signed trade deals with more than 60 countries since it left the European Union. But the vast majority of them are rollover deals, copying the terms of agreements it already had when it was part of the EU. It has been an achievement to have concluded these deals so quickly, but it has not added to the sum of British trade around the world. The UK's deal with Japan is marginally different than the EU's, so is an updated agreement it signed in June with Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. The UK has also agreed a deal in principle with Australia, which the EU has not. But that agreement has yet to come into effect, and will comprise only a tiny part of overall UK trade. So, that leaves the world's three largest economies. Trade with China will always be fraught with difficulty for political reasons. President Biden has now confirmed what has been obvious for some time - that a free trade deal with the United States is not going to happen any time soon. And Britain chose to leave the EU and its single market, and sign a new deal which limits the access it had before. As a result, according to the EU's statistics office Eurostat, British exports to the EU in the first seven months of this year fell by more than 17% compared to the same period in 2020. The coronavirus pandemic may have been an inhibiting factor for trade, but exports from all other major economies to the EU have risen. Better trading opportunities and a long-term focus on fast-growing markets in Asia were arguments put forward by supporters of Brexit. But leaving the EU is going to mean the UK does less trade around the world in the next few years, not more. With Joe Biden and the Democrats back in charge in Washington, the US was expected to strengthen ties with Europe and put the UK, to paraphrase Barack Obama, toward the back of the queue. Donald Trump's focus on transactional diplomacy and penchant for one-on-one deals was out; multilateralism was again in vogue. That's not exactly how things have played out, however. On Tuesday morning, Biden gave a speech at the United Nations emphasising the need for collective action by the community of nations. But by the evening, he was back at the White House for a one-on-one meeting with Boris Johnson, talking up a US-UK relationship that has taken on greater relevance for the Biden administration in the past few weeks. Although Johnson earlier spoke of US-UK relations that are ""as good as they have been in decades"", there are still a few bumps in the road. The US seems uninterested in prioritising a new trade deal. Biden's ""we'll have to work that through"" comment on Tuesday wasn't exactly an enthusiastic response. The president, who regularly boasts of his Irish heritage, has also warned of what he sees as the danger Brexit poses to stability in Northern Ireland - a point he again alluded to on Tuesday.

"Newly appointed Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab takes questions in Boris Johnson's place at today's PMQs Labour's deputy party leader Angela Rayner pressed him on rising prices as she stood in for Keir Starmer Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng is appearing before a committee of MPs considering issues raised by rising gas prices He says protecting consumers from ""exorbitant prices"" is a priority, but the industry must step up to keep prices down He says companies should look at their own management, rather than ""stretch out a hand for taxpayers' money"" Jonathan Brearley from Ofgem says hundreds of thousands of customers may be left in limbo if more energy suppliers go bust The government has agreed to pay millions in operating costs for a factory to restart the production of CO2 - vital for fresh food supply CF industries halted production at two of its factories because of soaring gas prices Edited by Johanna Howitt That's where we end our coverage from Westminster for today. Our writers were Arryn Moy, Doug Falconer, Emma Owen, Kate Whannel, and Sinead Wilson. The next PMQs will be on Wednesday 20 October - as Parliament goes in to a three-week recess to make way for the political party conference season. Do join us then. Adam FlemingChief political correspondent That PMQs felt different - that is partly down to Angela Rayner's presentation style in the House of Commons. Let's be honest, she is much funnier than Keir Starmer. And I hope Dominic Raab had a good time on his holiday in Crete because that holiday is going to potentially follow him around for the rest of his political career. On the serious stuff, we are getting quite use to the battle lines between the parties. Labour is talking about the increase in energy bills, the removal of the Â£20 a week rise to universal credit, then from next April the rise in National Insurance to pay for the health and social care levy. Labour are bundling all that together saying there is going to be a cost of living crisis. The government is responding by saying we are protecting you with the energy price cap and when it comes to jobs and wages, the economy is booming for some people. Both those things might be true at the same time, but by the end of the winter which one of those narratives will have won out? Dominic Raab and Angela Rayner deputised for Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer for today's PMQs: Reality Check At Deputy Prime Ministerâs Questions, Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said to Dominic Raab: âHis government chose to cut the income of a worker on Â£18,000 a year by over Â£1,100.â She gave the example of a shop worker. To get to this figure, Â£1,040 would come from the loss of the Â£20 a week increase to universal credit. And from next April, a worker earning Â£18,000 a year would be paying an extra Â£105 in National Insurance â as part of the rise in the rate of NI to help fund health and social care announced by the government.

The resumption oftravel into the US from Novemberis applies to fully vaccinated people from 33 countries. They include China, India, Brazil and most of the European Union (countries in its passport-free Schengen area). Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng also admitted that the recent
crisis in CO2 supply came as a surprise to ""a lot of people"". âWith regards to the CO2 situation, it was abundant it was very
cheap and I think a lot of people were surprised at what happened,"" he told the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee. ""We very rapidly dealt with
that situation I met with the CEO of the relevant company twice - on Sunday and
again on Monday, once each - and we have come up with a solution, which I have to
stress is very much something that is a short term support. ""There is no question of us essentially writing a cheque to
this company indefinitely."" Asked about the three-week limit on support for CF Fertilisers he says in a critical intervention you have to have a way of exiting that arrangement. ""It's not a case of just trying to nationalise it or supporting it indefinitely."" He adds: ""I'm confident that we can get other sources of CO2 in that period, there was an immediate crisis and the deal that we reached solved the immediate problem."" Down the corridor during PMQs, the Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng was still answering questions from the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee. He told the MPs that while he did not predict that gas prices ""would quadruple four times in five months"" the government does have structures in place to deal with ""extreme situations"". ""Now those structures are going to be tested and thatâs why
we are here, and thatâs why we are talking about possible contingency plansâ¦.but
I reject the idea that somehow this was completely unexpected and that we were
completely unprepared,"" he says. He adds it is ""unfair to say this somehow just happened and we were completely at sea"", but he does say there were other elements - such as the CO2 shortage - which were more novel.

Pete SaullPolitical Correspondent, BBC Westminster While the
green benches werenât as full as they usually are on a Wednesday lunchtime, the
head-to-head between the two deputies was a lively affair. Labourâs Angela Rayner is a
straight-talker - and her lines of attack prompted laughter on both sides of the
House. The Conservatives guffawed at
the suggestion that their party âdoes not careâ about working people. Rayner asked how many days someone on a low income would have to work
to pay for a luxury holiday in Crete. The former foreign secretary
faced criticism last month, when he stayed on holiday as the Taliban took control of
Afghanistan. But facing questions about
rising gas prices and the end to the universal credit uplift, he insisted that
the governmentâs plan to increase employment and wages was working. The debate about the cost of
living is likely to be a major feature of our politics as we head into the
autumn and winter. Todayâs 'deputy' PMQs was a chance to
rehearse the arguments before the parties head off for their respective
conferences. The final question comes from Labour MP Anna McMorrin. She asks Dominic Raab - who is justice secretary as well as deputy prime minister - if he will deliver a Victimsâ Bill. Raab says looked at plans ""on day one"" in his new post. He lists investments the government has made and says Labour voted against the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill. He says: ""You can't stand up for victims unless you stand up for tough sentencing"", he says. And that's it for today's deputy PMQs. Conservative MP Derek Thomas says he and fellow Cornish MPs want the seasonal agricultural workers visa scheme urgently renewed for next year - which he says would cover 30,000 people. Dominic Raab says the home secretary is being lobbied from ""various quarters"" and is very mindful of the impact of seasonal workers. He says the government will ""get the right balance"". Labour's George Howarth, who's just returned from illness, says ""town halls know better than Whitehall"" when it comes to levelling up. He wants to know if the PM will host a cross-party summit in Downing Street with local government representatives and mayors to discuss how they can be empowered to unlock potential? Raab welcomes him back and says the agenda for levelling up has got to be a team effort with central and local government and mayors all involved. He says he supports the spirit of the question and will do everything he can to work with him. DUP's Carla Lockhart attacks what she calls the ""ill-informed and partisan comments"" from the US President. During a meeting with Boris Johnson, Joe Bidenwarned that peacein Northern Ireland must not be jeopardised as a result of complications caused by Brexit. She argues that ""far from defending the Belfast agreement, the Northern Ireland Protocol is the single greatest danger to the Northern Ireland institutions"". ""A solution that restores Northern Ireland's place in the UK's internal markets is the only way to avert the collapse of the institutions,"" she says adding ""a solution must be found in weeks rather than months."" Dominic Raab replies that there needs to be ""a smart, pragmatic approach"" and tells MPs that ""the president understands our view."" Conservative Dehenna Davison says much of the reason why she is standing in the chamber as an MP is to do withthe death of her father from a single-punch assault. He is just one of many victims she says, and why she is marking ""one punch awareness week"". Will Raab lend his support she asks by joining her immediately after PMQs as supporters gather in Westminster Hall? Raab says he knows how much the campaign means to her personally and ""of course"" he will join her. Labour's Barry Sheerman notes that the deputy prime minister represents one of the wealthiest constituencies in the country (that's Esher and Walton in Surrey). He asks if he ""really"" believes in levelling-up and the redistribution of wealth in the country. He also seeks assurances that Channel 4 will stay in Leeds and in the public sector. Dominic Raab replies that the levelling up agenda is not just about helping the Midlands and the north of England. He says London and the south-east will also benefit because pressure on resources will be eased. SNP's Deidre Brock asks exactly what does the UK government have against the Scottish government requiring real living wages for Scottish workers  and net zero obligations in its green ports? Raab says net zero is ""at the heart of everything we do"". He says ministers have increased the national living wage to say the full-time worker Â£400 a year. The SNP Westminster deputy leader
calls for an âemergency energy paymentâ to help people on lower pay. Kirsten Oswald blames a âtoxic combinationâ of cuts, tax rises and the âgrowing cost of Brexitâ. She claims energy bills could
âskyrocketâ by Â£550 per household. Deputy PM Dominic Raab says several issues she raises were devolved to the Scottish government and he lists a
series of financial help to lower paid families. She says his answer was âdisappointing
and perplexingâ and adds that âwarm words donât heat homesâ. He calls on her to ""stop this scaremongering"".  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Covishield has been added to the UK's list of recognised vaccines, recipients of which are able to enter the country without isolating from next month But its still unclear whether Indian travellers or those from African countries, including Kenya, which use also Covishield, will avoid the need to isolate They are not listed among the countries whose citizens will be recognised as vaccinated by the UK even if they have had two doses However, the United Arab Emirates has been added to this list this morning, so travellers from there will not have to isolate in the UK Global cases fell significantly to 3.6 million last week from 4 million the week before, WHO reports Brazil's health minister has tested positive for Covid-19, after attending the UN General Assembly in New York Pret A Manger aims to hire 3,000 staff by the end of 2022 after cutting the same number of jobs last year Edited by Martha Buckley Speaking of new UK data, there's good news on the latest hospital figures, which are the lowest in six weeks. The total patient count for people in hospital with Covid has also been updated and stood at 7,567 yesterday - the lowest figure for 18 days.  It was above 8,000 every day last week. The numbers in ventilator beds have also fallen. After being above 1,000 throughout September they now stand at 943, after falling in recent days. The government has reported 34,460 new coronavirus cases in figures released today. A further 166 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test were also reported. The case figures are a jump from the 31,564 new cases recorded yesterday, though deaths fell from 203 on Tuesday. As we reported earlier, there are protests in India as it has not been added to the list of countries where people fully jabbed with an approved vaccine can avoid having to isolate if they want to travel to the UK. Many other countries are affected after the UK government clarified the jab widely distributed by Covax - Covishield - was an approved vaccine but arrivals from some places were not added to the exempt-from-quarantine list. Covishield is the Indian-made AstraZeneca jab and identical to the one used in the UK. The Kenyan and British governments say they are working on a system to recognise Covid vaccine certificates issued in both countries, to facilitate travel between them. Under the UK's new rules effective from 4 October, fully vaccinated people from countries that are not on the red list will be exempt from the compulsory quarantine. But despite being removed from the UK's red list, Kenyans intending to travel there will still have to take a test three days before travelling, quarantine for 10 days on arrival, as well as pay for Covid tests while in isolation. People from other African countries that remain on the UK red list have also criticised the new travel rules saying they are discriminatory.

Razia IqbalPresenter, Newshour, BBC World Service We told you earlier about a llama named Fifi and her ""nanobodies"" which are showing ""significant potential"" in Covid therapy trials. Prof James Naismith is director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute in Oxford, which has been doing this research. I asked him, Why llamas? This video can not be played Germany's health minister has announced that, from 1 November, Germans will no longer receive compensation for lost pay if they are unvaccinated and forced to quarantine. The government has been helping to pay workers sent into quarantine after being in contact with an infected person or returning from a ""high risk"" area abroad. But minister Jens Spahn says this support will be withdrawn, in an effort to encourage more people to get the jab. Getting vaccinated will remain a ""personal decision"", he says, but that decision will now ""also come with the responsibility to bear the financial consequences"". ""Some people will say this means pressure for the unvaccinated. I think we have to look at it the other way around - it is also a question of fairness,"" he added. More than 60% of Germany's population have been fully vaccinated, according to official data. While compulsory vaccination has been ruled out by the government, many German states have introduced restrictions for unvaccinated residents in public places. Those who've had their jabs are no longer required to quarantine. US officials have announced announced that all staff at San Francisco International Airport must be fully vaccinated to carry on working. In a statement on Tuesday, airport authorities and city mayor London Breed said the mandate was the first of its kind in the US, and would take effect immediately. âAs SFO prepares for the upcoming holiday travel season and the return of pre-pandemic passenger levels, we have an obligation to provide a safe airport facility for the traveling public and our on-site employees,"" said airport director Ivar Satero. Under the new rules, every airport tenant or contractor must ensure their on-site staff are fully vaccinated. Employees can be granted exemptions based on ""either medical disability or sincerely held religious belief"". The airport offers free vaccines at an on-site medical centre. The announcement has been welcomed by one local workers' union that represents several food and beverage staff at the airport. Speaking to the San Francisco Chronicle, Anand Singh, president of Unite Here Local 2, which represents several food and beverage workers at the airport, said: ""Our union is working with employers to ensure fair implementation because vaccines are critical to keeping workers safe and building a recovery where everyone comes back stronger."" BBC Storyteller Chanise Evans tells her story Some 250,000 school pupils will be supported to tell their own stories in a BBC scheme to help recovery from the pandemic. The BBC 100 Share Your Story project will see BBC stars and staff visiting secondary schools across the UK to improve students' well-being and story-telling skills. Director general Tim Davie said the BBC had supported ""an entire nation of home learners during the coronavirus pandemic"". He says: ""In 2022 - our centenary year - we will harness the unique power of the BBC to provide educational support to inspire millions of children and students across the UK."" Pupils will be supported to tell their own stories in class, in the form of a poem, a rap, a film or a speech. BBC hosts will then conduct a series of interactive assemblies in whichBBC stars and staff reveal how they have overcome challengesin their own lives. Deputy chief medical officer for England Professor Jonathan Van-Tam tells the Education Committee the dominant Delta variant is 60% more infectious than the Alpha variant, so it is really quite likely that teenagers will be infected at some point. He adds that he has in mind particularly the impact of being ill at a time not of their choosing, such as around their GCSEs. ""Because the Delta variant is so infectious we're not looking at a theoretical risk of children 12 to 17 becoming infected. I think it is really quite inevitable that they will be so at some point."" England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty and his deputy Jonathan Van-Tam are answering questions from the Education Committee. Prof Whitty says children are currently driving the spread of the virus, with ""substantial transmission"" in children. The 12-17 age group is the highest transmission group ""as far as we can tell"", he says. All children in that age group are due to be offered a Covid-19 vaccine - a decision Whitty insists has not been
made for political reasons or for the benefit of more vulnerable
adults. Asked about vaccination he says the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) and the chief medical officers agree the risk to children from Covid is small and the risk of vaccination is small. But he says it is the view of the JCVI that the benefits of vaccinating them are marginally greater than the potential for harm. He adds that vaccinating children would help prevent disruption in schools. ""The great majority of children who have not currently had
Covid are going to get it at some point,"" he says. ""It won't be necessary in the next two or three months but
they will get it sooner or later because this is incredibly
infectious... vaccination will reduce that risk."" Boris Johnson is in New York for the UN General Assembly No 10 says Boris Johnson is fully vaccinated - after being asked whether the prime minister had taken any extra precautions since coming into contact with a positive coronavirus case at the United Nations general assembly (UNGA). According to reports, Brazil's health minister Marcelo Queiroga has tested positive for Covid and gone into isolation, only 24 hours after being filmed shaking hands with Johnson in New York on Monday. Asked whether the prime minister had taken a Covid test since Queiroga's result, a spokesman for the prime minister says there are ""strict"" Covid measures in place at UNGA ""which the prime minister will obviously adhere to"". ""As you know he is double jabbed,"" he adds. An unvaccinated former councillor who became seriously ill with Covidfeared his mother would die after she caught the virus from him. Andrew Girvan, 48, was infected at the start of August and within a week 19 family members had the virus, including his grandparents and six-year-old daughter. He says he was given a 50/50 chance of survival and his mother was put on a ventilator,the Belfast Telegraph reports,external. ""It was without a doubt that it was me who gave it to her,"" the former Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) councillor tells BBC Radio Ulster's The Nolan Show. ""I was lying in bed in hospital and she was in the other hospital and she looked a lot worse than I was. ""To think that you've given your mum something that could eventually kill her isn't a nice place to be."" He says ""procrastination"" got in the way of getting his jab. As we've heard a bit earlier today, PCR tests for fully
vaccinated travellers arriving in the UK will be replaced by lateral flow
tests undernew foreign travel rules. But a leading immunologist says it is ""critical"" that the government ensures at-home testing is overseen by professional and any positive tests are screened for variants of concern. Professor Denis Kinane, immunologist and founding scientist at Cignpost Diagnostics, says: âIf we are to use lateral flow, letâs make it as robust as we can, which means
the swabbing should be administered by a capable agent and the authenticity of
the individual being tested should be verified. ""Any positives picked up in this
way should be reported to PHE and the individual retested and genomically
sequenced by the NHS.  
âLateral flow tests can also be performed at home but observed online by a
medical professional. ""This would ensure that the test is conducted correctly
and that the person being tested is who they say they are. ""The government
has to reduce spread and new variants coming into the UK and if lateral flow
tests are used, they need to be performed authentically.â A group representing nightclubs is launching a legal challenge to the Scottish government's plans for vaccine passports. From October, people will need proof they have had two doses of vaccine to enter certain venues and large events. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says the scheme will help reduce transmission of the virus and keep clubs open. But the Night Time Industries Association Scotland says there are ""serious flaws"" with the plans. The government's definition of a nightclub is a venue which is open between midnight and 05:00, serves alcohol, and which has a designated area for dancing and provides live or recorded music for this purpose. However, industry groups have voiced concerns that the definition could also cover arange of other hospitality venues, including bars, pubs and hotel function rooms. As policy makers look for creative ways to encourage people to get their vaccines, Romania's government has announced a new vaccination lottery. Any fully-vaccinated residents with an EU digital Covid certificate can enter the scheme, which is running from 1 October until the end of the year. A total of 19 draws will be made during the period, with 1,139 prizes totalling 15m Romanian leu ($3.6m; Â£2.6m). Dozens of other weekly prizes will also be given out, some up to 500,000 Romanian leu (Â£118,433; Â£86,825). Funding for the lottery will be given by Romania's economic ministry. âIn this epidemiological context, with significant increases in the number of people infected with Covid-19, it is important to support the vaccination process, including by granting rewards,â said Cseke Attila, Romania's interim health minister,in a statement on Monday.,external Authorities are struggling with vaccine hesitancy in the eastern European country. Just over a quarter of eligible citizens have been fully vaccinated - one of the lowest rates in the EU. Officials have blamed the low pick-up on logistical issues, and a general mistrust of medicine, made worse by online fake news. Hello and thanks for following our rolling coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. If you're just joining us, here are some of the biggest developments:  The World Health Organisation says that the global number of Covid-19 cases continued to fall last week. In its latest update,external, the UN health body said 3.6 million new cases were reported last week, down from 4 million the week before. It's the first substantial drop in over two months, with infections falling in every region of the world. There were major decreases in two regions especially: the Middle East, with a 22% fall, and a 16% drop in south east Asia. Most cases were reported in the US, the UK, India, Turkey and the Philippines. Global coronavirus-related deaths also declined 7% to just under 60,000. The WHO has revised its list of ""variants of interest"" and said it is tracking Lamba and Mu variants. Both have a Latin American origin, but haven't yet caused widespread epidemics. Meanwhile the Delta variant has spread to 185 countries. We've got a bit more detail now on Transport Secretary Grant Shapps's comments to the Transport Committee. Earlier, he said the government was working as ""quickly as possible"" to remove PCR Covid testing for international travellers and to replacethe PCR test taken two days after arrival with a cheaper and simpler lateral flow test. The expense of paying for private PCR testing is widely blamed for discouraging people from travelling abroad - withmost private providers charging above Â£60 for PCR tests and Â£30 for lateral flow tests. The government has warned more than 80 providers over misleading prices. Asked why the switch from PCR to lateral flow tests for arrivals into England would not happen until the end of October, Shapps said it would take several weeks to implement because private testing firms did not have enough lateral flow tests to meet demand. âThis is a Department of Health [and Social Care] responsibility rather than mine, but my understanding is that the ramp up of supply of lateral flow through the private testing sector has some way to go in as much as they have been almost entirely involved in providing PCRs currently,â he says. When questioned by Ben Bradshaw MP about why this was an issue as many test providers also offered lateral flow tests, Shapps responded that he thought it was a question of scale. âWe go from a situation where they are providing low number of thousands to probably millions of tests very quickly and need a few weeks to scale up on it,â he said. The transport secretary could not provide a more specific date for the switch but said his Department of Health colleagues were aware of the upcoming October half-term school holidays and understood the speed required to bring in the changes. Scottish tourism bodies are worried that visitors from overseas will be put off by the Covid-testing requirements Scotland's next tourism season is at ""serious risk"" becauserigorous Covid-testing requirements are being retainedfor international visitors, industry leaders have claimed. Visitor testing rules arebeing relaxed in Englandbut the Scottish government has raised health concerns. The Scottish Tourism Alliance claims the divergence is harming its industry. The Scottish government said it would be guided by clinical advice as well as economic implications. The Scottish Tourism Alliance has put its name to an open letter signed by more than 40 tourism businesses calling for an urgent meeting with the Scottish government. SinceCovid restrictions lifted in England on 19 July, people have been told they no longer have to work from home. However, there have been warnings that this could change if there is a surge in coronavirus cases this winter. Staff in the rest of the UK are still advised to remain at home where possible. The government'sCovid Autumn and Winter Plan for England,externalhas two proposals. Much ofPlan Afocuses onthe vaccine rollout: But if the NHS struggles,Plan B(or parts of it) could start - including advice to work from home again for ""a limited period"". Some businesses - but not all - have embraced the remote-working model seen during the pandemic, with some firms putting in place hybrid working arrangements that would see employees work part of the week from home. Other companies have said they want workers to return to the office or workplace full-time. You can ask to continue to work from home by making a flexible working request, but employers don't have to agree, even if you've worked from home throughout the pandemic. The government is expected to launch a consultation shortly onproposals to give all employees the right to request flexible working as soon as they start a job. At the moment, workers have to wait for six months. You can read morehere.

Officials said some sites would be shut for up to two weeks after construction workers and other protesters clashed. Property was damaged and police said several people were arrested. Hundreds gathered in Melbourne for another anti-vaccination protest on Tuesday, setting off flares and reportedly throwing urine at reporters. On Monday, riot police were deployed and reportedly used rubber bullets and pepper spray to disperse crowds.

"This video can not be played ""This is a very important trip for us"": Boris Johnson and Joe Biden hold face-to-face talks Joe Biden has played down the chances of a post-Brexit free trade deal between the US and UK, as he held talks with Boris Johnson at the White House. The US president said he would discuss the issue ""a little bit"" with the UK prime minister, adding: ""We're going to have to work that through."" Downing Street said a direct deal with the US remained the ""priority"". But UK ministers are pondering joining an existing North American trade pact instead, the BBC understands. Mr Biden and Mr Johnson also discussed Northern Ireland, climate change and Afghanistan during the 90-minute meeting. The UK is keen to strike free trade deals around the world in the wake of leaving the European Union's single market - including with the US, with which annual trade was worthan estimated $273bn (Â£200bn),externalin 2019. A deal would encourage more business between the two countries by making it cheaper, usually by reducing or eliminating taxes called tariffs. How many trade deals has the UK done? BBC specialists on the prospects for UK-US trade Biden meets Boris: Shared interests but bumps remain Biden in new protocol warning over Northern Ireland But Mr Johnson, echoing Mr Biden, downplayed chances of securing agreement with the US before the next general election, saying: ""The Americans do negotiate very hard."" Environment Secretary George Eustice told Sky News: ""We still very much hope to be able to put together an agreement with the United States. We are not putting timescales on it."" ""It's just not a priority for the US administration,"" he added. Mr Johnson highlighted the decision to lift the ban on British beef, and Downing Street is increasingly confident that there could soon be a favourable decision lifting the export ban on lamb. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office before the talks, Mr Biden said: ""We're going to talk a little bit about trade today and we're going to have to work that through."" He did not counter the assertion from his predecessor Barack Obama that the UK would have to join ""the back of the queue"" in seeking a trade deal after Brexit. It's really clear from both sides that there is no rapid path to a trade deal - the opportunity that used to be lauded by Brexiteers and by President Trump. Mr Johnson hinted at that realism in his curtain-raiser conversations on his way over here. And the president pretty much confirmed that in the meeting in the Oval Office. The UK seems no longer to want to believe, or pretend, that doing business in a major deal is top of their list. Instead, while the government is still officially pursuing a stand-alone deal with the US there's a twin track with a more incremental approach - there have already been changes to whisky tariffs and British beef. But No 10 is now hopeful that the Americans are seriously considering changing tack on British lamb. Read more from Laurahere. A source familiar with the government's thinking told the BBC the UK could negotiate entry into an existing trade arrangement between the US, Canada and Mexico - the USMCA - set up after former US President Donald Trump tore up its predecessor, NAFTA. ""There are a variety of different ways to do this,"" the source said. ""The question is whether the US administration is ready. The ball is in the US's court. It takes two to tango."" Joe Biden urges unity amid tensions with allies Hotdogs and hand-holding: The US-UK relationship history Elsewhere, Downing Street said Mr Johnson and Mr Biden agreed all diplomatic and humanitarian methods must be used to stop conditions getting worse in Afghanistan. The leaders said any international recognition of the Taliban must be contingent on the group respecting human rights. This followed arequest by the Taliban to address world leaders at the United Nations summitin New York this week. Brexit gave the UK the freedom to strike its own trade deals - and accounting for Â£1 in every Â£6 of British trade, a pact with the US was the ultimate prize. But Whitehall officials have for months been scrabbling for an alternative after the Biden administration indicated it was in no hurry to resume talks. Joining the USMCA arrangement already agreed by the US, Canada and Mexico could give the UK deeper benefits on some goods and digital trade with North American economies. But it has limited coverage of the UK's biggest strength when it comes to selling to America, namely services. Economists say the overall gains from joining USMCA may be very limited, perhaps less than 0.1% of GDP America's price of admission may include a hurdle already encountered: standards surrounding food and agricultural goods. For President Biden is explicit that his priority is US workers, not least its farmers. He is also clear that domestic issues take precedence. Even if the UK does want to sign up to USMCA, it may still be at the back of a queue - simply to get its application considered. Before the meeting, Mr Biden alsoissued a fresh warning to the UK that peace in Northern Ireland must not be jeopardisedas a result of complications caused by Brexit. He made it clear he had concerns about the Irish border, amid continuing issues withNorthern Ireland Protocol- the arrangement which helps prevent checks along the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The pair also discussed the newUK, US and Australia security pactin the Asia-Pacific region, with No 10 describing it as an example of ""shared values and approach to the world"". The meeting, taking place on the sidelines of the UN summit, involved the traditional exchange of gifts. Mr Biden gave the prime minister a framed photo of their first meeting in Cornwall at the G7 summit in June, and a White House-branded watch. Mr Johnson presented the president with a signed copy of a book written by British astronaut Tim Peake, with an inscription expressing hopes that it ""provides a reminder of what we're fighting to save as our countries tackle climate change together"". The prime minister's gift comes weeks ahead of the COP26 summit in Glasgow, which is seen as a crucial moment to bring climate change under control. Earlier, Mr Biden announced the US would double its climate finance pledge and increase funding for developing countries to $11.4bn (Â£8.3bn) by 2024. Mr Johnson said the US had ""stepped up to the plate"" with what he called a ""massive contribution"" towards the $100bn (Â£73bn) goal for countries to raise.

"Newly appointed Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab takes questions in Boris Johnson's place at today's PMQs Labour's deputy party leader Angela Rayner pressed him on rising prices as she stood in for Keir Starmer Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng is appearing before a committee of MPs considering issues raised by rising gas prices He says protecting consumers from ""exorbitant prices"" is a priority, but the industry must step up to keep prices down He says companies should look at their own management, rather than ""stretch out a hand for taxpayers' money"" Jonathan Brearley from Ofgem says hundreds of thousands of customers may be left in limbo if more energy suppliers go bust The government has agreed to pay millions in operating costs for a factory to restart the production of CO2 - vital for fresh food supply CF industries halted production at two of its factories because of soaring gas prices Edited by Johanna Howitt That's where we end our coverage from Westminster for today. Our writers were Arryn Moy, Doug Falconer, Emma Owen, Kate Whannel, and Sinead Wilson. The next PMQs will be on Wednesday 20 October - as Parliament goes in to a three-week recess to make way for the political party conference season. Do join us then. Adam FlemingChief political correspondent That PMQs felt different - that is partly down to Angela Rayner's presentation style in the House of Commons. Let's be honest, she is much funnier than Keir Starmer. And I hope Dominic Raab had a good time on his holiday in Crete because that holiday is going to potentially follow him around for the rest of his political career. On the serious stuff, we are getting quite use to the battle lines between the parties. Labour is talking about the increase in energy bills, the removal of the Â£20 a week rise to universal credit, then from next April the rise in National Insurance to pay for the health and social care levy. Labour are bundling all that together saying there is going to be a cost of living crisis. The government is responding by saying we are protecting you with the energy price cap and when it comes to jobs and wages, the economy is booming for some people. Both those things might be true at the same time, but by the end of the winter which one of those narratives will have won out? Dominic Raab and Angela Rayner deputised for Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer for today's PMQs: Reality Check At Deputy Prime Ministerâs Questions, Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said to Dominic Raab: âHis government chose to cut the income of a worker on Â£18,000 a year by over Â£1,100.â She gave the example of a shop worker. To get to this figure, Â£1,040 would come from the loss of the Â£20 a week increase to universal credit. And from next April, a worker earning Â£18,000 a year would be paying an extra Â£105 in National Insurance â as part of the rise in the rate of NI to help fund health and social care announced by the government.

Dharshini DavidEconomics Correspondent Prime Minister Boris Johnson meets US President Joe Biden in the Oval Office of the White House Brexit gave the
UK the freedom to strike its own trade deals - and accounting for Â£1 in every
Â£6 of British trade, a pact with the US was the ultimate prize. But Whitehall
officials have for months been scrabbling for an alternative after the Biden
administration indicated it was in no hurry to resume talks. Joining theUnited States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)could give the UK deeper benefits on some goods and digital trade with North
American economies. But it has
limited coverage of what is the UK's biggest strength when it comes to
selling to America, namely services. Economists say the overall gains from
joining USMCA may be very limited, perhaps less than 0.1% of GDP And what would
the price be? The UK already has deals with Canada and Mexico, it would have to
rely heavily on American cooperation to join this trade club - and one where
the rules have already been set, and hasnât allowed for new members. America's price
of admission may include a hurdle already encountered: standards surrounding
food and agricultural goods For President
Biden is explicit that his priority is US workers, not least its farmers. He is also clear
that domestic issues take precedence. Even if the UK does want to sign up to
USMCA, it may still be at the back of a queue - simply to get its application
considered. Reality Check Responding to criticism from Labour that the prime minister had made ""zero progress"" in securing aUK-US free trade dealon his trip to the US, Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab said: âBecause of the engagement weâve had with the US, they have immediately given us the boost to trade and businesses by reinstating travel from the UK to the US.â Itâs true that President Biden announced this change yesterday but it wasnât just for the UK. The resumption oftravel into the US from Novemberis applies to fully vaccinated people from 33 countries. They include China, India, Brazil and most of the European Union (countries in its passport-free Schengen area). Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng also admitted that the recent
crisis in CO2 supply came as a surprise to ""a lot of people"". âWith regards to the CO2 situation, it was abundant it was very
cheap and I think a lot of people were surprised at what happened,"" he told the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee. ""We very rapidly dealt with
that situation I met with the CEO of the relevant company twice - on Sunday and
again on Monday, once each - and we have come up with a solution, which I have to
stress is very much something that is a short term support. ""There is no question of us essentially writing a cheque to
this company indefinitely."" Asked about the three-week limit on support for CF Fertilisers he says in a critical intervention you have to have a way of exiting that arrangement. ""It's not a case of just trying to nationalise it or supporting it indefinitely."" He adds: ""I'm confident that we can get other sources of CO2 in that period, there was an immediate crisis and the deal that we reached solved the immediate problem."" Down the corridor during PMQs, the Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng was still answering questions from the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee. He told the MPs that while he did not predict that gas prices ""would quadruple four times in five months"" the government does have structures in place to deal with ""extreme situations"". ""Now those structures are going to be tested and thatâs why
we are here, and thatâs why we are talking about possible contingency plansâ¦.but
I reject the idea that somehow this was completely unexpected and that we were
completely unprepared,"" he says. He adds it is ""unfair to say this somehow just happened and we were completely at sea"", but he does say there were other elements - such as the CO2 shortage - which were more novel.

Pete SaullPolitical Correspondent, BBC Westminster While the
green benches werenât as full as they usually are on a Wednesday lunchtime, the
head-to-head between the two deputies was a lively affair. Labourâs Angela Rayner is a
straight-talker - and her lines of attack prompted laughter on both sides of the
House. The Conservatives guffawed at
the suggestion that their party âdoes not careâ about working people. Rayner asked how many days someone on a low income would have to work
to pay for a luxury holiday in Crete. The former foreign secretary
faced criticism last month, when he stayed on holiday as the Taliban took control of
Afghanistan. But facing questions about
rising gas prices and the end to the universal credit uplift, he insisted that
the governmentâs plan to increase employment and wages was working. The debate about the cost of
living is likely to be a major feature of our politics as we head into the
autumn and winter. Todayâs 'deputy' PMQs was a chance to
rehearse the arguments before the parties head off for their respective
conferences. The final question comes from Labour MP Anna McMorrin. She asks Dominic Raab - who is justice secretary as well as deputy prime minister - if he will deliver a Victimsâ Bill. Raab says looked at plans ""on day one"" in his new post. He lists investments the government has made and says Labour voted against the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill. He says: ""You can't stand up for victims unless you stand up for tough sentencing"", he says. And that's it for today's deputy PMQs. Conservative MP Derek Thomas says he and fellow Cornish MPs want the seasonal agricultural workers visa scheme urgently renewed for next year - which he says would cover 30,000 people. Dominic Raab says the home secretary is being lobbied from ""various quarters"" and is very mindful of the impact of seasonal workers. He says the government will ""get the right balance"". Labour's George Howarth, who's just returned from illness, says ""town halls know better than Whitehall"" when it comes to levelling up. He wants to know if the PM will host a cross-party summit in Downing Street with local government representatives and mayors to discuss how they can be empowered to unlock potential? Raab welcomes him back and says the agenda for levelling up has got to be a team effort with central and local government and mayors all involved. He says he supports the spirit of the question and will do everything he can to work with him. DUP's Carla Lockhart attacks what she calls the ""ill-informed and partisan comments"" from the US President. During a meeting with Boris Johnson, Joe Bidenwarned that peacein Northern Ireland must not be jeopardised as a result of complications caused by Brexit. She argues that ""far from defending the Belfast agreement, the Northern Ireland Protocol is the single greatest danger to the Northern Ireland institutions"". ""A solution that restores Northern Ireland's place in the UK's internal markets is the only way to avert the collapse of the institutions,"" she says adding ""a solution must be found in weeks rather than months."" Dominic Raab replies that there needs to be ""a smart, pragmatic approach"" and tells MPs that ""the president understands our view."" Conservative Dehenna Davison says much of the reason why she is standing in the chamber as an MP is to do withthe death of her father from a single-punch assault. He is just one of many victims she says, and why she is marking ""one punch awareness week"". Will Raab lend his support she asks by joining her immediately after PMQs as supporters gather in Westminster Hall? Raab says he knows how much the campaign means to her personally and ""of course"" he will join her. Labour's Barry Sheerman notes that the deputy prime minister represents one of the wealthiest constituencies in the country (that's Esher and Walton in Surrey). He asks if he ""really"" believes in levelling-up and the redistribution of wealth in the country. He also seeks assurances that Channel 4 will stay in Leeds and in the public sector. Dominic Raab replies that the levelling up agenda is not just about helping the Midlands and the north of England. He says London and the south-east will also benefit because pressure on resources will be eased. SNP's Deidre Brock asks exactly what does the UK government have against the Scottish government requiring real living wages for Scottish workers  and net zero obligations in its green ports? Raab says net zero is ""at the heart of everything we do"". He says ministers have increased the national living wage to say the full-time worker Â£400 a year. The SNP Westminster deputy leader
calls for an âemergency energy paymentâ to help people on lower pay. Kirsten Oswald blames a âtoxic combinationâ of cuts, tax rises and the âgrowing cost of Brexitâ. She claims energy bills could
âskyrocketâ by Â£550 per household. Deputy PM Dominic Raab says several issues she raises were devolved to the Scottish government and he lists a
series of financial help to lower paid families. She says his answer was âdisappointing
and perplexingâ and adds that âwarm words donât heat homesâ. He calls on her to ""stop this scaremongering"".  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played ""This is a very important trip for us"": Boris Johnson and Joe Biden hold face-to-face talks Joe Biden has played down the chances of a post-Brexit free trade deal between the US and UK, as he held talks with Boris Johnson at the White House. The US president said he would discuss the issue ""a little bit"" with the UK prime minister, adding: ""We're going to have to work that through."" Downing Street said a direct deal with the US remained the ""priority"". But UK ministers are pondering joining an existing North American trade pact instead, the BBC understands. Mr Biden and Mr Johnson also discussed Northern Ireland, climate change and Afghanistan during the 90-minute meeting. The UK is keen to strike free trade deals around the world in the wake of leaving the European Union's single market - including with the US, with which annual trade was worthan estimated $273bn (Â£200bn),externalin 2019. A deal would encourage more business between the two countries by making it cheaper, usually by reducing or eliminating taxes called tariffs. How many trade deals has the UK done? BBC specialists on the prospects for UK-US trade Biden meets Boris: Shared interests but bumps remain Biden in new protocol warning over Northern Ireland But Mr Johnson, echoing Mr Biden, downplayed chances of securing agreement with the US before the next general election, saying: ""The Americans do negotiate very hard."" Environment Secretary George Eustice told Sky News: ""We still very much hope to be able to put together an agreement with the United States. We are not putting timescales on it."" ""It's just not a priority for the US administration,"" he added. Mr Johnson highlighted the decision to lift the ban on British beef, and Downing Street is increasingly confident that there could soon be a favourable decision lifting the export ban on lamb. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office before the talks, Mr Biden said: ""We're going to talk a little bit about trade today and we're going to have to work that through."" He did not counter the assertion from his predecessor Barack Obama that the UK would have to join ""the back of the queue"" in seeking a trade deal after Brexit. It's really clear from both sides that there is no rapid path to a trade deal - the opportunity that used to be lauded by Brexiteers and by President Trump. Mr Johnson hinted at that realism in his curtain-raiser conversations on his way over here. And the president pretty much confirmed that in the meeting in the Oval Office. The UK seems no longer to want to believe, or pretend, that doing business in a major deal is top of their list. Instead, while the government is still officially pursuing a stand-alone deal with the US there's a twin track with a more incremental approach - there have already been changes to whisky tariffs and British beef. But No 10 is now hopeful that the Americans are seriously considering changing tack on British lamb. Read more from Laurahere. A source familiar with the government's thinking told the BBC the UK could negotiate entry into an existing trade arrangement between the US, Canada and Mexico - the USMCA - set up after former US President Donald Trump tore up its predecessor, NAFTA. ""There are a variety of different ways to do this,"" the source said. ""The question is whether the US administration is ready. The ball is in the US's court. It takes two to tango."" Joe Biden urges unity amid tensions with allies Hotdogs and hand-holding: The US-UK relationship history Elsewhere, Downing Street said Mr Johnson and Mr Biden agreed all diplomatic and humanitarian methods must be used to stop conditions getting worse in Afghanistan. The leaders said any international recognition of the Taliban must be contingent on the group respecting human rights. This followed arequest by the Taliban to address world leaders at the United Nations summitin New York this week. Brexit gave the UK the freedom to strike its own trade deals - and accounting for Â£1 in every Â£6 of British trade, a pact with the US was the ultimate prize. But Whitehall officials have for months been scrabbling for an alternative after the Biden administration indicated it was in no hurry to resume talks.

Even if the UK does want to sign up to USMCA, it may still be at the back of a queue - simply to get its application considered. Before the meeting, Mr Biden alsoissued a fresh warning to the UK that peace in Northern Ireland must not be jeopardisedas a result of complications caused by Brexit. He made it clear he had concerns about the Irish border, amid continuing issues withNorthern Ireland Protocol- the arrangement which helps prevent checks along the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The pair also discussed the newUK, US and Australia security pactin the Asia-Pacific region, with No 10 describing it as an example of ""shared values and approach to the world"". The meeting, taking place on the sidelines of the UN summit, involved the traditional exchange of gifts. Mr Biden gave the prime minister a framed photo of their first meeting in Cornwall at the G7 summit in June, and a White House-branded watch. Mr Johnson presented the president with a signed copy of a book written by British astronaut Tim Peake, with an inscription expressing hopes that it ""provides a reminder of what we're fighting to save as our countries tackle climate change together"". The prime minister's gift comes weeks ahead of the COP26 summit in Glasgow, which is seen as a crucial moment to bring climate change under control. Earlier, Mr Biden announced the US would double its climate finance pledge and increase funding for developing countries to $11.4bn (Â£8.3bn) by 2024. Mr Johnson said the US had ""stepped up to the plate"" with what he called a ""massive contribution"" towards the $100bn (Â£73bn) goal for countries to raise.

"Global chemicals firm Ineos has announced it will invest Â£1bn in cutting greenhouse emissions at its petrochemical plant in Grangemouth. The plan is to power the plant with hydrogen made from natural gas, while capturing carbon dioxide. The CO2 could then be pumped via a pipeline to St Fergus in Aberdeenshire and stored beneath the North Sea. The industrial site at Grangemouth is currently one of Scotland's biggest polluters. Fresh bid to capture emissions from Peterhead power station Government sets out Â£1bn plan to cut carbon emissions The announcement is the next phase of the company's road map to deliver emissions savings of more than 60% across the site by 2030, as Scotland works towards becoming net zero by 2045. Ineos says it has already achieved a 37% reduction in net CO2 emissions since acquiring the site in 2005. The Â£1bn investment is in addition to more than Â£500m spent on projects currently being implemented at Grangemouth. One of those is a new energy plant due to be completed in late 2023 which will supply energy to all site operations and drive down emissions by at least 150,000 tonnes of CO2 per year. The Grangemouth refinery is a joint venture formed between Ineos and PetroChina in 2011. As Scotland's only crude oil refinery, Petroineos is the primary supplier of aviation fuel for Scotland's main airports and the major supplier of petrol and diesel across Scotland's central belt, as well as in Northern Ireland and Northern England. Carbon capture and storage has been in development in Scotland for some considerable time. After the failed plan to attach it to Peterhead power station, the ""acorn project"" was born. It's been examining other uses to which the technology can be put. Using St Fergus in north east Scotland as a base, they have been looking around for partners. As one of Scotland's most polluting sites, Grangemouth has seemed one of the most obvious. The National Grid is already looking at using existing pipelines which transport gas from St Fergus to the industrial heartlands of central Scotland and putting them into reverse. All it has needed is money and today's announcement provides just that. The announcement comes just over a month before world leaders arrive in Scotland for the COP26 climate change summit. Some environmental groups are sceptical about carbon capture as part of a strategy for tackling the global climate emergency. Friends of the Earth Scotland campaigner Alex Lee described it as ""just another distraction tactic"", adding there was an ""urgent need"" to end fossil fuel production, scale-up renewable energy and invest in green jobs. ""Hydrogen technology enthusiasts fail to mention that it is wildly expensive, inefficient and is not zero carbon,"" they added. Ineos, however, says its road map highlights its commitment to supporting the goals ofthe Paris Accordand helping the Scottish government in its drive for a ""just transition"" to a net zero economy. The Scottish government's net zero secretary, Michael Matheson, welcomed the investment. ""This will not only drive forward innovation and diversification to tackle emissions at Grangemouth, but will also support the decarbonisation of other sectors, sites and regions across Scotland,"" he said. The UK government has promised support for four carbon capture and storage projects by the end of the decade, and Mr Matheson said he hoped the Ineos investment would secure some of this funding. ""Grangemouth, and Ineos itself, already holds a wealth of experience in engineering solutions and hydrogen production, and this new investment holds great potential for the future of Grangemouth, as well as the vital jobs that are located there, as part of our just transition to net zero,"" he said. Stuart Collings, the CEO of Ineos O&P UK added: ""Hydrogen will play a very important role in the decarbonisation of our manufacturing plants. Building the infrastructure for large scale utilisation of hydrogen creates a foundation to achieve net zero by 2045 and enables wider use of hydrogen by Ineos and others in and around Grangemouth."" Five Ineos sites at Grangemouth released around 3.2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in 2019, making it the largest climate polluter in the country, according to figures from the Scottish Environment and Protection Agency (Sepa). The power company SSE ranked as second-worst, with its gas power station at Peterhead emitting around 1.6 million tonnes that year. Terry A'Hearn, chief executive of Sepa, said: ""As Scotland's environmental watchdog, Sepa has an active and ongoing programme of engagement with Ineos. ""We remain focused on both addressing environmental compliance and in supporting and welcoming transformational innovation and investment wherever it occurs to help Scotland to continue its journey towards net zero.""

"Melbourne's popular Chapel St shopping precinct was among areas damaged A 5.9 magnitude earthquake has rattled southeast Australia, damaging buildings in the city of Melbourne. The earthquake happened about 09:15 local time (23:15 GMT) on Wednesday at Mansfield, not far from the Victorian state capital. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said ""we have had no reports of serious injuries and that is very good news"". The earthquake was also felt in neighbouring South Australia and New South Wales (NSW). It was followed by two aftershocks of 4.0 and 3.1 magnitude. While this is one of Australia's largest earthquakes in recent years, it has not caused significant damage. Speaking from the US, Mr Morrison noted earthquakes were uncommon in Australia and they ""can be a very, very disturbing event"". Melbourne is home to about five million people Victoria's State Emergency Service warned residents to be alert for possible aftershocks. ""If you are located in Victoria, you are in danger. Expect aftershocks, stay away from damaged buildings and other hazards. Avoid driving, except for emergencies,"" the authority said. Surgeon Sameer Thakur said he had been performing a heart bypass operation in Geelong, near Melbourne, when the quake hit. ""We're sort of in the crux of the operation and we just felt the whole operating table move,"" he told BBC Newsday. ""Looking around the room, all the IV poles were moving and some of the clamps that we have, they were all shaking."" He said ""fortunately we were at a stage where we could come to a halt"" until the shaking stopped, allowing them to complete the surgery. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation shared a clip of its breakfast TV presenters reacting in the studio as the earthquake hit. This video can not be played Watch the moment an earthquake shakes Australian TV studio ""Is it an earthquake or a structural thing?"" presenter Michael Rowland was later shown asking producers. ""Let's goâ¦ that was a big one."" Several high-rise towers and a city hospital were also briefly evacuated, residents reported. Some city tram lines had been suspended due to damage. South Australia Premier Stephen Marshall said his state had felt aftershocks. One federal MP, Michael McCormack, said the ""ground [was] shaking violently"" in Wagga Wagga, NSW. Large earthquakes are uncommon in Australia because the continent lies centrally on a tectonic plate. This quake struck at a shallow depth of 10km (6.5 miles), according to Geosciences Australia. It was initially measured at 6.0 magnitude before being revised to 5.9. The geoscience agency says Australia experiences a potentially damaging earthquake - defined as above 6.0 magnitude - about every 10 years. Melbourne, the country's second largest city, is home to about five million people. The city is currently in lockdown due to a recent wave of coronavirus cases.

"Covishield has been added to the UK's list of recognised vaccines, recipients of which are able to enter the country without isolating from next month But its still unclear whether Indian travellers or those from African countries, including Kenya, which use also Covishield, will avoid the need to isolate They are not listed among the countries whose citizens will be recognised as vaccinated by the UK even if they have had two doses However, the United Arab Emirates has been added to this list this morning, so travellers from there will not have to isolate in the UK Global cases fell significantly to 3.6 million last week from 4 million the week before, WHO reports Brazil's health minister has tested positive for Covid-19, after attending the UN General Assembly in New York Pret A Manger aims to hire 3,000 staff by the end of 2022 after cutting the same number of jobs last year Edited by Martha Buckley Speaking of new UK data, there's good news on the latest hospital figures, which are the lowest in six weeks. The total patient count for people in hospital with Covid has also been updated and stood at 7,567 yesterday - the lowest figure for 18 days.  It was above 8,000 every day last week. The numbers in ventilator beds have also fallen. After being above 1,000 throughout September they now stand at 943, after falling in recent days. The government has reported 34,460 new coronavirus cases in figures released today. A further 166 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test were also reported. The case figures are a jump from the 31,564 new cases recorded yesterday, though deaths fell from 203 on Tuesday. As we reported earlier, there are protests in India as it has not been added to the list of countries where people fully jabbed with an approved vaccine can avoid having to isolate if they want to travel to the UK. Many other countries are affected after the UK government clarified the jab widely distributed by Covax - Covishield - was an approved vaccine but arrivals from some places were not added to the exempt-from-quarantine list. Covishield is the Indian-made AstraZeneca jab and identical to the one used in the UK. The Kenyan and British governments say they are working on a system to recognise Covid vaccine certificates issued in both countries, to facilitate travel between them. Under the UK's new rules effective from 4 October, fully vaccinated people from countries that are not on the red list will be exempt from the compulsory quarantine. But despite being removed from the UK's red list, Kenyans intending to travel there will still have to take a test three days before travelling, quarantine for 10 days on arrival, as well as pay for Covid tests while in isolation. People from other African countries that remain on the UK red list have also criticised the new travel rules saying they are discriminatory.

Deputy chief medical officer for England Professor Jonathan Van-Tam tells the Education Committee the dominant Delta variant is 60% more infectious than the Alpha variant, so it is really quite likely that teenagers will be infected at some point. He adds that he has in mind particularly the impact of being ill at a time not of their choosing, such as around their GCSEs. ""Because the Delta variant is so infectious we're not looking at a theoretical risk of children 12 to 17 becoming infected. I think it is really quite inevitable that they will be so at some point."" England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty and his deputy Jonathan Van-Tam are answering questions from the Education Committee. Prof Whitty says children are currently driving the spread of the virus, with ""substantial transmission"" in children. The 12-17 age group is the highest transmission group ""as far as we can tell"", he says. All children in that age group are due to be offered a Covid-19 vaccine - a decision Whitty insists has not been
made for political reasons or for the benefit of more vulnerable
adults. Asked about vaccination he says the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) and the chief medical officers agree the risk to children from Covid is small and the risk of vaccination is small. But he says it is the view of the JCVI that the benefits of vaccinating them are marginally greater than the potential for harm. He adds that vaccinating children would help prevent disruption in schools. ""The great majority of children who have not currently had
Covid are going to get it at some point,"" he says. ""It won't be necessary in the next two or three months but
they will get it sooner or later because this is incredibly
infectious... vaccination will reduce that risk."" Boris Johnson is in New York for the UN General Assembly No 10 says Boris Johnson is fully vaccinated - after being asked whether the prime minister had taken any extra precautions since coming into contact with a positive coronavirus case at the United Nations general assembly (UNGA). According to reports, Brazil's health minister Marcelo Queiroga has tested positive for Covid and gone into isolation, only 24 hours after being filmed shaking hands with Johnson in New York on Monday. Asked whether the prime minister had taken a Covid test since Queiroga's result, a spokesman for the prime minister says there are ""strict"" Covid measures in place at UNGA ""which the prime minister will obviously adhere to"". ""As you know he is double jabbed,"" he adds. An unvaccinated former councillor who became seriously ill with Covidfeared his mother would die after she caught the virus from him. Andrew Girvan, 48, was infected at the start of August and within a week 19 family members had the virus, including his grandparents and six-year-old daughter.

""To think that you've given your mum something that could eventually kill her isn't a nice place to be."" He says ""procrastination"" got in the way of getting his jab. As we've heard a bit earlier today, PCR tests for fully
vaccinated travellers arriving in the UK will be replaced by lateral flow
tests undernew foreign travel rules. But a leading immunologist says it is ""critical"" that the government ensures at-home testing is overseen by professional and any positive tests are screened for variants of concern. Professor Denis Kinane, immunologist and founding scientist at Cignpost Diagnostics, says: âIf we are to use lateral flow, letâs make it as robust as we can, which means

From October, people will need proof they have had two doses of vaccine to enter certain venues and large events. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says the scheme will help reduce transmission of the virus and keep clubs open. But the Night Time Industries Association Scotland says there are ""serious flaws"" with the plans. The government's definition of a nightclub is a venue which is open between midnight and 05:00, serves alcohol, and which has a designated area for dancing and provides live or recorded music for this purpose. However, industry groups have voiced concerns that the definition could also cover arange of other hospitality venues, including bars, pubs and hotel function rooms. As policy makers look for creative ways to encourage people to get their vaccines, Romania's government has announced a new vaccination lottery. Any fully-vaccinated residents with an EU digital Covid certificate can enter the scheme, which is running from 1 October until the end of the year. A total of 19 draws will be made during the period, with 1,139 prizes totalling 15m Romanian leu ($3.6m; Â£2.6m). Dozens of other weekly prizes will also be given out, some up to 500,000 Romanian leu (Â£118,433; Â£86,825). Funding for the lottery will be given by Romania's economic ministry. âIn this epidemiological context, with significant increases in the number of people infected with Covid-19, it is important to support the vaccination process, including by granting rewards,â said Cseke Attila, Romania's interim health minister,in a statement on Monday.,external Authorities are struggling with vaccine hesitancy in the eastern European country. Just over a quarter of eligible citizens have been fully vaccinated - one of the lowest rates in the EU. Officials have blamed the low pick-up on logistical issues, and a general mistrust of medicine, made worse by online fake news. Hello and thanks for following our rolling coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. If you're just joining us, here are some of the biggest developments:  The World Health Organisation says that the global number of Covid-19 cases continued to fall last week. In its latest update,external, the UN health body said 3.6 million new cases were reported last week, down from 4 million the week before. It's the first substantial drop in over two months, with infections falling in every region of the world. There were major decreases in two regions especially: the Middle East, with a 22% fall, and a 16% drop in south east Asia. Most cases were reported in the US, the UK, India, Turkey and the Philippines. Global coronavirus-related deaths also declined 7% to just under 60,000. The WHO has revised its list of ""variants of interest"" and said it is tracking Lamba and Mu variants. Both have a Latin American origin, but haven't yet caused widespread epidemics. Meanwhile the Delta variant has spread to 185 countries. We've got a bit more detail now on Transport Secretary Grant Shapps's comments to the Transport Committee. Earlier, he said the government was working as ""quickly as possible"" to remove PCR Covid testing for international travellers and to replacethe PCR test taken two days after arrival with a cheaper and simpler lateral flow test. The expense of paying for private PCR testing is widely blamed for discouraging people from travelling abroad - withmost private providers charging above Â£60 for PCR tests and Â£30 for lateral flow tests. The government has warned more than 80 providers over misleading prices. Asked why the switch from PCR to lateral flow tests for arrivals into England would not happen until the end of October, Shapps said it would take several weeks to implement because private testing firms did not have enough lateral flow tests to meet demand. âThis is a Department of Health [and Social Care] responsibility rather than mine, but my understanding is that the ramp up of supply of lateral flow through the private testing sector has some way to go in as much as they have been almost entirely involved in providing PCRs currently,â he says. When questioned by Ben Bradshaw MP about why this was an issue as many test providers also offered lateral flow tests, Shapps responded that he thought it was a question of scale. âWe go from a situation where they are providing low number of thousands to probably millions of tests very quickly and need a few weeks to scale up on it,â he said. The transport secretary could not provide a more specific date for the switch but said his Department of Health colleagues were aware of the upcoming October half-term school holidays and understood the speed required to bring in the changes. Scottish tourism bodies are worried that visitors from overseas will be put off by the Covid-testing requirements Scotland's next tourism season is at ""serious risk"" becauserigorous Covid-testing requirements are being retainedfor international visitors, industry leaders have claimed. Visitor testing rules arebeing relaxed in Englandbut the Scottish government has raised health concerns. The Scottish Tourism Alliance claims the divergence is harming its industry. The Scottish government said it would be guided by clinical advice as well as economic implications. The Scottish Tourism Alliance has put its name to an open letter signed by more than 40 tourism businesses calling for an urgent meeting with the Scottish government. SinceCovid restrictions lifted in England on 19 July, people have been told they no longer have to work from home. However, there have been warnings that this could change if there is a surge in coronavirus cases this winter. Staff in the rest of the UK are still advised to remain at home where possible. The government'sCovid Autumn and Winter Plan for England,externalhas two proposals. Much ofPlan Afocuses onthe vaccine rollout: But if the NHS struggles,Plan B(or parts of it) could start - including advice to work from home again for ""a limited period"". Some businesses - but not all - have embraced the remote-working model seen during the pandemic, with some firms putting in place hybrid working arrangements that would see employees work part of the week from home. Other companies have said they want workers to return to the office or workplace full-time. You can ask to continue to work from home by making a flexible working request, but employers don't have to agree, even if you've worked from home throughout the pandemic. The government is expected to launch a consultation shortly onproposals to give all employees the right to request flexible working as soon as they start a job. At the moment, workers have to wait for six months. You can read morehere.

Officials said some sites would be shut for up to two weeks after construction workers and other protesters clashed. Property was damaged and police said several people were arrested. Hundreds gathered in Melbourne for another anti-vaccination protest on Tuesday, setting off flares and reportedly throwing urine at reporters.

"This video can not be played ""This is a very important trip for us"": Boris Johnson and Joe Biden hold face-to-face talks Joe Biden has played down the chances of a post-Brexit free trade deal between the US and UK, as he held talks with Boris Johnson at the White House. The US president said he would discuss the issue ""a little bit"" with the UK prime minister, adding: ""We're going to have to work that through."" Downing Street said a direct deal with the US remained the ""priority"". But UK ministers are pondering joining an existing North American trade pact instead, the BBC understands. Mr Biden and Mr Johnson also discussed Northern Ireland, climate change and Afghanistan during the 90-minute meeting. The UK is keen to strike free trade deals around the world in the wake of leaving the European Union's single market - including with the US, with which annual trade was worthan estimated $273bn (Â£200bn),externalin 2019. A deal would encourage more business between the two countries by making it cheaper, usually by reducing or eliminating taxes called tariffs. How many trade deals has the UK done? BBC specialists on the prospects for UK-US trade Biden meets Boris: Shared interests but bumps remain Biden in new protocol warning over Northern Ireland But Mr Johnson, echoing Mr Biden, downplayed chances of securing agreement with the US before the next general election, saying: ""The Americans do negotiate very hard."" Environment Secretary George Eustice told Sky News: ""We still very much hope to be able to put together an agreement with the United States. We are not putting timescales on it."" ""It's just not a priority for the US administration,"" he added. Mr Johnson highlighted the decision to lift the ban on British beef, and Downing Street is increasingly confident that there could soon be a favourable decision lifting the export ban on lamb. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office before the talks, Mr Biden said: ""We're going to talk a little bit about trade today and we're going to have to work that through."" He did not counter the assertion from his predecessor Barack Obama that the UK would have to join ""the back of the queue"" in seeking a trade deal after Brexit. It's really clear from both sides that there is no rapid path to a trade deal - the opportunity that used to be lauded by Brexiteers and by President Trump. Mr Johnson hinted at that realism in his curtain-raiser conversations on his way over here. And the president pretty much confirmed that in the meeting in the Oval Office. The UK seems no longer to want to believe, or pretend, that doing business in a major deal is top of their list. Instead, while the government is still officially pursuing a stand-alone deal with the US there's a twin track with a more incremental approach - there have already been changes to whisky tariffs and British beef. But No 10 is now hopeful that the Americans are seriously considering changing tack on British lamb. Read more from Laurahere. A source familiar with the government's thinking told the BBC the UK could negotiate entry into an existing trade arrangement between the US, Canada and Mexico - the USMCA - set up after former US President Donald Trump tore up its predecessor, NAFTA. ""There are a variety of different ways to do this,"" the source said. ""The question is whether the US administration is ready. The ball is in the US's court. It takes two to tango."" Joe Biden urges unity amid tensions with allies Hotdogs and hand-holding: The US-UK relationship history Elsewhere, Downing Street said Mr Johnson and Mr Biden agreed all diplomatic and humanitarian methods must be used to stop conditions getting worse in Afghanistan. The leaders said any international recognition of the Taliban must be contingent on the group respecting human rights. This followed arequest by the Taliban to address world leaders at the United Nations summitin New York this week. Brexit gave the UK the freedom to strike its own trade deals - and accounting for Â£1 in every Â£6 of British trade, a pact with the US was the ultimate prize. But Whitehall officials have for months been scrabbling for an alternative after the Biden administration indicated it was in no hurry to resume talks. Joining the USMCA arrangement already agreed by the US, Canada and Mexico could give the UK deeper benefits on some goods and digital trade with North American economies. But it has limited coverage of the UK's biggest strength when it comes to selling to America, namely services. Economists say the overall gains from joining USMCA may be very limited, perhaps less than 0.1% of GDP America's price of admission may include a hurdle already encountered: standards surrounding food and agricultural goods. For President Biden is explicit that his priority is US workers, not least its farmers. He is also clear that domestic issues take precedence. Even if the UK does want to sign up to USMCA, it may still be at the back of a queue - simply to get its application considered. Before the meeting, Mr Biden alsoissued a fresh warning to the UK that peace in Northern Ireland must not be jeopardisedas a result of complications caused by Brexit. He made it clear he had concerns about the Irish border, amid continuing issues withNorthern Ireland Protocol- the arrangement which helps prevent checks along the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The pair also discussed the newUK, US and Australia security pactin the Asia-Pacific region, with No 10 describing it as an example of ""shared values and approach to the world"". The meeting, taking place on the sidelines of the UN summit, involved the traditional exchange of gifts. Mr Biden gave the prime minister a framed photo of their first meeting in Cornwall at the G7 summit in June, and a White House-branded watch. Mr Johnson presented the president with a signed copy of a book written by British astronaut Tim Peake, with an inscription expressing hopes that it ""provides a reminder of what we're fighting to save as our countries tackle climate change together"". The prime minister's gift comes weeks ahead of the COP26 summit in Glasgow, which is seen as a crucial moment to bring climate change under control. Earlier, Mr Biden announced the US would double its climate finance pledge and increase funding for developing countries to $11.4bn (Â£8.3bn) by 2024. Mr Johnson said the US had ""stepped up to the plate"" with what he called a ""massive contribution"" towards the $100bn (Â£73bn) goal for countries to raise.

The total patient count for people in hospital with Covid has also been updated and stood at 7,567 yesterday - the lowest figure for 18 days.  It was above 8,000 every day last week. The numbers in ventilator beds have also fallen. After being above 1,000 throughout September they now stand at 943, after falling in recent days. The government has reported 34,460 new coronavirus cases in figures released today. A further 166 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test were also reported. The case figures are a jump from the 31,564 new cases recorded yesterday, though deaths fell from 203 on Tuesday. As we reported earlier, there are protests in India as it has not been added to the list of countries where people fully jabbed with an approved vaccine can avoid having to isolate if they want to travel to the UK. Many other countries are affected after the UK government clarified the jab widely distributed by Covax - Covishield - was an approved vaccine but arrivals from some places were not added to the exempt-from-quarantine list. Covishield is the Indian-made AstraZeneca jab and identical to the one used in the UK.

Any fully-vaccinated residents with an EU digital Covid certificate can enter the scheme, which is running from 1 October until the end of the year. A total of 19 draws will be made during the period, with 1,139 prizes totalling 15m Romanian leu ($3.6m; Â£2.6m). Dozens of other weekly prizes will also be given out, some up to 500,000 Romanian leu (Â£118,433; Â£86,825). Funding for the lottery will be given by Romania's economic ministry. âIn this epidemiological context, with significant increases in the number of people infected with Covid-19, it is important to support the vaccination process, including by granting rewards,â said Cseke Attila, Romania's interim health minister,in a statement on Monday.,external Authorities are struggling with vaccine hesitancy in the eastern European country. Just over a quarter of eligible citizens have been fully vaccinated - one of the lowest rates in the EU. Officials have blamed the low pick-up on logistical issues, and a general mistrust of medicine, made worse by online fake news. Hello and thanks for following our rolling coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. If you're just joining us, here are some of the biggest developments:  The World Health Organisation says that the global number of Covid-19 cases continued to fall last week. In its latest update,external, the UN health body said 3.6 million new cases were reported last week, down from 4 million the week before. It's the first substantial drop in over two months, with infections falling in every region of the world. There were major decreases in two regions especially: the Middle East, with a 22% fall, and a 16% drop in south east Asia. Most cases were reported in the US, the UK, India, Turkey and the Philippines. Global coronavirus-related deaths also declined 7% to just under 60,000. The WHO has revised its list of ""variants of interest"" and said it is tracking Lamba and Mu variants. Both have a Latin American origin, but haven't yet caused widespread epidemics. Meanwhile the Delta variant has spread to 185 countries. We've got a bit more detail now on Transport Secretary Grant Shapps's comments to the Transport Committee. Earlier, he said the government was working as ""quickly as possible"" to remove PCR Covid testing for international travellers and to replacethe PCR test taken two days after arrival with a cheaper and simpler lateral flow test. The expense of paying for private PCR testing is widely blamed for discouraging people from travelling abroad - withmost private providers charging above Â£60 for PCR tests and Â£30 for lateral flow tests. The government has warned more than 80 providers over misleading prices. Asked why the switch from PCR to lateral flow tests for arrivals into England would not happen until the end of October, Shapps said it would take several weeks to implement because private testing firms did not have enough lateral flow tests to meet demand. âThis is a Department of Health [and Social Care] responsibility rather than mine, but my understanding is that the ramp up of supply of lateral flow through the private testing sector has some way to go in as much as they have been almost entirely involved in providing PCRs currently,â he says. When questioned by Ben Bradshaw MP about why this was an issue as many test providers also offered lateral flow tests, Shapps responded that he thought it was a question of scale. âWe go from a situation where they are providing low number of thousands to probably millions of tests very quickly and need a few weeks to scale up on it,â he said. The transport secretary could not provide a more specific date for the switch but said his Department of Health colleagues were aware of the upcoming October half-term school holidays and understood the speed required to bring in the changes. Scottish tourism bodies are worried that visitors from overseas will be put off by the Covid-testing requirements Scotland's next tourism season is at ""serious risk"" becauserigorous Covid-testing requirements are being retainedfor international visitors, industry leaders have claimed. Visitor testing rules arebeing relaxed in Englandbut the Scottish government has raised health concerns. The Scottish Tourism Alliance claims the divergence is harming its industry. The Scottish government said it would be guided by clinical advice as well as economic implications. The Scottish Tourism Alliance has put its name to an open letter signed by more than 40 tourism businesses calling for an urgent meeting with the Scottish government. SinceCovid restrictions lifted in England on 19 July, people have been told they no longer have to work from home. However, there have been warnings that this could change if there is a surge in coronavirus cases this winter. Staff in the rest of the UK are still advised to remain at home where possible. The government'sCovid Autumn and Winter Plan for England,externalhas two proposals. Much ofPlan Afocuses onthe vaccine rollout: But if the NHS struggles,Plan B(or parts of it) could start - including advice to work from home again for ""a limited period"". Some businesses - but not all - have embraced the remote-working model seen during the pandemic, with some firms putting in place hybrid working arrangements that would see employees work part of the week from home. Other companies have said they want workers to return to the office or workplace full-time. You can ask to continue to work from home by making a flexible working request, but employers don't have to agree, even if you've worked from home throughout the pandemic. The government is expected to launch a consultation shortly onproposals to give all employees the right to request flexible working as soon as they start a job. At the moment, workers have to wait for six months. You can read morehere.

"The price of CO2 used to produce food and drink will be five times higher, under a deal to restart production. But there will be no ""significant impact"" on prices in supermarkets, the government says. Food grade CO2 is used for hundreds of products: to carbonate water, soft drinks and alcoholic drinks to dispense drinks and beers in pubs to promote the growth of plants - such as cucumbers - in greenhouses to stun pigs and chickens before slaughter for packaging meats, baby foods, fresh foods and baked products (CO2 extends shelf life by preventing bacteria) to keep food fresh in transport (CO2 is used in the form of dry ice and snow) Source: Food and Drink Federation/Global Counsel CF Industries produces CO2 as a by-product of its main product, fertiliser. Its two main plants, on Teesside and in Cheshire, had stopped work because of rises in wholesale gas prices. Because the fertiliser factories stopped working, there had been a cut of 60% of the UK's food-grade carbon dioxide supply. Why are gas prices rising and what if my supplier goes bust? Is the UK headed for a gas shortage this winter? It will meet the full operating costs - said to be tens of millions of pounds - of CF Industries' plant on Teesside for three weeks ""whilst the CO2 market adapts to global prices"". There will be a cap to the overall cost. As part of the deal, the food industry will have to pay five times more for carbon dioxide - with prices rising from Â£200 per tonne to Â£1,000. Environment Secretary George Eustice said the increased cost of CO2 wouldnot have a ""significant impact"" on prices. He said that while food prices were increasing because of issues including oil prices and labour shortages, carbon dioxide was ""a tiny proportion"" of overall costs. The CO2 issue has caused a ""big supply issue"", one supermarket executive told the BBC. Grocery delivery firm Ocadowarned it had ""limited stock"" of some frozen items. The Food and Drink Federation said with shoppers were likely to notice shortages in poultry, pork and bakery products. The British Retail Consortium welcomed payments to restart CO2 production, but saidtimings for the resumption of supplies would ""still be tight"". Remaining UK carbon dioxide production is being prioritised for medical uses. It is used during some invasive surgeries to stabilise body cavities, to stimulate breathing and to get rid of warts and moles. CO2 is also used by the nuclear industry as a coolant. The Timesreported,externalthat ministers were concerned that six reactors might have to close because of the supply problems. CO2 is also used commercially in fire extinguishers, for inflating life rafts and life jackets, and as a liquid solvent. Yes there was - caused by a usual summer drop in production, and a heatwave which increased demand for drinks and frozen products. At room temperature, carbon dioxide is a colourless, odourless gas. In the Earth's atmosphere, increased levels of CO2 contribute to global warming. It is naturally produced when: humans and animals breathe during combustion (for example petrol and diesel in cars) things ferment or decompose Its molecules have one carbon and two oxygen atoms, which is why its chemical formula is CO2.

"Gas and electricity bills are going up again on 1 January, when the latest energy price cap takes effect. Customers are encouraged to submit a meter reading to ensure they are charged the correct amount. The energy price cap covers 26 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and is setevery three months,externalby the energy regulator Ofgem. It fixes the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of energy on a standard - or default - tariff for a typical dual-fuel household which pays by direct debit. Between 1 January and 31 March 2025,gas prices will be capped at 6.34p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 24.86 per kWh.,external This means the annual bill for a dual-fuel direct debit household using a typical amount of energywill go up to Â£1,738 per year, an increase of Â£21 from the previous cap. Those who pay their bills every three months by cash or cheque will pay Â£1,851. Analysts at forecaster Cornwall Insight, which tracks the energy market, expect prices to fall slightly in April and October 2025, but says thathigh domestic energy prices are likely to be ""the new normal"". The cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market. Your energy bill depends on the overall amount of gas and electricity you use, and how you pay for it. The type of property you live in, how energy efficient it is, how many people live there and the weather all make a difference. The Ofgem cap is based on a ""typical household"" using 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year with a single bill for gas and electricity, settled by direct debit. The vast majority of people pay their bill this way to help spread payments across the year. Those who pay every three months by cash or cheque are charged more. Energy prices could vary at different times of day Submitting a meter reading when the cap changes means you will not be charged for estimated usage at the wrong rate. This is especially important when prices go up. Customers withworking smart metersdo not need to submit a reading as their bill is calculated automatically. Fixed-priced deals offer certainty for a set period - often a year, or longer - but if prices drop, you could be stuck at a higher price. Ofgem says customers who want the security of a set price should consider fixed deals. However, it recommends getting independent advice. The price comparison site Uswitch says it is important to check whether fixed deals have exit fees before signing up and to make sure you fully understand the terms of the contract. Because the price cap changes every three months, it is difficult to know with any certainty whether a fixed tariff is a good deal. The longer the fixed term, the greater the uncertainty. Between January and March, households on prepayment meters will pay slightly less than those on direct debit, with a typical bill of Â£1,690, a rise of Â£21 from the previous quarter. About four million households had prepayment meters in April 2024, according to Ofgem. Many have been in place for years, but some were installed more recently after customers struggled to pay higher bills. Rulesintroduced in November 2023,externalmean suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts before switching them to a meter. They cannot be installed at all in certain households. Energy firms pay out over force-fitting of meters Standing charges are a fixed daily fee to cover the costs of connecting to a supply. They are typically 61p a day for electricity and 32p a day for gas, although they vary slightly by region. Under the energy price cap, they have risen by 43% since 2019. Campaigners argue standing charges are unfair because they make up a larger proportion of the bill of low energy users. Ofgem has proposed thatenergy firms must provide a choice of price-capped tariffsfrom winter 2025, one which has a standing charge and unit rate - as is the case now - and another with no standing charge but a higher unit rate. Customers would be able to choose which suits them best. Separately, it wants a consistent approach from suppliers on how to deal with unpaid bills totalling Â£3.8bn. Changes to the winter fuel payment mean more than 10 million pensioners are not receiving the money this winter. Previously, it was paid to all pensioners in England and Wales born before 25 September 1957. However, in July, the government said future payments would be made only to those on low incomes who receivedcertain benefits, including pension credit. The 2024 payment - worth Â£200 or Â£300 depending on individual circumstances - is paid automatically to eligible pensioners. However, hundreds of thousands of people who are entitled to pension credit do not claim it, which means they will miss out on the winter fuel payment too. How much is the winter fuel payment and who can still get it? TheÂ£500m Household Support Fund,,externalwhich was introduced in September 2021 to help vulnerable customershas been extended until March 2025. TheWarm Home Discount scheme,externalcontinues to offer a discount to eligible pensioners and low income households. The government'sFuel Direct Scheme,externalcan help people to repay an energy debt directly from their benefit payments. In addition, suppliers must offer customers affordable payment plans or repayment holidays if they are struggling with bills. Most suppliers also offer hardship grants.

"High energy prices are already causing problems for households in the UK and across Europe, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine is set to make the situation worse. So where does the UK get its gas from and how much could bills rise? EU countriesget about 40% of their gas directly from Russia. The UK gets less than 5% of its gas from Russia but its gas prices are affected by fluctuations in the global markets. While Russian oil and gas exports aren't directly affected by Western sanctions, the prospect of further action by the US and EU is hitting Russian trade and pushing up gas prices globally. Thesanctions already imposedby Western nations are designed to stop Russia's banks from doing business in several major economies and trade areas. Separately Germany hasblocked the progress of Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. Experts fear that Putin may decide to retaliate by reducing gas supplies to Europe. If this were to happen wholesale costs - (ie the cost suppliers face when buying to supply their customers) - would rocket and send prices higher everywhere, including the UK. The energy cap will increase in April and could rise again in the autumn Household energy costs have been kept in check bythe price cap,external, but average household bills are expected to rise by about Â£700 to about Â£2,000 in Aprilwhen the price cap is increased, and rise again in the autumn when the price cap is again revised. Energy bills could reach Â£3,000 as oil price soars The energy regulator Ofgem agreed to increase the cap after dozens of energy firms collapsed because they could not pass on the increased wholesale costs to their customers. As a result,more than four million customers have been switched to a different supplier in the last year, often on a higher tariff. Rising energy prices have already contributed to a big surge in the UK's cost of living,with inflation at 5.5% in the 12 months to January, the highest rate since March 1992. Four cheap ways to save energy at home this winter What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? How to save energy at home and help the planet About half of the UK's gas comes directly from the North Sea. The UK has been a big producer of gas since the mid-1960s, but the amount produced has fallen since 2000 while demand continues to rise. Another third of the UK's gas comes through pipelines from Norway. The rest come mainly as liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports in tankers from Qatar, the US and others. The small amount of Russian gas the UK buys also comes in LNG form. LNG supplies are particularly sensitive to global market prices, and are sold to whoever pays the most. The government says the UK's energy bill crisis is due to high global gas prices, not security of supply. However, that could change quite rapidly if Russian gas becomes scarce, as countries that depend heavily on Russian gas will have to compete for alternative supplies. The UK also has limited storage facilities, which means it is more affected by short-term price fluctuations in the wholesale gas market than some other European countries which can hold greater reserves. The government says it is ""not complacent"" about gas supplies. It does have the power to impose emergency measures, such as ordering big industrial customers to temporarily stop using gas. Even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the market was in crisis. Colder winters in 2021 put pressure on supplies and depleted gas reserves. Those reserves would normally have been replenished in summer months but output dropped as some producers used this time to for maintenance postponed during Covid lockdowns. Meanwhile, calm weather reduced the amount of electricity generated by wind power. As a result, wholesale gas prices more than quadrupled last year. The UK has been especially badly-hit as it is one of Europe's biggest users of natural gas - 85% of homes use gas central heating, while gas also generates a third of the UK's electricity.

"The British food industry will be forced to pay five times more for carbon dioxide as part of a government deal with a US company to restart production in the UK. Environment Secretary George Eustice said carbon dioxide prices would rise from Â£200 per tonne to Â£1,000. The government has agreed to pay out tens of millions of pounds to CF Industries to reopen a plant in the UK. The closure had raised fears over food supplies and the nuclear industry. US-owned CF Industries recently shut two UK sites that produce 60% of the country's commercial carbon dioxide supplies, because of a sharp rise in gas prices. This video can not be played Ros Atkins on... the UK's rising energy bills Farms, food producers and supermarkets have warned that a shortage of carbon dioxide will lead to significant disruption to the manufacture and supply of fresh produce. The Times also reported,externalthat ministers were concerned that the UK might have to close its six advanced gas-cooled nuclear reactors, which also use CO2. The government announced late on Tuesday night that it would meet the full operating costs to run CF Industries' Billingham plant in Teesside for three weeks. The costs are expected to be in the ""low tens of millions"" and will be below Â£50m. Mr Eustice said that the deal with CF Industries ""will be not a loan, it will be a payment to underwrite some of their fixed costs"". At the end of the three-week period, it is hoped that the price of carbon dioxide will have risen sufficiently to make it economically viable for CF Industries to keep production running. Mr Eustice said the food industry would have to accept ""a big, sharp rise"" carbon dioxide prices from Â£200 to Â£1,000 a tonne. ""The critical thing was to get the production up and running expeditiously. That's why we've needed this government intervention,"" he said. ""But we've had meetings with the food industry. They all recognise that the price of carbon dioxide is going to increase substantially and when that price increases, then the market signal will be then for these plants to continue producing."" Mr Eustice insisted that the rise in cost would not have a ""significant impact"" on food prices. He said that while food prices were increasing ""due to global commodity prices, oil prices and also other factors such as labour shortages"", carbon dioxide was ""a tiny proportion"" of the industry's overall costs. CF Industries had halted two of its fertiliser factories - which produce carbon dioxide as a by-product - because of gas prices. Carbon dioxide is used in the slaughter of animals such as chickens CF Industries' Billingham plant will need up to three days to start producing new CO2. The company told the BBC it had ""no estimate"" on when its second UK plant at Ince in Cheshire would  resume production. The British Meat Processors Association said the deal to open CF Industries' Teesside plant was a ""huge relief"" and said it was now ""focused on re-establishing supplies before Friday this week, which is when around 25% of pork production was in danger of shutting down"". Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, welcomed the decision, but said the timetable to restart CF Industries' factory and begin producing carbon dioxide ""will still be tight"". He told the BBC's Today programme: ""Our understanding is that provided that carbon dioxide starts to get through to food producers by the end of the week, then we can avert major and significant disruption in our stores."" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the ""exceptional short-term arrangement"" would ensure industries that rely on a stable supply of CO2 ""have the resources they require to avoid disruption"". He said: ""With regards to the CO2 situation, it was abundant, it was very cheap and I think a lot of people were surprised at what happened."" The government intends to publish the letter from Mr Kwarteng to Tony Will, chief executive of CF Industries, which sets out the terms of the taxpayer support. Commenting on the three-week deal, Mr Kwarteng said: ""In a critical intervention you have to have a way of exiting the arrangement. ""It is not a case of just trying to nationalise it or supporting it indefinitely, and that is why in the critical period we needed to have a short term arrangement I am confident that we can get other sources of CO2 in that period. Mr Eustice said that the shortage of carbon dioxide had been caused by a ""perfect storm"" of circumstances where CF Industries had shut its two plants because ""an increase in gas price means they are not profitable"", while two other providers had closed their sites for maintenance. But the British Meat Processors Association (BMPA) said the current difficulties showed how exposed the UK is, because of its reliance on such a small number of carbon dioxide producers. ""Over many years, we have had a major consolidation of the industry resulting in sectors like food and drink, nuclear and health being reliant on a very small number of very large suppliers,"" the BMPA said. ""If a market-based solution is to be found, it will likely involve longer-term higher prices for CO2, which will be sustainable for some, but not all users of the gas."" Ian Wright, the chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, also called on the government to support other fertiliser producers and help food producers to look for alternatives to CO2. Mr Will, who flew from the US to the UK on Sunday to meet Mr Kwarteng, said: ""We look forward to working with Secretary Kwarteng and the UK government on developing a longer-term solution, including the development of alternative suppliers of CO2 for the UK market."" Farmers fear gas price crisis may spark pig cull How could the CO2 shortage hit food supplies? Gas price crisis: Government poised to step in The BBC understands that the deal with CF Industries has been drafted so that other companies who stop production because of high commodity prices will not be able to ask the government for similar help. Norwegian firm Yara has also cut production at a number of European factories, including one in Hull. This video can not be played The prime minister says he does ânot believe people will be short of foodâ amid reports of some empty supermarket shelves. Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged people not to worryabout putting food on the table this winter, amid rising energy and food bills and a cut to universal credit. Wholesale prices for gas have surged 250% since January, with a 70% rise since August alone, leading to calls for support from the industry and the collapse of some smaller energy firms. Mr Opie added that the government should also take action on other issues affecting food retailers in recent weeks, such as the shortage of HGV drivers, which has been exacerbated by the pandemic and many drivers returning to the European Union after Brexit. The government has been keen to stress that this is very much an emergency measure, time-limited, and with a cap on the amount it is prepared to pay. It had to do something. Food producers were warning that shortages would become apparent within days, at a time when supply chains have already been disrupted by other issues, such as a lack of lorry drivers. But the fact remains that it has agreed to give a large US-owned company tens of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money, just to operate one of its own plants. That isn't a particularly good look - and it has cast a glaring spotlight on the vulnerability of a key part of the economy. Now there is a three-week window for government, supermarkets and food producers to come up with a ""sustainable market-based solution"". In practice, that's likely to mean users paying more for their CO2, a cost which will ultimately be borne by consumers.

"Avro Energy and Green have collapsed, becoming the latest firms to be brought down by the sharp rise in gas prices. Combined with other recent failures, it means 1.5 million people are now facing a switch to a new, more expensive firm. All affected customers will continue to receive energy while a new supplier is appointed by regulator Ofgem. Its price cap limits how much firms can charge. Ofgem's boss earlier warned the rise in gas prices was ""unprecedented"" and meant more firms would go bust, Avro Energy, the biggest supplier to exit the market so far, has 580,000 customers, while Green has 250,000. Green, which employs 180 people, blamed ""unprecedented market conditions and regulatory failings"" for its collapse. Since the sharp rise in wholesale gas prices - which firms complain they are unable to pass on to customers because of the price cap on energy bills - a number of small companies have collapsed. They include People's Energy, Utility Point, PfP Energy and MoneyPlus Energy. Together, the recently failed companies account for more than 5% of the market, about 1.5 million customers. Meanwhile Bulb, the UK's sixth largest energy company with 1.7 million customers, is seeking financing. And another firm, Igloo, has said it is working with restructuring consultants Alvarez & Marsal. But Igloo told the BBC it had not appointed administrators. If an energy firm collapses, customers are automatically switched to a tariff provided by the new supplier. This is a payment plan agreed with the regulator Ofgem, but it may well be more expensive than the deal they had with the former company which went bust. Customers are advised to not try and switch to a new supplier until they are contacted by whoever Ofgem appoints to take over their account. Ofgem boss Jonathan Brearley, warned earlier more customers would be affected. ""We've already seen hundreds of thousands of customers affected, that may well go well above that. It's very hard for me to put a figure on it."" Appearing before the cross-party Business Committee on Wednesday, he declined to say if the number of customers that would eventually need new suppliers could run into ""millions"". Is the UK headed for a gas shortage this winter? Why are gas prices rising and what if my supplier goes bust? Gas prices: 'I'm just watching the meter go up' Mr Brearley insisted that Ofgem had plans in place to cope as the crisis developed. He told MPs that Ofgem ""war-gamed"" various scenarios. A six-fold rise in wholesale gas prices since last year meant if was likely more firms would go under, Mr Brearley said, although he said commercial talks with the firms prevented him from speculating how many. ""It's not unusual for suppliers to go out of the market,"" he said. ""I think what is different this time is that dramatic change in the costs that those suppliers are facing. ""We do expect more (suppliers) not to be able to face the circumstances we're in, but it's genuinely hard to say more than that, partly because that means predicting what may happen to the gas price."" Hundreds of thousands of savvy switchers who followed advice to shop around for a cheap energy deal will be left frustrated at the demise of suppliers of many of the most competitive tariffs. As they are automatically shifted from a bust supplier to a surviving one, they will need to put that tendency to keep switching to one side. Citizens Advice, the official consumer advocate for energy, says it is best to do nothing while that transfer is made. Any credit they have built up will be honoured. While the continuation of their energy supply is guaranteed, their old contract is not. They, and anyone else whose fixed rate is coming to an end, will find they are potentially paying hundreds of pounds more per year for their energy - although the damage is limited by Ofgem's price cap. The problem is, if they look around for anything better, right now they are likely to draw a blank. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation charity has warned that millions of low-income households will face a squeeze on their finances from October, when energy companies will be allowed to lift the maximum amount they charge for gas and electricity by as much as 12%. And from next month, Universal Credit claimants face losing Â£20 a week. Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng admitted the cut to Universal Credit could make it ""a very difficult winter"" for low-income families, and said he was speaking to Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey ""a great deal"" on the subject. Customers will still continue to receive gas or electricity even if the energy supplier goes bust. Ofgem will move your account to a new supplier, but it may take a few weeks. Your new supplier should then contact you to explain what is happening with your account While you wait to hear from your new supplier: check your current balance and - if possible - download any bills; take a photo of your meter reading If you pay by direct debit, there is no need to cancel it straight away, Citizens Advice says. Wait until your new account is set up before you cancel it If you are in credit, your money is protected and you'll be paid back. If you were in debt to the old supplier, you'll still have to pay the money back to your new supplier instead Read more about the next best steps to take here. Emma Pinchbeck said the gas crisis had exposed the need for market reforms The head of trade body Energy UK Emma Pinchbeck said earlier that the sector had been fragile for a couple of years and the current gas crisis had exposed fault-lines in the market. She said: ""There's a short-term crisis here, which is in some ways out of our control - it's to do with the gas prices - but it's been exacerbated and arguably caused by our regulatory design."" Wholesale gas prices have spiked as economies reopened from Covid-19 lockdowns and high demand for liquefied natural gas in Asia pushed down supplies to Europe. The surge in demand has sent shockwaves through industries reliant on natural gas. On Tuesday, the governmentagreed to pay out tens of millions of poundsto US fertiliser firm CF Industries to restart carbon dioxide production. Its shutdown, due to high energy costs, had sparked concerns over food shortages. Carbon dioxide, a by-product of fertiliser manufacturing, is used to stun animals, in fizzy drinks, and in food packaging.

"Sir Mick Jagger paid an emotional tribute to the band's late drummer The Rolling Stones have played their first concert since the death of their drummer Charlie Watts last month. The small warm-up show took place in Massachusetts Gillette Stadium, to an audience of about 300 people. Singer Sir Mick Jagger dedicated the show to Watts, who died of an unspecified illness at the age of 80. ""It's a bit of a poignant night for us because its the first tour in 59 years that we've done without our lovely Charlie Watts,"" he said. ""We all miss Charlie so much. We miss him as a band, we miss him as friends - on and off the stage. ""We've got so many memories of Charlie, and I'm sure some of you that have seen us before have got memories of Charlie as well. And I hope you remember him like we do."" Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

The Stones were joined on drums by Steve Jordan, a session musician who has worked with the band since the 1980s. He had been announced as a stand-in for Watts for their forthcoming US tour before his death, as the drummer recovered from a medical procedure. Jagger and Richards pay tribute to bandmate Watts Five of Charlie Watts' best drum beats Charlie Watts: Jazz man who became rock superstar Monday's invitation-only show featured 15 songs, opening with Let's Spend the Night Together before running through hits like Tumbling Dice, 19th Nervous Breakdown and (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction. They also covered the Chi-Lites' Troubles A-Comin' and played their 2020 single Living In A Ghost Town live for the first time. Watts joined the Stones in January 1963 The show was held in a tent-like structure set up on the stadium field, which is normally home to The New England Patriots. It was organised by Patriots' owner Robert Kraft, and the guest list included Governor of Massachusetts Charlie Baker, J Geils Band singer Peter Wolf and Moderna chairman Noubar Afeyan - all of whom had to show proof of vaccination to attend. The Stones had been rehearsing in Boston over the summer and, due to pandemic-related travel restrictions, were unable to attend Watts' funeral in England,The Sun reported earlier this month,external. They paid tribute to the musician online, with guitarist Keith Richards calling him ""the coolest guy I know"". Mick Jagger simply shared a photograph of Watts smiling while seated behind his drum kit.

"Boris Johnson met Joe Biden at the Oval Office in the White House With Joe Biden and the Democrats back in charge in Washington, the US was expected to strengthen ties with Europe and put the UK, to paraphrase Barack Obama, toward the back of the queue. Donald Trump's focus on transactional diplomacy and penchant for one-on-one deals was out; multilateralism was again in vogue. That's not exactly how things have played out, however. On Tuesday morning, Biden gave a speech at the United Nations emphasising the need for collective action by the community of nations. But by the evening, he was back at the White House for a one-on-one meeting with Boris Johnson, talking up a US-UK relationship that has taken on greater relevance for the Biden administration in the past few weeks. What's the view from the UK? Read Laura Kuenssberg's analysis The location conveyed as much about the importance of the meeting for the Americans as the brief opening statements and two quickly answered questions (both from British reporters chosen by Johnson, much to the consternation of US journalists). This sit-down could have been held in a New York conference room; instead it was in the Oval Office, surrounded by the trappings of US power. That sends a message. This video can not be played Watch: President Biden's first UN General Assembly speech Although Johnson earlier spoke of US-UK relations that are ""as good as they have been in decades"", there are still a few bumps in the road. The US seems uninterested in prioritising a new trade deal. Biden's ""we'll have to work that through"" comment on Tuesday wasn't exactly an enthusiastic response. The president, who regularly boasts of his Irish heritage, has also warned of what he sees as the danger Brexit poses to stability in Northern Ireland - a point he again alluded to on Tuesday. Shared priorities, however, seem to have prevailed. With Johnson, Biden has found a welcome partner in tackling climate change. And the two nations appear headed toward an even closer security relationship following the US-UK-Australia pledge to share military and intelligence assets - a development Johnson said ""has great potential"" to benefit the world. That Aukus triumvirate is almost Trumpian in its nature; an Anglophone alliance that sidelines continental Europe and positions itself to face off against Chinese territorial ambitions. China scoffs at a ""cold war mentality"". The French fume at a diplomatic snub that cost them billions in theirnixed Australian submarine deal. But Biden has a plan for his foreign policy, and it appears the UK has a prominent part in it. Tuesday's Oval Office meeting was further evidence of that.

"Newly appointed Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab takes questions in Boris Johnson's place at today's PMQs Labour's deputy party leader Angela Rayner pressed him on rising prices as she stood in for Keir Starmer Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng is appearing before a committee of MPs considering issues raised by rising gas prices He says protecting consumers from ""exorbitant prices"" is a priority, but the industry must step up to keep prices down He says companies should look at their own management, rather than ""stretch out a hand for taxpayers' money"" Jonathan Brearley from Ofgem says hundreds of thousands of customers may be left in limbo if more energy suppliers go bust The government has agreed to pay millions in operating costs for a factory to restart the production of CO2 - vital for fresh food supply CF industries halted production at two of its factories because of soaring gas prices Edited by Johanna Howitt That's where we end our coverage from Westminster for today. Our writers were Arryn Moy, Doug Falconer, Emma Owen, Kate Whannel, and Sinead Wilson. The next PMQs will be on Wednesday 20 October - as Parliament goes in to a three-week recess to make way for the political party conference season. Do join us then. Adam FlemingChief political correspondent That PMQs felt different - that is partly down to Angela Rayner's presentation style in the House of Commons. Let's be honest, she is much funnier than Keir Starmer. And I hope Dominic Raab had a good time on his holiday in Crete because that holiday is going to potentially follow him around for the rest of his political career. On the serious stuff, we are getting quite use to the battle lines between the parties. Labour is talking about the increase in energy bills, the removal of the Â£20 a week rise to universal credit, then from next April the rise in National Insurance to pay for the health and social care levy. Labour are bundling all that together saying there is going to be a cost of living crisis. The government is responding by saying we are protecting you with the energy price cap and when it comes to jobs and wages, the economy is booming for some people. Both those things might be true at the same time, but by the end of the winter which one of those narratives will have won out? Dominic Raab and Angela Rayner deputised for Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer for today's PMQs: Reality Check At Deputy Prime Ministerâs Questions, Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said to Dominic Raab: âHis government chose to cut the income of a worker on Â£18,000 a year by over Â£1,100.â She gave the example of a shop worker. To get to this figure, Â£1,040 would come from the loss of the Â£20 a week increase to universal credit. And from next April, a worker earning Â£18,000 a year would be paying an extra Â£105 in National Insurance â as part of the rise in the rate of NI to help fund health and social care announced by the government.

Dharshini DavidEconomics Correspondent Prime Minister Boris Johnson meets US President Joe Biden in the Oval Office of the White House Brexit gave the
UK the freedom to strike its own trade deals - and accounting for Â£1 in every
Â£6 of British trade, a pact with the US was the ultimate prize. But Whitehall
officials have for months been scrabbling for an alternative after the Biden
administration indicated it was in no hurry to resume talks. Joining theUnited States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)could give the UK deeper benefits on some goods and digital trade with North
American economies. But it has
limited coverage of what is the UK's biggest strength when it comes to
selling to America, namely services. Economists say the overall gains from
joining USMCA may be very limited, perhaps less than 0.1% of GDP And what would
the price be? The UK already has deals with Canada and Mexico, it would have to
rely heavily on American cooperation to join this trade club - and one where
the rules have already been set, and hasnât allowed for new members. America's price
of admission may include a hurdle already encountered: standards surrounding
food and agricultural goods For President
Biden is explicit that his priority is US workers, not least its farmers. He is also clear
that domestic issues take precedence. Even if the UK does want to sign up to
USMCA, it may still be at the back of a queue - simply to get its application
considered. Reality Check Responding to criticism from Labour that the prime minister had made ""zero progress"" in securing aUK-US free trade dealon his trip to the US, Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab said: âBecause of the engagement weâve had with the US, they have immediately given us the boost to trade and businesses by reinstating travel from the UK to the US.â Itâs true that President Biden announced this change yesterday but it wasnât just for the UK. The resumption oftravel into the US from Novemberis applies to fully vaccinated people from 33 countries. They include China, India, Brazil and most of the European Union (countries in its passport-free Schengen area). Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng also admitted that the recent
crisis in CO2 supply came as a surprise to ""a lot of people"". âWith regards to the CO2 situation, it was abundant it was very
cheap and I think a lot of people were surprised at what happened,"" he told the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee. ""We very rapidly dealt with
that situation I met with the CEO of the relevant company twice - on Sunday and
again on Monday, once each - and we have come up with a solution, which I have to
stress is very much something that is a short term support. ""There is no question of us essentially writing a cheque to
this company indefinitely."" Asked about the three-week limit on support for CF Fertilisers he says in a critical intervention you have to have a way of exiting that arrangement. ""It's not a case of just trying to nationalise it or supporting it indefinitely."" He adds: ""I'm confident that we can get other sources of CO2 in that period, there was an immediate crisis and the deal that we reached solved the immediate problem."" Down the corridor during PMQs, the Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng was still answering questions from the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee. He told the MPs that while he did not predict that gas prices ""would quadruple four times in five months"" the government does have structures in place to deal with ""extreme situations"". ""Now those structures are going to be tested and thatâs why
we are here, and thatâs why we are talking about possible contingency plansâ¦.but
I reject the idea that somehow this was completely unexpected and that we were
completely unprepared,"" he says. He adds it is ""unfair to say this somehow just happened and we were completely at sea"", but he does say there were other elements - such as the CO2 shortage - which were more novel.

Pete SaullPolitical Correspondent, BBC Westminster While the
green benches werenât as full as they usually are on a Wednesday lunchtime, the
head-to-head between the two deputies was a lively affair. Labourâs Angela Rayner is a
straight-talker - and her lines of attack prompted laughter on both sides of the
House. The Conservatives guffawed at
the suggestion that their party âdoes not careâ about working people. Rayner asked how many days someone on a low income would have to work
to pay for a luxury holiday in Crete. The former foreign secretary
faced criticism last month, when he stayed on holiday as the Taliban took control of
Afghanistan. But facing questions about
rising gas prices and the end to the universal credit uplift, he insisted that
the governmentâs plan to increase employment and wages was working. The debate about the cost of
living is likely to be a major feature of our politics as we head into the
autumn and winter. Todayâs 'deputy' PMQs was a chance to
rehearse the arguments before the parties head off for their respective
conferences. The final question comes from Labour MP Anna McMorrin. She asks Dominic Raab - who is justice secretary as well as deputy prime minister - if he will deliver a Victimsâ Bill. Raab says looked at plans ""on day one"" in his new post. He lists investments the government has made and says Labour voted against the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill. He says: ""You can't stand up for victims unless you stand up for tough sentencing"", he says. And that's it for today's deputy PMQs. Conservative MP Derek Thomas says he and fellow Cornish MPs want the seasonal agricultural workers visa scheme urgently renewed for next year - which he says would cover 30,000 people. Dominic Raab says the home secretary is being lobbied from ""various quarters"" and is very mindful of the impact of seasonal workers. He says the government will ""get the right balance"". Labour's George Howarth, who's just returned from illness, says ""town halls know better than Whitehall"" when it comes to levelling up. He wants to know if the PM will host a cross-party summit in Downing Street with local government representatives and mayors to discuss how they can be empowered to unlock potential? Raab welcomes him back and says the agenda for levelling up has got to be a team effort with central and local government and mayors all involved. He says he supports the spirit of the question and will do everything he can to work with him. DUP's Carla Lockhart attacks what she calls the ""ill-informed and partisan comments"" from the US President. During a meeting with Boris Johnson, Joe Bidenwarned that peacein Northern Ireland must not be jeopardised as a result of complications caused by Brexit. She argues that ""far from defending the Belfast agreement, the Northern Ireland Protocol is the single greatest danger to the Northern Ireland institutions"". ""A solution that restores Northern Ireland's place in the UK's internal markets is the only way to avert the collapse of the institutions,"" she says adding ""a solution must be found in weeks rather than months."" Dominic Raab replies that there needs to be ""a smart, pragmatic approach"" and tells MPs that ""the president understands our view."" Conservative Dehenna Davison says much of the reason why she is standing in the chamber as an MP is to do withthe death of her father from a single-punch assault. He is just one of many victims she says, and why she is marking ""one punch awareness week"". Will Raab lend his support she asks by joining her immediately after PMQs as supporters gather in Westminster Hall? Raab says he knows how much the campaign means to her personally and ""of course"" he will join her. Labour's Barry Sheerman notes that the deputy prime minister represents one of the wealthiest constituencies in the country (that's Esher and Walton in Surrey). He asks if he ""really"" believes in levelling-up and the redistribution of wealth in the country. He also seeks assurances that Channel 4 will stay in Leeds and in the public sector. Dominic Raab replies that the levelling up agenda is not just about helping the Midlands and the north of England. He says London and the south-east will also benefit because pressure on resources will be eased. SNP's Deidre Brock asks exactly what does the UK government have against the Scottish government requiring real living wages for Scottish workers  and net zero obligations in its green ports? Raab says net zero is ""at the heart of everything we do"". He says ministers have increased the national living wage to say the full-time worker Â£400 a year. The SNP Westminster deputy leader
calls for an âemergency energy paymentâ to help people on lower pay. Kirsten Oswald blames a âtoxic combinationâ of cuts, tax rises and the âgrowing cost of Brexitâ. She claims energy bills could
âskyrocketâ by Â£550 per household. Deputy PM Dominic Raab says several issues she raises were devolved to the Scottish government and he lists a
series of financial help to lower paid families. She says his answer was âdisappointing
and perplexingâ and adds that âwarm words donât heat homesâ. He calls on her to ""stop this scaremongering"".  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Pete SaullPolitical Correspondent, BBC Westminster While the
green benches werenât as full as they usually are on a Wednesday lunchtime, the
head-to-head between the two deputies was a lively affair. Labourâs Angela Rayner is a
straight-talker - and her lines of attack prompted laughter on both sides of the
House. The Conservatives guffawed at
the suggestion that their party âdoes not careâ about working people. Rayner asked how many days someone on a low income would have to work
to pay for a luxury holiday in Crete. The former foreign secretary
faced criticism last month, when he stayed on holiday as the Taliban took control of
Afghanistan. But facing questions about
rising gas prices and the end to the universal credit uplift, he insisted that
the governmentâs plan to increase employment and wages was working. The debate about the cost of
living is likely to be a major feature of our politics as we head into the
autumn and winter. Todayâs 'deputy' PMQs was a chance to
rehearse the arguments before the parties head off for their respective
conferences. The final question comes from Labour MP Anna McMorrin. She asks Dominic Raab - who is justice secretary as well as deputy prime minister - if he will deliver a Victimsâ Bill. Raab says looked at plans ""on day one"" in his new post. He lists investments the government has made and says Labour voted against the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill. He says: ""You can't stand up for victims unless you stand up for tough sentencing"", he says. And that's it for today's deputy PMQs. Conservative MP Derek Thomas says he and fellow Cornish MPs want the seasonal agricultural workers visa scheme urgently renewed for next year - which he says would cover 30,000 people. Dominic Raab says the home secretary is being lobbied from ""various quarters"" and is very mindful of the impact of seasonal workers. He says the government will ""get the right balance"". Labour's George Howarth, who's just returned from illness, says ""town halls know better than Whitehall"" when it comes to levelling up. He wants to know if the PM will host a cross-party summit in Downing Street with local government representatives and mayors to discuss how they can be empowered to unlock potential? Raab welcomes him back and says the agenda for levelling up has got to be a team effort with central and local government and mayors all involved. He says he supports the spirit of the question and will do everything he can to work with him. DUP's Carla Lockhart attacks what she calls the ""ill-informed and partisan comments"" from the US President. During a meeting with Boris Johnson, Joe Bidenwarned that peacein Northern Ireland must not be jeopardised as a result of complications caused by Brexit. She argues that ""far from defending the Belfast agreement, the Northern Ireland Protocol is the single greatest danger to the Northern Ireland institutions"". ""A solution that restores Northern Ireland's place in the UK's internal markets is the only way to avert the collapse of the institutions,"" she says adding ""a solution must be found in weeks rather than months."" Dominic Raab replies that there needs to be ""a smart, pragmatic approach"" and tells MPs that ""the president understands our view."" Conservative Dehenna Davison says much of the reason why she is standing in the chamber as an MP is to do withthe death of her father from a single-punch assault. He is just one of many victims she says, and why she is marking ""one punch awareness week"". Will Raab lend his support she asks by joining her immediately after PMQs as supporters gather in Westminster Hall? Raab says he knows how much the campaign means to her personally and ""of course"" he will join her. Labour's Barry Sheerman notes that the deputy prime minister represents one of the wealthiest constituencies in the country (that's Esher and Walton in Surrey). He asks if he ""really"" believes in levelling-up and the redistribution of wealth in the country. He also seeks assurances that Channel 4 will stay in Leeds and in the public sector. Dominic Raab replies that the levelling up agenda is not just about helping the Midlands and the north of England. He says London and the south-east will also benefit because pressure on resources will be eased. SNP's Deidre Brock asks exactly what does the UK government have against the Scottish government requiring real living wages for Scottish workers  and net zero obligations in its green ports? Raab says net zero is ""at the heart of everything we do"". He says ministers have increased the national living wage to say the full-time worker Â£400 a year. The SNP Westminster deputy leader
calls for an âemergency energy paymentâ to help people on lower pay. Kirsten Oswald blames a âtoxic combinationâ of cuts, tax rises and the âgrowing cost of Brexitâ. She claims energy bills could
âskyrocketâ by Â£550 per household. Deputy PM Dominic Raab says several issues she raises were devolved to the Scottish government and he lists a
series of financial help to lower paid families. She says his answer was âdisappointing
and perplexingâ and adds that âwarm words donât heat homesâ. He calls on her to ""stop this scaremongering"".  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Newly appointed Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab takes questions in Boris Johnson's place at today's PMQs Labour's deputy party leader Angela Rayner pressed him on rising prices as she stood in for Keir Starmer Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng is appearing before a committee of MPs considering issues raised by rising gas prices He says protecting consumers from ""exorbitant prices"" is a priority, but the industry must step up to keep prices down He says companies should look at their own management, rather than ""stretch out a hand for taxpayers' money"" Jonathan Brearley from Ofgem says hundreds of thousands of customers may be left in limbo if more energy suppliers go bust The government has agreed to pay millions in operating costs for a factory to restart the production of CO2 - vital for fresh food supply CF industries halted production at two of its factories because of soaring gas prices Edited by Johanna Howitt That's where we end our coverage from Westminster for today. Our writers were Arryn Moy, Doug Falconer, Emma Owen, Kate Whannel, and Sinead Wilson. The next PMQs will be on Wednesday 20 October - as Parliament goes in to a three-week recess to make way for the political party conference season. Do join us then. Adam FlemingChief political correspondent That PMQs felt different - that is partly down to Angela Rayner's presentation style in the House of Commons. Let's be honest, she is much funnier than Keir Starmer. And I hope Dominic Raab had a good time on his holiday in Crete because that holiday is going to potentially follow him around for the rest of his political career. On the serious stuff, we are getting quite use to the battle lines between the parties. Labour is talking about the increase in energy bills, the removal of the Â£20 a week rise to universal credit, then from next April the rise in National Insurance to pay for the health and social care levy. Labour are bundling all that together saying there is going to be a cost of living crisis. The government is responding by saying we are protecting you with the energy price cap and when it comes to jobs and wages, the economy is booming for some people. Both those things might be true at the same time, but by the end of the winter which one of those narratives will have won out? Dominic Raab and Angela Rayner deputised for Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer for today's PMQs: Reality Check At Deputy Prime Ministerâs Questions, Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said to Dominic Raab: âHis government chose to cut the income of a worker on Â£18,000 a year by over Â£1,100.â She gave the example of a shop worker. To get to this figure, Â£1,040 would come from the loss of the Â£20 a week increase to universal credit. And from next April, a worker earning Â£18,000 a year would be paying an extra Â£105 in National Insurance â as part of the rise in the rate of NI to help fund health and social care announced by the government.

Dharshini DavidEconomics Correspondent Prime Minister Boris Johnson meets US President Joe Biden in the Oval Office of the White House Brexit gave the
UK the freedom to strike its own trade deals - and accounting for Â£1 in every
Â£6 of British trade, a pact with the US was the ultimate prize. But Whitehall
officials have for months been scrabbling for an alternative after the Biden
administration indicated it was in no hurry to resume talks. Joining theUnited States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)could give the UK deeper benefits on some goods and digital trade with North
American economies. But it has
limited coverage of what is the UK's biggest strength when it comes to
selling to America, namely services. Economists say the overall gains from
joining USMCA may be very limited, perhaps less than 0.1% of GDP And what would
the price be? The UK already has deals with Canada and Mexico, it would have to
rely heavily on American cooperation to join this trade club - and one where
the rules have already been set, and hasnât allowed for new members. America's price
of admission may include a hurdle already encountered: standards surrounding
food and agricultural goods For President
Biden is explicit that his priority is US workers, not least its farmers. He is also clear
that domestic issues take precedence. Even if the UK does want to sign up to
USMCA, it may still be at the back of a queue - simply to get its application
considered. Reality Check Responding to criticism from Labour that the prime minister had made ""zero progress"" in securing aUK-US free trade dealon his trip to the US, Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab said: âBecause of the engagement weâve had with the US, they have immediately given us the boost to trade and businesses by reinstating travel from the UK to the US.â Itâs true that President Biden announced this change yesterday but it wasnât just for the UK. The resumption oftravel into the US from Novemberis applies to fully vaccinated people from 33 countries. They include China, India, Brazil and most of the European Union (countries in its passport-free Schengen area). Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng also admitted that the recent
crisis in CO2 supply came as a surprise to ""a lot of people"". âWith regards to the CO2 situation, it was abundant it was very
cheap and I think a lot of people were surprised at what happened,"" he told the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee. ""We very rapidly dealt with

""It's not a case of just trying to nationalise it or supporting it indefinitely.""

"Global chemicals firm Ineos has announced it will invest Â£1bn in cutting greenhouse emissions at its petrochemical plant in Grangemouth. The plan is to power the plant with hydrogen made from natural gas, while capturing carbon dioxide. The CO2 could then be pumped via a pipeline to St Fergus in Aberdeenshire and stored beneath the North Sea. The industrial site at Grangemouth is currently one of Scotland's biggest polluters. Fresh bid to capture emissions from Peterhead power station Government sets out Â£1bn plan to cut carbon emissions The announcement is the next phase of the company's road map to deliver emissions savings of more than 60% across the site by 2030, as Scotland works towards becoming net zero by 2045. Ineos says it has already achieved a 37% reduction in net CO2 emissions since acquiring the site in 2005. The Â£1bn investment is in addition to more than Â£500m spent on projects currently being implemented at Grangemouth. One of those is a new energy plant due to be completed in late 2023 which will supply energy to all site operations and drive down emissions by at least 150,000 tonnes of CO2 per year. The Grangemouth refinery is a joint venture formed between Ineos and PetroChina in 2011. As Scotland's only crude oil refinery, Petroineos is the primary supplier of aviation fuel for Scotland's main airports and the major supplier of petrol and diesel across Scotland's central belt, as well as in Northern Ireland and Northern England. Carbon capture and storage has been in development in Scotland for some considerable time. After the failed plan to attach it to Peterhead power station, the ""acorn project"" was born. It's been examining other uses to which the technology can be put. Using St Fergus in north east Scotland as a base, they have been looking around for partners. As one of Scotland's most polluting sites, Grangemouth has seemed one of the most obvious. The National Grid is already looking at using existing pipelines which transport gas from St Fergus to the industrial heartlands of central Scotland and putting them into reverse. All it has needed is money and today's announcement provides just that. The announcement comes just over a month before world leaders arrive in Scotland for the COP26 climate change summit. Some environmental groups are sceptical about carbon capture as part of a strategy for tackling the global climate emergency. Friends of the Earth Scotland campaigner Alex Lee described it as ""just another distraction tactic"", adding there was an ""urgent need"" to end fossil fuel production, scale-up renewable energy and invest in green jobs. ""Hydrogen technology enthusiasts fail to mention that it is wildly expensive, inefficient and is not zero carbon,"" they added. Ineos, however, says its road map highlights its commitment to supporting the goals ofthe Paris Accordand helping the Scottish government in its drive for a ""just transition"" to a net zero economy. The Scottish government's net zero secretary, Michael Matheson, welcomed the investment. ""This will not only drive forward innovation and diversification to tackle emissions at Grangemouth, but will also support the decarbonisation of other sectors, sites and regions across Scotland,"" he said. The UK government has promised support for four carbon capture and storage projects by the end of the decade, and Mr Matheson said he hoped the Ineos investment would secure some of this funding. ""Grangemouth, and Ineos itself, already holds a wealth of experience in engineering solutions and hydrogen production, and this new investment holds great potential for the future of Grangemouth, as well as the vital jobs that are located there, as part of our just transition to net zero,"" he said. Stuart Collings, the CEO of Ineos O&P UK added: ""Hydrogen will play a very important role in the decarbonisation of our manufacturing plants. Building the infrastructure for large scale utilisation of hydrogen creates a foundation to achieve net zero by 2045 and enables wider use of hydrogen by Ineos and others in and around Grangemouth."" Five Ineos sites at Grangemouth released around 3.2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in 2019, making it the largest climate polluter in the country, according to figures from the Scottish Environment and Protection Agency (Sepa). The power company SSE ranked as second-worst, with its gas power station at Peterhead emitting around 1.6 million tonnes that year. Terry A'Hearn, chief executive of Sepa, said: ""As Scotland's environmental watchdog, Sepa has an active and ongoing programme of engagement with Ineos.

"Pen Farthing founded the charity A former Marine's mission to bring rescue animals back to the UK as the Taliban took over Afghanistan is being examined by the Charity Commission. The regulator has told the BBC it is looking into the funding arrangements of Operation Ark, which raised more than Â£200,000 from supporters in days. Operation Ark was launched by Pen Farthing's charity Nowzad to evacuate staff members and their immediate families, plus the animals in its care. The charity says it acted correctly. Nowzad, which reported income of close to Â£1m last year, told the BBC: ""The trustees are wholly confident that Nowzad's life-saving work in incredibly difficult circumstances was both the right and only thing to do and was absolutely in furtherance of the charity's purpose."" The Charity Commission has contacted Nowzad for further information after receiving reports around the governance and financial arrangements of Operation Ark. It is examining the use of charity funds for the evacuation and whether it is in line with the charity's purpose. ""We will assess the information provided by the trustees to determine whether or not there is a role for the Commission,"" it said in a statement provided to the BBC. Farthing tells of joy as rescue workers escape Pen Farthing through airport security with animals Minister offers help to get charity out of Kabul Leading charities lawyer Edwina Turner at Anthony Collins solicitors says this can be ""a crisis point"" in the life of a charity. ""It's very serious if the regulator gathers information from you. The charity will want to clear up any concerns,"" Mrs Turner said. ""One question they [Nowzad] would need an answer to is have they spent money raised in furtherance of their objects? Secondly, have they spent the money in the best way possible to achieve their charitable purposes. Thirdly, has the money raised through Operation Ark been spent in accordance with the terms of the fundraising campaign?"" Nowzad operated an animal clinic, dog and cat shelter and donkey sanctuary in Afghanistan. It trained and employed local Afghans - including women - as vets. As the Taliban takeover progressed last month it said its staff were in danger due to their work with foreign organisations, such as embassies, and ""the animals were at risk because the Taliban considers companion animals, particularly dogs, unclean."" Theformer Royal Marine and his supporters led a vociferous evacuation campaignwhich garnered a lot of public attention. It received huge public support but also came in for criticism, including from Defence Secretary Ben Wallace who complained it distracted from focusing on evacuating the most vulnerable. The charity says an ""extremely fraught but ultimately successful"" evacuation ensued. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Nowzad confirmed the Charity Commission is asking for their trustees' comments on Operation Ark including, specifically, how it furthered the charity's purpose. ""The trustees of course recognise that it is entirely proper for the Commission to gather more information regarding this high-profile and unprecedented operation and are very happy to provide the information requested,"" it added. Nowzad is a registered charity in England and Wales and is regulated by the Charity Commission. At this stage, the Charity Commission has made clear they are gathering information and no findings have so far been made. According to Mrs Turner, the Charity Commission has a range of powers, including ""removing trustees, putting in an interim manager to run a charity or certain aspects of a charity"" or, in extreme circumstances, ""they can bring a charity to a close."" Mr Farthing, the founder of the animal shelter, who is originally from Dovercourt in Essex, is now working to find new homes in the UK for both his airlifted staff and rescued animals. He is also considering expanding his charity's work abroad, in countries he deems safer than Afghanistan, though he does not rule out a return to Kabul if conditions one day improve.

"Covishield has been added to the UK's list of recognised vaccines, recipients of which are able to enter the country without isolating from next month But its still unclear whether Indian travellers or those from African countries, including Kenya, which use also Covishield, will avoid the need to isolate They are not listed among the countries whose citizens will be recognised as vaccinated by the UK even if they have had two doses However, the United Arab Emirates has been added to this list this morning, so travellers from there will not have to isolate in the UK Global cases fell significantly to 3.6 million last week from 4 million the week before, WHO reports Brazil's health minister has tested positive for Covid-19, after attending the UN General Assembly in New York Pret A Manger aims to hire 3,000 staff by the end of 2022 after cutting the same number of jobs last year Edited by Martha Buckley Speaking of new UK data, there's good news on the latest hospital figures, which are the lowest in six weeks. The total patient count for people in hospital with Covid has also been updated and stood at 7,567 yesterday - the lowest figure for 18 days.  It was above 8,000 every day last week. The numbers in ventilator beds have also fallen. After being above 1,000 throughout September they now stand at 943, after falling in recent days. The government has reported 34,460 new coronavirus cases in figures released today. A further 166 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test were also reported. The case figures are a jump from the 31,564 new cases recorded yesterday, though deaths fell from 203 on Tuesday. As we reported earlier, there are protests in India as it has not been added to the list of countries where people fully jabbed with an approved vaccine can avoid having to isolate if they want to travel to the UK. Many other countries are affected after the UK government clarified the jab widely distributed by Covax - Covishield - was an approved vaccine but arrivals from some places were not added to the exempt-from-quarantine list. Covishield is the Indian-made AstraZeneca jab and identical to the one used in the UK. The Kenyan and British governments say they are working on a system to recognise Covid vaccine certificates issued in both countries, to facilitate travel between them. Under the UK's new rules effective from 4 October, fully vaccinated people from countries that are not on the red list will be exempt from the compulsory quarantine. But despite being removed from the UK's red list, Kenyans intending to travel there will still have to take a test three days before travelling, quarantine for 10 days on arrival, as well as pay for Covid tests while in isolation. People from other African countries that remain on the UK red list have also criticised the new travel rules saying they are discriminatory.

Razia IqbalPresenter, Newshour, BBC World Service We told you earlier about a llama named Fifi and her ""nanobodies"" which are showing ""significant potential"" in Covid therapy trials. Prof James Naismith is director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute in Oxford, which has been doing this research. I asked him, Why llamas? This video can not be played Germany's health minister has announced that, from 1 November, Germans will no longer receive compensation for lost pay if they are unvaccinated and forced to quarantine. The government has been helping to pay workers sent into quarantine after being in contact with an infected person or returning from a ""high risk"" area abroad. But minister Jens Spahn says this support will be withdrawn, in an effort to encourage more people to get the jab. Getting vaccinated will remain a ""personal decision"", he says, but that decision will now ""also come with the responsibility to bear the financial consequences"". ""Some people will say this means pressure for the unvaccinated. I think we have to look at it the other way around - it is also a question of fairness,"" he added. More than 60% of Germany's population have been fully vaccinated, according to official data. While compulsory vaccination has been ruled out by the government, many German states have introduced restrictions for unvaccinated residents in public places. Those who've had their jabs are no longer required to quarantine. US officials have announced announced that all staff at San Francisco International Airport must be fully vaccinated to carry on working. In a statement on Tuesday, airport authorities and city mayor London Breed said the mandate was the first of its kind in the US, and would take effect immediately. âAs SFO prepares for the upcoming holiday travel season and the return of pre-pandemic passenger levels, we have an obligation to provide a safe airport facility for the traveling public and our on-site employees,"" said airport director Ivar Satero. Under the new rules, every airport tenant or contractor must ensure their on-site staff are fully vaccinated. Employees can be granted exemptions based on ""either medical disability or sincerely held religious belief"". The airport offers free vaccines at an on-site medical centre. The announcement has been welcomed by one local workers' union that represents several food and beverage staff at the airport. Speaking to the San Francisco Chronicle, Anand Singh, president of Unite Here Local 2, which represents several food and beverage workers at the airport, said: ""Our union is working with employers to ensure fair implementation because vaccines are critical to keeping workers safe and building a recovery where everyone comes back stronger."" BBC Storyteller Chanise Evans tells her story Some 250,000 school pupils will be supported to tell their own stories in a BBC scheme to help recovery from the pandemic. The BBC 100 Share Your Story project will see BBC stars and staff visiting secondary schools across the UK to improve students' well-being and story-telling skills. Director general Tim Davie said the BBC had supported ""an entire nation of home learners during the coronavirus pandemic"". He says: ""In 2022 - our centenary year - we will harness the unique power of the BBC to provide educational support to inspire millions of children and students across the UK."" Pupils will be supported to tell their own stories in class, in the form of a poem, a rap, a film or a speech. BBC hosts will then conduct a series of interactive assemblies in whichBBC stars and staff reveal how they have overcome challengesin their own lives. Deputy chief medical officer for England Professor Jonathan Van-Tam tells the Education Committee the dominant Delta variant is 60% more infectious than the Alpha variant, so it is really quite likely that teenagers will be infected at some point. He adds that he has in mind particularly the impact of being ill at a time not of their choosing, such as around their GCSEs. ""Because the Delta variant is so infectious we're not looking at a theoretical risk of children 12 to 17 becoming infected. I think it is really quite inevitable that they will be so at some point."" England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty and his deputy Jonathan Van-Tam are answering questions from the Education Committee. Prof Whitty says children are currently driving the spread of the virus, with ""substantial transmission"" in children. The 12-17 age group is the highest transmission group ""as far as we can tell"", he says. All children in that age group are due to be offered a Covid-19 vaccine - a decision Whitty insists has not been
made for political reasons or for the benefit of more vulnerable
adults. Asked about vaccination he says the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) and the chief medical officers agree the risk to children from Covid is small and the risk of vaccination is small. But he says it is the view of the JCVI that the benefits of vaccinating them are marginally greater than the potential for harm. He adds that vaccinating children would help prevent disruption in schools. ""The great majority of children who have not currently had
Covid are going to get it at some point,"" he says. ""It won't be necessary in the next two or three months but
they will get it sooner or later because this is incredibly
infectious... vaccination will reduce that risk."" Boris Johnson is in New York for the UN General Assembly No 10 says Boris Johnson is fully vaccinated - after being asked whether the prime minister had taken any extra precautions since coming into contact with a positive coronavirus case at the United Nations general assembly (UNGA). According to reports, Brazil's health minister Marcelo Queiroga has tested positive for Covid and gone into isolation, only 24 hours after being filmed shaking hands with Johnson in New York on Monday. Asked whether the prime minister had taken a Covid test since Queiroga's result, a spokesman for the prime minister says there are ""strict"" Covid measures in place at UNGA ""which the prime minister will obviously adhere to"". ""As you know he is double jabbed,"" he adds. An unvaccinated former councillor who became seriously ill with Covidfeared his mother would die after she caught the virus from him. Andrew Girvan, 48, was infected at the start of August and within a week 19 family members had the virus, including his grandparents and six-year-old daughter. He says he was given a 50/50 chance of survival and his mother was put on a ventilator,the Belfast Telegraph reports,external. ""It was without a doubt that it was me who gave it to her,"" the former Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) councillor tells BBC Radio Ulster's The Nolan Show. ""I was lying in bed in hospital and she was in the other hospital and she looked a lot worse than I was. ""To think that you've given your mum something that could eventually kill her isn't a nice place to be."" He says ""procrastination"" got in the way of getting his jab. As we've heard a bit earlier today, PCR tests for fully
vaccinated travellers arriving in the UK will be replaced by lateral flow
tests undernew foreign travel rules. But a leading immunologist says it is ""critical"" that the government ensures at-home testing is overseen by professional and any positive tests are screened for variants of concern. Professor Denis Kinane, immunologist and founding scientist at Cignpost Diagnostics, says: âIf we are to use lateral flow, letâs make it as robust as we can, which means
the swabbing should be administered by a capable agent and the authenticity of
the individual being tested should be verified. ""Any positives picked up in this
way should be reported to PHE and the individual retested and genomically
sequenced by the NHS.  
âLateral flow tests can also be performed at home but observed online by a
medical professional. ""This would ensure that the test is conducted correctly
and that the person being tested is who they say they are. ""The government
has to reduce spread and new variants coming into the UK and if lateral flow
tests are used, they need to be performed authentically.â A group representing nightclubs is launching a legal challenge to the Scottish government's plans for vaccine passports. From October, people will need proof they have had two doses of vaccine to enter certain venues and large events. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says the scheme will help reduce transmission of the virus and keep clubs open. But the Night Time Industries Association Scotland says there are ""serious flaws"" with the plans. The government's definition of a nightclub is a venue which is open between midnight and 05:00, serves alcohol, and which has a designated area for dancing and provides live or recorded music for this purpose. However, industry groups have voiced concerns that the definition could also cover arange of other hospitality venues, including bars, pubs and hotel function rooms. As policy makers look for creative ways to encourage people to get their vaccines, Romania's government has announced a new vaccination lottery. Any fully-vaccinated residents with an EU digital Covid certificate can enter the scheme, which is running from 1 October until the end of the year. A total of 19 draws will be made during the period, with 1,139 prizes totalling 15m Romanian leu ($3.6m; Â£2.6m). Dozens of other weekly prizes will also be given out, some up to 500,000 Romanian leu (Â£118,433; Â£86,825). Funding for the lottery will be given by Romania's economic ministry. âIn this epidemiological context, with significant increases in the number of people infected with Covid-19, it is important to support the vaccination process, including by granting rewards,â said Cseke Attila, Romania's interim health minister,in a statement on Monday.,external Authorities are struggling with vaccine hesitancy in the eastern European country. Just over a quarter of eligible citizens have been fully vaccinated - one of the lowest rates in the EU. Officials have blamed the low pick-up on logistical issues, and a general mistrust of medicine, made worse by online fake news. Hello and thanks for following our rolling coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. If you're just joining us, here are some of the biggest developments:  The World Health Organisation says that the global number of Covid-19 cases continued to fall last week. In its latest update,external, the UN health body said 3.6 million new cases were reported last week, down from 4 million the week before. It's the first substantial drop in over two months, with infections falling in every region of the world. There were major decreases in two regions especially: the Middle East, with a 22% fall, and a 16% drop in south east Asia. Most cases were reported in the US, the UK, India, Turkey and the Philippines. Global coronavirus-related deaths also declined 7% to just under 60,000. The WHO has revised its list of ""variants of interest"" and said it is tracking Lamba and Mu variants. Both have a Latin American origin, but haven't yet caused widespread epidemics. Meanwhile the Delta variant has spread to 185 countries. We've got a bit more detail now on Transport Secretary Grant Shapps's comments to the Transport Committee. Earlier, he said the government was working as ""quickly as possible"" to remove PCR Covid testing for international travellers and to replacethe PCR test taken two days after arrival with a cheaper and simpler lateral flow test. The expense of paying for private PCR testing is widely blamed for discouraging people from travelling abroad - withmost private providers charging above Â£60 for PCR tests and Â£30 for lateral flow tests. The government has warned more than 80 providers over misleading prices. Asked why the switch from PCR to lateral flow tests for arrivals into England would not happen until the end of October, Shapps said it would take several weeks to implement because private testing firms did not have enough lateral flow tests to meet demand. âThis is a Department of Health [and Social Care] responsibility rather than mine, but my understanding is that the ramp up of supply of lateral flow through the private testing sector has some way to go in as much as they have been almost entirely involved in providing PCRs currently,â he says. When questioned by Ben Bradshaw MP about why this was an issue as many test providers also offered lateral flow tests, Shapps responded that he thought it was a question of scale. âWe go from a situation where they are providing low number of thousands to probably millions of tests very quickly and need a few weeks to scale up on it,â he said. The transport secretary could not provide a more specific date for the switch but said his Department of Health colleagues were aware of the upcoming October half-term school holidays and understood the speed required to bring in the changes. Scottish tourism bodies are worried that visitors from overseas will be put off by the Covid-testing requirements Scotland's next tourism season is at ""serious risk"" becauserigorous Covid-testing requirements are being retainedfor international visitors, industry leaders have claimed. Visitor testing rules arebeing relaxed in Englandbut the Scottish government has raised health concerns. The Scottish Tourism Alliance claims the divergence is harming its industry. The Scottish government said it would be guided by clinical advice as well as economic implications. The Scottish Tourism Alliance has put its name to an open letter signed by more than 40 tourism businesses calling for an urgent meeting with the Scottish government. SinceCovid restrictions lifted in England on 19 July, people have been told they no longer have to work from home. However, there have been warnings that this could change if there is a surge in coronavirus cases this winter. Staff in the rest of the UK are still advised to remain at home where possible. The government'sCovid Autumn and Winter Plan for England,externalhas two proposals. Much ofPlan Afocuses onthe vaccine rollout: But if the NHS struggles,Plan B(or parts of it) could start - including advice to work from home again for ""a limited period"". Some businesses - but not all - have embraced the remote-working model seen during the pandemic, with some firms putting in place hybrid working arrangements that would see employees work part of the week from home. Other companies have said they want workers to return to the office or workplace full-time. You can ask to continue to work from home by making a flexible working request, but employers don't have to agree, even if you've worked from home throughout the pandemic. The government is expected to launch a consultation shortly onproposals to give all employees the right to request flexible working as soon as they start a job. At the moment, workers have to wait for six months. You can read morehere.

Officials said some sites would be shut for up to two weeks after construction workers and other protesters clashed. Property was damaged and police said several people were arrested. Hundreds gathered in Melbourne for another anti-vaccination protest on Tuesday, setting off flares and reportedly throwing urine at reporters.

Prof James Naismith is director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute in Oxford, which has been doing this research. I asked him, Why llamas? This video can not be played Germany's health minister has announced that, from 1 November, Germans will no longer receive compensation for lost pay if they are unvaccinated and forced to quarantine. The government has been helping to pay workers sent into quarantine after being in contact with an infected person or returning from a ""high risk"" area abroad. But minister Jens Spahn says this support will be withdrawn, in an effort to encourage more people to get the jab. Getting vaccinated will remain a ""personal decision"", he says, but that decision will now ""also come with the responsibility to bear the financial consequences"". ""Some people will say this means pressure for the unvaccinated. I think we have to look at it the other way around - it is also a question of fairness,"" he added. More than 60% of Germany's population have been fully vaccinated, according to official data. While compulsory vaccination has been ruled out by the government, many German states have introduced restrictions for unvaccinated residents in public places. Those who've had their jabs are no longer required to quarantine. US officials have announced announced that all staff at San Francisco International Airport must be fully vaccinated to carry on working. In a statement on Tuesday, airport authorities and city mayor London Breed said the mandate was the first of its kind in the US, and would take effect immediately. âAs SFO prepares for the upcoming holiday travel season and the return of pre-pandemic passenger levels, we have an obligation to provide a safe airport facility for the traveling public and our on-site employees,"" said airport director Ivar Satero. Under the new rules, every airport tenant or contractor must ensure their on-site staff are fully vaccinated. Employees can be granted exemptions based on ""either medical disability or sincerely held religious belief"". The airport offers free vaccines at an on-site medical centre. The announcement has been welcomed by one local workers' union that represents several food and beverage staff at the airport. Speaking to the San Francisco Chronicle, Anand Singh, president of Unite Here Local 2, which represents several food and beverage workers at the airport, said: ""Our union is working with employers to ensure fair implementation because vaccines are critical to keeping workers safe and building a recovery where everyone comes back stronger."" BBC Storyteller Chanise Evans tells her story Some 250,000 school pupils will be supported to tell their own stories in a BBC scheme to help recovery from the pandemic. The BBC 100 Share Your Story project will see BBC stars and staff visiting secondary schools across the UK to improve students' well-being and story-telling skills. Director general Tim Davie said the BBC had supported ""an entire nation of home learners during the coronavirus pandemic"". He says: ""In 2022 - our centenary year - we will harness the unique power of the BBC to provide educational support to inspire millions of children and students across the UK."" Pupils will be supported to tell their own stories in class, in the form of a poem, a rap, a film or a speech. BBC hosts will then conduct a series of interactive assemblies in whichBBC stars and staff reveal how they have overcome challengesin their own lives. Deputy chief medical officer for England Professor Jonathan Van-Tam tells the Education Committee the dominant Delta variant is 60% more infectious than the Alpha variant, so it is really quite likely that teenagers will be infected at some point. He adds that he has in mind particularly the impact of being ill at a time not of their choosing, such as around their GCSEs. ""Because the Delta variant is so infectious we're not looking at a theoretical risk of children 12 to 17 becoming infected. I think it is really quite inevitable that they will be so at some point."" England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty and his deputy Jonathan Van-Tam are answering questions from the Education Committee. Prof Whitty says children are currently driving the spread of the virus, with ""substantial transmission"" in children. The 12-17 age group is the highest transmission group ""as far as we can tell"", he says. All children in that age group are due to be offered a Covid-19 vaccine - a decision Whitty insists has not been
made for political reasons or for the benefit of more vulnerable
adults. Asked about vaccination he says the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) and the chief medical officers agree the risk to children from Covid is small and the risk of vaccination is small. But he says it is the view of the JCVI that the benefits of vaccinating them are marginally greater than the potential for harm. He adds that vaccinating children would help prevent disruption in schools. ""The great majority of children who have not currently had
Covid are going to get it at some point,"" he says. ""It won't be necessary in the next two or three months but
they will get it sooner or later because this is incredibly
infectious... vaccination will reduce that risk."" Boris Johnson is in New York for the UN General Assembly No 10 says Boris Johnson is fully vaccinated - after being asked whether the prime minister had taken any extra precautions since coming into contact with a positive coronavirus case at the United Nations general assembly (UNGA). According to reports, Brazil's health minister Marcelo Queiroga has tested positive for Covid and gone into isolation, only 24 hours after being filmed shaking hands with Johnson in New York on Monday. Asked whether the prime minister had taken a Covid test since Queiroga's result, a spokesman for the prime minister says there are ""strict"" Covid measures in place at UNGA ""which the prime minister will obviously adhere to"". ""As you know he is double jabbed,"" he adds. An unvaccinated former councillor who became seriously ill with Covidfeared his mother would die after she caught the virus from him. Andrew Girvan, 48, was infected at the start of August and within a week 19 family members had the virus, including his grandparents and six-year-old daughter. He says he was given a 50/50 chance of survival and his mother was put on a ventilator,the Belfast Telegraph reports,external. ""It was without a doubt that it was me who gave it to her,"" the former Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) councillor tells BBC Radio Ulster's The Nolan Show. ""I was lying in bed in hospital and she was in the other hospital and she looked a lot worse than I was. ""To think that you've given your mum something that could eventually kill her isn't a nice place to be."" He says ""procrastination"" got in the way of getting his jab. As we've heard a bit earlier today, PCR tests for fully
vaccinated travellers arriving in the UK will be replaced by lateral flow
tests undernew foreign travel rules. But a leading immunologist says it is ""critical"" that the government ensures at-home testing is overseen by professional and any positive tests are screened for variants of concern. Professor Denis Kinane, immunologist and founding scientist at Cignpost Diagnostics, says: âIf we are to use lateral flow, letâs make it as robust as we can, which means
the swabbing should be administered by a capable agent and the authenticity of
the individual being tested should be verified. ""Any positives picked up in this
way should be reported to PHE and the individual retested and genomically
sequenced by the NHS.  
âLateral flow tests can also be performed at home but observed online by a
medical professional. ""This would ensure that the test is conducted correctly
and that the person being tested is who they say they are. ""The government
has to reduce spread and new variants coming into the UK and if lateral flow
tests are used, they need to be performed authentically.â A group representing nightclubs is launching a legal challenge to the Scottish government's plans for vaccine passports. From October, people will need proof they have had two doses of vaccine to enter certain venues and large events. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says the scheme will help reduce transmission of the virus and keep clubs open. But the Night Time Industries Association Scotland says there are ""serious flaws"" with the plans. The government's definition of a nightclub is a venue which is open between midnight and 05:00, serves alcohol, and which has a designated area for dancing and provides live or recorded music for this purpose. However, industry groups have voiced concerns that the definition could also cover arange of other hospitality venues, including bars, pubs and hotel function rooms. As policy makers look for creative ways to encourage people to get their vaccines, Romania's government has announced a new vaccination lottery. Any fully-vaccinated residents with an EU digital Covid certificate can enter the scheme, which is running from 1 October until the end of the year. A total of 19 draws will be made during the period, with 1,139 prizes totalling 15m Romanian leu ($3.6m; Â£2.6m). Dozens of other weekly prizes will also be given out, some up to 500,000 Romanian leu (Â£118,433; Â£86,825). Funding for the lottery will be given by Romania's economic ministry. âIn this epidemiological context, with significant increases in the number of people infected with Covid-19, it is important to support the vaccination process, including by granting rewards,â said Cseke Attila, Romania's interim health minister,in a statement on Monday.,external Authorities are struggling with vaccine hesitancy in the eastern European country. Just over a quarter of eligible citizens have been fully vaccinated - one of the lowest rates in the EU. Officials have blamed the low pick-up on logistical issues, and a general mistrust of medicine, made worse by online fake news. Hello and thanks for following our rolling coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. If you're just joining us, here are some of the biggest developments:  The World Health Organisation says that the global number of Covid-19 cases continued to fall last week. In its latest update,external, the UN health body said 3.6 million new cases were reported last week, down from 4 million the week before. It's the first substantial drop in over two months, with infections falling in every region of the world. There were major decreases in two regions especially: the Middle East, with a 22% fall, and a 16% drop in south east Asia. Most cases were reported in the US, the UK, India, Turkey and the Philippines. Global coronavirus-related deaths also declined 7% to just under 60,000. The WHO has revised its list of ""variants of interest"" and said it is tracking Lamba and Mu variants. Both have a Latin American origin, but haven't yet caused widespread epidemics. Meanwhile the Delta variant has spread to 185 countries. We've got a bit more detail now on Transport Secretary Grant Shapps's comments to the Transport Committee. Earlier, he said the government was working as ""quickly as possible"" to remove PCR Covid testing for international travellers and to replacethe PCR test taken two days after arrival with a cheaper and simpler lateral flow test. The expense of paying for private PCR testing is widely blamed for discouraging people from travelling abroad - withmost private providers charging above Â£60 for PCR tests and Â£30 for lateral flow tests. The government has warned more than 80 providers over misleading prices. Asked why the switch from PCR to lateral flow tests for arrivals into England would not happen until the end of October, Shapps said it would take several weeks to implement because private testing firms did not have enough lateral flow tests to meet demand. âThis is a Department of Health [and Social Care] responsibility rather than mine, but my understanding is that the ramp up of supply of lateral flow through the private testing sector has some way to go in as much as they have been almost entirely involved in providing PCRs currently,â he says. When questioned by Ben Bradshaw MP about why this was an issue as many test providers also offered lateral flow tests, Shapps responded that he thought it was a question of scale. âWe go from a situation where they are providing low number of thousands to probably millions of tests very quickly and need a few weeks to scale up on it,â he said. The transport secretary could not provide a more specific date for the switch but said his Department of Health colleagues were aware of the upcoming October half-term school holidays and understood the speed required to bring in the changes. Scottish tourism bodies are worried that visitors from overseas will be put off by the Covid-testing requirements Scotland's next tourism season is at ""serious risk"" becauserigorous Covid-testing requirements are being retainedfor international visitors, industry leaders have claimed. Visitor testing rules arebeing relaxed in Englandbut the Scottish government has raised health concerns. The Scottish Tourism Alliance claims the divergence is harming its industry. The Scottish government said it would be guided by clinical advice as well as economic implications. The Scottish Tourism Alliance has put its name to an open letter signed by more than 40 tourism businesses calling for an urgent meeting with the Scottish government. SinceCovid restrictions lifted in England on 19 July, people have been told they no longer have to work from home. However, there have been warnings that this could change if there is a surge in coronavirus cases this winter. Staff in the rest of the UK are still advised to remain at home where possible. The government'sCovid Autumn and Winter Plan for England,externalhas two proposals. Much ofPlan Afocuses onthe vaccine rollout: But if the NHS struggles,Plan B(or parts of it) could start - including advice to work from home again for ""a limited period"". Some businesses - but not all - have embraced the remote-working model seen during the pandemic, with some firms putting in place hybrid working arrangements that would see employees work part of the week from home. Other companies have said they want workers to return to the office or workplace full-time. You can ask to continue to work from home by making a flexible working request, but employers don't have to agree, even if you've worked from home throughout the pandemic. The government is expected to launch a consultation shortly onproposals to give all employees the right to request flexible working as soon as they start a job. At the moment, workers have to wait for six months. You can read morehere.

Officials said some sites would be shut for up to two weeks after construction workers and other protesters clashed. Property was damaged and police said several people were arrested. Hundreds gathered in Melbourne for another anti-vaccination protest on Tuesday, setting off flares and reportedly throwing urine at reporters. On Monday, riot police were deployed and reportedly used rubber bullets and pepper spray to disperse crowds. Of those acting aggressively, state premier Daniel Andrews said: ""They're not there to protest, they're there for a fight."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Watch: President Biden's first UN General Assembly speech In his first address to the United Nations, US President Joe Biden has urged global cooperation through ""a decisive decade for our world"". His calls for unity come amid tensions with allies over the US' Afghanistan withdrawal and a major diplomatic row with France over a submarine deal. The US also announced it was doubling its climate finance pledge by 2024. Reaffirming his support for democracy and diplomacy, Mr Biden said: ""We must work together like never before."" The 76th General Assembly in New York City takes place against the backdrop of a climate crisis and a once-in-a-century pandemic, both of which have sharpened global divides. Mr Biden pushed for cooperation on these fronts, saying: ""Whether we choose to fight for our shared future or not will reverberate for generations to come. Simply put, we stand, in my view, at an inflection point in history."" Mr Biden on Tuesday stressed that the US is ""not seeking a new Cold War or a world divided into rigid blocs"". The US, he said, ""is ready to work with any nation that steps up and pursues peaceful resolution to shared challenges, even if we have intense disagreements in other areas"". The remark appeared to be a response to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, who this weekend warned the US and China were headed for ""a Cold War that would be different from the past one, and probably more dangerous and more difficult to manage"". The president also touted the pullout from Afghanistan, which has been criticised by allies at home and abroad, saying the US was ending a ""period of relentless war"" for a ""new era of relentless diplomacy"". Mr Biden offered a key pledge on climate finance as well, saying the US will increase funding for developing countries to $11.4bn (Â£8.3bn) by 2024. This means the US will offer just over half of the European Union's pledge to help poorer nations cope with climate change. Has climate pledge to poor countries been met? The developed world had pledged to provide these countries $100bn a year by 2020 but this has still not been achieved. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson - who is meeting with Mr Biden later on Tuesday - praised the ""massive contribution"" and said the US had ""stepped up to the plate"". At the end of his first address, Mr Biden promised that the US would lead ""with our allies"". ""We will lead on all the greatest challenges of our time, from Covid to climate, human dignity and human rights, but we will not go it alone,"" he said. World leaders at odds with former President Donald Trump had hoped for a more stable and reliable America under his successor's leadership - but Mr Biden's most recent foreign policy moves have made some uneasy. The US' lack of coordination during the Afghanistan exit after two decades of war rankled allies and led to an international scramble to evacuate. The Nato mission at the time of the withdrawal comprised troops from 36 countries, three-quarters of whom were non-American. How Europe's relationship with Joe Biden turned sour Last week, a trilateral US-UK deal to provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines infuriated the French, who had their own five-year-old contract to build conventional submarines for the Australians. French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian described the agreement as ""a stab in the back"", and the top French diplomats in both countries were recalled. The Biden administration has also seen international criticism over alleged US hoarding of Covid-19 vaccines and non-reciprocal travel restrictions, as well as frugality with climate aid. After four years of America First and Donald Trump's isolationist nationalism, this was a speech the leaders of the liberal democracies wanted to cheer. But Joe Biden's first appearance before the UN General Assembly will be treated with a good deal of scepticism after America's shambolic departure from Afghanistan. That said, the US president was determined to push his more outward looking view of the world. And turning a page, he was able to say this was the first time in 20 years that America wasn't at war. British diplomats will have cheered his pledge to double to $11.4bn the money to tackle climate change by 2024 - something they have been lobbying the White House relentlessly on. One issue that enjoys bipartisan support in Washington is the threat posed by China - the driving force behind the new security partnership with Britain and Australia. He didn't mention the world's other superpower by name, but it's clear who he was talking about. The US president has had a torrid, horrid summer. This speech was an attempt to reassure America's international allies - and to put flesh on the bones of his claim that ""America is back"".

"Covishield has been added to the UK's list of recognised vaccines, recipients of which are able to enter the country without isolating from next month But its still unclear whether Indian travellers or those from African countries, including Kenya, which use also Covishield, will avoid the need to isolate They are not listed among the countries whose citizens will be recognised as vaccinated by the UK even if they have had two doses However, the United Arab Emirates has been added to this list this morning, so travellers from there will not have to isolate in the UK Global cases fell significantly to 3.6 million last week from 4 million the week before, WHO reports Brazil's health minister has tested positive for Covid-19, after attending the UN General Assembly in New York Pret A Manger aims to hire 3,000 staff by the end of 2022 after cutting the same number of jobs last year Edited by Martha Buckley Speaking of new UK data, there's good news on the latest hospital figures, which are the lowest in six weeks. The total patient count for people in hospital with Covid has also been updated and stood at 7,567 yesterday - the lowest figure for 18 days.  It was above 8,000 every day last week. The numbers in ventilator beds have also fallen. After being above 1,000 throughout September they now stand at 943, after falling in recent days. The government has reported 34,460 new coronavirus cases in figures released today. A further 166 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test were also reported. The case figures are a jump from the 31,564 new cases recorded yesterday, though deaths fell from 203 on Tuesday. As we reported earlier, there are protests in India as it has not been added to the list of countries where people fully jabbed with an approved vaccine can avoid having to isolate if they want to travel to the UK. Many other countries are affected after the UK government clarified the jab widely distributed by Covax - Covishield - was an approved vaccine but arrivals from some places were not added to the exempt-from-quarantine list. Covishield is the Indian-made AstraZeneca jab and identical to the one used in the UK. The Kenyan and British governments say they are working on a system to recognise Covid vaccine certificates issued in both countries, to facilitate travel between them. Under the UK's new rules effective from 4 October, fully vaccinated people from countries that are not on the red list will be exempt from the compulsory quarantine. But despite being removed from the UK's red list, Kenyans intending to travel there will still have to take a test three days before travelling, quarantine for 10 days on arrival, as well as pay for Covid tests while in isolation. People from other African countries that remain on the UK red list have also criticised the new travel rules saying they are discriminatory.

This video can not be played Germany's health minister has announced that, from 1 November, Germans will no longer receive compensation for lost pay if they are unvaccinated and forced to quarantine. The government has been helping to pay workers sent into quarantine after being in contact with an infected person or returning from a ""high risk"" area abroad. But minister Jens Spahn says this support will be withdrawn, in an effort to encourage more people to get the jab. Getting vaccinated will remain a ""personal decision"", he says, but that decision will now ""also come with the responsibility to bear the financial consequences"". ""Some people will say this means pressure for the unvaccinated. I think we have to look at it the other way around - it is also a question of fairness,"" he added. More than 60% of Germany's population have been fully vaccinated, according to official data. While compulsory vaccination has been ruled out by the government, many German states have introduced restrictions for unvaccinated residents in public places. Those who've had their jabs are no longer required to quarantine. US officials have announced announced that all staff at San Francisco International Airport must be fully vaccinated to carry on working. In a statement on Tuesday, airport authorities and city mayor London Breed said the mandate was the first of its kind in the US, and would take effect immediately. âAs SFO prepares for the upcoming holiday travel season and the return of pre-pandemic passenger levels, we have an obligation to provide a safe airport facility for the traveling public and our on-site employees,"" said airport director Ivar Satero. Under the new rules, every airport tenant or contractor must ensure their on-site staff are fully vaccinated. Employees can be granted exemptions based on ""either medical disability or sincerely held religious belief"". The airport offers free vaccines at an on-site medical centre. The announcement has been welcomed by one local workers' union that represents several food and beverage staff at the airport. Speaking to the San Francisco Chronicle, Anand Singh, president of Unite Here Local 2, which represents several food and beverage workers at the airport, said: ""Our union is working with employers to ensure fair implementation because vaccines are critical to keeping workers safe and building a recovery where everyone comes back stronger.""

Deputy chief medical officer for England Professor Jonathan Van-Tam tells the Education Committee the dominant Delta variant is 60% more infectious than the Alpha variant, so it is really quite likely that teenagers will be infected at some point. He adds that he has in mind particularly the impact of being ill at a time not of their choosing, such as around their GCSEs. ""Because the Delta variant is so infectious we're not looking at a theoretical risk of children 12 to 17 becoming infected. I think it is really quite inevitable that they will be so at some point."" England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty and his deputy Jonathan Van-Tam are answering questions from the Education Committee. Prof Whitty says children are currently driving the spread of the virus, with ""substantial transmission"" in children. The 12-17 age group is the highest transmission group ""as far as we can tell"", he says. All children in that age group are due to be offered a Covid-19 vaccine - a decision Whitty insists has not been
made for political reasons or for the benefit of more vulnerable
adults. Asked about vaccination he says the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) and the chief medical officers agree the risk to children from Covid is small and the risk of vaccination is small. But he says it is the view of the JCVI that the benefits of vaccinating them are marginally greater than the potential for harm. He adds that vaccinating children would help prevent disruption in schools. ""The great majority of children who have not currently had
Covid are going to get it at some point,"" he says. ""It won't be necessary in the next two or three months but
they will get it sooner or later because this is incredibly
infectious... vaccination will reduce that risk."" Boris Johnson is in New York for the UN General Assembly No 10 says Boris Johnson is fully vaccinated - after being asked whether the prime minister had taken any extra precautions since coming into contact with a positive coronavirus case at the United Nations general assembly (UNGA). According to reports, Brazil's health minister Marcelo Queiroga has tested positive for Covid and gone into isolation, only 24 hours after being filmed shaking hands with Johnson in New York on Monday. Asked whether the prime minister had taken a Covid test since Queiroga's result, a spokesman for the prime minister says there are ""strict"" Covid measures in place at UNGA ""which the prime minister will obviously adhere to"". ""As you know he is double jabbed,"" he adds. An unvaccinated former councillor who became seriously ill with Covidfeared his mother would die after she caught the virus from him. Andrew Girvan, 48, was infected at the start of August and within a week 19 family members had the virus, including his grandparents and six-year-old daughter. He says he was given a 50/50 chance of survival and his mother was put on a ventilator,the Belfast Telegraph reports,external. ""It was without a doubt that it was me who gave it to her,"" the former Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) councillor tells BBC Radio Ulster's The Nolan Show. ""I was lying in bed in hospital and she was in the other hospital and she looked a lot worse than I was. ""To think that you've given your mum something that could eventually kill her isn't a nice place to be."" He says ""procrastination"" got in the way of getting his jab. As we've heard a bit earlier today, PCR tests for fully
vaccinated travellers arriving in the UK will be replaced by lateral flow
tests undernew foreign travel rules. But a leading immunologist says it is ""critical"" that the government ensures at-home testing is overseen by professional and any positive tests are screened for variants of concern. Professor Denis Kinane, immunologist and founding scientist at Cignpost Diagnostics, says: âIf we are to use lateral flow, letâs make it as robust as we can, which means
the swabbing should be administered by a capable agent and the authenticity of
the individual being tested should be verified. ""Any positives picked up in this
way should be reported to PHE and the individual retested and genomically
sequenced by the NHS.  
âLateral flow tests can also be performed at home but observed online by a
medical professional. ""This would ensure that the test is conducted correctly
and that the person being tested is who they say they are. ""The government
has to reduce spread and new variants coming into the UK and if lateral flow
tests are used, they need to be performed authentically.â A group representing nightclubs is launching a legal challenge to the Scottish government's plans for vaccine passports. From October, people will need proof they have had two doses of vaccine to enter certain venues and large events. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says the scheme will help reduce transmission of the virus and keep clubs open. But the Night Time Industries Association Scotland says there are ""serious flaws"" with the plans. The government's definition of a nightclub is a venue which is open between midnight and 05:00, serves alcohol, and which has a designated area for dancing and provides live or recorded music for this purpose. However, industry groups have voiced concerns that the definition could also cover arange of other hospitality venues, including bars, pubs and hotel function rooms. As policy makers look for creative ways to encourage people to get their vaccines, Romania's government has announced a new vaccination lottery. Any fully-vaccinated residents with an EU digital Covid certificate can enter the scheme, which is running from 1 October until the end of the year. A total of 19 draws will be made during the period, with 1,139 prizes totalling 15m Romanian leu ($3.6m; Â£2.6m). Dozens of other weekly prizes will also be given out, some up to 500,000 Romanian leu (Â£118,433; Â£86,825). Funding for the lottery will be given by Romania's economic ministry. âIn this epidemiological context, with significant increases in the number of people infected with Covid-19, it is important to support the vaccination process, including by granting rewards,â said Cseke Attila, Romania's interim health minister,in a statement on Monday.,external Authorities are struggling with vaccine hesitancy in the eastern European country. Just over a quarter of eligible citizens have been fully vaccinated - one of the lowest rates in the EU. Officials have blamed the low pick-up on logistical issues, and a general mistrust of medicine, made worse by online fake news. Hello and thanks for following our rolling coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. If you're just joining us, here are some of the biggest developments:  The World Health Organisation says that the global number of Covid-19 cases continued to fall last week. In its latest update,external, the UN health body said 3.6 million new cases were reported last week, down from 4 million the week before. It's the first substantial drop in over two months, with infections falling in every region of the world. There were major decreases in two regions especially: the Middle East, with a 22% fall, and a 16% drop in south east Asia. Most cases were reported in the US, the UK, India, Turkey and the Philippines. Global coronavirus-related deaths also declined 7% to just under 60,000. The WHO has revised its list of ""variants of interest"" and said it is tracking Lamba and Mu variants. Both have a Latin American origin, but haven't yet caused widespread epidemics. Meanwhile the Delta variant has spread to 185 countries. We've got a bit more detail now on Transport Secretary Grant Shapps's comments to the Transport Committee. Earlier, he said the government was working as ""quickly as possible"" to remove PCR Covid testing for international travellers and to replacethe PCR test taken two days after arrival with a cheaper and simpler lateral flow test. The expense of paying for private PCR testing is widely blamed for discouraging people from travelling abroad - withmost private providers charging above Â£60 for PCR tests and Â£30 for lateral flow tests. The government has warned more than 80 providers over misleading prices. Asked why the switch from PCR to lateral flow tests for arrivals into England would not happen until the end of October, Shapps said it would take several weeks to implement because private testing firms did not have enough lateral flow tests to meet demand. âThis is a Department of Health [and Social Care] responsibility rather than mine, but my understanding is that the ramp up of supply of lateral flow through the private testing sector has some way to go in as much as they have been almost entirely involved in providing PCRs currently,â he says. When questioned by Ben Bradshaw MP about why this was an issue as many test providers also offered lateral flow tests, Shapps responded that he thought it was a question of scale. âWe go from a situation where they are providing low number of thousands to probably millions of tests very quickly and need a few weeks to scale up on it,â he said. The transport secretary could not provide a more specific date for the switch but said his Department of Health colleagues were aware of the upcoming October half-term school holidays and understood the speed required to bring in the changes. Scottish tourism bodies are worried that visitors from overseas will be put off by the Covid-testing requirements Scotland's next tourism season is at ""serious risk"" becauserigorous Covid-testing requirements are being retainedfor international visitors, industry leaders have claimed. Visitor testing rules arebeing relaxed in Englandbut the Scottish government has raised health concerns. The Scottish Tourism Alliance claims the divergence is harming its industry. The Scottish government said it would be guided by clinical advice as well as economic implications. The Scottish Tourism Alliance has put its name to an open letter signed by more than 40 tourism businesses calling for an urgent meeting with the Scottish government. SinceCovid restrictions lifted in England on 19 July, people have been told they no longer have to work from home. However, there have been warnings that this could change if there is a surge in coronavirus cases this winter. Staff in the rest of the UK are still advised to remain at home where possible. The government'sCovid Autumn and Winter Plan for England,externalhas two proposals. Much ofPlan Afocuses onthe vaccine rollout: But if the NHS struggles,Plan B(or parts of it) could start - including advice to work from home again for ""a limited period"". Some businesses - but not all - have embraced the remote-working model seen during the pandemic, with some firms putting in place hybrid working arrangements that would see employees work part of the week from home. Other companies have said they want workers to return to the office or workplace full-time. You can ask to continue to work from home by making a flexible working request, but employers don't have to agree, even if you've worked from home throughout the pandemic. The government is expected to launch a consultation shortly onproposals to give all employees the right to request flexible working as soon as they start a job. At the moment, workers have to wait for six months. You can read morehere.

Officials said some sites would be shut for up to two weeks after construction workers and other protesters clashed. Property was damaged and police said several people were arrested. Hundreds gathered in Melbourne for another anti-vaccination protest on Tuesday, setting off flares and reportedly throwing urine at reporters.

"Covishield has been added to the UK's list of recognised vaccines, recipients of which are able to enter the country without isolating from next month But its still unclear whether Indian travellers or those from African countries, including Kenya, which use also Covishield, will avoid the need to isolate They are not listed among the countries whose citizens will be recognised as vaccinated by the UK even if they have had two doses However, the United Arab Emirates has been added to this list this morning, so travellers from there will not have to isolate in the UK Global cases fell significantly to 3.6 million last week from 4 million the week before, WHO reports Brazil's health minister has tested positive for Covid-19, after attending the UN General Assembly in New York Pret A Manger aims to hire 3,000 staff by the end of 2022 after cutting the same number of jobs last year Edited by Martha Buckley Speaking of new UK data, there's good news on the latest hospital figures, which are the lowest in six weeks. The total patient count for people in hospital with Covid has also been updated and stood at 7,567 yesterday - the lowest figure for 18 days.  It was above 8,000 every day last week. The numbers in ventilator beds have also fallen. After being above 1,000 throughout September they now stand at 943, after falling in recent days. The government has reported 34,460 new coronavirus cases in figures released today. A further 166 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test were also reported. The case figures are a jump from the 31,564 new cases recorded yesterday, though deaths fell from 203 on Tuesday. As we reported earlier, there are protests in India as it has not been added to the list of countries where people fully jabbed with an approved vaccine can avoid having to isolate if they want to travel to the UK. Many other countries are affected after the UK government clarified the jab widely distributed by Covax - Covishield - was an approved vaccine but arrivals from some places were not added to the exempt-from-quarantine list. Covishield is the Indian-made AstraZeneca jab and identical to the one used in the UK. The Kenyan and British governments say they are working on a system to recognise Covid vaccine certificates issued in both countries, to facilitate travel between them. Under the UK's new rules effective from 4 October, fully vaccinated people from countries that are not on the red list will be exempt from the compulsory quarantine. But despite being removed from the UK's red list, Kenyans intending to travel there will still have to take a test three days before travelling, quarantine for 10 days on arrival, as well as pay for Covid tests while in isolation. People from other African countries that remain on the UK red list have also criticised the new travel rules saying they are discriminatory.

Razia IqbalPresenter, Newshour, BBC World Service We told you earlier about a llama named Fifi and her ""nanobodies"" which are showing ""significant potential"" in Covid therapy trials. Prof James Naismith is director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute in Oxford, which has been doing this research. I asked him, Why llamas? This video can not be played Germany's health minister has announced that, from 1 November, Germans will no longer receive compensation for lost pay if they are unvaccinated and forced to quarantine. The government has been helping to pay workers sent into quarantine after being in contact with an infected person or returning from a ""high risk"" area abroad. But minister Jens Spahn says this support will be withdrawn, in an effort to encourage more people to get the jab. Getting vaccinated will remain a ""personal decision"", he says, but that decision will now ""also come with the responsibility to bear the financial consequences"". ""Some people will say this means pressure for the unvaccinated. I think we have to look at it the other way around - it is also a question of fairness,"" he added. More than 60% of Germany's population have been fully vaccinated, according to official data. While compulsory vaccination has been ruled out by the government, many German states have introduced restrictions for unvaccinated residents in public places. Those who've had their jabs are no longer required to quarantine. US officials have announced announced that all staff at San Francisco International Airport must be fully vaccinated to carry on working. In a statement on Tuesday, airport authorities and city mayor London Breed said the mandate was the first of its kind in the US, and would take effect immediately. âAs SFO prepares for the upcoming holiday travel season and the return of pre-pandemic passenger levels, we have an obligation to provide a safe airport facility for the traveling public and our on-site employees,"" said airport director Ivar Satero. Under the new rules, every airport tenant or contractor must ensure their on-site staff are fully vaccinated. Employees can be granted exemptions based on ""either medical disability or sincerely held religious belief"". The airport offers free vaccines at an on-site medical centre. The announcement has been welcomed by one local workers' union that represents several food and beverage staff at the airport. Speaking to the San Francisco Chronicle, Anand Singh, president of Unite Here Local 2, which represents several food and beverage workers at the airport, said: ""Our union is working with employers to ensure fair implementation because vaccines are critical to keeping workers safe and building a recovery where everyone comes back stronger."" BBC Storyteller Chanise Evans tells her story Some 250,000 school pupils will be supported to tell their own stories in a BBC scheme to help recovery from the pandemic. The BBC 100 Share Your Story project will see BBC stars and staff visiting secondary schools across the UK to improve students' well-being and story-telling skills. Director general Tim Davie said the BBC had supported ""an entire nation of home learners during the coronavirus pandemic"". He says: ""In 2022 - our centenary year - we will harness the unique power of the BBC to provide educational support to inspire millions of children and students across the UK."" Pupils will be supported to tell their own stories in class, in the form of a poem, a rap, a film or a speech. BBC hosts will then conduct a series of interactive assemblies in whichBBC stars and staff reveal how they have overcome challengesin their own lives. Deputy chief medical officer for England Professor Jonathan Van-Tam tells the Education Committee the dominant Delta variant is 60% more infectious than the Alpha variant, so it is really quite likely that teenagers will be infected at some point. He adds that he has in mind particularly the impact of being ill at a time not of their choosing, such as around their GCSEs. ""Because the Delta variant is so infectious we're not looking at a theoretical risk of children 12 to 17 becoming infected. I think it is really quite inevitable that they will be so at some point."" England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty and his deputy Jonathan Van-Tam are answering questions from the Education Committee. Prof Whitty says children are currently driving the spread of the virus, with ""substantial transmission"" in children. The 12-17 age group is the highest transmission group ""as far as we can tell"", he says. All children in that age group are due to be offered a Covid-19 vaccine - a decision Whitty insists has not been
made for political reasons or for the benefit of more vulnerable
adults. Asked about vaccination he says the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) and the chief medical officers agree the risk to children from Covid is small and the risk of vaccination is small.

"Pen Farthing founded the charity A former Marine's mission to bring rescue animals back to the UK as the Taliban took over Afghanistan is being examined by the Charity Commission. The regulator has told the BBC it is looking into the funding arrangements of Operation Ark, which raised more than Â£200,000 from supporters in days. Operation Ark was launched by Pen Farthing's charity Nowzad to evacuate staff members and their immediate families, plus the animals in its care. The charity says it acted correctly. Nowzad, which reported income of close to Â£1m last year, told the BBC: ""The trustees are wholly confident that Nowzad's life-saving work in incredibly difficult circumstances was both the right and only thing to do and was absolutely in furtherance of the charity's purpose."" The Charity Commission has contacted Nowzad for further information after receiving reports around the governance and financial arrangements of Operation Ark. It is examining the use of charity funds for the evacuation and whether it is in line with the charity's purpose. ""We will assess the information provided by the trustees to determine whether or not there is a role for the Commission,"" it said in a statement provided to the BBC. Farthing tells of joy as rescue workers escape Pen Farthing through airport security with animals Minister offers help to get charity out of Kabul Leading charities lawyer Edwina Turner at Anthony Collins solicitors says this can be ""a crisis point"" in the life of a charity. ""It's very serious if the regulator gathers information from you. The charity will want to clear up any concerns,"" Mrs Turner said. ""One question they [Nowzad] would need an answer to is have they spent money raised in furtherance of their objects? Secondly, have they spent the money in the best way possible to achieve their charitable purposes. Thirdly, has the money raised through Operation Ark been spent in accordance with the terms of the fundraising campaign?"" Nowzad operated an animal clinic, dog and cat shelter and donkey sanctuary in Afghanistan. It trained and employed local Afghans - including women - as vets. As the Taliban takeover progressed last month it said its staff were in danger due to their work with foreign organisations, such as embassies, and ""the animals were at risk because the Taliban considers companion animals, particularly dogs, unclean."" Theformer Royal Marine and his supporters led a vociferous evacuation campaignwhich garnered a lot of public attention. It received huge public support but also came in for criticism, including from Defence Secretary Ben Wallace who complained it distracted from focusing on evacuating the most vulnerable. The charity says an ""extremely fraught but ultimately successful"" evacuation ensued. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Nowzad confirmed the Charity Commission is asking for their trustees' comments on Operation Ark including, specifically, how it furthered the charity's purpose. ""The trustees of course recognise that it is entirely proper for the Commission to gather more information regarding this high-profile and unprecedented operation and are very happy to provide the information requested,"" it added. Nowzad is a registered charity in England and Wales and is regulated by the Charity Commission. At this stage, the Charity Commission has made clear they are gathering information and no findings have so far been made. According to Mrs Turner, the Charity Commission has a range of powers, including ""removing trustees, putting in an interim manager to run a charity or certain aspects of a charity"" or, in extreme circumstances, ""they can bring a charity to a close."" Mr Farthing, the founder of the animal shelter, who is originally from Dovercourt in Essex, is now working to find new homes in the UK for both his airlifted staff and rescued animals.

"The number of parents having a baby using a surrogate in England and Wales has almost quadrupled in the last 10 years, new figures show. Parental orders, which transfer legal parentage from the surrogate, rose from 117 in 2011 to 413 in 2020. Two-thirds of applicants are now mixed-sex couples often in their 30s or 40s. The report is by the University of Kent and My Surrogacy Journey, a non-profit organisation which supports surrogates and intended parents. Surrogacy is when a woman carries a pregnancy for another couple or individual. In most cases it is because someone cannot carry a pregnancy themselves for health reasons or because they are men in a same-sex relationship. As it becomes more common, experts say the UK law on surrogacy - in place since 1985 - is outdated and leaves both surrogates and intended parents vulnerable. The law states a surrogate is deemed the legal mother when the baby is born - irrespective of genetics or any agreements that have been made. A parental order must be made to transfer legal parentage to the intended or biological parents. And it is illegal to advertise for a surrogate - meaning unless family or friends offer, intended parents can struggle to find a match. Fran and her surrogate Gina, shortly after giving birth Non-profit organisations and social media sites say they are seeing more people using their services to help match surrogates and would-be parents. Two women who met on a Facebook group were Fran and her surrogate Gina. Fran, 39, from Stockton-on-Tees, needed a surrogate to carry her two daughters, Evelyn and Grace, after cervical cancer treatment meant she could not carry a pregnancy herself. ""My consultant told me about a woman like me who was now a mum and she was my goal,"" said Fran. ""I want to put my story out there to show others that normal real-life women get through this and take their own baby home. ""I can't think of a better way of women empowering women."" She said those using surrogates in order to have a family are ""just normal people, teachers, people who re-mortgage their houses to do this"". ""When you're given a cancer diagnosis your whole life changes in a second and you fall into this hole, and the fog just descends,"" Fran told the BBC. ""And then when Evelyn was born it felt like for the first time since that diagnosis this weight had been lifted and I could start to think about life again."" Gina, 45, Fran's surrogate, runs one of the many Facebook groups where surrogates and intended parents match. She believes more people are considering surrogacy, in part down to celebrities such asRobbie Williamsand Kim Kardashian talking so openly about their own experiences. ""We have over 1,000 members currently,"" she said. ""Across independent groups there have been over 40 babies born in 2019 alone."" Gina backs changing the law so that those who have a baby with a surrogate become the legal parents ""from the minute that baby is born"". ""I don't want the parental rights to someone else's child. I never went into this to have another baby of my own. I've got three beautiful children of my own. It was all about creating a family for someone else. I don't want to be a mum to someone else's child,"" she said. Natalie with her own two children - she is now pregnant as a surrogate for the first time Natalie is mum to two children and is now 30 weeks pregnant with her first surrogate baby. The 34-year-old, from Bath, said: ""We struggled starting our own family - we had a miscarriage and a still birth. ""My daughter Sophie was born at 37 weeks but tragically she died. A friend had had breast cancer and I'd offered to be a surrogate for her if she needed. She didn't, but it was always in the back of my mind."" She added she was driven to help others who wanted to have a child but could not. ""I was watching The Nest [a TV drama featuring surrogacy] during lockdown and I felt so sorry for them,"" she said. ""I spoke to my husband and we talked about if I could deal with being a surrogate after losing our daughter, so I spoke to my GP and a bereavement nurse who were supportive. ""I met my intended parents on the Facebook groups and we chatted for a year before matching."" Natalie - seen here at an ultrasound scan - said she wanted to help others become parents Department of Health guidance said it does not generally recommend that those considering surrogacy do so independently on sites like Facebook, instead pointing to one of the four UK non-profit organisations. The trouble is those organisations have long waiting lists. Natalie Gamble is director of Brilliant Beginnings - another non-profit organisation in the UK which matches surrogates and intended parents. ""We get around 100 enquiries a month from women who want to be surrogates and that's risen considerably in the past few years,"" she said. ""Unfortunately, there are still more intended parents looking for a match than we can help."" Megan says she and partner Ed have never wanted their own children Megan, 25, from Ipswich looked into becoming a surrogate when she was furloughed during lockdown. She is currently getting to know two sets of intended parents she met through a surrogacy organisation. ""Me and my fiancÃ© Ed are childless by choice - we've always known we don't want children,"" she said. ""But if I have the ability why wouldn't I help someone else? ""My best friends totally get it - my parents and older family members not so much. My mum's main concern was she wanted me to have my own kids but they're both really supportive. I've donated eggs twice and this is absolutely what I want to do."" Surrogacy is legal in the UK. However, it is illegal to advertise for a surrogate and it is illegal for third parties to profit from matching Surrogacy arrangements in the UK are regulated by the Surrogacy Arrangements Act 1985 and the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008 In the US commercial surrogacy is legal in many states, but it can cost vast sums The NHS does not fund surrogacy arrangements The Department of Health lists the four main UK surrogacy organisations - COTS, Brilliant Beginnings, My Surrogacy Journey and Surrogacy UK The legislation relating to surrogacy is UK-wide, but there are different judicial systems in Scotland and Northern Ireland. TheDepartment of Health guidance,externalonly applies to England and Wales. In the US where surrogacy is more common and highly regulated, intended parents can go on to the birth certificate as soon as the baby is born - and payments of tens of thousands of pounds to surrogates are common. Commercial surrogacy is illegal in the UK, so a third party cannot profit from matching people. But it is not illegal for a surrogate to be paid expenses - non-profit organisations say between Â£12,000 and Â£20,000 is the average for such expenses, but there is no limit. The government agrees the surrogacy law in the UK needs to change and has asked the Law Commission of England and Wales along with the Scottish Law Commission to review it. Professor Nick Hopkins is the Law Commissioner for family law, and is one of the proponents leading the consultation. ""When we asked whether surrogacy law needed review we received one of our largest volume of responses. The law does need updating. ""We're looking at the idea that legal parentage would start not with a parental order but at birth. But it is fundamental to our review that the surrogate must retain her bodily autonomy throughout and a surrogacy agreement would not be enforceable if a surrogate withdrew her consent - which is extremely rare."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""We know surrogacy is an important option for families and we remain committed to reforming legislation to ensure more certainty for surrogates and intended parents."" The Law Commission will publish its recommendations for reform of the law and a draft bill towards the end of 2022.

"Insulate Britain climate change protesters blocked the exit slip road of the M25 at junction 18 A court ruling won by the government warns climate change protesters that they could be jailed if they continue their campaign of blocking the M25. Ministers hope theHigh Court injunction,externalcan prevent further disruption around London. Insulate Britain has blocked parts of the M25 five times in the last fortnight. Transport Secretary Grant Shappstweeted,externalthat activists faced ""possible imprisonment if they flout"". The Department for Transport (DfT) said more than 200 Insulate Britain campaigners hadbeen arrested at the protests, the first of which affected Essex, Hertfordshire and Kent on 13 September. Protesters have also targeted other motorways, including the M11 near Stansted Airport in Essex and the M3 in Surrey. The civil court action was taken by National Highways - the government body which runs motorways. Campaigners glued themselves to the motorway in some of the protests that began at the start of last week The protest group has been calling for the installation of heat-saving measures in social housing by 2025, and all homes by 2030. Insulate Britain spokeswoman Zoe Cohen told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that protesters ""understand the risks they are taking are because we have tried everything else to make the government protect us from the predicted impacts of climate chaos"". ""That involves the loss of all that we cherish, our society, our way of life and law and order,"" she said. Ina reply to Mr Shapps' tweet,external, Insulate Britain said the government ""is reckless and is putting lives at risk with its inaction on #insulation"". M25 protesters 'may cause serious injury or death' Priti Patel calls M25 climate protesters selfish Arrest tally over M25 protests reaches 77 Mr Shapps told MPs he believed the injunction would bring an end to the demonstrations. ""It barely goes without saying, it's irresponsible, dangerous and completely counterproductive,"" he said. ""Earlier in the process there was a somewhat different approach being taken. ""Yesterday the police were on the scene much more quickly. The injunction will greatly strengthen their hand."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Home Secretary Priti Patel, wholast week described protesters' actions as ""selfish"", said the injunction would mean ""people can get moving again"" on the London orbital motorway. ""We will not tolerate lives being put at risk,"" she said. Insulate Britain campaigners protested on the M25 near Cobham in Surrey on Tuesday Mr Shapps added the government would be reviewing the powers, but it was ""unacceptable for people to be able to walk on to not just a major highway but a motorway, stop traffic, be released the next day and do the same thing again"". ""An injunction may just be an interim way of doing [stopping] that,"" he said. Police chiefs have warned that the protests are putting officers in danger Assistant Chief Constable for Humberside Police, Chris Noble, who is the National Police Chiefs' Council lead for policing protests, told the Today programme police ""aren't anti-protest but we are pro-responsibility"". ""This is not a benign supermarket car park that this is taking place on,"" he said. He said police officers were most likely to come to harm as a result of the protests because they were having to run across motorways to try to remove the campaigners. In his High Court order, Mr Justice Lavender ruled it should last until 21 March, but there would be a hearing to review the situation on 5 October. The order covers every part of the M25 and the Dartford Crossing, including slip roads and bridges, and states that demonstrators are banned from ""causing damage to the surface of or to any apparatus on or around the M25 including but not limited to painting, damaging by fire, or affixing any item or structure thereto"". The order means that breaching it could lead to a civil court hearing. In a statement, Insulate Britain said it would continue its protests and ""as soon as the government makes a meaningful statement that we can trust, we will leave the motorway"". During the recent protests,the government saidit was ""investing Â£1.3bn this year alone to support people to install energy efficiency measures, and our upcoming Heat and Buildings Strategy will set out how we decarbonise the nation's homes in a way that is fair, practical and affordable"".

"The White House meeting is, for any British prime minister, the big ticket. And because of Covid, Boris Johnson has had to wait for his - the two years since he moved in to Downing Street means a new president here too. Imagine how different today could have been if Donald Trump was still in charge. The two leaders are intensely different, but when the big moment came, both appeared to be content. Mr Johnson and President Joe Biden met for 90 minutes after smiles for the cameras in the Oval Office. Their talks ranged from security, to climate change, Russia and China, and the possibility of closer trade ties. But on the trade deal issue, the president said they needed to ""work through"" it and ""talk a little"" - confirming Downing Street's assumption that the prospect of a major pact is a long way off. Number 10 didn't deny the UK could join an existing agreement between the US, Mexico and Canada - which the BBC understands has been considered - but said the priority was still pursuing a deal with America alone. What's the view from the US? Read Anthony Zurcher's analysis It's really clear from both sides that there is no rapid path to a trade deal - the opportunity that used to be lauded by Brexiteers and by President Trump. Mr Johnson hinted at that realism in his curtain raiser conversations on his way over here. And the president pretty much confirmed that here in their meeting in the Oval Office. This video can not be played Joe Biden and Boris Johnson met on the sidelines of a UN summit in New York The UK seems no longer to want to believe, or pretend, that doing business in a major deal is top of their list. Instead, while the government is still officially pursuing a standalone deal with the US there's a twin track with a more incremental approach - there have already been changes to whisky tariffs and British beef. But Number 10 is now hopeful that the Americans are seriously considering changing tack on British lamb. Biden downplays chances of UK-US trade deal Hotdogs and hand-holding: The US-UK relationship history A Downing Street source said the relationship between the two countries had made ""great strides forward"", hailing the ending of the US travel ban and especially President Biden's extra promises of cash to tackle climate change.

"Pen Farthing founded the charity A former Marine's mission to bring rescue animals back to the UK as the Taliban took over Afghanistan is being examined by the Charity Commission. The regulator has told the BBC it is looking into the funding arrangements of Operation Ark, which raised more than Â£200,000 from supporters in days. Operation Ark was launched by Pen Farthing's charity Nowzad to evacuate staff members and their immediate families, plus the animals in its care. The charity says it acted correctly. Nowzad, which reported income of close to Â£1m last year, told the BBC: ""The trustees are wholly confident that Nowzad's life-saving work in incredibly difficult circumstances was both the right and only thing to do and was absolutely in furtherance of the charity's purpose."" The Charity Commission has contacted Nowzad for further information after receiving reports around the governance and financial arrangements of Operation Ark. It is examining the use of charity funds for the evacuation and whether it is in line with the charity's purpose. ""We will assess the information provided by the trustees to determine whether or not there is a role for the Commission,"" it said in a statement provided to the BBC. Farthing tells of joy as rescue workers escape Pen Farthing through airport security with animals Minister offers help to get charity out of Kabul Leading charities lawyer Edwina Turner at Anthony Collins solicitors says this can be ""a crisis point"" in the life of a charity. ""It's very serious if the regulator gathers information from you. The charity will want to clear up any concerns,"" Mrs Turner said. ""One question they [Nowzad] would need an answer to is have they spent money raised in furtherance of their objects? Secondly, have they spent the money in the best way possible to achieve their charitable purposes. Thirdly, has the money raised through Operation Ark been spent in accordance with the terms of the fundraising campaign?"" Nowzad operated an animal clinic, dog and cat shelter and donkey sanctuary in Afghanistan. It trained and employed local Afghans - including women - as vets. As the Taliban takeover progressed last month it said its staff were in danger due to their work with foreign organisations, such as embassies, and ""the animals were at risk because the Taliban considers companion animals, particularly dogs, unclean."" Theformer Royal Marine and his supporters led a vociferous evacuation campaignwhich garnered a lot of public attention. It received huge public support but also came in for criticism, including from Defence Secretary Ben Wallace who complained it distracted from focusing on evacuating the most vulnerable. The charity says an ""extremely fraught but ultimately successful"" evacuation ensued. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

It says ""all staff and their families, including young children and two newborns, and 162 dogs and cats have been delivered to safety."" Nowzad confirmed the Charity Commission is asking for their trustees' comments on Operation Ark including, specifically, how it furthered the charity's purpose. ""The trustees of course recognise that it is entirely proper for the Commission to gather more information regarding this high-profile and unprecedented operation and are very happy to provide the information requested,"" it added. Nowzad is a registered charity in England and Wales and is regulated by the Charity Commission. At this stage, the Charity Commission has made clear they are gathering information and no findings have so far been made. According to Mrs Turner, the Charity Commission has a range of powers, including ""removing trustees, putting in an interim manager to run a charity or certain aspects of a charity"" or, in extreme circumstances, ""they can bring a charity to a close."" Mr Farthing, the founder of the animal shelter, who is originally from Dovercourt in Essex, is now working to find new homes in the UK for both his airlifted staff and rescued animals. He is also considering expanding his charity's work abroad, in countries he deems safer than Afghanistan, though he does not rule out a return to Kabul if conditions one day improve.

"Pret posted a 58% fall in sales to Â£299m in 2020, compared to Â£708m the year before Pret A Manger says it is seeing a return of workers to the office in busy city centres. Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays were now the busiest for the sandwich chain, Pret boss Pano Christou told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Pret has announced plans to hire 3,000 staff by the end of 2022 after cutting the same number of jobs last year. Mr Christou said the chain hoped to open 200 more shops in the UK over the next two years. He added that Pret hoped to expand into five markets overseas by the end of 2023, with many of the new outlets placed in train stations, bus stations and motorway services. The expansion proposals come as demand from commuters and office workers - a key market for the chain - has started to pick up again after plunging during the Covid lockdowns. The business is now looking to turn that around, despite having to tackle supply chain and heavy goods vehicle (HGV) lorry driver shortages, like many other businesses across the country. ""A couple of weeks ago, we ran out of some prepared fruit for two or three days [and] we were short of a couple of our bread lines for a couple of days,"" he said. ""I think we will see [the driver shortages] until the end of this year and into next year - there's a real challenge for the industry to navigate through."" The impact of the first lockdown led to Pret cutting 3,000 jobs, which represented a third of its workforce. Most of the jobs axed were from its shops, but 90 roles were also lost at its support centre. The chain posted a 58% fall in revenue to Â£299m in 2020, compared with Â£708m the year before. Pret a Manger to cut staff hours Pret A Manger plans rent talks in bid to avoid closures Should I be working from home or going back to the office? Mr Christou told the BBC the ""most difficult period"" over the last year was having to make people redundant. ""You have so many people's lives in your hands and making those decisions was the most difficult thing I had to do in my entire career,"" he said. ""When you have to make a call on thousands of people's jobs, that is something you spend a lot of time thinking through. But it was about how we could ensure that the business would survive and come through Covid."" As part of its recruitment drive, Pret said it had received a Â£100m investment from JAB and Pret founder Sinclair Beecham to accelerate the expansion. ""Last year we were in the eye of the storm during the height of the pandemic. Now we have the chance to build a bright new future for Pret,"" Mr Christou said. ""It's been an incredibly tough two years, but we have a big opportunity ahead."" Mr Christou said he was ""definitely seeing our Pret stores getting busier"" since coronavirus restrictions were lifted on 19 July. The number of employees working across the Pret has grown 28% since the start of the year, with more than 6,000 employees in the UK. About 30% of those employed this year had worked for Pret previously. ""Clearly recruitment is a challenge at the moment, and we're putting everything behind ensuring that we are an employer of choice; that we pay well, that we've got the right benefits, and then we've got the right bonus available to attract new staff,"" Mr Christou said. Last week Pret announced that it was increasing pay by at least 5% for its cafe workers, weeks after ditching paid breaks and attempting to slash bonuses. The move means that starting pay for store workers will now rise to a minimum of Â£9.40 an hour, up from the legal minimum of Â£8.91, but all team members, including managers will get a raise.

"Students will examine how the player uses social medial to make an impact Pupils starting media studies GCSEs this year will study Marcus Rashford's role as an influencer. The footballer and food campaigner's media impact will be included in the syllabus of the AQA exam board. It will focus on his use of social media to speak out on issues such as free school meals and racism in sport. The Manchester United and England player was awarded an MBE last year for services to vulnerable children during the pandemic. Rashford has used his public profile to reduce the stigma surrounding free school meals. He talked frankly of his own experience of relying on free lunches at school. In an open letter to MPs last year, he wrote: ""My mum worked full time, earning the minimum wage, to make sure we always had a good evening meal on the table - but it was not enough. ""The system was not built for families like mine to succeed, regardless of how hard my mum worked."" The footballer's high-profile interventions, often on social media, put pressure on ministers to extend food support through school holidays. But as well as allowing him to campaign, his celebrity profile has also exposed him to racist abuse, such as after missing a penalty during the Euro 2020 shootout at Wembley. Rashford was widely praised for dealing with the pressure, however. And after a mural was defaced in his hometown, of Withington, Greater Manchester, there was an outpouring of support. Fans of his social campaigning made a pilgrimage to what became a shrine of tributes, shared one photo at a time on social media. And Rashford responded on Twitter ""At one of my lowest points, the outpouring of support around this mural really lifted me and I am truly grateful for that."" Hundreds of messages were left on the mural in Manchester When the former Education Secretary Gavin Williamson recently muddled meeting him with the rugby player Maro Itoje, Rashford commented with restrained irony, tweeting: ""Accent could have been a giveaway."" Now, his media presence could form the basis of questions in GCSE exams in 2023. AQA head of curriculum for creative arts Sandra Allen said students would learn how social media could make an impact. ""It's not just an opportunity for them to learn about social media - it's also a great way to learn about important social and race issues as part of our commitment to equality, diversity and inclusion in the curriculum,"" she added. GCSE media studies courses are often a barometer of social trends. And AQA has chosen Rashford to replace the influencer and businesswoman Zoe Sugg, know to millions as Zoella. She was among the first influencers to break through from posting from her teenage bedroom to a large and lucrative following. But now, at the age of 31, she appeals more to young mothers than teenagers studying for GCSE exams. Steff Hutchinson, assistant head teacher at Caludon Castle School, in Coventry, said her pupils were very excited to hear they were going to be studying Rashford's use of the media. ""He is very, very relevant to all of my students, particularly those who are of colour themselves and the lads who are into football seeing someone who is a massive role model,"" she said. ""It will make sense to them, as they're also using social media to brand themselves and I think they'll understand how they could possibly be more careful and more accurate about what they do."" Also included in the updated syllabus is the BBC TV adaptation of Philip Pullman's novels, His Dark Materials,  as well as commercial radio shows and magazines.

"MPs are concerned that delays at Euston Station could lead to more costs There is ""no clear end in sight"" to HS2 costs and delays, MPs on the Public Accounts Committee have said. The committee is ""increasingly alarmed"" about key parts of the project, including a lack of progress at Euston Station. Without a government decision on the station, the project ""will literally run out of time"", the committee fears. The Department for Transport (DfT) said it was making significant progress delivering HS2. Euston Station is an important part of the first phase of the rail project, both as a London terminus and as a link to other infrastructure such as the London Underground. But the DfT ""is yet to make key decisions on the design and approach to construction there"" despite having the necessary planning consents. This could ""lead to yet more costs, delays and uncertainty over the promised benefits of the programme"", the committee said. HS2: Charges against '7 Sisters' tree protest in Buckinghamshire dropped HS2: Old Oak Common construction work begins Dame Meg Hillier, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, said: ""HS2 is already one of the single most expensive taxpayer-funded programmes in the UK but there's actually no clear end in sight in terms of the final cost, or even the final route. ""The project was plagued by a lack of planning and transparency from the start and there are many difficulties ahead. ""This project cannot simply keep sinking more taxpayer funds without greater clarity on the later phases. The development of Euston is a real challenge that must be resolved swiftly now."" The current estimated cost of completing HS2 is between Â£72bn and Â£98bn at 2019 prices, compared with an original budget of Â£55.7bn in 2015 at 2015 prices. The DfT said: ""We are making significant progress delivering HS2, a key part of our promise to build back better from Covid-19. An artist's impression of Birmingham Curzon Street HS2 station ""We will continue to rigorously control pressures, and as our latest update to Parliament confirmed, Phase One remains within budget and schedule."" The Integrated Rail Plan would soon outline how major rail projects, including HS2 Phase 2b, would work together to ""deliver the reliable train services that passengers across the North and Midlands need and deserve"", it added. HS2 Ltd, the firm behind the project, said: ""HS2 Phases One and 2a have received parliamentary approval and have very clear cost ranges. ""Although there have been challenges - particularly relating to the pandemic - the project remains on budget."" The company said the HS2 was supporting more than 20,000 jobs. The Public Accounts Committee has been critical of the rail project in the past, and in May 2020 said HS2 was ""badly off course"" and that bosses had been ""blindsided by contact with reality"". The committee accused HS2 Ltd and the DfT of lacking transparency and undermining public confidence. Following this criticism, the government was now providing ""a clearer explanation of costs than we have previously seen in its reporting to Parliament"", the MPs said on Wednesday. As tunnelling machines bore into the earth below the Chilterns, intense scrutiny of HS2 continues above ground. HS2's huge budget, environmental impact and community disruption are making lots of MPs and their constituents angry. But last week the government's high speed minister recommitted to the project ""going full steam ahead"". But there is still a major political issue for the government on HS2 - will it all get built? The prime minister still hasn't confirmed if the Eastern leg from the West Midlands to Leeds will happen, and Northern politicians are starting to express their frustration. Conservative and Labour MPs in Yorkshire see it as crucial for ""levelling-up"" the region, alongside other major rail investment they want too. But the government's cheque book is under pressure after a huge year of Covid spending. And with inflation rising and costs growing, we wait to see if the chancellor and prime minister push the button for it in full - or if HS2 will be slimmed down.

"The British food industry will be forced to pay five times more for carbon dioxide as part of a government deal with a US company to restart production in the UK. Environment Secretary George Eustice said carbon dioxide prices would rise from Â£200 per tonne to Â£1,000. The government has agreed to pay out tens of millions of pounds to CF Industries to reopen a plant in the UK. The closure had raised fears over food supplies and the nuclear industry. US-owned CF Industries recently shut two UK sites that produce 60% of the country's commercial carbon dioxide supplies, because of a sharp rise in gas prices. This video can not be played Ros Atkins on... the UK's rising energy bills Farms, food producers and supermarkets have warned that a shortage of carbon dioxide will lead to significant disruption to the manufacture and supply of fresh produce. The Times also reported,externalthat ministers were concerned that the UK might have to close its six advanced gas-cooled nuclear reactors, which also use CO2. The government announced late on Tuesday night that it would meet the full operating costs to run CF Industries' Billingham plant in Teesside for three weeks. The costs are expected to be in the ""low tens of millions"" and will be below Â£50m. Mr Eustice said that the deal with CF Industries ""will be not a loan, it will be a payment to underwrite some of their fixed costs"". At the end of the three-week period, it is hoped that the price of carbon dioxide will have risen sufficiently to make it economically viable for CF Industries to keep production running. Mr Eustice said the food industry would have to accept ""a big, sharp rise"" carbon dioxide prices from Â£200 to Â£1,000 a tonne. ""The critical thing was to get the production up and running expeditiously. That's why we've needed this government intervention,"" he said. ""But we've had meetings with the food industry. They all recognise that the price of carbon dioxide is going to increase substantially and when that price increases, then the market signal will be then for these plants to continue producing."" Mr Eustice insisted that the rise in cost would not have a ""significant impact"" on food prices. He said that while food prices were increasing ""due to global commodity prices, oil prices and also other factors such as labour shortages"", carbon dioxide was ""a tiny proportion"" of the industry's overall costs. CF Industries had halted two of its fertiliser factories - which produce carbon dioxide as a by-product - because of gas prices. Carbon dioxide is used in the slaughter of animals such as chickens CF Industries' Billingham plant will need up to three days to start producing new CO2. The company told the BBC it had ""no estimate"" on when its second UK plant at Ince in Cheshire would  resume production. The British Meat Processors Association said the deal to open CF Industries' Teesside plant was a ""huge relief"" and said it was now ""focused on re-establishing supplies before Friday this week, which is when around 25% of pork production was in danger of shutting down"". Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, welcomed the decision, but said the timetable to restart CF Industries' factory and begin producing carbon dioxide ""will still be tight"". He told the BBC's Today programme: ""Our understanding is that provided that carbon dioxide starts to get through to food producers by the end of the week, then we can avert major and significant disruption in our stores."" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the ""exceptional short-term arrangement"" would ensure industries that rely on a stable supply of CO2 ""have the resources they require to avoid disruption"". He said: ""With regards to the CO2 situation, it was abundant, it was very cheap and I think a lot of people were surprised at what happened."" The government intends to publish the letter from Mr Kwarteng to Tony Will, chief executive of CF Industries, which sets out the terms of the taxpayer support. Commenting on the three-week deal, Mr Kwarteng said: ""In a critical intervention you have to have a way of exiting the arrangement. ""It is not a case of just trying to nationalise it or supporting it indefinitely, and that is why in the critical period we needed to have a short term arrangement I am confident that we can get other sources of CO2 in that period. Mr Eustice said that the shortage of carbon dioxide had been caused by a ""perfect storm"" of circumstances where CF Industries had shut its two plants because ""an increase in gas price means they are not profitable"", while two other providers had closed their sites for maintenance. But the British Meat Processors Association (BMPA) said the current difficulties showed how exposed the UK is, because of its reliance on such a small number of carbon dioxide producers. ""Over many years, we have had a major consolidation of the industry resulting in sectors like food and drink, nuclear and health being reliant on a very small number of very large suppliers,"" the BMPA said. ""If a market-based solution is to be found, it will likely involve longer-term higher prices for CO2, which will be sustainable for some, but not all users of the gas."" Ian Wright, the chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, also called on the government to support other fertiliser producers and help food producers to look for alternatives to CO2. Mr Will, who flew from the US to the UK on Sunday to meet Mr Kwarteng, said: ""We look forward to working with Secretary Kwarteng and the UK government on developing a longer-term solution, including the development of alternative suppliers of CO2 for the UK market."" Farmers fear gas price crisis may spark pig cull How could the CO2 shortage hit food supplies? Gas price crisis: Government poised to step in The BBC understands that the deal with CF Industries has been drafted so that other companies who stop production because of high commodity prices will not be able to ask the government for similar help. Norwegian firm Yara has also cut production at a number of European factories, including one in Hull. This video can not be played The prime minister says he does ânot believe people will be short of foodâ amid reports of some empty supermarket shelves. Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged people not to worryabout putting food on the table this winter, amid rising energy and food bills and a cut to universal credit. Wholesale prices for gas have surged 250% since January, with a 70% rise since August alone, leading to calls for support from the industry and the collapse of some smaller energy firms. Mr Opie added that the government should also take action on other issues affecting food retailers in recent weeks, such as the shortage of HGV drivers, which has been exacerbated by the pandemic and many drivers returning to the European Union after Brexit. The government has been keen to stress that this is very much an emergency measure, time-limited, and with a cap on the amount it is prepared to pay. It had to do something. Food producers were warning that shortages would become apparent within days, at a time when supply chains have already been disrupted by other issues, such as a lack of lorry drivers. But the fact remains that it has agreed to give a large US-owned company tens of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money, just to operate one of its own plants. That isn't a particularly good look - and it has cast a glaring spotlight on the vulnerability of a key part of the economy. Now there is a three-week window for government, supermarkets and food producers to come up with a ""sustainable market-based solution"". In practice, that's likely to mean users paying more for their CO2, a cost which will ultimately be borne by consumers.

"Xi Jinping made his address in a video recording at the annual summit China will not build new coal-fire projects abroad, a move that could be pivotal in tackling global emissions. President Xi Jinping made the announcement in his address at the United Nations General Assembly. China has been funding coal projects in countries like Indonesia and Vietnam under a massive infrastructure project known as the Belt and Road initiative. But it has been under pressure to end the financing, as the world tries to meet Paris climate agreement targets. ""China will step up support for other developing countries in developing green and low-carbon energy, and will not build new coal-fired power projects abroad,"" Mr Xi said in a video recording at the annual summit. No further details were provided, but the move could limit the expansion of coal plants in many developing countries under China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The BRI has seen China fund trains, roads, ports and coal plants in numerous countries, many of them developing nations. For the first time in several years however, it did not fund any coal projects in the first half of 2021. China is also the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter and is heavily reliant on coal for domestic energy needs. Mr Xi mentioned promises made last year about China achieving peak emissions before 2030 and then transitioning to carbon neutrality by 2060. China sets surprise 2060 carbon neutrality goal The US Climate Envoy John Kerry welcomed the announcement, saying in a statement that he was ""absolutely delighted to hear that President Xi has made this important decision"". The head of the COP26 United Nations Climate Change Conference due to be held in Scotland next month also applauded the news. ""It is clear the writing is on the wall for coal power. I welcome President Xi's commitment to stop building new coal projects abroad - a key topic of my discussions during my visit to China,"" Alok Sharmasaid on Twitter,external. This is the announcement that China has increasingly been expected to make. For nearly a decade now coal fired power stations have been a key feature of Xi Jinping's awkwardly named Belt and Road Initiative of foreign investment. However, the reality is that the number of these projects has fallen significantly. Crucial details will need to be cleared up; when will this take effect? Will it cover new power plants approved but not yet built? Will China also stop financing new coal fired power stations abroad? This is progress, but it's the low hanging fruit in terms of China's addiction to coal. Half the coal burned in the world is burned in China. It is still adding numerous new coal power plants at home, with a lifespan of 40 to 50 years. The biggest question remains: When will this country start to cut the overall number within its borders and substantially reduce its dependency on the most polluting form of power generation? Mr Xi's address came after US President Joe Biden gave his maiden speech at the United Nations during which he urged countries to work together as never before to tackle global problems such as climate change and the pandemic. Mr Biden also said that democracy would not be defeated by authoritarianism, but refrained from mentioning China by name. ""The future will belong to those who give their people the ability to breathe free, not those who seek to suffocate their people with an iron hand,"" Mr Biden said. ""We all must call out and condemn the targeting and oppression of racial, ethnic, and religious minorities, whether it occurs in Xinjiang or northern Ethiopia, or anywhere in the world,"" he added, referring to the western Chinese region where China is accused of using forced labour. Relations between the US and China are at an all time low over issues including trade, human rights and the origins of Covid-19. In his address, Mr Xi said that China had peaceful intentions in international relations. But he also seemed to address the tensions and the formation of alliances in the region like the ""Quad"" grouping, made up of Australia, the US, India and Japan, saying there was a need to ""reject the practice of forming small circles or zero-sum games"".

"This video can not be played Watch: President Biden's first UN General Assembly speech In his first address to the United Nations, US President Joe Biden has urged global cooperation through ""a decisive decade for our world"". His calls for unity come amid tensions with allies over the US' Afghanistan withdrawal and a major diplomatic row with France over a submarine deal. The US also announced it was doubling its climate finance pledge by 2024. Reaffirming his support for democracy and diplomacy, Mr Biden said: ""We must work together like never before."" The 76th General Assembly in New York City takes place against the backdrop of a climate crisis and a once-in-a-century pandemic, both of which have sharpened global divides. Mr Biden pushed for cooperation on these fronts, saying: ""Whether we choose to fight for our shared future or not will reverberate for generations to come. Simply put, we stand, in my view, at an inflection point in history."" Mr Biden on Tuesday stressed that the US is ""not seeking a new Cold War or a world divided into rigid blocs"". The US, he said, ""is ready to work with any nation that steps up and pursues peaceful resolution to shared challenges, even if we have intense disagreements in other areas"". The remark appeared to be a response to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, who this weekend warned the US and China were headed for ""a Cold War that would be different from the past one, and probably more dangerous and more difficult to manage"". The president also touted the pullout from Afghanistan, which has been criticised by allies at home and abroad, saying the US was ending a ""period of relentless war"" for a ""new era of relentless diplomacy"". Mr Biden offered a key pledge on climate finance as well, saying the US will increase funding for developing countries to $11.4bn (Â£8.3bn) by 2024. This means the US will offer just over half of the European Union's pledge to help poorer nations cope with climate change. Has climate pledge to poor countries been met? The developed world had pledged to provide these countries $100bn a year by 2020 but this has still not been achieved. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson - who is meeting with Mr Biden later on Tuesday - praised the ""massive contribution"" and said the US had ""stepped up to the plate"". At the end of his first address, Mr Biden promised that the US would lead ""with our allies"". ""We will lead on all the greatest challenges of our time, from Covid to climate, human dignity and human rights, but we will not go it alone,"" he said. World leaders at odds with former President Donald Trump had hoped for a more stable and reliable America under his successor's leadership - but Mr Biden's most recent foreign policy moves have made some uneasy. The US' lack of coordination during the Afghanistan exit after two decades of war rankled allies and led to an international scramble to evacuate. The Nato mission at the time of the withdrawal comprised troops from 36 countries, three-quarters of whom were non-American. How Europe's relationship with Joe Biden turned sour Last week, a trilateral US-UK deal to provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines infuriated the French, who had their own five-year-old contract to build conventional submarines for the Australians. French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian described the agreement as ""a stab in the back"", and the top French diplomats in both countries were recalled. The Biden administration has also seen international criticism over alleged US hoarding of Covid-19 vaccines and non-reciprocal travel restrictions, as well as frugality with climate aid. After four years of America First and Donald Trump's isolationist nationalism, this was a speech the leaders of the liberal democracies wanted to cheer. But Joe Biden's first appearance before the UN General Assembly will be treated with a good deal of scepticism after America's shambolic departure from Afghanistan. That said, the US president was determined to push his more outward looking view of the world. And turning a page, he was able to say this was the first time in 20 years that America wasn't at war. British diplomats will have cheered his pledge to double to $11.4bn the money to tackle climate change by 2024 - something they have been lobbying the White House relentlessly on. One issue that enjoys bipartisan support in Washington is the threat posed by China - the driving force behind the new security partnership with Britain and Australia. He didn't mention the world's other superpower by name, but it's clear who he was talking about. The US president has had a torrid, horrid summer. This speech was an attempt to reassure America's international allies - and to put flesh on the bones of his claim that ""America is back"".

"Boris Johnson met Joe Biden at the Oval Office in the White House With Joe Biden and the Democrats back in charge in Washington, the US was expected to strengthen ties with Europe and put the UK, to paraphrase Barack Obama, toward the back of the queue. Donald Trump's focus on transactional diplomacy and penchant for one-on-one deals was out; multilateralism was again in vogue. That's not exactly how things have played out, however. On Tuesday morning, Biden gave a speech at the United Nations emphasising the need for collective action by the community of nations.

"This video can not be played ""This is a very important trip for us"": Boris Johnson and Joe Biden hold face-to-face talks Joe Biden has played down the chances of a post-Brexit free trade deal between the US and UK, as he held talks with Boris Johnson at the White House. The US president said he would discuss the issue ""a little bit"" with the UK prime minister, adding: ""We're going to have to work that through."" Downing Street said a direct deal with the US remained the ""priority"". But UK ministers are pondering joining an existing North American trade pact instead, the BBC understands. Mr Biden and Mr Johnson also discussed Northern Ireland, climate change and Afghanistan during the 90-minute meeting. The UK is keen to strike free trade deals around the world in the wake of leaving the European Union's single market - including with the US, with which annual trade was worthan estimated $273bn (Â£200bn),externalin 2019. A deal would encourage more business between the two countries by making it cheaper, usually by reducing or eliminating taxes called tariffs. How many trade deals has the UK done? BBC specialists on the prospects for UK-US trade Biden meets Boris: Shared interests but bumps remain Biden in new protocol warning over Northern Ireland But Mr Johnson, echoing Mr Biden, downplayed chances of securing agreement with the US before the next general election, saying: ""The Americans do negotiate very hard."" Environment Secretary George Eustice told Sky News: ""We still very much hope to be able to put together an agreement with the United States. We are not putting timescales on it."" ""It's just not a priority for the US administration,"" he added. Mr Johnson highlighted the decision to lift the ban on British beef, and Downing Street is increasingly confident that there could soon be a favourable decision lifting the export ban on lamb. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office before the talks, Mr Biden said: ""We're going to talk a little bit about trade today and we're going to have to work that through."" He did not counter the assertion from his predecessor Barack Obama that the UK would have to join ""the back of the queue"" in seeking a trade deal after Brexit. It's really clear from both sides that there is no rapid path to a trade deal - the opportunity that used to be lauded by Brexiteers and by President Trump. Mr Johnson hinted at that realism in his curtain-raiser conversations on his way over here. And the president pretty much confirmed that in the meeting in the Oval Office. The UK seems no longer to want to believe, or pretend, that doing business in a major deal is top of their list. Instead, while the government is still officially pursuing a stand-alone deal with the US there's a twin track with a more incremental approach - there have already been changes to whisky tariffs and British beef. But No 10 is now hopeful that the Americans are seriously considering changing tack on British lamb. Read more from Laurahere. A source familiar with the government's thinking told the BBC the UK could negotiate entry into an existing trade arrangement between the US, Canada and Mexico - the USMCA - set up after former US President Donald Trump tore up its predecessor, NAFTA. ""There are a variety of different ways to do this,"" the source said. ""The question is whether the US administration is ready. The ball is in the US's court. It takes two to tango."" Joe Biden urges unity amid tensions with allies Hotdogs and hand-holding: The US-UK relationship history Elsewhere, Downing Street said Mr Johnson and Mr Biden agreed all diplomatic and humanitarian methods must be used to stop conditions getting worse in Afghanistan. The leaders said any international recognition of the Taliban must be contingent on the group respecting human rights. This followed arequest by the Taliban to address world leaders at the United Nations summitin New York this week. Brexit gave the UK the freedom to strike its own trade deals - and accounting for Â£1 in every Â£6 of British trade, a pact with the US was the ultimate prize. But Whitehall officials have for months been scrabbling for an alternative after the Biden administration indicated it was in no hurry to resume talks. Joining the USMCA arrangement already agreed by the US, Canada and Mexico could give the UK deeper benefits on some goods and digital trade with North American economies. But it has limited coverage of the UK's biggest strength when it comes to selling to America, namely services. Economists say the overall gains from joining USMCA may be very limited, perhaps less than 0.1% of GDP America's price of admission may include a hurdle already encountered: standards surrounding food and agricultural goods. For President Biden is explicit that his priority is US workers, not least its farmers. He is also clear that domestic issues take precedence. Even if the UK does want to sign up to USMCA, it may still be at the back of a queue - simply to get its application considered. Before the meeting, Mr Biden alsoissued a fresh warning to the UK that peace in Northern Ireland must not be jeopardisedas a result of complications caused by Brexit. He made it clear he had concerns about the Irish border, amid continuing issues withNorthern Ireland Protocol- the arrangement which helps prevent checks along the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The pair also discussed the newUK, US and Australia security pactin the Asia-Pacific region, with No 10 describing it as an example of ""shared values and approach to the world"". The meeting, taking place on the sidelines of the UN summit, involved the traditional exchange of gifts. Mr Biden gave the prime minister a framed photo of their first meeting in Cornwall at the G7 summit in June, and a White House-branded watch. Mr Johnson presented the president with a signed copy of a book written by British astronaut Tim Peake, with an inscription expressing hopes that it ""provides a reminder of what we're fighting to save as our countries tackle climate change together"". The prime minister's gift comes weeks ahead of the COP26 summit in Glasgow, which is seen as a crucial moment to bring climate change under control. Earlier, Mr Biden announced the US would double its climate finance pledge and increase funding for developing countries to $11.4bn (Â£8.3bn) by 2024. Mr Johnson said the US had ""stepped up to the plate"" with what he called a ""massive contribution"" towards the $100bn (Â£73bn) goal for countries to raise.

"This video can not be played The prime minister says he does ânot believe people will be short of foodâ amid reports of some empty supermarket shelves. Boris Johnson has said people should not worry about putting food on the table this winter, amid surging energy prices and a cut to universal credit. The prime minister told BBC News: ""I don't believe people will be short of food - and wages are actually rising."" It comes after Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng warned some households face a ""very difficult winter"". Energy and food bills are rising due to a spike in global gas prices - and many families face a Â£20-a-week benefit cut. The cost of protecting customers from failing energy providers could lead to higher bills,the boss of the energy regulator Ofgem has warned. Speaking to the BBC in New York, where he has been meeting world leaders at the United Nations, Mr Johnson said the surge in energy prices was a ""short-term"" problem caused by ""the global economy coming back to life"" after the coronavirus pandemic. Government to pay millions to restart CO2 supplies Is the UK headed for a gas shortage this winter? Gas price crisis: Government poised to step in Universal credit: When will the Â£20 increase stop? ""We are talking to the energy companies - doing what we can to keep prices low, to make sure that the supermarket shelves aren't empty,"" he said. Households across England, Scotland and Wales are set to see their energy bills rise by an average of Â£139 a year in October. Workers also face a rise in National Insurance payments from next April, to help fund higher costs for the NHS and social care. In his BBC interview, Mr Johnson insisted the gas price increase was an ""interim"" issue and the global energy markets would ""rectify themselves"". Some supermarket shoppers have been met with empty shelves It showed that the UK was right to be moving to renewable energy, he added. The government is hoping to limit further energy bill rises by keeping a price cap in place, and also plans to help bigger firms take on customers from small suppliers that have gone bust. Separately, the government says it has taken action to prevent supermarket shortages with a deal to restart production at CF Industries, the UK's biggest producer of carbon dioxide. The gas is widely used by the food industry to prolong shelf life. Restarting production at the carbon dioxide plants is set to cost taxpayers tens of millions of pounds, after the government agreed to meet the full operating costs for three weeks. Energy price rises have been as dizzying as New York's skyscrapers - but Boris Johnson was reluctant to acknowledge the squeeze on supply was anything more than a short-term problem. The government has managed to broker a deal on CO2, but the pressure points this autumn go beyond that. There are real fears at home about household bills, food supplies, and rising prices. But Mr Johnson blamed the pressures on the pandemic, saying the issues were just in the ""interim"". While he said the government would help where it could, he did not provide details of any further actions the government might take, placing his faith in the market to resolve the crunch and pointing to his energy ""ten-point plan"". A long-term Whitehall plan may not be that much comfort to those worrying about paying higher bills right here and now. Read more from Laura here. Mr Johnson has again rejected calls from Labour and many Tory MPs to scrap the cut to the Â£20 a week top-up to universal credit, which some MPs have warnedwill push many working families into poverty. Instead of keeping the top-up, which was brought in to help people through the pandemic, Mr Johnson said:  ""We think the best thing we can do is help people into high-skilled, high wage jobs, that is what is happening, ""Unemployment is falling very rapidly, jobs are being created, wages are rising. ""And rather than raising people's taxes to put more money into benefits, we want to see companies paying their workers more."" Labour held a debate in the Commons, calling on the government to halt the proposed cut to the universal credit top-up. The party's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Bridget Phillipson, said working families faced a squeeze on living standards this winter ""on a scale not seen for a generation"" - and it was down to government decisions, not an ""unforeseeable series of unhappy accidents"". ""Incomes are coming down, prices are going up - especially energy prices - taxes are going up, rents are going up, childcare costs are going up, fuel costs are going up, rail fares are going up. ""And with empty shelves in too many shops, restaurants closing because of meat shortages, and now refrigerant shortages putting Christmas at risk, it isn't just that people can afford less, there is also less to afford,"" she told MPs. Speaking on BBC Two's Newsnight programme on Monday, the Conservative former Brexit Secretary, David Davis, warned there was a risk of a ""cost of living crisis"" for new Tory voters such as ""the plumber, the bricklayer, the lorry driver"". He said his advice to Chancellor Rishi Sunak would be: ""You think hard about the ordinary family's take-home pay and what they have to buy with it, because that will be a dictator of how people feel going in to the new year.""

"Dua Lipa is one of the UK's most streamed artists - but less popular acts struggle to make a living, MPs say The UK's major record labels could face an inquiry into whether their practices are distorting the music market. The government has written to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) asking it to consider an investigation into Sony, Warner and Universal Music. It has also asked the watchdog to consider YouTube's dominance over the streaming market. The move comes after MPs demanded a ""complete reset"" of the music industry, amid ""pitiful returns"" for artists. The Culture Select Committee issued the call in a damning report this summer, after hearing evidence from musicians such as Nile Rodgers, Elbow and Radiohead in a six-month inquiry into music streaming. MPs call for complete reset of music streaming Stones and Jones call for streaming reforms Streaming 'is threatening the future of music' Julian Knight, who chairs the committee, said while streaming had ""brought significant profits to the recorded-music industry, the talent behind it - performers, songwriters and composers - are losing out"". He called for the CMA to investigate the commercial power wielded by major record labels, expressing concern they receive beneficial placement on playlists and storefronts at the expense of independent labels and self-releasing artists. In an official response, the government said there ""may be value"" in such a market study but it was up to the CMA to decide whether to pursue it. A spokesperson for the watchdog told the BBC that ""initial proposals"" for an investigation would be considered at its board meeting next month. The British Phonographic Industry (BPI), which represents the UK's recorded-music industry, said it would comply with any resulting inquiry. ""Should the CMA conduct a study, we look forward to detailing labels' role in supercharging the careers of British talent within a complex and dynamic ecosystem,"" it said. The culture committee's report, issued in July, was ultimately critical of the UK music industry. While streaming had helped save the music industry, after two decades of illegal downloads, record labels and streaming companies had subsequently ""leveraged structural advantages to achieve seemingly unassailable positions"" in their markets, it said. In its response, the government said the select committee's inquiry had provided ""invaluable insights"" into music streaming but ""there is still work to be done to understand the problems musicians are facing"". It called for more research into the way musicians were paid and royalties shared, saying it would ""assess different models"" to see how they would affect the industry, including ""equitable remuneration"" - where labels and artists receive an equal share of streaming royalties, in contrast to the current arrangement, where artists receive about 16%. This video can not be played Nile Rodgers says streaming numbers are meaningless when it comes to being paid The government also said it wanted to ""explore ways in which new and upcoming songwriters [and] composers"" could be paid more fairly. The MPs' report noted writers received particularly poor revenues from streaming services, after pop composer Fiona Bevan revealed she had earned just Â£100 for a track on Kylie Minogue's number-one album Disco. ""Right now, hit songwriters are driving Ubers,"" she told the inquiry. ""It's quite shameful"" In its response, the government said it would work with Credit's Due - an initiative launched by Abba's Bjorn Ulvaeus - to ensure writers receive proper credit and remuneration for songs they worked on. It also agreed that the role of curators who make playlists on services such as Spotify and Apple Music warranted further investigation. While the select committee recommended intro using a ""code of conduct"" to avoid bribes and favouritism, the government said it would gather more evidence to decide ""the case for further intervention"". Mr Knight welcomed the government's response, saying: ""Our inquiry into music streaming exposed fundamental problems within the structure of the music industry itself. ""It is testimony to all those who gave evidence to our inquiry that the government has acknowledged our report as a 'key moment' for the music industry. ""Within days we expect to see the government's own research published into the pitiful earning of creators in this digital age and hope it will corroborate what artists and musicians told us. ""We will be monitoring the outcome and what tangible steps the government pledges to take to redress this unfairness and reward the talent behind the music."" The BPI said: ""We welcome government's recognition of the need for a better understanding of the complexity of the music-streaming market"". Working together to address areas of concern was  ""preferable to legislative intervention"", it said, warning new regulations could jeopardise the industry's ""hard won return to growth after years of decline"".

"Students will examine how the player uses social medial to make an impact Pupils starting media studies GCSEs this year will study Marcus Rashford's role as an influencer. The footballer and food campaigner's media impact will be included in the syllabus of the AQA exam board. It will focus on his use of social media to speak out on issues such as free school meals and racism in sport. The Manchester United and England player was awarded an MBE last year for services to vulnerable children during the pandemic. Rashford has used his public profile to reduce the stigma surrounding free school meals. He talked frankly of his own experience of relying on free lunches at school. In an open letter to MPs last year, he wrote: ""My mum worked full time, earning the minimum wage, to make sure we always had a good evening meal on the table - but it was not enough. ""The system was not built for families like mine to succeed, regardless of how hard my mum worked."" The footballer's high-profile interventions, often on social media, put pressure on ministers to extend food support through school holidays. But as well as allowing him to campaign, his celebrity profile has also exposed him to racist abuse, such as after missing a penalty during the Euro 2020 shootout at Wembley. Rashford was widely praised for dealing with the pressure, however. And after a mural was defaced in his hometown, of Withington, Greater Manchester, there was an outpouring of support. Fans of his social campaigning made a pilgrimage to what became a shrine of tributes, shared one photo at a time on social media. And Rashford responded on Twitter ""At one of my lowest points, the outpouring of support around this mural really lifted me and I am truly grateful for that."" Hundreds of messages were left on the mural in Manchester When the former Education Secretary Gavin Williamson recently muddled meeting him with the rugby player Maro Itoje, Rashford commented with restrained irony, tweeting: ""Accent could have been a giveaway."" Now, his media presence could form the basis of questions in GCSE exams in 2023. AQA head of curriculum for creative arts Sandra Allen said students would learn how social media could make an impact. ""It's not just an opportunity for them to learn about social media - it's also a great way to learn about important social and race issues as part of our commitment to equality, diversity and inclusion in the curriculum,"" she added. GCSE media studies courses are often a barometer of social trends. And AQA has chosen Rashford to replace the influencer and businesswoman Zoe Sugg, know to millions as Zoella. She was among the first influencers to break through from posting from her teenage bedroom to a large and lucrative following. But now, at the age of 31, she appeals more to young mothers than teenagers studying for GCSE exams. Steff Hutchinson, assistant head teacher at Caludon Castle School, in Coventry, said her pupils were very excited to hear they were going to be studying Rashford's use of the media. ""He is very, very relevant to all of my students, particularly those who are of colour themselves and the lads who are into football seeing someone who is a massive role model,"" she said. ""It will make sense to them, as they're also using social media to brand themselves and I think they'll understand how they could possibly be more careful and more accurate about what they do."" Also included in the updated syllabus is the BBC TV adaptation of Philip Pullman's novels, His Dark Materials,  as well as commercial radio shows and magazines.
