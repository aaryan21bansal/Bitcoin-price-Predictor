"This video can not be played The Eiffel Tower turns off its lights Leaders of countries affected by recent terror attacks have voiced solidarity with the UK after the deadly attack near the Houses of Parliament. A lone attacker was shot dead after he used a car to run down pedestrians, killing two, and stabbed a police officer to death outside Parliament. Leaders of France and Germany, which suffered deadly vehicle attacks last year, offered the UK their support. The US president offered condolences and praised UK security forces. There is a mixture of nationalities among the dead, police say, and 29 people have been treated in hospital, of whom seven are critically injured. Among those injured by the car on Westminster Bridge arethree French schoolchildren and two Romanians, while five South Koreans were hurt in the chaos that followed the attack. In Paris, the lights of the Eiffel Tower went out from midnight (23:00 GMT) in a tribute to the victims. Live coverage What we know so far Eyewitness accounts World watches London 'stabbed in heart' How the news broke Video: Aftermath on the bridge 'Terror incident': In pictures President Francois Hollande expressed his ""solidarity"" with the British people, saying ""terrorism concerns us all and France knows how the British people are suffering today"". Emergency response workers continued to work at the scene into the evening In July last year,a man drove a lorry into pedestrians in the southern French city of Nice, killing 84 people. The attack was claimed by the Islamic State (IS) group. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose country sawa lorry attack in December that killed 12 people in Berlinand was also claimed by IS, said her thoughts were ""with our British friends and all of the people of London"". ""I want to say for Germany and its citizens: We stand firmly and resolutely by Great Britain's side in the fight against all forms of terrorism,"" she added. US President Donald Trump spoke by phone to British Prime Minister Theresa May to offer his condolences and to praise the effective response of UK security services. Mr Trump pledged the ""full co-operation and support"" of the US government in bringing those responsible for the attack to justice, the White House said in a statement. Belgium's prime minister sent a message of support as his country marked the first anniversary of the suicide bomb attacks on the Brussels airport and underground system, which killed 32 people. ""Our condolences are with those who mourn and all who are affected in London,"" Charles Michel tweeted. ""Belgium stands with UK in fight against terror."" European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said in astatement,externalthat the people of Brussels and Belgium had ""suffered a similar pain and felt the support of your sympathy and solidarity"". ""At this emotional time, we at the European Commission can only send that sympathy back twofold."" Brussels marks bomb attacks anniversary People in Brussels made a heart sign with their hands to remember the victims of the attacks there a year ago Russian President Vladimir Putin also sent condolences by telegram to Mrs May, expressing support for the bereaved and wounded. ""The forces of terror are acting more and more deviously and cynically. It is clear that, in order to counteract the terrorist threat, all members of the global community must combine forces,"" he said. In other reaction: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in astatement,externalthat it was an ""attack on democracies around the world"" and Canadians stood ""united with the British people in the fight against terrorism"" Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said it was an ""attack on parliaments, freedom and democracy everywhere"" and offered his support and solidarity to the British government Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said he and Mr Turnbull had discussed the attack as they met in Canberra. ""Together, we send our condolences to the prime minister of the UK and together we condemn terrorism and we stand against all forms of terrorism.'' Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said: ""Horrible images from London. The very heart of the city has been struck. Our thoughts are with the British people."" Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy tweeted ""solidarity with the victims"", and sent a telegram to Mrs May offering condolences. ""We must remain united against these type of threats that affect all of us equally and that know no barriers,'' he wrote. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan emphasised that ""Turkey feels and shares deeply in the United Kingdom's pain"" and that it stood in ""solidarity"" with Britain ""in the fight against terrorism"". It came just hours after his latest salvo in a fiery row with European allies, especially Germany and the Netherlands, over Turkish referendum campaigning in their countries. Mr Erdogan had warned that Europeans would not be able to walk safely on the world's streets if ""Europe continues this way"". But not all international reaction was so reserved, with some right-wing politicians suggesting that controls on immigration - or even all Muslims - was the way forward. It has subsequently emerged that the attacker was born in Britain. The leader of Australia's One Nation party, Pauline Hanson, announcedher own personal hashtag.,external. ""It's #Pray4Muslimban. Put a ban on it, that's how you solve the problem, and then let's deal with the issues here,"" she said. ""We've got real problems... make sure that we do not have this religion which is really an ideology that is going to eventually cause so much havoc on our streets, not only for ourselves, but for future generations."" In France, National Front leader Marine Le Pen, who is campaigning for the French presidency, said the London attack showed the need for borders to be protected. She told French media that security measures needed enhancing amid a rising threat from ""radicalised personalities who act alone without networks"", and urged countries to co-operate with each other on sharing intelligence. Poland's Prime Minister Beata Szydlo said the London attacks justified the country's policy of refusing to take in refugees. ""I hear in Europe very often: do not connect the migration policy with terrorism, but it is impossible not to connect them,"" she told private broadcaster TVN24.

"The roads around the Houses of Parliament are choked with traffic and tourists at the best of times but on Wednesday there is an extra buzz about the place for Prime Minister's Questions at midday. It is the best day to see your MP, as they are nearly all in the building. Queues to get into Parliament start forming early in the morning. The protests in Parliament Square seem noisier and more colourful than normal. Things start to wind down after the main event but there is still a festive atmosphere in nearby pubs, as people from all parts of the UK - down in London for the day to lobby their MPs - swap stories and buy drinks. Now the wide roads leading in all directions to the Houses of Parliament are silent and empty, blocked off by police tape, following a deadly terror attack. The police cordon covers an area of a few square miles and keeps being extended. ""You are now in the de facto press pen,"" shouts a police officer as we are moved back further down a side road behind a more distant line of tape. ""I have to make this road sterile."" The incessant clattering of helicopters overhead and the occasional police siren have replaced the roar of traffic. Foreign TV crews mill about at the police cordons, their mobile phones clamped to their ears as they explain to their editors why they can't get near the scene. A few locals chat to the reporters. The mood is calm and almost resigned. Live updates: Westminster terror attack ""It was a matter of time I suppose,"" says one man. ""I'm old enough to remember the IRA days. I remember them saying 'we only have to get lucky once'."" Father Giles Orton, a Church of England curate from Derbyshire, in London to shop for ""ecclesiastical supplies"", says he is ""just shocked and saddened"". But he adds, we ""should be grateful"" that it had not been worse. Constantine, a 23-year-old student, says he was near Trafalgar Square when news of the attack broke. ""I saw the police start shutting everything off. I heard a lot of people talking. I have a cousin who works in Parliament and I live in Soho and I am a little worried about safety. Particularly LGBT safety which I am heavily involved with."" ""I heard one man say 'this is why we need Donald Trump' which annoyed me,"" he adds. Some MPs were earlier evacuated from the Palace of Westminster to nearby New Scotland Yard and Westminster Abbey, while others had to remain in the Commons chamber. Pupils from Westminster School, next door to the Abbey, were in high spirits after being sent home early, although others said they had been in a state of shock when news of the attack broke. Some of them wondered aloud why the school wasn't put on lock down like most of the other buildings in the area, including both House of Parliament and St Thomas's hospital on the other side of the Thames. A man from Merseyside, visiting his daughter, who is a teacher at the school, said he was in the National Gallery when she texted him about the attack. ""It happens in any big city now,"" he says, ""and any small city. I am not really surprised."" On Birdcage Walk, at the rear of Downing Street, civil servants were streaming out of imposing government offices after being sent home early; heads down, chatting to colleagues, refusing to chat to the media. They trooped off towards Trafalgar Square in search of an alternative route home since Westminster Underground station was closed, melting into the crowds at Charing Cross and Embankment. Beyond the police cordons and the TV crews it felt like any other day.

"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""We will never give in to terror"" The terror attack in Westminster will not stop Britons from going about their lives and such attacks are ultimately ""doomed to failure"", the PM has said. Theresa May said the ""sick and depraved"" attack in Westminster, in which five people died, would not stop people going to work as normal or Parliament from sitting on Thursday. Values of freedom of speech, liberty and democracy would prevail, she said. She praised the ""exceptional bravery"" of the police officer who died. Speaking outside No 10, Mrs May - who earlier chaired a meeting of the emergency response committee Cobra - said her thoughts were with the officer's relatives and those others who had been killed and injured in the ""appalling incident"". Four dead in Westminster terror attack 'Hero' MP tried to save stabbed officer Sturgeon's 'solidarity' with London French students hurt in London attack ""Our thoughts and prayers go out to all who have been affected - to the victims themselves, and their family and friends who waved their loved ones off, but will not now be welcoming them home,"" she said. ""For those of us who were in Parliament at the time of this attack, these events provide a particular reminder of the exceptional bravery of our police and security services who risk their lives to keep us safe. ""Once again today, these exceptional men and women ran towards the danger even as they encouraged others to move the other way."" While the details of the incident - in which a single alleged assailant in a car struck a number of pedestrians on Westminster Bridge before stabbing a police officer at the gates of the Palace of Westminster - were still emerging, she said, the UK would not be cowed. Confirming that the terror threat level would remain at severe, she said it was no accident that Parliament had been targeted in the incident. ""These streets of Westminster - home to the world's oldest Parliament - are ingrained with a spirit of freedom that echoes in some of the furthest corners of the globe,"" she said. ""And the values our Parliament represents - democracy, freedom, human rights, the rule of law - command the admiration and respect of free people everywhere. That is why it is a target for those who reject those values. This video can not be played Corbyn: My thoughts are with the victims ""But let me make it clear today, as I have had cause to do before, any attempt to defeat those values through violence and terror is doomed to failure."" Parliament, she insisted, would meet ""as normal"" on Thursday and the British public would ""come together as normal"". ""And Londoners - and others from around the world who have come here to visit this great city - will get up and go about their day as normal. ""They will board their trains, they will leave their hotels, they will walk these streets, they will live their lives. And we will all move forward together. Never giving in to terror. And never allowing the voices of hate and evil to drive us apart."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has also paid tribute to the police and emergency services for their response to Wednesday's attack. ""Lives have been lost and people have been seriously injured,"" he said. ""I want to thank the police and all the security services who did so much to keep the public, those who work in Parliament and MPs safe. ""Our thoughts are with those who suffered loss and those that have seen terrible injuries this afternoon."" Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said it had been an attack on British democracy, while the Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has spoken of a ""sense of solidarity"" felt in Scotland for people in London.

"This video can not be played Mobile phone footage by Monmouth MP David Davies captures the panic inside the Houses of Parliament A Welsh MP has told of hearing shots outside Parliament, following a terrorist attack which left five people dead and at least 40 injured. One was a police officer who died after being stabbed, another was his alleged attacker who was shot by armed police. Monmouth MP David Davies told BBC Wales: ""The shots started, I was with other MPs, we immediately dropped to the floor and then hid behind pillars."" It came after a car crashed into several people on Westminster Bridge. Live updates from Westminster London attack: What we know Scotland Yard confirmed there was a ""firearms incident"" on Westminster Bridge at 14:40 GMT on Wednesday following a car crash. At least one woman is known to be among those killed, with many of the 40 injured being struck by a car on Westminster Bridge. The police officer killed in the attack has been named by Scotland Yard as PC Keith Palmer. The 48-year-old husband and father was stabbed by his attacker, who was then shot dead. Acting Deputy Commissioner and head of counter terrorism at the Metropolitan Police, Mark Rowley said they believed the attacker was inspired by Islamist-related terrorism. He also said police believe they know the identity of the man. This video can not be played Monmouth MP David Davies describes hearing shouting and gun shots Downing Street said the prime minister was in Parliament at the time but had been taken back safely to Number 10. Staff inside Parliament were told to stay inside their offices as proceedings in the Commons were suspended and they were later evacuated to Westminster Abbey. Mr Davies told BBC News he had been walking with fellow Conservative MP Grant Shapps at the time of the incident. ""We were in New Palace Yard. We heard a load of shouting - I thought it was protesters,"" he said. ""The next thing there was at least one shot, I think I looked around and thought 'that can't be for real, can it?' ""And then more shots - I can't remember exactly, but I shouted 'get down', or 'everyone get down on the floor'. ""People started moving backwards, I waited for the shots to stop. ""I was behind a pillar, and I just took a chance and ran back to Portcullis House - I just didn't know what was going on."" Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns, who was in a meeting with the Prime Minister and cabinet members at the time of the incident, described it as a ""tragic attack at the heart of democracy"". ""My thoughts and prayers are with those who were tragically killed and injured and my undiluted gratitude goes to the police, house staff and emergency services for keeping us safe. I will be forever grateful,"" he added. Montgomeryshire MP Glyn Davies said MPs had been voting at the time of the incident, and there was a ""lockdown"" of Parliament as police checked the area. ""We're a bit shaken as the reality of the attack sets in,"" he said. ""My thoughts go out to anyone who's been injured."" Several Welsh MPs used social media to let family, friends and colleagues know they were safe before MPs were allowed to leave Westminster Abbey at about 19:30 GMT. Among them was Rhondda MP Chris Bryant, who paid tribute to security services saying they had done an ""amazing job"". This video can not be played ""Nothing will stop British democracy"" says Chris Bryant MP ""We're just constantly aware that people put themselves in harm's way to protect us and to protect our way of life,"" he said. ""My heart goes out to the people who have lost people. ""The idea that completely innocent individuals walking past - who have absolutely nothing to do with political life - might have lost their life is obviously very distressing."" Mr Bryant added he hoped Parliament would be open on Thursday. ""We need to be able to show that nothing will stop British democracy,"" he said. Proceedings at the Welsh Assembly in Cardiff were suspended on Wednesday afternoon in the wake of the incidents, and following the suspension of proceedings in the House of Commons and the Scottish Parliament. The presence of armed officers around Welsh Assembly buildings and in the surrounding area has been increased as a precaution, presiding officer Elin Jones said. This video can not be played Elin Jones suspended proceedings in light of the ""serious terrorist incident"" in London Interrupting a debate, Ms Jones said: ""We are aware of the disturbing events at Westminster. ""I have spoken to our security personnel here in the Senedd and we are taking appropriate steps. ""I will be keeping this matter under review as the business of the afternoon progresses. ""I'm sure all our thoughts are with our colleagues and all involved at Westminster at this very difficult time."" First Minister Carwyn Jonestweeted,external: ""Disturbing images emerging from Westminster. This is a terrible attack at the heart of our democracy; thoughts are with all those affected."" South Wales Police assistant chief constable Richard Lewis said additional security was being taken at key locations as a ""sensible precaution"".

"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has expressed her concern for those caught up in the terrorist attack at Westminster. She spoke of a ""sense of solidarity"" felt in Scotland for people in London. Four people have died after a car was driven at pedestrians near the UK parliament before the occupant jumped out and stabbed a police officer. The Scottish Parliament suspended a debate on an independence referendum following the attack. Ms Sturgeon said: ""My thoughts, as I'm sure the thoughts of everybody in Scotland tonight, are with people caught up in this dreadful event. ""My condolences in particular go to those who've lost loved ones. ""My thoughts are with those who've sustained injuries and we all feel a sense of solidarity with the people of London tonight."" She said Scotland would consider whether there were any wider lessons for public safety. The first minister added: ""I convened a meeting of the Scottish Government's Resilience Committee to review what is currently known about the incident at Westminster and also to review any implications for Scotland. ""(But) it is important to stress that there is no intelligence of any risk to Scotland."" This video can not be played Ken Macintosh: ""The fact that our sister parliament has had a serious incident is affecting this particular debate."" The Scottish Parliament had been close to concluding its debate on a call for a referendum on Scottish independence when Presiding Officer Ken Macintosh announced that the sitting would be suspended. He said the incident in London was affecting the contributions of MSPs, and that the debate would resume at another time. A vote had been due to be held at 17:30, but politicians including Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson called for the session to be suspended. Parliament shooting - latest updates London attack: What we know so far The London attack is currently being treated as a terrorist incident Politicians and staff immediately left the chamber once the debate had been suspended Parliament officials initially ruled that the debate should continue as planned, before Mr Macintosh decided that it should be halted. The presiding officer said: ""The fact that our sister parliament has had a serious incident is affecting this particular debate, and is affecting the contribution of members. And so it is for that reason we are deciding to suspend the sitting. ""We will resume this debate and we will be able to do so in a full and frank manner, but I think to continue at the moment would not allow members to make their contributions in the manner they wish to."" The debate is expected to continue next week, with a decision due to be made on Thursday morning. Eyewitness accounts How the news broke Video: Aftermath on the bridge 'Terror incident': In pictures Conservative MSP Fin Carson tweeted ahead of the presiding officer's ruling that he had left the parliament chamber, saying: ""I can't understand how this debate can go on. At least a suspension would have shown some respect."" However, some politicians were unhappy about the decision to suspend the debate. Liberal Democrat MSP Mike Rumbles was among those to argue it was a ""mistake"", telling BBC Scotland that had huge sympathy for those affected by the attack, but that: ""We should not be giving in to terrorism, and I believe we've done that"". Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham was also unhappy with the decision - but was later said to agree entirely after learning the full details of the London attack. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had been expected to win the backing of a majority of MSPs for her plan to ask the UK government for a section 30 order, which would be needed to hold a legally-binding referendum on independence. The UK government has already said it will block the move, and will not enter into any negotiations until after the Brexit process has been completed. Security has been increased around the parliament building Several MSPs called for the debate to be suspended out of respect for those affected - but some argued it was ""giving in to terrorism"" An increased police presence could be seen in and around the Scottish Parliament at Holyrood on Wednesday afternoon. An email to MSPs, staff and Holyrood pass-holders from the Scottish Parliament chief executive's office said: ""While there is no intelligence to suggest there is a specific threat to Scotland, Edinburgh or Holyrood, we have increased security with immediate effect at the Scottish Parliament as a precaution."" Police vehicles were seen outside the parliament building, with a spokesman for Police Scotland saying the force was ""liaising with colleagues in London and will ensure appropriate safety and security plans are in place based upon what we know"".

" The walls of the sports hall vibrate when yet another mortar bomb lands close by. Two hundred children, competing in a regional taekwondo tournament, barely flinch at the sound of the detonation. This is part of daily life in Syria’s war-torn capital Damascus. The children trying to win medals on this particular Friday morning have known nothing else during their short, turbulent lives. “In this sport complex, more than 170 mortars have landed,” says Brigadier General Mowaffak Joumaa, the president of Syria’s national Olympic committee who is in the audience. “If we hide after each mortar, the terrorists will soon arrive to our homes.” You can’t speak of daily life in Syria without looking at the impact the violence has had - and sport is no different. Children in Damascus give a thumbs during a break from competing in a regional taekwondo competition For the past six years the country has been ravaged by war and the stories that have been told are horrifying and dehumanising in equal measure. Since the uprising began in 2011, there has been little positivity spoken in connection with the country, but then there is the remarkable story of Syria's national football team. The relationship that exists between this national team and its people depicts the power of sport on a personal, cultural and political level. It goes to the heart of what makes sport matter. More than 4,500 miles away - in the lobby of a five-star Malaysian hotel south of Kuala Lumpur - a group of Syrian footballers await check-in. Some are arguing demonstrably about Real Madrid - the names Zidane and Ronaldo mixing with their passionate Arabic. Others sit quietly on their mobile phones. This is Syria's national football team and their presence here in Malaysia is the culmination of a journey travelled by more than just themselves and their team-mates. In October last year, playing in a World Cup 2018 qualifier away from home in Beijing, this side representing their war-torn nation of 23m people beat China - a country of 1.4bn that has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on its president’s plan for footballing success. The players celebrated by going shopping with their win bonus. This week, they are preparing to play Uzbekistan in arguably the most important game in their nation’s footballing history - and one that will make reaching the play-offs for a place at the World Cup in Russia next year a real possibility. Win the game and they will earn a $1,000 (£800) bonus each, around a year’s wages for the average Syrian footballer and more money than most of the population can dream of in a country that has seen its currency devalue by around 1,000% since the start of the war. So why Malaysia? Economic sanctions, as well as security fears, mean no games can take place inside Syria and they are forced to play their home fixtures at neutral venues in front of very few fans. That is easier said than done when you are a state with very few friends on the global stage. They came within one day of forfeiting this World Cup campaign entirely, given a lack of viable hosts. It all serves to make their achievements all the more incredible. Is there any other national team for whom a win and two draws in qualifying would not only mean so much but also be considered a great achievement? A month before the victory against China, Syria drew against former World Cup semi-finalists South Korea. These results mean gradually, the footballing world is starting to pay attention to Syria for sporting reasons. But this is not entirely a good news story. There is no ignoring the control that president Bashar Assad’s regime tries to exert over its citizens and, once again, sport is no different. The relative success of the team is both a passing panacea and a propaganda opportunity, the former for the people and the latter for the president. To present a thriving football culture to the world fits in entirely with the agenda of normalisation, of having quelled the rebellion, of stabilisation and control. However, as we discovered, the reality is far from that. There is a privilege to being a sports journalist, reporting on some of the biggest sporting events and stories from around the world. Despite having more than 30 years experience between us this assignment was like no other and took us to Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and finally Malaysia. Ultimately, this is a story of 23 Syrian footballers, 23m Syrian people, 4.9m refugees, six years of war and one president. “We want our players to play outside Syria, we need our players to play outside Syria”. Tarek Jabban (second from right) was a central defender and former captain of the Syria national team There is perhaps no more telling indictment of the crisis in Syrian football than the national team's assistant coach actively encouraging their best players to leave the troubled country and play abroad. Tarek Jabban not only coaches for his country, but was one of the most decorated footballers in Syrian league history. A player before the war, he knows better than most how far the national game has fallen since fighting began six years ago. The league is in such a state of decay that players here do not have the support or the access to facilities that can be offered abroad. Many already have left, and the majority of the 23 players who are in Malaysia this week are currently playing abroad, many of them star players including captain Ahmad Al Salih, who plays for Henan Jianye in China. Firas Al-Khatib one of the squads most experienced players plays for Al Kuwait. Omar Kharbin is another to earn a fortune by Syrian standards playing for one of the Middle East’s most famous teams, Al-Hilal in Saudi Arabia. Arguably the best player still based in Syria is his cousin Osama Omari, he plays with Al-Wahda in Damascus, and is top scorer in the league. Unlike the others, Omari has no option to move away. He was conscripted into the army and is on release to the Al-Wahda football club from the Ministry of Defence. Many left before the war and other young men, including Kharbin, avoided the draft by merit of being an only child. Fans attend the Syrian league football match between Al-Ittihad and Al-Hurriya in January 2017 in the northern Syrian city of Aleppo Such are the fine margins of life here. A map of occupied territory around Syria As a result of the conflict, the league has shrunk geographically, with teams playing only in areas where government exerts control. Effectively the league has been centered around two major cities, Damascus and Latakia. But as the regime retook rebel-held areas in some of the places most devastated by the war, football has begun to expand again and in January of this year football returned to the city of Aleppo. Games are also played further south in Homs now. The rapid return of football to these areas shows the government’s desire to use the game to display life as returning to normal and of the war as being won. What could be more normal than going to a football match? But like the normality, this “growth” of the game is an illusion. The truth is that the league is in crisis. Years of economic sanctions and a crash in the value of the Syrian pound have meant that there is no money in the league. There is no money in the Syrian FA which runs the league. Mohannad Ibrahim (centre, 43) with team-mates We are told private investment is minimal and it’s government money that keeps it afloat. Attendances are poor at all but a handful of games because the fans have little money and there are legitimate security fears around gathering in large public crowds. The average salary of a good Syrian player in the domestic league is just $200 (£161) a month. That’s a good wage by Syrian standards but can’t compare with the money available elsewhere. The team that wins the league gets just $10,000 (£8,000). It is against this backdrop that the best players have left and that the clubs are unable to attract any overseas talent. Unsurprisingly there are no foreign players in the league. One player who left before the war was Mohannad Ibrahim, he developed through the youth system of Al Karamah in Homs, one of the oldest clubs in the country. Now aged 30, he was an established international, but then left to go to Saudi Arabia and the Czech Republic before now playing in Jordan for Kufr Som. “In general the economic situation in Syria is now difficult and of course this reflects on sport,"" says Ibrahim. ""I know many members of the team and I am in contact with them and they are all facing very difficult living conditions. So many of them are looking for any opportunity to go and play professionally outside the country so they can leave and get their family out of the country to have a better life.” He last played for the national team in 2011. He says he has received many invitations since to play for the team but had declined for what he describes as personal reasons, rather than political ones.“Of course I wish to be with them but as you know there are many conditions that prevent me from being committed with the team, and those same conditions obliged me to apologise to join the team, nevertheless my heart is with them I wish them the best of luck. I wish they can perform the best level they can and qualify, and to be one of the best-qualified teams.” “We want our players to play outside Syria, we need our players to play outside Syria”. There is perhaps no more telling indictment of the crisis in Syrian football than the national team's assistant coach actively encouraging their best players to leave the troubled country and play abroad. Tarek Jabban not only coaches for his country, but was one of the most decorated footballers in Syrian league history. A player before the war, he knows better than most how far the national game has fallen since fighting began six years ago. Tarek Jabban (second from right) was a central defender and former captain of the Syria national team The league is in such a state of decay that players here do not have the support or the access to facilities that can be offered abroad. Many already have left, and the majority of the 23 players who are in Malaysia this week are currently playing abroad, many of them star players including captain Ahmad Al Salih who plays for Henan Jianye in China, Firas Al-Khatib one of the squads most experienced players plays for Al Kuwait. Omar Kharbin is another to earn a fortune by Syrian standards playing for one of the Middle East’s most famous teams, Al-Hilal in Saudi Arabia. Arguably the best player still based in Syria is his cousin Osama Omari, he plays with Al-Wahda in Damascus, and is top scorer in the league. Unlike the others, Omari has no option to move away. He was conscripted into the army and is on release to the Al-Wahda football club from the Ministry of Defence. Many left before the war and other young men, including Kharbin, avoided the draft by merit of being an only child. Such are the fine margins of life here.

Richard Conway (right) watches the action at the Tishreen Stadium The game is being played at the Tishreen stadium in Damascus on a Friday afternoon. The army patrol the gates to this complex with machine guns, a reminder of the security fears that mean many won’t come and why attendances remain low. This ground, more than any, is proof of that. Four years ago in a hotel on the complex, Youssef Suleiman, a player from Homs-based al-Wathbah club, was killed by a mortar as he prepared to play a game here in the Syrian domestic league.Inside the ground what fans have made it are in good voice. Drums and songs from a small corner echo around a ground empty on three sides. There are about 300 people here. One fan who has brought his young family along is not deterred. “It is very important to keep hope and to stay optimistic,” he tells us. “Live our life in normal way, in sport, in everything. The kids need to live a normal life, what's happening is not their fault, they need to watch sport, go to their schools, go to public parks, they have to. The banner of President Bashar Assad is ever-present at the Tishreen Stadium. Here it is pictured during a game between Latakia's Hutteen and Hama's Taliya in March 2016 We need always to look forward, to be optimistic and to have hope, otherwise the life will be stopped.” At half-time we are allowed down on to the running track that goes round the pitch. We are there to meet the man in charge of the Syrian national team and the man chiefly responsible for their run of results in qualifying. As we wait, we get a closer look at the pitch - bald patches of dry earth and a very coarse greenery that barely resembles grass. It is no wonder the first half was delayed so much by injuries.The head coach Ayman Hakeem knows the problems well: “Those results we made until now is a miracle, because of the very bad circumstances we are living, all the other teams play in their homes but we can't, we play outside all the time. What we did until now is a proof of the high spirit our players have.” Over his shoulder, a huge billboard of President Bashar Assad dominates the empty stand behind the goal. It is a reminder of the war that is the backdrop to everything in Syria. Its effect on domestic football, as well as neutral venues and lack of friendlies for the national team mean the odds are stacked against Syria more than any other team, but the coach is not put off. Ayman Hakeem (right) In football nothing is impossible, there is always hope, we try to stay optimistic all the time despite all the difficulties we are facing we will do our best. After the next game we will know more if we are going to make the miracle and arrive to World Cup”. As we return to the stands, walking with the national coach, the crowd begin to chant “Russia, Russia, Russia”. We think it is in recognition of their World Cup campaign, but our translator tells us it because they think we are Russian. They presumably think the only western media allowed or even interested in Syrian football would be Russian. The match finishes 3-2 to Jableh, like many high-scoring affairs the standard is poor, which confirms the expectations.It wasn’t always like this though. Footballing culture runs deep in Syria and before the rebellion began the national game was flourishing. An example of its popularity and reach came in 2005 when the women’s national team played their first competitive match.The men are attracting all the attention right now, but Syria’s women’s team are about to embark on their own World Cup pre-qualifying campaign too, in many ways just as significant as the men's. Noor Jrees Unlike their male counterparts, games stopped entirely because of the war. They have not played a competitive international since 2011 and after waiting six years are now about to play four games in eight days in Vietnam. Noor Jrees is 21 and is in the squad that are basing themselves at Syrian FA headquarters before heading out to Hanoi. Jrees said: “We have the power to participate, and we have the hope that we are going to make good results of course with all the support we have and the coaches who are helping a lot, we will make good results”. Whether it’s the women or the men, national or club, there is a definite enthusiasm for football here but it is in spite of the situation, fighting the atrophy in the infrastructure and quality of domestic football, against the backdrop of war. Ibrahim told us that the Syrian fans are “the smile” of the game. They haven’t had much to smile about recently, but their national teams are doing their very best to change that.

Ibrahim told us that the Syrian fans are “the smile” of the game. They haven’t had much to smile about recently, but their national teams are doing their very best to change that. When you close your eyes you could be in any other city in the Middle East. The call to prayer from a nearby mosque, the constant hum of traffic and the distant wail of a police siren provide a familiar soundtrack. But then you open your eyes and this isn’t any other city. This is Damascus. It is the heartland of Syria’s president, Bashar Assad,who has led a war against opposition forces within his country for more than six years. Just like at the football stadium, Assad’s portrait can be found everywhere across the city. It is leadership by way of a cult of personality and his face glares back at you from every shop, taxi, public building, checkpoint and cafe. At times, it is comedic to the outsider. The small passport office at the Syria/Lebanon border has no fewer than nine pictures of him displaying a variety of macho poses. One is contained in a heart-shaped frame.Yet there’s nothing funny about him to those trapped within the country’s borders or living under his authoritarian rule. Many here will not talk of him openly. Most will not even dare speak his name when asked about their feelings towards him. The reach and menace of the regime runs deep in the Syrian psyche.What started as peaceful demonstrations, all part of a popular uprising across the region in 2011 known as the Arab Spring, quickly degenerated into a vicious and bloody war.Syria perceives the uprising as being exploited by their external enemies – for example Turkey, Qatar or some in Saudi Arabia – who wanted to weaken or bring down the government and its backer Iran. The regime also says it is fighting an existential battle against violent Sunni sectarianism which wishes to eradicate the minority Alawite sect that President Assad is part of. The war has sucked world powers into the maelstrom and seen groups such as the so-called Islamic State attempt to exploit the resultant chaos. It has torn this ancient land apart. Hundreds of thousands of civilians have been killed, vibrant cities have been reduced to rubble, millions have been internally displaced and a refugee crisis has been created on a scale not seen since the Second World War. The Syrian government also stands accused of war crimes against its own people for numerous egregious breaches of human rights such as using banned chemical weapons and bombing water supplies. Its many enemies control large swathes of territory but Russia’s military backing of Assad has changed the trajectory of the conflict since 2015. The northern city of Aleppo was brutally regained by Syrian forces late last year, aided by the Kremlin. Meanwhile, life goes on for those who call Damascus their home but the violence regularly reverberates for its residents. A group of young boys in Aleppo We were soon provided with our own stark demonstration. Joining Brigadier General Mowaffak Joumaa at the children's regional taekwondo tournament, we are reminded that mortar fire – both incoming from rebel positions in the suburbs and going back out from the regime – is part of daily life in Damascus. As the president of Syria’s national Olympic committee, and a member of Parliament, General Joumaa is the most powerful sports official in the country and a voice of the regime. “The situation is safe here, it is safe in many Syrian cities such as Homs, Latakia and even Aleppo,” he says, with Assad’s portrait hanging on the wall behind him. The blast we have just experienced contradicts his words. How ‘safe’ is it when artillery shells regularly fall from the sky? “Life here is normal but it’s not like before [the start of the war].” “The mortars and terrorism are working to stop Syrian people from living. We believe that this country should continue."" And what of those who say Syria should not play international sport given allegations it has bombed hospitals, schools and committed war crimes against its own people? ""The real face of the Syrian government was before 2011. Syria and all its people, hospitals and schools were safe,"" says General Joumaa. When terrorism and jihadis came to Syria, it became our duty to defend our schools and hospitals. If a thief arrived to your house, would you let him steal it or would you defend your house and your family? ""The Syrian government is defending our people and to keep Syria united, this country in land and people."" The very next day we’re provided with a graphic display of just how febrile the situation really is. As we work, a mile or so away the explosive booms come in quick succession, separated by just a few minutes to cause maximum devastation. After driving a short distance to the Bab al-Saghir cemetery in the oldest part of Damascus we are told two devices have gone off in a nearby coach park. The first is a roadside bomb. The second comes when a suicide bomber – his belt packed with shrapnel - wanders amidst the survivors, mainly Iraqi Shia pilgrims, as soldiers and medics rush to treat them. A grizzled army commander grants us permission to enter the site and the smell rising from the ground is almost overwhelming. Diesel has leaked from the damaged vehicles and pooled with the blood of those who died. Every so often we have to avoid standing on small, smashed fragments of human bone as we try to delicately and respectfully navigate our way around. A broken wheelchair, torn sandals, a wallet and mangled sunglasses have all been abandoned in the ensuing carnage - the last remnants of what the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says were 74 lives, callously ended. Attacks on this scale are uncommon in Damascus but local people who come out to survey what has happened appear strangely detached and, to some extent, desensitised. Some wander around aimlessly staring at the bleak scene before retreating back to their homes. It is a brief, horrific and personal insight into what the Syrian people have lived with for more than six years and it’s impossible to feel anything but compassion and sympathy for those affected by the consequences of the war. The reality of what we have witnessed snaps into even sharper focus when, returning to our rented car, the local driver asks us to make sure we’ve washed the blood from our shoes. He doesn’t want his carpets to get stained. We find small pools of fresh rainwater on the gravel road and watch as they slowly turn a shade of dirty crimson. The Brigadier General’s assertion that everything here is safe and normal has never sounded as hollow. “The crisis started and the war erupted, a shell hit our house and killed my brother. We were forced to leave and take refuge.” Mohammad Al Khalaf This is Mohammad Al Khalaf, but the story is one familiar to many of the 80,000 Syrian refugees inside Za’atari refugee camp in northern Jordan. “Almost every house in the camp has the same story, either they have someone who is a martyr, someone injured, someone missing or arrested. These are the stories of the camp.” We have come here because no story about modern-day Syria is complete without the refugees’ perspective and football is no different. We are sat together on a beaten-up sofa outside a café, which, like all the buildings here, is made of flat-pack metal sheeting courtesy of the United Nations. It’s on the main thoroughfare through the camp known as the ‘Champs Elysees’. But this is not France, it is far more affecting. Al Khalaf was playing football for Al Majd club in Al-Qadam and the war forced him to quit his career. Like many, he is angry, like few he expresses it. “We are angry because the families are separated by the war. All the Syrians’ families are separated, that’s why we have so much anger. But what shall we do? Issam Al Masri We have to accept our destiny and adapt to it. We didn’t want this to happen but it wasn’t in our hands, they are trying to destroy the people. We hope that it will end and in God’s will we will be able to return to our country as soon as possible.” Situated 15km from the Syrian border, the settlement opened in 2012 and is now the fourth largest in the country and everyone here is trying to re-build their life in some way. Al Khalaf is no different, he has a job with one of the non-government organisations (NGOs), but crucially he has also found another football club. He is allowed a pass to leave the camp, which allows him to train with the team, it has to be renewed every two weeks. Most residents here are only allowed one pass a year. It is only with a club in the Jordanian second division and he isn’t being paid, but it is a start. We travel further down the dusty desert track that runs from one end of this vast site to the other, flanked on both sides by more metal-boxed small businesses. In one, what look like legs of lamb hang in the dusty, Perspex window with a wooden chopping block behind. This provides a leaning post for the butcher, and there’s more chatting than chopping going on. A few doors down, a small radio is on, playing music of a genre known simply as ‘tinny’. Below in his workshop sits a man on a stool, rolled cigarette in mouth, smoke in his eyes. He repairs spokes on a broken wheel while more bikes await repair outside. The camp has its own bus system but most people walk or cycle. Girls train at Za'atari Weaving between pedestrians, bikes and occasional sewage collection trucks we are heading to meet Issam Al Masri. Like Al Khalaf, he left his football career behind when he fled Syria. He was aged just 18.He lives just off the ‘Champs Elysees’. Behind a corrugated iron fence with a door of the same battered material, his home is a collection of the windowed metal boxes. Now 22, Al Masri lives here with his mum, dad, six sisters and one brother. Before the war they lived in Daraa, close to the border with Jordan, and where the Syrian uprising began in 2011. After two years of war in 2013, the family left their home and walked across the border. They each took just one bag filled with clothes. “The war that started in our country and the tough living conditions which we couldn’t tolerate, made us obliged to leave as did many others, so we ended up here in Za’atari. ""We couldn’t find jobs or couldn’t work to feed our children and families.”Asked if he is angry or sad, he shrugs his shoulders, makes a gesture of resignation with his hands and smiles. “Each one of us has to conceal his feelings..."" In the family living room, with a patchwork of rugs covering the floor and cushions around the walls to sit on, Al Masri is in a corner with his dad, his younger brother sits on his dad’s lap. Issam Al Masri's mother, Kholod, and younger brother Mohammed On a table and the wall next to them are the trophies and medals of Al Masri’s footballing career. It’s an impressive collection. We’d been told that he was the best player in the camp and the medals seem to back that up. When they left Syria he had a promising career ahead of him with Syrian Premier League club Al Shula in Daraa. Everyone in life has a dream. My dream was to become a famous player…. but, frankly speaking, up until now I didn’t have the opportunity to fulfill my dream.” He hasn’t given up. ""I still have hopes and many dreams, my first dream is to become a famous player and play with a famous club.” He says he had to leave more trophies behind - “there was twice as many of them”, he adds, with a mix of pride and sadness. As we prepare to leave, his mum asks if there is anything we can do to help her son’s career. She perhaps more than anyone knows how important it is to him. We tell her that many people will see his story and offer a hopeful ""inshallah"" [God willing]. Sadly, we can promise no more. Although not yet playing for a club, Al Masri is now coaching football in the camp. He is employed by a project jointly funded by Uefa and the Asian Football development programme to offer football coaching to children of all ages. “The crisis started and the war erupted, a shell hit our house and killed my brother.

He is employed by a project jointly funded by Uefa and the Asian Football development programme to offer football coaching to children of all ages. We arrive at what looks like a school playground. In the corner, small boys around six years old are doing what life here offers them little chance to do, they are smiling and being kids, as they pursue a football around a patch of gravel. It’s chaotic and unstructured, supervised but not coached, they are simply encouraged to have fun. In the Tarmac’d area, older boys are receiving more structured coaching from Al Masri, practising headers, chesting and close control – he’s encouraging and instructive in equal measure, his Arabic interspersed with the occasional “bravo”. The project has just celebrated its four-year anniversary, introduced with the hope of using football to help these kids forget, albeit briefly, the situation these they find themselves in. “All these kids saw the war,” says Aduallah al Nahhasis, the project’s co-ordinator. “The war, even for an adult is difficult to see, all the killing and all the blood. When they first came here it was difficult for them to leave their caravan, but after that they started to adapt to the situation. “At first it was for the boys but when we saw that some girls were interested, we offered it to them, so in the end we can make all the girls and boys so happy now.” When they first offered coaching to girls they had just three players. Cultural sensitivities of the refugees, many of whom came from rural areas of southern Syria, were a big obstacle -they were reluctant to allow their daughters to play in public. The Euro 2016-branded tarpaulins that surround the project are not a cynical marketing tool - this was the organisers' response to those sensitivities, allowing the girls to train in private. There are now more than 1,000 taking part. The project runs organised leagues with 12 teams representing the districts of the camp. NGOs and charities also have teams. Football, it is fair to say, has established itself as a central part of camp life. It’s that ability of sport, in this case football, to bring people together that means both Al Masri and Al Khalaf will be supporting the national team on their World Cup journey. “Sport has nothing to do with politics,"" says Al Khalaf. ""We have to move forward and sport has a message and we should relay this message. If the Syrian team plays with any other country, for sure and from the bottom of my heart I will back it and support it."" Al Khalaf’s little bit of success in finding a team to play for whilst here in the camp, no matter how small, gives the likes of Al Masri and the next generation hope that they can build a football career outside Syria. Hope is important here. And so too is football. Kouteibah Al Refai is a worried man. For weeks now he has been making increasingly frantic calls in an attempt to arrange a warm-up game for the Syrian men’s team before their crucial World Cup qualifier against Uzbekistan. As the secretary general of his country’s football federation, he has arguably the most difficult job in world football. It’s tough to organise friendly fixtures when you represent a country considered a pariah state by most of the international community. Pacing around his office at the Syrian FA headquarters, cigarette hanging from his lip, he lists the excuses he’s been given and the tiny pool of teams who will take them on. The Syrian FA headquarters conference room was hit by a mortar and in the corner of Kouteibah's office is a pane of shattered glass from the shrapnel. “All of the countries we’ve contacted could not meet the dates we’ve got available. Kouteibah Al Refai “Iraq did offer us a friendly in Tehran but the dates didn’t work for us. This is the problem we are suffering in these years,” he says. Finding a venue to play World Cup qualifying games was a similarly tough task given Syria’s inability to host teams because of security fears. The Malaysian FA finally agreed, at the last minute, after a deal with Macau, a tiny territory known as the “Vegas of China”, fell through. Macau had agreed to pay the Syrians $150,000 (£121,000) per ‘home’ game, tempted by the fact that China and South Korea were in their qualifying group. Hosting home games would see teams and fans visit, spending money in their hotels and casinos. However, the sanctions Syria operates under meant the money couldn’t be internationally wired and a request to be paid in cash complicated matters to such an extent that the deal eventually collapsed. “Security concerns” were cited as the official reason. No money is provided to them directly from either the world governing body Fifa or from the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) because of sanctions. And there’s hardly any money for salaries too. However, the AFC has agreed to cover Syria’s hotels, air fares and other expenses from a pot of $2m (£1.6m) of subsidies owed to Syria for reaching this stage of World Cup qualification. It must be spent wisely given that home games currently involve a 9,000-mile round-trip to southeast Asia. This is about more than money and politics though. “We are trying our best to help the people, using football,” says Kouteibah. It’s an instrument of love. It is bringing Syrians together. Our results are playing that role in trying to bring us together as we used to be before the war.” Down the hallway from his office sits Fadi Dabbas, one of the leading directors of the Syrian FA. When the question of politics, the war and sport is raised with him there is a tacit recognition too that they are inseparable. “When a Syrian team is playing, the first thing in the match is the playing of the national anthem,” he says. “Football is very important in politics. It gives the real image of Syria, that Syria is fine despite the war. “Football and politics are related, we are representing a state and the Syrian team are from all shades of Syria and from all Syria.” Fifa insists politics should play no part in football and therefore Syria are free to compete internationally providing they play on neutral ground. The positive results against China and South Korea in their group came under such trying circumstances. Assistant manager Tarek Jabban says he coaches for the love of his country. That is definitely a prerequisite given his monthly salary is just $100 (£80). That’s despite Jabban being one of the most decorated players in Syrian football history. He spent his career with the leading Damascus club Al Jaish, winning the league on six occasions and the cup five times. He also played – and captained – his country close to 100 times. At home in a Damascus suburb, with his wife and four daughters watching on, he reflects on how the team has performed recently. His daughters have spent the afternoon baking a chocolate cake to welcome us to their home and Tarek hopes we will return if Syria takes the small chance they have to qualify for the World Cup. In football nothing is impossible, there is always hope.” The situation for Jabban is also difficult. Like so many in Syria he must deal with the consequences of the conflict, which includes a drastic limitation on electricity. Power outages are a daily occurrence and the city streets are plunged into darkness at night to conserve energy. To ensure he can watch key games at home without interruption he uses a small TV powered by batteries. “We try to stay optimistic all the time, despite all the difficulties we are facing,"" he says.Now he must prepare his players for the game of their lives and he hopes his experience of playing in big matches will help. He was part of the 1994 Syrian team that won the AFC Youth Championship, beating Japan 2-1 in the final. Jabban has fond memories of being carried shoulder high by supporters as they arrived home with the cup. Clutching the medal in his hand he recalls how they were met by 40,000 supporters on their return to Damascus airport. “It is something I will never forget,” he says. Omar al Midani (right) in action for Al Wahda His neighbour then fulfilled a pre-tournament promise to carry him up 12 flights of stairs to the top of his parents’ apartment building if he won. Jabban hides his medals well. As his prized possessions he is concerned they may be stolen. His six-year-old daughter Juri is therefore seeing her father’s huge haul for the very first time. The taste of that 1994 win, and seeing what it meant to the people of his country, is something he wants his players to now experience too. “We will do our best. After the first game we will know more if we are going to make the miracle happen and arrive at the World Cup,” he said. The squad tasked with making miracles are well aware of the wider responsibilities on their shoulders. At just 22 years old, Omar al Midani has more to worry about than just leading Syria’s defensive line. The centre-half, who plays for the Damascus club Al Wahda, has featured 17 times for his country, scoring once. A tall, powerful player, his presence in Syria’s back line is a key factor in their recent success. National players across the world often complain that the weight of expectation on their shoulders from the public to win can be too much at times. Omar al Midani (right) in conversation with team-mates In Syria, the situation is reversed. The players have taken on the task themselves of providing some respite from the war to their compatriots. “Despite all the pain they are living in, the people are believing and supporting us all time,” says Midani. “The minimum we can do is to give them joy for few hours, we ask God to help us to do that.” Most players his age don’t have such things to occupy their minds. Omar has ambitions to play abroad and develop his career but as we watch Al Wahda’s youth team train he emphasises that such personal motivations are secondary while the war continues. “The football was much better before the war. We were happy, the only thing we cared about was football and school. Now the only thing we care about is to have our country back like it used to be.” That day may be some way off. In the meantime all Kouteibah, Jabban and Midani can do is keep planning and playing. The crisp Syrian spring has given way to the heat and torrential rain of a tropical climate. Malaysia has been “home” to the Syria team since last September and it is here, on the edge of the equator and far from their land, they must now compete. The team arrived almost a week before their game against Uzbekistan in order to shake off jet lag, play a game against a local club and acclimatise to the steamy weather. At their preferred hotel in the town of Seremban, one hour’s drive south of the capital Kuala Lumpur, the squad have got to know the staff well. The chef accommodates their dietary requirements and, after training in the evening, the players and staff sit in a reserved section of the restaurant before retiring to their rooms. Team members know they must use this temporary base to their advantage. They have learned all about the local conditions at the nearby Tuanku Abdul Rahman stadium and its mud bath of a pitch. The two opponents they’ve faced here so far - Iran and South Korea – have both failed to score. If Syria are to make it to Russia next summer for the World Cup they must leverage every possible angle open to them. Things will be different though on this visit. At very short notice the local authorities in Seremban have ruled the Rahman stadium is unavailable because of an event in the town. Arrangements have been made for the match to be staged in Malacca, a further 40 miles to the south. And so, with just over 72 hours before kick-off in the game that will help determine their World Cup fate, this band of footballing nomads pack up, pose for pictures with the hotel’s management and hit the road once more. Being flexible for football is something the Syrian people are used to after six years of war. While in Damascus we were told a story about how every weekend one particular soldier on the front line lays down his weapons and picks up a whistle. He makes the relatively short journey back to the capital in time to officiate at a local football match, swapping his combat fatigues for the black shorts and shirt of a referee. When the game ends he changes back into his uniform, grabs his AK-47 and returns to the countryside to resume battle. Such anecdotes show Syria as a nation where the love for football runs as deep as that witnessed in Europe or South America. The story of the soldier referee also exemplifies how the demands of war have become wholly integrated in day-to-day Syrian life, and not just for those enlisted in the military. Football, like every other facet of society, must fit around the regime’s primary aim to prevail against its many enemies. As a result, living in Damascus is a claustrophobic affair – the constant security checkpoints, the searches, the rivers of choking traffic and the state-sponsored paranoia cultivated by Assad are stifling. Added to that are the daily power cuts, water shortages, a suspicion of arts and culture and an inability to often leave the country because of visa restrictions. Many must find the freedom they crave in everyday life through playing or watching football. On the professional side of the sport, players are clinging to their trade. The domestic game is in crisis but those still making a living through it are grateful they don’t have to fight in an attritional, bitter conflict. Those playing for Syrian clubs face thwarted dreams of the kind of life a football career can provide but, like everyone else, they count their blessings and make do with the hand they’ve been dealt. Even for those players who flee the country, there is no true freedom. They may have personal safety abroad but extended families back home, and the thought of Assad's insidious long reach ensures most stay quiet about politics. Yet it is the politics of war that has led to 11m people being uprooted from their homes over the past six years. Many have found sanctuary with family or friends in regime-controlled cities or in refugee camps such as Za’atari. Others meanwhile, in search of a new life far from Syria, have washed ashore in flimsy vessels on the beaches of southern Europe. Those fortunate enough to still be breathing have faced perilous onward journeys within a continent increasingly fractured over its attitude towards their plight. The one common thread between Syrians, no matter if they are regime supporters or part of the opposition, is a love of their country. That even extends to those we have spoken with who have lost family members or were forced to flee their homes in order to survive. They all long for better days ahead. One player who previously expressed negative opinions about the regime and was banned is returning to the national team. Firas al Khatib, considered one of his country’s greatest ever players, declared support for the Syrian opposition in 2012 and hasn’t featured for the team since. Now, following overtures from the head coach, he is returning and ready to play his part in trying to take Syria forward. So a good news story around potential qualification for the World Cup is both a welcome distraction from the grind of wartime life and a way for Syrian patriotism to be expressed other than down the barrel of a gun. If this team make it to Russia next summer then they can expect a lot more than the 40,000 who turned up to carry the victorious youth team shoulder high from the airport in 1994. As assistant coach Tarek Jabban reflects, given the cash-strapped conditions under which they operate, the task at hand is not just one of making it to world football’s flagship tournament. It’s about producing a miracle. Regardless of the eventual outcome, the excitement from this football adventure has given the Syrian government a PR boost – but it has also provided many things to its people including hope, escapism and pride. Back in Malaysia - and settled in a new hotel - the squad are focused. In the old colonial town of Malacca - surrounded by palm trees and rubber plantations - they know what they must now do. Win. Victory over Uzbekistan will give them renewed belief they can qualify for a regional play-off. Win that and they would then face an opponent from North or Central America or the Caribbean for a place in Russia. It is a high hurdle to clear. In the end, World Cup qualification may well prove elusive but the achievements of this Syrian squad will be lauded given what they have had to overcome. The points will soon be tallied and the end result will be known. If only the same could be said for the war the Syrian people must endure and their country's long-term future.

"The appointment of Alastair Campbell seems to point towards a growing pro-Remain confidence Alastair Campbell is returning to British newspapers as editor-at-large of The New European. Almost a quarter of a century after he left the Daily Mirror to work for Tony Blair, Campbell will write regular columns and, like all editors-at-large, become an ambassador for the product, I have learned. He will also commission pieces. It was Campbell who persuaded Blair to write a high-profile front-page story for the paper. Campbell already has a regular slot, whether a column or interview, in GQ magazine and also the International Business Times. Last circulation figures for the weekly The New European suggest it sells more than 20,000 copies The most interesting thing about this story isn't what it says about Campbell, who chose the paper to serialise his recent memoirs, but about the growing confidence, impact and viability of the so-called pop-up paper for the 48% of Britons who voted Remain. The paper's editor, Matt Kelly, is winning plaudits all over the place for turning a frankly quirky experiment after last year's referendum into a print product whose subscriber base is growing as it approaches its first birthday. Kelly won special recognition at last week's Press Awards (full disclosure: I was one of the many judges involved in the awards). Kelly, who looks like Al Capone after a stint with Slimming World, and talks in a thick Scouse accent (he grew up in Formby) that doesn't smack of metropolitan elite, is also chief content officer of Archant, the family-owned publisher founded in 1845. Latest circulation figures for The New European suggest it sells more than 20,000 copies. Its 48 pages are put together by a staff of about five in Norwich. I suspect Campbell's 370,000 followers on Twitter will be hearing plenty more about The New European. He and Kelly both know that if even one in 100 of them took out a subscription, that would be transformative for this brave little title.

"This video can not be played ""The export market is very important to our organisation,"" says cattle rancher Coleman Locke ""Tremendously important"" is how rancher Coleman Locke describes the role of international trade to his cattle business. The 72-year-old has worked on his family's 10,000-acre ranch on the Gulf Coast of Texas for his whole life and has seen his fair share of struggles in the industry, including droughts and disease. But now he is gearing up for a new threat - the potential loss of trade deals that could cut off a huge slice of his ranch's yearly sales. ""In 2016, 25% of the breeding stock that we sold here at this ranch went out of the United States, it's a tremendously important market for us,"" says Mr Locke. Coleman Locke has worked on the family ranch his whole life He's not alone. Last year the American beef industry earned over $6bn (Â£4.9bn) from overseas sales. Among the biggest purchasers are Canada and Mexico, partners with the US in the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). President Trump's promise to renegotiate Nafta and possibly place tariffs on Mexico or other US trading partners has the industry worried. ""Nafta is extremely important to us. It's one of the biggest trade deals that agriculture has ever had,"" says John Robinson from the National Cattlemen's Beef Association (NCBA). The beef industry is already reeling from the loss of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), whichPresident Trump withdrew from in his first week in office. The free trade agreement with Pacific Rim countries, including many in Asia, was set to expand America's export market for beef. By some estimates, it could have added $400m in sales each year. The US beef industry is already reeling from the loss of the Trans-Pacific Partnership ""It makes the market very nervous when they hear we aren't going to do the TPP and we are going to change Nafta,"" says Jennings Steen, a cattle dealer based in Austin. Mr Steen says he and his partner have been fielding dozens of calls since President Trump's election, from ranchers desperate to know how changes to trade deals could affect their businesses. They are concerned about prices and hesitate to make long-term plans. American suppliers particularly wanted increased access to Japan's home market, where high tariffs on US beef have made it hard to compete with suppliers from Australia who can sell beef into Japan at lower rates. But President Trump's supporters say his experience in business will allow him to negotiate better deals for the US, focussing on bilateral agreements rather than bigger deals involving several countries. According to Texas agriculture commissioner Sid Miller, after 22 years Nafta is in need of a ""facelift"". Mr Miller was an outspoken and early supporter of President Trump. But since the election, he has spent a lot of time reassuring the ranching community that trade with Mexico won't disappear and new trade options will be opened up under the Trump administration. Texas agricultural commissioner, Sid Miller, sat down with the BBC's Michelle Fleury in his Austin office Mr Miller says he takes ""a softer kinder approach [than Donald Trump],"" stressing that Texas needs trading partners like Mexico, but also that it needs new deals with countries like China and better deals with its existing partners. President Trump's vision for changes to Nafta has focused on ensuring more products are made in the US and he has called for tariffs on manufactured goods imported into the US from Mexico. But such tariffs could result in retaliatory charges on US products sold into Mexico - including agricultural goods like cattle and beef. Mr Miller is unshaken by this prospect, though. He acknowledges that US farmers produce more than the country can consume - including beef - but sees this as giving the US leverage over other trading partners. ""Agriculture is a good bargaining tool,"" he says. ""People have to eat, they don't have to buy manufactured goods."" President Trump's relationship with the cattle industry though isn't as simple as a beef over trade. Rural communities voted overwhelmingly in support of Mr Trump. Beef and cattle producers, like other members of the agricultural industry, would like to see the rollbacks on regulations that President Trump has promised. ""I think cattle producers and rural America, in general, are optimistic about the Trump administration,"" says the NCBA's John Robinson. Within President Trump's first month, there were regulatory rollbacks that Mr Robinson calls ""very encouraging"". But he says he hopes the beef industry is given an equal seat to manufacturing when it comes to renegotiating Nafta. That seat is crucial because the US produces more beef than it consumes. Without international markets, suppliers will have to reduce production or see a significant drop in prices, as the market is flooded with local beef. There is no guarantee either that the bilateral deals President Trump has promised will be better than the ones he has walked away from. As a part of TPP, US beef producers who currently face import duties of up to 38.5% on fresh and frozen beef entering Japan would have seen those tariffs phased out over 16 years. Without that deal, many worry competition from countries that remained in TPP, like Australia, will increase. For Coleman Locke on his ranch in Texas, it's too soon to worry. No deals have been struck yet and business is still good. But if President Trump wants to claim his title as America's dealmaker in chief he's going to have to be sure he doesn't trade away this rancher's livelihood.

"It took minutes for the scammer to take over Six weeks ago, a young woman called Zed (not her real name) was in a meeting at work when a message popped up on Facebook Messenger from a distant friend. ""Hey babe,"" it began. The friend asked Zed to vote for her in an online modelling competition, which she agreed to do. But then - disaster. Adding her email address to the competition register had caused a tech meltdown, her friend said. She needed to borrow her email log-in to fix it quickly and restore her votes. Zed was unsure. The friend begged - her career was at stake, she pleaded. Still in the meeting and powerless to make a call, Zed gave in - a momentary leap of faith. Except it was not her friend that she was talking to - someone else had got into the account and was pretending to be her. It's a scamming technique known as spear phishing. ""Phishing uses behavioural psychology to trick victims into trusting the attacker in order to obtain sensitive information,"" said Paul Bischoff ofComparitech,external, who also talked to Zed. ""Spear phishing is less prevalent, but far more dangerous. Spear phishing targets an individual or small group of people. The attacker can gather personal information about their target to build a more believable persona."" Besides never sharing the credentials for your online accounts, a good way to stay safe is to enable ""two-step authentication"". This means that users must enter another code besides their password, received for example by their mobile phone, to log in. This can usually be set up in the security settings for your account or during the sign-up process. Two-step authentication is offered by Gmail, Hotmail, Apple, Amazon, Yahoo, Facebook and Twitteramong others,external. Within minutes, Zed watched in horror as she was locked out of one account after another, as well as her Apple iCloud where she stored all her data - including a photo of her passport, bank details, and some explicit pictures. The hacker took control of all her IDs as they were all linked to the email address details she had supplied. The scammer also activated an extra layer of security, called two-step authentication, meaning that they received all alerts about her accounts and could reset them. Then a man called. The number had a Pakistan area code. ""He started the call by saying he didn't want any drama, he didn't want me to cry, he wanted me to talk to him like a professional,"" she said. He sounded young, perhaps a college student, she thought. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external He accused her of leading an ""immoral"" life. He had seen her photographs, he knew she had smoked and had boyfriends and was sexually active. He asked her what her parents would think and was furious when she said they already knew. ""He claimed he had hacked thousands of women,"" Zed says. ""He said 10 or 12 he had felt bad about because he couldn't find anything about them that was 'wrong'."" Zed was not part of that group. ""He said he was happy when he hacked my account. That I deserved everything."" He told her he would post the explicit pictures on her Facebook page - where she has more than 1,000 friends. The scammer said he had targeted thousands of people. ""I offered him money. I asked if I could pay. He said, 'Don't talk about money.' He sounded irritated,"" she said. Instead, he wanted her to perform a sex act for him on camera. Zed refused. ""Either you do it for me or you do it for the whole world,"" he told her - and uploaded one of the photos to Facebook. Zed had already warned her boyfriend and parents who assembled an army of friends waiting to report activity on her account. Within 15 minutes it had been disabled by Facebook - but she still received concerned messages from contacts. ""A friend who is like a brother sent me a message - it wasn't him who had seen [the photo] but a friend of his,"" she said. ""I feel like I mustn't think too much about how many people saw [the photos]."" The last thing the scammer said to her was, ""Have a great life."" ""It seemed to me the only reason he was doing this was to morally police women and get them to do stuff for him,"" Zed said. The man didn't want money ""He wanted a gallery of explicit photographs of women. That seemed to be his motive."" Zed does not consider herself to be digitally naive. She is a bright, articulate 20-something from India who works in the media industry on the US east coast. ""I have been tech savvy and on the internet almost my entire life - but I've never really seen the power of what people can do until now,"" she says. Regaining control of her accounts has been a struggle. It took Zed a month to get her Apple ID back after engineers created a bespoke questionnaire for her containing answers that were not stored in her account. Gmail and Facebook have also been restored, but she has lost Snapchat and her Hotmail address - her central account which she had used for more than 13 years. ""I feel for the poor woman - these scams are so easy to fall for,"" said cybersecurity expert Prof Alan Woodward from Surrey University. ""I think what it shows is that security is a combination of people, process and technology.  You can be very 'savvy' in any one or two of these but scammers are superb at finding novel combinations that, frankly, we just wouldn't think of. ""I know it sounds so obvious but, regardless of who they are, you should not share your username and password.  Give these scammers a small chink in the armour and they are sadly brilliant at getting in and running amok in your digital life."" Zed still uses iCloud but does not store personal stuff on it anymore - and has activated two-step verification everywhere. ""I still see the value in the storage. But I will never ever give any information away again,"" she said. Zed originally decided to share her story on community site Reddit after trying to find others who may have been conned by the same man. ""I was really shocked to discover that I found absolutely nothing,"" she said. ""I was hoping that speaking up about it would remedy that problem and encourage others to share their stories. ""It also felt like the only way to get back at him."" As far as Zed knows, the scammer has not been caught. ""Cyber-criminals come in all shapes and sizes,' said prof Woodward. ""Their motive is not always monetary gain. As we have sadly seen of late, revenge or just being plain malicious is a growing trend.""

"This Zara dress had been to at least five countries before it ended up on a shop hanger ""Made in Morocco"" says the label on the pink Zara shirt dress. While this may be where the garment was finally sewn together, it has already been to several other countries. In fact, it's quite possible this piece of clothing is better travelled than you. If it was human, it would have certainly journeyed far enough to have earned itself some decent air miles. The material used to create it came from lyocell - a sustainable alternative to cotton. The trees used to make this fibre come mainly from Europe, according to Lenzing, the Austrian supplier that Zara-owner Inditex uses. These fibres were shipped to Egypt, where they were spun into yarn. This yarn was then sent to China where it was woven into a fabric. This fabric was then sent to Spain where it was dyed, in this case pink. The fabric was then shipped to Morocco to be cut into the various parts of the dress and then sewn together. After this, it was sent back to Spain where it was packaged and then sent to the UK, the US or any one of the 93 countries where Inditex has shops. From dresses to t-shirts and trousers, most items of clothing sold around the world will have had similarly complicated journeys. In fact, they're likely to be even more convoluted. Most Inditex garments are made close to its Spanish headquarters or in nearby countries such as Portugal, Morocco and Turkey. This is what helps the firm achieve its famously fast reaction times to new trends. Most of its rivals' supply chains are far less local. Regardless of where they're based, most factories are not owned by the fashion brands that use them. Instead, they're selected as official suppliers. Often these suppliers subcontract work to other factories for certain tasks, or in order to meet tight deadlines. Your cotton top may well have started out in a field in Texas before criss-crossing the globe This system can make tracking the specific origins of a single item difficult. I contacted several big clothing brands including H&M, Marks and Spencer, Gap and Arcadia Group last week to give me a sample example of the journey of a t-shirt in their basic range from seed to finished product. Only Inditex was able to respond in time to meet the deadline for this article. ""I imagine companies don't want to respond because they have no clue where the materials they buy come from,"" says Tim Hunt, a researcher at Ethical Consumer, which researches the social, ethical and environmental behaviour of firms. The difficulties were highlighted devastatingly bythe 2013 Rana Plaza disasterwhere more than 1,100 people were killed and 2,500 injured when the Bangladesh garment factory collapsed. In some cases, brands weren't even aware their clothes were being produced there. The #whomademyclothes campaign encourages customers to put pressure on fashion firms to be more open about their suppliers According to the""Behind the Barcode"" report,externalby Christian Aid and development organisation Baptist World Aid Australia, only 16% of the 87 biggest fashion brands publish a full list of the factories where their clothes are sewn, and less than a fifth of brands know where all of their zips, buttons, thread and fabric come from. Non-profit group Fashion Revolution, formed after the Rana Plaza factory collapse, is leading a campaign to try to force firms to be more transparent about their supply chains. Every year, around the time of the disaster it runs a #whomademyclothes campaign encouraging customers to push firms on this issue. Fashion Revolution co-founder and creative director Orsola de Castro says the mass production demands of the fashion industry and the tight timescales required to get products from the catwalks on to the shelves as quickly as possible means the manufacturing processes have become ""very, very chaotic"". ""The amount of manpower which goes into the production of a t-shirt - even at the sewing level, it goes through so many different hands. On their standard products most brands wouldn't know the journey from seed to store,"" she says. While newer and smaller fashion brands are creating products with 100% traceability, she says it's a lot harder for the established giants. ""It's a big and complex issue to turn around and would require a massive shift in attitude."" Pietra Rivoli travelled from the US to China and Africa to track the journey of a single $6 t-shirt Yet just over a decade ago, Pietra Rivoli had no problems tracking the journey of a single $6 cotton t-shirt she'd picked out of a sale bin in a Walmart in Florida. Starting with the tag at the back of the t-shirt, she tracked its journey backwards from the US ""step by step along the supply chain"". ""A shoe leather project,"" is how Prof Rivoli describes her journey, which resulted in a book, The Travels of a T-Shirt in the Global Economy. As a teacher of finance and international business at Georgetown University in Washington, Prof Rivoli wanted to investigate her assumption that free trade benefited all countries. Pietra Rivoli says the current backlash against global trade is linked to political interference Her travels took her from the cotton-growing region of Lubbock in Texas to China, where the t-shirt was sewn together. Eventually, she ended up in Tanzania on the east coast of Africa, which has a thriving second-hand clothing market. Her assumption was that the complicated supply chain was driven by cost and market forces. She concluded that a lot of brands' decisions about where to buy supplies and make their clothing was actually driven by politics. She cites US agricultural subsidies for cotton growers and China's migration policies encouraging workers to move from the countryside as examples. ""Rather than a story of how people were competing - how do I make a faster T-shirt, a better T-shirt, a cheaper T-shirt - what I found is that the story of the T-shirt and why its life turned out the way it did was really about how people were using political power,"" she says. The current backlash against global trade is a direct result of this kind of political interference, she believes. This kind of consumer anger could eventually drive change among fashion firms, she says. Prof Rivoli notes that many firms now list all their direct suppliers and she says there is a move towards developing fewer, longer term supplier relationships. ""There might be a little less hopping around,"" she laughs.

"Bear Grylls might be confident about climbing mountains, wrestling alligators and challenging the wilderness to do its venomous worst - but there's one thing that fills him with horror. Cocktail parties full of strangers. ""We all have fears. People say, 'You can't have any fears', but I'm scared of so many things,"" says the man who has what must be the best ever job description, of ""adventurer"". ""I'm really bad at cocktail parties with lots of people I don't know. I really genuinely am."" Maggots and steep rock faces are less daunting to him than unarmed combat with canapes and small talk. Speaking at an international education conference, Grylls says he lacked confidence as a youngster and describes his own approach to tackling fear and those nagging self-doubts. ""I've learned that the best way over our fears is right bang through the middle. It really is. The only way you don't see the fear is when you're right on it. ""I've learned this the hard way. It's how I deal with it now,"" he said at the Global Education and Skills Forum in Dubai. Climbing Everest became a focus for the adventurer's recovery from back injuries He says he is also ""really nervous"" of jumping out of aeroplanes, which is understandable since in his 20s he broke his back in three places in a parachuting accident in Africa. His recovery from this injury became the springboard for his later ambitions - setting the target of climbing Everest and giving him the fire in his belly to make the most of this ""second chance"" in life. ""It was definitely a dark time after that accident. ""My over-riding emotion was that I really have got lucky. I should either be dead or paralysed. There's got to be some purpose behind this. Life has given me a second chance. ""I might be a bit crook and a bit scarred, but I'm OK and I'm really going to claw my way back - and I really want to do something with my life. ""Sometimes in life it takes a knock to remember what we really value."" Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external There probably isn't a pamphlet in the careers office for people wanting to become adventurers. But Grylls has a straightforward explanation for the path he took - and the occupational hazard of constantly putting himself in danger. ""It's the only thing I'm good at. I'm not saying that out of modesty, it really is. It's my job, it's what I really love. It's what over the years I've become half-decent at."" And he says the parachute accident was another spur to improve and get things right in split-second decisions. When his parachute was failing to function properly and he was spinning to the ground, he says he wasn't thinking about his life flashing before his eyes - instead he was trying to sort out the parachute.

You can join the debate at theBBC's Family & Education News Facebook page,external. But he ""ran out of time and hit the ground very hard"" and says that, in retrospect, he should have used those seconds to use the reserve chute. ""I made a promise to myself on that hospital bed that I was going to become the fastest-thinking, the quickest-reaction dude out there. Now I really take pride that I'm good in those moments. But these are skills we develop."" ""Sometimes in life it takes a knock to remember what we really value"" He is famous for his survival skills. But he says the first inhospitable terrain he had to conquer was his own lack of self-confidence. ""I wasn't very good at school - and I struggled a lot with confidence,"" says the Eton-educated adventurer. But he says such early struggles can be better preparation than success coming too easily. ""The great people I know in life often struggled at school, because it was the struggle that developed their strength."" His descriptions are also punctuated by an awareness of the small margins between success and failure - and life and death. When he talks about the last exhausting phase of climbing Everest, he describes coming across the body of another climber he had known, Rob Hall, who had died on the mountain two years before. ""I remember just sitting next to Rob, still perfectly there, his hair blowing, as if I could nudge him and he'd stand up and be fine. ""I desperately needed something to give me strength - and he is such a hero of mine. I just remember this panic filling me - there are a lot of bodies on the mountain, but this was different - we were so close, but now so far away."" He pushed on and became one of the youngest climbers to get to the summit of Everest. And he says he brought back some snow from the summit and kept it as a liquid symbol of conquering his self-doubt. Bear Grylls says young people need some risk in their lives Grylls's popularity as a TV presenter has been based on his Boy's Own adventures in the world's wild places. It's in contrast to the worries about young people spending too long in front of screens, missing out on exercise and stressing over social media. He says young people need to see the outdoor world and to experience risk in their lives to build a spirit of adventure and curiosity. ""If you strip risk out of young people's lives, you kill that spirit. Risk is all around us - and you empower kids if you teach them how to manage that risk."" And he says it's the shy and under-confident youngsters he wants to encourage most. ""The rewards in life don't always go to the biggest or the bravest, the cleverest, or even the best,"" he tells them. ""The rewards in life go to the dogged and the determined, to the tenacious, those who get back on their feet when they get kicked."" He's prepared for numbingly cold temperatures and the threats of hungry predators. Just don't try and ambush him with a cocktail sausage and a conversation about the traffic.

"Everton Free School is the first school run by a Premier League club Everton Free School is the first school run by a Premier League football club, taking on students who have not been able to stay in mainstream education. The Victoria Derbyshire programme has been given exclusive access to the school. Life for Liam, aged 15, hasn't been easy. Liam, whose full name we have not used, has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism, and witnessed domestic violence while growing up. His own mental health has also been a worry, and he has been the target of bullies. All of this had a big impact on his time at school, and by the time he was entering his teens, options for his education were running out. ""It was very anxious for me as a parent, to know you had to be at work all day and your son was somewhere he hated being,"" says his mother Laura. This video can not be played Liam's mum says he was quite suicidal before he started at Everton Free School ""I'd worry all day. Is he going to get hit? Are they going to be waiting for him after school?"" It was a dark time for Liam, and meant his progress was slipping. He wasn't turning up to class, and when he did, he'd get into fights. ""It was hard to get the work done. I'd always need the one-on-one. It would always be so hard to complete a task,"" he says. Three years ago, Laura was told about Everton Free School - the only school run by a Premier League football club. For lifelong fan Liam, it seemed like a real opportunity. A class is held at a corporate box at Everton's Goodison Park The school has 120 students and teaches English, maths and science as core GCSEs, as well as a range of more practical subjects aimed at getting the students jobs when they finish. But all of them have special needs of some kind - behavioural problems, issues at home and some with drugs and crime. Chloe, who is also 15, had serious behavioural problems. ""I got kicked out. I was naughty, and used to do nothing in school and used to argue with all the teachers. I used to fight,"" she remembers. ""People used to go around carrying knives and that. And if they'd get into a fight they'd stab them."" Laura was in two minds about sending Liam into a school where students had such problems. ""Definitely without a doubt, it was the hardest decision I've ever had to make,"" she says. ""Am I throwing my child from the furnace into the fire? I really had to think hard about it."" The school has 120 students and teaches English, maths and science as core GCSEs And it's not cheap. At Â£14,500 a year per pupil, it is three times the cost of a mainstream school - a bill picked up by the taxpayer. I ask Richard Cronin, the school's executive principal, if it is just a way of rewarding difficult kids. He says there is a ""really high correlation"" between young people not being engaged in the education system and being involved in crime. ""We are engaging them. That's got to be beneficial to everybody,"" he says. Most would have had a 5-10% attendance. This school aims to get them up above 80%. One of the perks of being associated with Everton - for fans like Liam anyway - is meeting the players when they come and visit the school. England and Everton defender Phil Jagielka came to join a science lesson. Joe posing for a photograph with Phil Jagielka ""A few of them want to speak to you,"" the footballer says. ""A few of them want to give you a little bit of banter - there are a couple of Liverpool fans in here and all sorts, so they refuse to write the word blue down for instance. ""I've been here for a long time now and I've met some fantastic characters, some great people. ""If you give these kids a chance to open up and talk, more often than not, you know you've had a great day. These are going to be young men and women in a couple of years and if we can give them a decent foothold then that's what's important."" Liam beams as he meets his team's captain, wearing the Everton kit. He's now doing extra maths and is working towards a qualification in coaching football. ""As a fan it makes you proud. The crest on your chest every day. It's what you want really."" The Everton brand - and its profile and money - is a big bonus for this school. But in wearing the kit and being associated with its name, the students gain something more important: respect. And it is changing their lives.

"The claim:The increase in women working in their 70s is because some of them can't afford to retire. Reality Check verdict:Although some women keep working out of choice, it is also likely that others are doing so because increased life expectancy and an inadequate pension pot means they don't have enough money to retire on. The proportion of women working into their 70s has doubled in the past four years, to 11%,according to official figures,external. That works out as about 150,000 women still working into their mid-70s. Although the growth has been strong, there is still a higher proportion of men working into their 70s, at 15.5%. But are some women continuing to work later in life because they want to, or because they cannot afford to retire? Life expectancy has been steadily climbing in the UK, and a woman who was 65 in 2015 could expect to live a further 20.9 years, on average,according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS),external. A longer life expectancy is, of course, good news, but also means this generation requires a higher level of savings to cover living expenses, not to mention possible care costs. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation puts theminimum income standard,externalfor pensioners at Â£186.77 a week - the equivalent of Â£9,712 a year. But a pensioner retiring after April 6 this year and relying purely on their state pension will have an income of Â£8,300 per year - Â£1,400 less than the Joseph Rowntree estimate. This means retirees also need to have built up their own pension pot. A survey from the pension provider Aegon suggests the average woman has less than half of the retirement savings an average man has. It also indicated the average woman hoped to retire at 64, compared with 65 for men. There are a number of factors behind this disparity. Women have a higher life expectancy than men, and on average earn less over the course of their working lifetimes as they are more likely to have taken time out from work for caring responsibilities. What's more, one in three women currently earns less than Â£10,000, which is the threshold at which they are eligible for automatic enrolment into a private pension scheme. Changes to the state pension age have also played a part. Until 1995, women expected to draw their state pensions at 60; men at 65. But changes made by the 1995 Pensions Act meant the pension ages of both men and women would be 65 by 2020. In 2011, this changed again, meaning some women born between April 1951 and 1960 are now facing a pension age of 66. The Cridland Report on the state pension age is due out on Thursday. Action group Women Against State Pension Inequality (Waspi) was set up to campaign for transitional arrangements for women born in the 1950s who have been negatively affected by changes in state pension law. The group says hundreds of thousands of women are suffering from financial hardship as a result of the changes, with not enough time to re-plan for their retirement.

"Nicola Sturgeon said she was ""frustrated"" by her talks with Theresa May in Glasgow on Monday This afternoon the Scottish Parliament will resume their debate on a Scottish independence referendum. The debate was suspended and the vote delayed last Wednesday as news reached the chamber of the terror attack in Westminster. Today they will pick up where they left off. The result of the vote this evening is not in any doubt. With the support of the Scottish Greens, the SNP will win the vote calling for a second referendum. They will then claim that the prime minister must not stand in the way of the democratically expressed will of the Scottish Parliament. But the other opposition parties - the Tories, Labour and Lib Dems - all believe that the will of the parliament does not match the will of the people. Scottish voters don't want another referendum, they argue, and they are convinced public opinion is on their side. It used to be received wisdom in Scottish politics that if Westminster tried to deny a Scottish referendum it could easily backfire and stir up support for independence. In general, independence supporters want another referendum while No voters do not But the unionist parties are confident there is no great public demand for another vote - other than among people who are already committed nationalists. Opinion polls suggest people are split fairly evenly, about 50/50, on whether they want another vote. And it tends to be Yes supporters who say yes to another referendum and No voters who say no, not now. The great divide in Scottish politics over the question of independence may only be solidified by this current debate over whether to re-run the 2014 referendum. Nicola Sturgeon will argue that this is now a great constitutional struggle in which the Scottish Parliament is battling with Westminster. Tories say Ms Sturgeon is just playing a well rehearsed game, one in which she puts forward a proposal she knows will be rejected by Westminster and then responds with righteous indignation. And we are about to see that happen once again. The first minster will soon send a letter to 10 Downing Street demanding another referendum. No 10 will reply to say they are not prepared to talk about it at this time. The prime minister made that clear when she met Nicola Sturgeon in Glasgow yesterday, when she said it was more important to pull together and get the best Brexit deal for the whole of the UK. The big question, the big calculation for both sides, is how many Scottish voters will then share the SNP's inevitable outrage about being denied another referendum. Some will. Others will breathe a huge sigh of relief that they don't have to live through another campaign. At least not yet.

The 87-year-old left the Caribbean's ""emerald isle"" in 1954 for a new life in England but has diligently returned to his homeland every year for almost four decades. Joe Sweeney, 87, is proud of Irish heritage and his ancestor Nathaniel Bass Daly The 1793 grave was prepared for Nathaniel's wife Elizabeth, lost at just 31 to an unknown epidemic, and refers only to Nathaniel as her ""disconsolate husband"". ""But we know he's buried here,"" Mr Sweeney says. ""He insisted his name wasn't put on the stone because he didn't want to disturb her."" The former stonemason is proud of his Irish roots which date back, he says, to the early settlers of the 1600s when the Irish made up the majority of Montserrat's white population as indentured labourers, merchants and plantation owners. Joe Sweeney has not been to Ireland, but his daughter has researched their family history ""Nathaniel Daly came on an official visit and liked it so much he stayed. He was a sophisticated, respected man. The Daly family owned a lot of land,"" Mr Sweeney continues, gesturing to the surrounding landscape fringing Daly Hill, one of numerous locations here with an Irish name. ""My daughter went to Ireland to find out about our family; she discovered the Sweeneys were from Donegal and the Dalys from Tipperary."" Mr Sweeney has never been to Ireland himself, something he regrets. But what he regrets more is not extracting further information about his familial roots from his parents before they died. ""You didn't question your parents in those days; they'd say you were cheeky,"" he says, blue-flecked eyes twinkling. ""For some people, having Irish ancestors is just a fact of life. But I am proud to be one of them; I feel a kinship,"" he adds. He is far from alone. From the shamrock-shaped passport stamp upon arrival at the tiny British territory, to the marking of St Patrick's Day with a public holiday and a week of festivities, Montserrat's Irish heritage is eulogised. Montserratians enjoy celebrating their Irish connection The thousands of international visitors who flooded in for this year's celebrations transformed the isle of 5,000 residents, many of whom bear surnames like Riley, O'Brien and Meade, into a vibrant sea of green. Leprechauns, shamrocks and Guinness are ubiquitous but the revelry features the island's rich Caribbean and African culture too, evidenced in feasts of traditional food such as goat ""water"" or stew, a ""freedom run"" in tribute to its slave history, and gospel and soca performances. Retired schoolteacher Sylvester Browne helped organise Montserrat's first official St Patrick's Day festivities in 1985. Prior to that, the date was marked informally with low-key events in individual villages. Sylvester Browne helped organise Montserrat's first official St Patrick's Day celebrations in 1985 Mr Browne's own village of St Patrick's was destroyed by the Soufriere Hills volcanic eruption of 1997, part of a two decade-long crisis that forced more than half of the island's erstwhile 11,500 inhabitants to flee. The volcano remains active to this day, although it has been relatively quiet in recent years. Today, visits to the ruined capital city of Plymouth and Montserrat's ""black sand"" beaches are a draw for adventure tourists. More than half of the island is still within an exclusion zone. The villages of St Patrick's and Morris were destroyed in less than 30 minutes in 1997 ""St Patrick's Day celebrations started because we wanted to commemorate the village more than anything,"" Mr Browne tells the BBC. ""It's evolved in a way we never imagined."" The original plantation-era costumes have stood the test of time - and appeared sporadically in this year's parade, alongside garb in the green, white and marigold national tartan, masquerade dancers, and African-inspired grass skirts and head-wraps. The national tartan was a popular choice for the St Patrick's Day parade Some groups commemorated events in the island's history ""I'm happy it's grown to be this big but it saddens me that it's become so commercialised,"" Mr Browne continues. ""It would nice if it focussed more on local tradition and what makes us unique."" These days, Montserrat's ethnic melting pot makes it hard to quantify how many people are of Irish descent. ""Some people deny it; others are proud for sentimental reasons, it's a connection they value,"" Mr Browne explains. Some of the costumes bear little resemblance to those worn at parades in Ireland Spirits were high at the parade in Montserrat ""St Patrick's Day is a nice way to showcase the island to visitors; some people are still not certain how safe it is. It's also great to see so many Montserratians return home for it."" Vince Greenaway was one of more than 1,000 Montserratians living overseas to attend the 17 March parade. ""Last year my buddies back home called me in Canada to tell me I was missing out,"" he says, laughing. ""I promised them I would be here this year; it's wonderful to see people I haven't seen in years.""

"This video can not be played Germany v England: Gareth Southgate says England must think long term Gareth Southgate prepared for his first game as permanent England manager by insisting foundations are now in place to narrow the gap on their opponents Germany - but warned the country's ""island"" mentality must end. England's3-2 win over the World Cup holders in Berlin last Marchleft then manager Roy Hodgson proclaiming his ""finest moment"" in charge -only to resign in Juneafter ahumiliating last-16 exit to Icelandat Euro 2016. Southgate, who replaced Hodgson's successor Sam Allardyceafter an unbeaten four-game run in interim charge,faces a stern test in Dortmund on Wednesday before a World Cup qualifier against Lithuania at Wembley on Sunday. The 46-year-old says plans are now in place that will put England in a position to finally catch up with the German model of consistent success. ""Some of those things have already started, such as the reform of academies and the improved focus on coaching, which is a process they went through,"" said Southgate. ""We've probably got some work to do in terms of the way they have a connection between the DFB (the German football association) and the Bundesliga that is immensely strong. There is an opportunity for the young German players to play in that league - there is a real buy-in on that, partly because of the ownership model of the clubs. ""To highlight the difference, they postponed the start of the Bundesliga because they got a team in the Olympics. We can't even get a team in the Olympics. That is the collaboration they have."" However, he added: ""We are different. We have to get off the island and learn from elsewhere. We have some great strengths and if we couple those with some other traits we could be more powerful than anybody, but we have a lot of work to get to that point."" Southgate also admitted the lack of recent major football success for England was the ""missing piece"" in the country's sporting portfolio. ""I'm not sure we've always looked at ourselves in the mirror as closely as we should, that's what we need as a football nation,"" he added. ""We've had success in every other sport in our country. ""It's probably the hardest one to succeed in - and if we do succeed it's the one that will have the most impact on our country and on the people."" Sterling a doubt to face Germany - team news & stats Football Daily podcast: Can Southgate shake up England? Lewis Holtby played 42 games for Spurs before moving to Hamburg Germany midfielder Lewis Holtby,now at SV Hamburgafter playing for Tottenham and Fulham in the Premier League, agreed the Football Association has embarked on the mission to catch up and said England's ""time will come"". ""The youth system in Germany is the best in the world. The training, the managers, the facilities, all of that was very good when I was coming through and now it's improved even more,"" he told BBC Radio 5 live. ""In England, the FA is definitely improving. You can see how many young players there are in the national team, how many prospects coming through with a lot of talent. There is [Manchester United striker] Marcus Rashford, [Tottenham's] Dele Alli is the future of England's midfield and [Tottenham striker] Harry Kane has been top of the Premier League scoring charts. ""But Germany have always been ahead at being ready for tournaments, knowing when to be ready. All praise to the German FA for the very good work they have done over the years on that."" He added: ""I read a lot about people in England looking to the German youth system with big eyes, hoping to be like them - but the FA looks like it's trying to find its own way. ""Their time will come. If they keep progressing this way they should have no problems."" Southgate, a firm admirer of the German system, added: ""We can learn from their mentality. When we've played German teams they just have that belief in the way they play. ""I'm watching Gary Cahill on the ball now and he has got that belief and confidence from the way he has been asked to play this year. ""You are working in a different system and opening your mind. Gary working with Antonio Conte at Chelsea reminds me of what [former England boss] Terry Venables gave me as a player, just stretching you into different challenges and doing things that improve you. ""We won't get there overnight but I think we've got players who are able to do that."" Chelsea defender Cahill, who will captain England against Germany in the absence of Manchester United forward Wayne Rooney and played in the game in Berlin, says his team will not be intimidated by the world champions. ""I am certainly respectful of the history of what they have done, but man for man I'm confident in the squad we've got and the players we have when I'm going out to face them,"" said the 31-year-old. And how can the gap to Germany's model of consistent success finally be closed? ""That is probably the golden question isn't it?"" Cahill said. ""To develop, young players have to play as much football as they can at club level and play in massive, important games - play cup finals or win leagues. That will happen. ""The more experiences they go through - good and bad - will bring them on as players and characters. ""One thing for me is having the ability and the other is having the experience.
