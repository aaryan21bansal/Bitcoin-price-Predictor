"The Prittlewell burial site was discovered in 2003 A royal burial site found between a pub and Aldi supermarket has been hailed as the UK's answer to Tutankhamun's tomb. Workers unearthed the grave, which contained dozens of rare artefacts, during roadworks in Prittlewell, near Southend, Essex, in 2003. Tooth enamel fragments were the only human remains, but experts say their ""best guess"" is that they belonged to a 6th Century Anglo-Saxon prince. It is said to be the oldest example of a Christian Anglo-Saxon royal burial. Now, after 15 years of expert analysis some of the artefacts are returning to Southend to go on permanent display for the first time at the Central Museum. When a team from the Museum of London Archaeology (Mola) excavated the site, they said they were ""astounded"" to find the burial chamber intact. The remains of the timber structure, which would have measured about 13ft (4m) square and 5ft (1.5m) deep, housed some 40 rare and precious artefacts. Among them was a lyre - an ancient harp - and a 1,400-year-old box thought to be the only surviving example of painted Anglo-Saxon woodwork in Britain. Gold coins, the gilded silver neck of a wooden drinking vessel, decorative glass beakers and a flagon believed to have come from Syria were also found. Each had been placed within the tomb ""as part of a carefully choreographed burial rite"", indicating the resting place of a man of princely lineage, they said. The tomb contained 40 artefacts including treasures from other kingdoms Locals nicknamed the grave's unknown occupant the Prince of Prittlewell and the King of Bling because of the riches buried alongside him. Ciara Phipps from Southend Museums Service said the first artefact uncovered - a copper alloy hanging bowl - gave experts a ""real idea of just how significant this burial might be"". ""It's thought it was probably acquired as a gift so it gives a sense of how significant this person might have been... he had friends in high places,"" she said. It had been suggested the remains were those of Saebert, Saxon king of Essex from AD604 to AD616 but carbon dating and other tests have indicated the tomb was constructed between AD575 and AD605 - at least 11 years before his death. After 15 years of research, archaeologists said their ""best guess"" was that the tomb belonged to Seaxa, Saebert's brother. Gold-foil crosses found at the head of the coffin are thought to have been placed over the eyes - making it certain he was a Christian However, other funeral customs, such as the burial mound, grave artefacts and wooden chamber, reflect pre-Christian beliefs and traditions A golden belt buckle, likely made especially for the burial, suggested a high-status individual An ""exceptionally large"" ash-wood coffin with an elaborate lid had space for a corpse and other worldly items. It alone would have weighed 160kg The size of the coffin, and placement of items within it, suggested he was about 5ft 6in (1.68m) tall A folding iron stool, thought to be a gifstol (gift seat) from which a lord dispensed rewards and judgement to his loyal followers and warriors, was found A ""skilfully crafted sword"" with collars of ribbed gold wire on the horn handle and a complex, pattern-welded blade was a clear signal of an aristocratic or royal-status burial. Source: Mola Gold decorated drinking vessels were among the treasures found in the royal burial A lyre, a stringed musical instrument, was also among the finds The burial is believed to belong to Seaxa, the brother of King Saebert Sophie Jackson, Mola's director of research and engagement, said no-one had expected the ""unpromising looking site"" found in 2003 to contain ""our equivalent of Tutankhamun's tomb"". ""It's between a bit of railway and a bit of road, essentially a verge. It's not where you'd expect to find it,"" she said. Ms Jackson said no-one could have known what was beneath the ""unpromising-looking"" site She said the grave provided a snapshot of a ""really interesting time"" when Christianity was ""just creeping in"" to the British Isles. ""They would have been just on the transition between having pagan burials with all your gear but also having these crosses,"" she said. Ms Jackson said ""the best guess"" was the tomb had housed Seaxa. She said: ""There's a lot of debate about whether he was a fully-fledged hairy beast Saxon warrior, or younger. ""Had he died before he could really prove himself?"" Tutankhamun was an Egyptian king who died about 3,000 years ago. His tomb was discovered by British archaeologist Howard Carter in 1922 in an area now known as the Valley of the Kings. It was one of the most well-preserved tombs that conservationists had ever seen, and close to 2,000 objects were found inside. The chamber was filled with treasure and detailed wall paintings that showed the story of King Tutankhamun's life and death. After the treasures had been catalogued and cleared, the tomb itself became a tourist destination when it was opened to the public in the 1930s. Who was Tutankhamun? Treasure status for Norfolk Anglo-Saxon finds Treasure find man unearths rare brooch in Norfolk Lenborough Anglo Saxon coin hoard valued at Â£1.35m Research was undertaken by more than 40 experts in various fields, who worked together to reconstruct the chamber. In some cases, items had been so badly eroded that only soil impressions remained. These artefacts were digitally recreated using techniques including CT scans and microscopic analysis of soil samples. Ms Phipps said the display, which begins on Saturday, was a ""real gem"" of the museum. ""It's such a significant moment for the museum service and also for the community of Southend,"" she said. ""This collection has evoked and encouraged a huge amount of local pride."" The museum has alsolaunched a website with information about its research,external, as well as an interactive diagram of the tomb.

"This video can not be played Mercer: The communities I come from are seething Tory MP Johnny Mercer says he has withdrawn his support for Theresa May and her government over the historical prosecution of servicemen and women. In a letter to the PM,external, the Plymouth MP said he would only vote with the Conservatives on Brexit legislation. He called on Mrs May to end the ""abhorrent process"" of ""elderly veterans being dragged back to Northern Ireland"" to face possible prosecution. He has previously called for legislationto stop this happening. Communities Secretary - and former Northern Ireland Secretary - James Brokenshire said he was ""very saddened"" by Mr Mercer's announcement and acknowledged that ""the system isn't working well in Northern Ireland"". He said the government had been consulting on changing the existing system. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Mercer said the government had ""singularly failed to act for four years and I am simply not prepared to put up with it any more"". ""There is nothing loyal about watching the car go over the cliff and not doing anything about it,"" he added. In his letter the former Army officer and member of the Commons Defence Committee, said: ""As you know, the historical prosecution of our servicemen and women is a matter that is personally offensive to me. ""Many are my friends; and I am from their tribe."" BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the Conservative Party can ""ill afford to lose MPs from [the] rising generation who have been able to win marginal seats"" right now.

Mr Mercer told the PM he cannot ""support your legislative programme any further until your government make some clear and concrete steps to end this abhorrent process"". ""The macabre spectacle of elderly veterans being dragged back to Northern Ireland to face those who seek to re-fight that conflict through other means, without any protection from a government who sent them almost fifty years ago, is too much,"" he wrote. MP unsure Tories still share his values ""It appears that my values and ethos may be slowly, but very firmly, separating from a party I joined in 2015. ""I will not be voting for any of the government's legislative actions outside of Brexit until legislation is brought forward to protect veterans from being repeatedly prosecuted for historical allegations and will be updating my constituents of this decision accordingly."" A total of six former soldiers are now facing prosecution over Troubles-era killings. The cases relate to Daniel Hegarty; Bloody Sunday; John Pat Cunningham; Joe McCann (involving two ex-soldiers); and Aidan McAnespie. Not all the charges are murder. The Public Prosecution Service in Northern Ireland said that of 26 so-called legacy cases it has taken decisions on since 2011, 13 related to republicans, eight to loyalists, and five are connected to the Army.

"Northern Ireland is bucking the UK trend of falling GP numbers The number of GPs per head of population in NI is rising despite falling elsewhere in the UK, the BBC can reveal. The Nuffield Trust analysis looked at GPs working in the NHS, both full and part-time, per 100,000 people. While there are more doctors, fewer of them are choosing to work full time, said the Royal College of GPs. Recognising issues linked to an ageing population, the Department of Health said it needed to train more GPs. Currently, there are 67 per 100,000 people in Northern Ireland, meaning there are almost six more doctors per 100,000 people than there were a decade ago - in England they are down by six. County Fermanagh, Omagh and Mid Ulster have the lowest number of doctors per head of population, with a number of practices being forced to merge in order to stay open. Northern Ireland's Royal College of GPs said it required more doctors to work full time in general practice - particularly in rural areas - but acknowledged that years of lobbying for additional funding had paid off. Grainne Doran says more GPs are choosing not to work full time ""We have had an increase in the total number of GPs but unfortunately they are not all choosing to work full time in GP practices,"" said the college's chairwoman, Dr Grainne Doran. ""Instead, they are expanding their portfolios in other areas - which is great but doesn't mean we have enough GPs working in surgeries to meet the needs of a growing population. ""For instance, they are working in emergency departments perhaps one night a week, and they are also involved in hospice care, even involved in training."" GP numbers in first sustained drop for 50 years Rise in patients waiting more than a year GP practices: New services to be offered Concerns over future of GP services The nature of general practice is changing. Gone are the days when a GP worked full time from one practice. Dr Mark Cromie, who has been qualified for almost three years, works in both a rural practice in Lisnaskea, Enniskillen, and in the local hospital, as well as being involved in teaching. ""GPs want to work differently now,"" he said. ""We don't want to work on our own and isolated but instead as part of a wider team where we can bounce ideas off one another. ""We are involved in a team of physiotherapists, social workers, dermatologists, often under the one roof and that provides better care for patients."" Dr Mark Cromie enjoys the variety of work available to a rural GP Northern Ireland is struggling to get more people like Dr Cromie. Despite lobbying for additional GP training places, and securing 111, only 86 were filled this year. The Royal College of GPs admits it must now adopt a more positive tone about the profession. It has called on the Department of Health to ensure the HSC (Health and Social Care) workforce strategy analyses workforce needs and trends in general practice to ensure Northern Ireland has enough GPs. The department said Northern Ireland had the UK's most ambitious approach to delivering multi-disciplinary working in primary care. ""Every practice now has access to a practice-based pharmacist - the largest scheme of its kind in the UK, relative to population,"" said a spokesperson. Elsewhere, the NHS is seeing the first sustained fall in GP numbers per head of population for nearly 50 years. In England, the number of GPs per 100,000 people fell from 63.9 in 2014 to 58 last year. The last time numbers fell like this was in the late 1960s. From 1970 to 2010, numbers were rising as the population aged. But after 2010, the increases started tailing off, before falling in each of the last four years. The fall in GPs means the average doctor now has 125 more patients to look after than they did in 2014. The Nuffield Trust, an independent think tank, believes another 3,500 GPs would be needed to get the NHS back to where it was in 2014. There are just over 42,000 working currently, down by nearly 1,500 in four years.

"The victims of the attack clockwise - Chrissy Archibald, Sebastien Belanger, Kirsty Boden, Ignacio Echeverria, Sara Zelenak, Xavier Thomas, Alexandre Pigeard, James McMullan One of the London Bridge attackers was seen washing his knife and wiping it on his beard shortly after eight people were killed, an inquest has heard. Khuram Butt, 27, was caught on CCTV cleaning his 12in pink ceramic knife inside the Black and Blue restaurant. In the same footage, an accomplice, Youssef Zaghba, 22, was seen having a drink from behind the bar. The inquest also heard two victims might still be alive if barriers had been put up after a similar attack. Khuram Butt, Youssef Zaghba and Rachid Redouane were shot dead by police after they drove a van into pedestrians, stabbed others, and confronted unarmed police officers shouting ""Allahu Akbar"" on 3 June 2017. Counsel for the coroner Jonathan Hough QC had warned the families of the victims at the inquest at the Old Bailey that ""distressing images"" would be shown and that Butt's reaction was ""the most chilling"". The inquest was also shown footage of diner Roy Larner,dubbed the Lion of London Bridge,being savagely stabbed in the stomach. Mr Larner appeared not to react after he was stabbed twice in quick succession before he stood up and ran away. In other footage, the third attacker, Rachid Redouane, 30, was shown on CCTV bending down to tie his shoelaces in the street during the attack through Borough Market. Redouane was also seen, in other images, talking to an unidentified man and then walking away without attacking him, for reasons that are not known. Mr Hough said: ""There is clearly some form of discussion. We don't know what was said. Despite appeals for witnesses, he [the man in the footage] never came forward."" In the space of three minutes, the attackers had struck Xavier Thomas, 45, and Christine Archibald, 30, with a van on the bridge then fatally stabbed Alexandre Pigeard, 26, Sara Zelenak, 21, Kirsty Boden, 28, Sebastien Belanger, 36, James McMullan, 32, and Ignacio Echeverria, 39, around Borough Market. Within 10 minutes, the attackers, who injured 48 more people, had been shot dead by police marksmen. In the CCTV, pedestrians were seen running for their lives as the attackers' van mounted the pavement on the bridge. An image of the van used by the attackers The inquest also heard that two victims of the attack, Christine Archibald, 30, and Xavier Thomas, 45, might still be alive if barriers had been put up following the Westminster Bridge attack, which took place two months earlier. The pair were among 10 people struck by a 2.5-ton hire van driven by Zaghba. Mr Thomas was knocked into the Thames and found dead three days later, while Ms Archibald died after being dragged under the wheels of the powerful vehicle. Gareth Patterson, QC, representing some victims, questioned a senior officer about why no barriers were put in place on London Bridge following the earlier attack in Westminster. He said: ""There were no barriers in place on that pavement protecting pedestrians from traffic on that road. ""If there had been barriers Christine Archibald and Xavier Thomas would now be with us today."" Senior investigating officer Det Supt Rebecca Riggs agreed, saying: ""That may well be the case."" The court heard barriers were put up on London Bridge within two days of the attack. Earlier, the inquest heard armed officers kept shooting at the attackers even after gunning them down, fearing they were wearing explosive vests. Det Supt Rebecca Riggs said police withdrew but had to fire extra shots when they saw the men were ""still moving"". ""They believed they were going to activate the explosive devices they were wearing and they fired a number of shots,"" she said. Neil McLelland, who was looking out of the window of the nearby Wheatsheaf pub, was hit in the head by a bullet and fell to the ground, while five other people were injured by shrapnel from the shooting. The court heard the officers then put ""themselves in harm's way"" to evacuate the pub, taking Mr McLelland and others to safety. Mr McLelland survived his injuries. The armed officers who killed the knifemen have not been named at the inquest The second day of the inquest was also told one victim was killed after he tried to beat the attackers with his skateboard. Det Supt Riggs said Spaniard Ignacio Echeverria, 39, had been cycling with friends when he came across PC Wayne Marques and PC Charlie Guenigault trying to tackle the knifemen. The officers had stepped in to help Oliver Downing and Marie Bondeville, who had been hurt by the trio. Mr Echeverria, an HSBC financial crime analyst, ran across to help and swung his board at one of the killers but was knocked to the ground by Redouane, the inquest was told. Ignacio Echeverria was the last of eight people to be killed in the attack Det Supt Riggs said: ""Ignacio got off his bike and ran across to where the two officers were to assist [them]."" ""He had taken his board from his rucksack and swung at the attackers and managed to hit them. [Rachid] Redouane retaliated, causing him to fall on the ground,"" she added. ""The attackers then set upon him on the ground."" Counsel to the coroner Jonathan Hough QC added: ""It was a brief but furious assault."" BBC reporter Marie Jackson, at the inquest Over several hours, the inquest watched the horrific attack unfold from every angle, second by second, from cameras on buildings, in restaurants, in taxis and buses, on police body-cams and the public's mobile phones. The hearing gasped as the attackers' van was shown careering over London Bridge, knocking over pedestrians like skittles. One camera captured Tyler Ferguson running to the side of his fiancÃ©e, Chrissy Archibald, as she lay dying in the middle of the road. Other footage showed the attackers striding side-by-side through Borough Market, indiscriminately stabbing anyone in their path. Their victims are filmed bleeding in the street, clutching their faces, heads and chests. In the Black and Blue restaurant, the men stabbed customers with their knives before ducking behind the bar to swig some water from a tap. On their way out, they picked up a couple of bottles, smashed them on the side of a table - another weapon. On Thursday, the hearing is due to hear from an eyewitness, Christine Delcros, whose partner Xavier Thomas was knocked off the bridge and into the Thames by the attackers' van. Earlier, Ms Delcros wept in court as CCTV footage showed the French couple walking hand in hand towards the bridge, their final moments together. In a touching moment, Julie Wallace, the bereaved mother of Sara Zelenak, crossed the courtroom to take a seat beside Ms Delcros to comfort her. The inquest continues.

"Tom Rostance Ajax 2-3 Tottenham (Agg: 3-3) WHAT a night in the Champions League. Again. Just 24 hours on from Liverpool's heroics at Anfield, Tottenham produced another inspirational display to beat Ajax on away goals and set up the most unlikely of all-English finals in Madrid on 1 June. Tottenham were 2-0 down at half-time - and 3-0 on aggregate - after this superb Ajax side again had a wonderful 45 minutes. But Lucas Moura's 35-minute hat-trick sent Spurs into their first Champions League final and reduced manager Mauricio Pochettino to tears. If you're just tuning in, catch the match reporthere.  Ajax 2-3 Tottenham (Agg: 3-3) An emotional Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino speaking to BT Sport:""Still difficult to talk. The emotion is amazing, thank you to football. My players are heroes - in the last year I was telling everyone this group are heroes. The second half they were amazing. Thank you football - this type of emotion without football is no possible. Thank you to everyone who has believed in us. To describe this in words is difficult. ""We were talking before the game that when you work and when you feel the love it's not stress it's passion of the team. We showed we love the sport and football. Today was amazing. It was a joy to watch this kind of game. ""It's difficult to compete at this level. I am so grateful to be a coach. To be in football and to live this type of football.

I was all over the place and it was raw emotion. Disbelief and shock. This last month of football in the Champions League and the Premier League has been unbelievable. Certain players like Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld have been at that club for a long time trying to develop themselves and I do not think they envisaged playing in a European Cup final for Tottenham. Liverpool have been in finals for years and it is rooted in their history. Spurs need these days, and if they can win it, it sends them into a completely different stratosphere.

"Lora Haddock says she is thankful for the decision A sex toythat was banned from this year's CES tech showafter winning an innovation award has been given the prize again, four months later. The Ose robotic vibrator by Lora DiCarlo was originally given the prize by the Consumer Technology Association (CTA) in January. However, the CTA quickly changed its mind and ousted the device, causing outrage. The organisation has now offered a ""sincere apology"" to Lora DiCarlo. The CTA was accused of ""gender bias"" at the timein a blog by Lora Haddock, the founder and chief executive of the Lora DiCarlo company.,external Ms Haddock argued that the organisation had rejected a product focused on female sexuality, whereas shopping or childcare-related items aimed at women were allowed to remain in the same award category as the vibrator. ""We firmly believe that women, non-binary, gender non-conforming, and LGBTQI folks should be vocally claiming our space in pleasure and tech,"" she said. ""The CTA did not handle this award properly,"" said Jean Foster, a marketing executive at the organisation. ""This prompted some important conversations internally and with external advisers, and we look forward to taking these learnings to continue to improve the show."" Ms Haddock said she appreciated the ""gesture"" from the CTA, which would serve to ""remove the stigma and embarrassment around female sexuality"".

"This video can not be played Sir Graham Brady: ""No public clarity"" on Theresa May's departure date The PM has rejected calls to quit over her handling of Brexit, saying it is ""not an issue about me"". Theresa May was replying to Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns, who said she had ""failed to deliver on her promises"" and had lost public trust. Calls have been growing for the prime minister to name an exit date. The PM's spokesman said she had already promised to leave after delivering the first stage of Brexit and was sticking to that ""generous and bold offer"". Mrs May has agreed to address a meeting of the 1922 Committee - an elected body of Tory MPs which represents backbenchers and oversees leadership contests - next week. Its chairman, Sir Graham Brady, told the BBC he had had two ""very good meetings"" with the PM, organised to raise concerns about her leadership. Watch: What does the 1922 Committee do? May meets senior Tory amid calls to resign A really simple guide to the European elections He said it was clear she ""wishes and is determined to do her best to secure our departure [from the EU]"", but the 1922's executive would have the opportunity after next week's meeting ""to decide if the assurances they have had [from her] are sufficient or not"". This video can not be played Andrea Jenkyns says Theresa May should make way for a new leader Sir Graham also said he believed the PM would ask the Commons to vote again on the terms of the UK's exit before elections to the European Parliament take place on 23 May. The withdrawal agreement has effectively been rejected by MPs three times already. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says the prime minister has bought herself a bit more time.

In March, Mrs May pledged to stand down if and when Parliament ratified her Brexit withdrawal agreement, but she has not made it clear how long she intends to stay if no deal is reached. Pressure has grown on her sincethe Tories' local election drubbing last week,and there have been warnings they face a meltdown in elections to the European Parliament too. At Prime Minister's Questions, Mrs May said she was ""very sorry"" that so many councillors - 1,300, in fact - lost their seats. But she told Ms Jenkyns the resolution to the Brexit crisis was ""not an issue about me or her"" - and if it was up to the prime minister, the UK would have already left the EU. Much of the anger in the parliamentary party is focusing on Mrs May's efforts to find a Brexit compromise with Labour. Further pressure is also coming from the grassroots, with local Tory associations confirmingthey will hold a vote of confidencein her leadership on 15 June. Analysis:By BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake Sometimes it can seem like Theresa May is surrounded by an invisible force field, deflecting blows from all directions. Political flaming asteroids which might've seen off a prime minister in simpler times lie smouldering on the floor as she doggedly pushes on. A failed snap election, no confidence votes, defeat after defeat in Parliament have all left her standing somehow. But that survival is down in no small part to factors beyond her control; nobody wanting to inherit the mess, Tories terrified of losing power to Labour, and a party increasingly ill at ease with itself. But if something shifts then her time and her luck may run out. A candidate to replace her could decide it's now or never, her own MPs may run out of patience entirely or the European election results may simply be too bad to bear. Holding her hands up and walking away would not be in Theresa May's nature, but just as events have shaped her survival, they may yet lead to her demise. The 1922 has previously rejected calls to re-write its rulesto bring forward another confidence vote in the PM's leadership, meaning that at the moment, the earliest it can happen is in mid-December. Brexit: A really simple guide Why the UK couldn't avoid the European elections Eurosceptic Conservative MP Peter Bone said ""the majority"" of Tory MPs ""acknowledge she needs to go and needs to go soon"". Tory Brexiteer Sheryll Murraytweeted,externalthat she believed the PM ""should resign immediately"". Former minister Robert Halfon said Mrs May had to set out a ""proper timetable"" for departure, but it had to be done in a ""dignified way"". Some Conservatives, though, think she should be allowed to stay until the autumn, if necessary, to deliver the UK's exit from the EU. Mel Stride, financial secretary to the Treasury, said: ""At end of the day - if you change the pilot, you are not going to change the weather."" Discussions with Labour could still yield a way forward, he said - although as yet, the talks have not borne fruit. Negotiations finished on Wednesday without an agreement between the two sides, but Downing Street said there will be more talks ""over the coming days"". Conservative MPs have already begun to voice their intentions to stand in a Tory leadership contest once Mrs May leaves,including new International Development Secretary Rory Stewart. Cabinet minister Andrea Leadsom is the latest to indicate an interest, saying she is ""seriously considering"" standing for a second time - she ran in 2016, but pulled out to give Mrs May a clear run at the job. The beauty contest to be next Tory leader The UK had been due to leave the EU on 29 March, but the deadline was pushed back to 31 October after Parliament was unable to agree a way forward. No confidence vote of Tory MPs:Theresa May won a leadership ballot by 200 to 117 votes on 12 December 2018. Under current party rules, there can't be another vote for a further year so the PM is technically safe until 12 December this year. Many MPs want to change the rules to allow an earlier contest but this would need to be agreed by the 1922 Committee. No confidence vote in Parliament:The PM would have to resign if she lost a confidence vote in Parliament. Labour tried this manoeuvre in December but Tory MPs and their DUP allies backed the PM. Might some Tories now withhold their support if they think it will usher in a new leader rather than a general election? Grassroots Tory revolt:Local Conservative associations seem to be turning against the PM, with one - Clwyd South - already passing a motion of no confidence in her. The National Conservative Convention's vote on 15 June is non-binding, though, so the PM could ignore it. Cabinet revolt:Margaret Thatcher quit in 1990 after a number of ministers told her it was time to go. Could history repeat itself? There has been no sign of that so far and colleagues who want to succeed her - and there are many - may not want to be seen to be the ones wielding the knife or to risk sacrificing their own careers. Quits of her own accord:The BBC's Norman Smith says there is no way the PM will ""walk away"" right now, but this could change in the aftermath of a ""catastrophic"" result in European elections.

"Scotland has the highest number of GPs per head of population in the UK, research commissioned by the BBC shows. Analysis by the Nuffield Trust think tank shows there are 76 GPs per 100,000 people, compared to a national UK average of 60. But Scotland's doctors have warned major challenges still exist with recruitment and retention. The Scottish government haspledged to recruit a further 800over the next decade to fill gaps. The pressures on GPs across the UK are being examined by the BBC as part of a special day of coverage, including a Panorama investigation. The UK-wide figures show there has been four consecutive years of falls with the biggest drops being seen in England. Unlike south of the border, Scottish GP numbers have stayed relatively static in recent years. This comes against a backdrop of increased patient numbers, many elderly with complex medical needs, and a fall in the number of GP practices. Latest figures also show a 8% drop in the number of GP surgeries since 2008, from 1,025 in 2008 to 944 last year. Over the same period the number of registered patients has increased by 5% to 5.7m. There are reasons why Scotland has a higher ratio of GPs to patients than other parts of the UK. One is topography - in parts of the Highlands, one GP may cover a vast area with a small number of inhabitants - and we have one of the largest island populations in Europe. Most doctors say we still face a crisis in GP recruitment and retention, with high vacancy rates and almost a third of doctors nearing retirement age. A commitment to recruit 800 family doctors by 2027 has been welcomed but even then there are worries that many of those jobs will be part-time ones and will still leave significant gaps. The move to bigger practices with advanced nurse practitioners, pharmacists, physiotherapists and even paramedics taking on new roles is part of the answer, but there are recruitment problems in these professions too. Doctors in Scotland are being offered incentives such as ""golden hello"" payments or relocation costs as part of a plan to recruit 800 GPs in a decade. The move is part of thenew GP contractagreed in 2018 but unions say there are still significant gaps in GP numbers. Dr Alasdair Forbes, of the Royal College of General Practitioners Scotland, warned that the country faces a shortfall of 856 family doctors by 2021. He said: ""Our members have told us that the current shortage of GPs is taking a toll on their wellbeing and reduces the likelihood that they will remain in general practice for the long-term. ""A commitment to increase the number of whole-time-equivalent GPs must be in tandem with the growth of the wider primary care team workforce such as nurses, pharmacists and physiotherapists. ""General practice is at the frontline of the NHS, carrying out the vast majority of patient contacts and holding clinical risk as gatekeepers to the other parts of the health service. ""By investing in general practice, the NHS will be enabled to be at its best where it is needed most, tackling many of the root causes of health inequalities and reducing the pressure on secondary care services."" Olive Watson, 93, has lived in the village of Stoneyburn all her life and can't remember a time when it didn't have a GP practice. But that changed last year when the doctors who ran the West Lothian village's health centre handed the keys back to NHS Lothian. The health board was unable to find a replacement, despite an extensive recruitment drive. For Olive, who is registered blind, and the rest of the village this means the closest practice is three miles away in Fauldhouse. ""It is murder,"" Olive told BBC Scotland. ""It is just not convenient in anyway, when you get off the bus it is a hill and a bit of a walk to get there,"" said the pensioner, who now mostly relies on taxis to get to her new GPs. ""I would like to see a doctor, even part time, put in the village here, that would be handy for me and other people like me who are elderly but also young families. ""I met a lady with two kids who spent Â£12 going up and down to the doctor with one of them who was ill. ""You feel sorry for people like that, it is a lot of money in bus fares."" Olive, who also has asthma, said the village's surgery closing down had sometimes put her off going to see a GP. She added:  ""If I am really very ill I phone for the paramedics and they are very good."" The Nuffield Trust analysis looked at the number of GPs working in the NHS per 100,000 people across the UK. It shows that during the late 1960s the numbers were falling, before four decades of almost continuous growth. A peak of 66.5 was reached in 2009, before the increases tailed off. There has now been four consecutive years of falls with the biggest drops being seen in England. A  Scottish government spokeswoman said:  ""We have a record number of GPs working in Scotland, and are committed to increasing numbers by at least 800 in the next 10 years. ""We are committed to investing Â£250m more in direct support of general practice by the end of this parliamentary period. ""The new GP contract agreed with the BMA and GPs, ensures GPs are able to spend more time with patients and less on bureaucracy, making a career in general practice even more attractive to younger doctors.""

"Tom Rostance Ajax 2-3 Tottenham (Agg: 3-3) WHAT a night in the Champions League. Again. Just 24 hours on from Liverpool's heroics at Anfield, Tottenham produced another inspirational display to beat Ajax on away goals and set up the most unlikely of all-English finals in Madrid on 1 June. Tottenham were 2-0 down at half-time - and 3-0 on aggregate - after this superb Ajax side again had a wonderful 45 minutes. But Lucas Moura's 35-minute hat-trick sent Spurs into their first Champions League final and reduced manager Mauricio Pochettino to tears. If you're just tuning in, catch the match reporthere.  Ajax 2-3 Tottenham (Agg: 3-3) An emotional Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino speaking to BT Sport:""Still difficult to talk. The emotion is amazing, thank you to football. My players are heroes - in the last year I was telling everyone this group are heroes. The second half they were amazing. Thank you football - this type of emotion without football is no possible. Thank you to everyone who has believed in us. To describe this in words is difficult. ""We were talking before the game that when you work and when you feel the love it's not stress it's passion of the team. We showed we love the sport and football. Today was amazing. It was a joy to watch this kind of game. ""It's difficult to compete at this level. I am so grateful to be a coach. To be in football and to live this type of football. ""They are all heroes but [Lucas Moura] was a superhero. From the first to last one - the tough moment to live in the five years before."" Pochettino then wells up with tears... ""I want to remember my family... it's amazing to reward them. We need to be ready for the next game on Sunday then prepare for the final.""

"Tom Rostance Ajax 2-3 Tottenham (Agg: 3-3) WHAT a night in the Champions League. Again. Just 24 hours on from Liverpool's heroics at Anfield, Tottenham produced another inspirational display to beat Ajax on away goals and set up the most unlikely of all-English finals in Madrid on 1 June. Tottenham were 2-0 down at half-time - and 3-0 on aggregate - after this superb Ajax side again had a wonderful 45 minutes. But Lucas Moura's 35-minute hat-trick sent Spurs into their first Champions League final and reduced manager Mauricio Pochettino to tears. If you're just tuning in, catch the match reporthere.  Ajax 2-3 Tottenham (Agg: 3-3) An emotional Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino speaking to BT Sport:""Still difficult to talk. The emotion is amazing, thank you to football. My players are heroes - in the last year I was telling everyone this group are heroes. The second half they were amazing. Thank you football - this type of emotion without football is no possible. Thank you to everyone who has believed in us. To describe this in words is difficult. ""We were talking before the game that when you work and when you feel the love it's not stress it's passion of the team. We showed we love the sport and football. Today was amazing. It was a joy to watch this kind of game. ""It's difficult to compete at this level. I am so grateful to be a coach. To be in football and to live this type of football. ""They are all heroes but [Lucas Moura] was a superhero. From the first to last one - the tough moment to live in the five years before."" Pochettino then wells up with tears... ""I want to remember my family... it's amazing to reward them. We need to be ready for the next game on Sunday then prepare for the final.""

Ajax 2-3 Tottenham (Agg: 3-3) Jermaine JenasFormer Tottenham midfielder on BBC Radio 5 Live I have just about recovered. There was some screaming and then I completely choked up and lost my voice. I was all over the place and it was raw emotion. Disbelief and shock. This last month of football in the Champions League and the Premier League has been unbelievable. Certain players like Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld have been at that club for a long time trying to develop themselves and I do not think they envisaged playing in a European Cup final for Tottenham. Liverpool have been in finals for years and it is rooted in their history. Spurs need these days, and if they can win it, it sends them into a completely different stratosphere. Managers have everything thrown at them and that was a night for him. He may never get this sort of game ever again and I'm delighted for him and the football club.

"The bell was donated to St Catharine's College by a former student in 1960 A Cambridge University college has removed a historic bell from view amid fears it has links to the slave trade. The Demerara Bell was donated to St Catharine's College by a former student who went on to work for a sugar company in British Guiana. In April, the university announced a two-year investigation into its own historical links with slavery. A spokesperson for St Catharine's College said the bell ""most likely"" came from a slave plantation. As reported in the Daily Telegraph,external, archived articles from the college magazine, St Catharine's College Society, state that the 18th Century bell was donated by industrialist Edward Goodland with the inscription ""De Catherina 1772"" two years after his arrival in British Guiana in 1958. It was initially hung in a belfry outside the Porter's lodge but was moved in 1994 to an accommodation block. The Demerara bell at St Catharine's College has been removed from view The university has appointed an advisory group, chaired by Prof Martin Millett and based in the Centre of African Studies, which will examine the institution's archives to establish whether it benefitted financially from the slave trade. ""It is only right that Cambridge should look into its own exposure to the profits of coerced labour,"" said vice-chancellor Stephen Toope. A spokesperson for the college said: ""As part of the ongoing reflection taking place about the links between universities and slavery, we are aware that a bell currently located at the College most likely came from a slave plantation. ""A more detailed investigation is underway into the bell's provenance as part of a wider project researching the College's historical links to the slave trade."" Cambridge investigates its slavery links Senior tutor Dr Miranda Griffin said: ""It is important that the college, along with the rest of the collegiate university, acknowledges historical links to slavery and the slave trade. ""As an academic community, we will continue to conduct rigorous research into all aspects of our past and to reflect on our commitment to diversity, inclusion and asking challenging questions.""

"British and Irish ministers have signed a deal to preserve the Common Travel Area after Brexit. It guarantees free movement for citizens crossing the Irish border and cross-border access for study and health care. It comes as NI's parties meet in an attempt to break the Stormont deadlock. Northern Ireland has been without devolved government for more than two-and-a-half years, after the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in split in a bitter row. A memorandum of understanding, which is not legally binding, was signed at a meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference on Wednesday. The conference was scheduled by the two governments following last month's murder ofLyra McKee, and is part of efforts to restore power-sharing in Belfast. David Lidington, who is Theresa May's de facto deputy, stressed the importance of the latest memorandum. ""It guarantees that whatever the terms of the UK's exit from the EU, there will be no change to the rights of British and Irish citizens,"" he said. New Common Travel Area treaty call Governments set out NI talks plan British and Irish ministers hold London conference Journalist shot dead during Derry riots The TÃ¡naiste Simon Coveney gave an illustration of the kind of rights the governments want to protect. ""British and Irish people will be able to travel to each others' countries, to study, to work, access social welfare, access health care and vote in each other's elections,"" he said, Some politicians argue this memorandum is insufficient as it is not a binding treaty. However the Irish government said people should be assured by the fact that the deal has been copper fastened by legislation in both countries. On Tuesday, thegovernments set out details for a fresh talks processto take place over the next few weeks. They held talks with the five main parties, the first since substantive negotiations collapsed last year. Talks got under way at Stormont on Tuesday The Common Travel Area (CTA) gives UK and Irish citizens certain reciprocal rights in each others' countries. The rights include largely unrestricted travel between each jurisdiction. It is an arrangement between the UK and Ireland which pre-dates their membership of the European Union. The memorandum will be signed by Cabinet Minister David Liddington and Tanaiste (Deputy prime minister) Simon Coveney. Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley will also be in attendance. By Enda McClafferty, BBC News NI Political Correspondent It may have been in place for more than a century but in reality it was an agreement written in sand with no real legal weight. The Common Travel Area and the rights which flowed from it for citizens crossing the border, survived because of an arrangement between London and Dublin built on trust. Brexit threatened that trust and exposed the legal shortcoming in the arrangement. On Wednesday, ministers shored up the Common Travel Area in a Memorandum of Understanding which we are told will be Brexit-proof. But, by definition, a Memorandum of Understanding is not a legally binding document but instead signals the intention of both sides to move forward with a contract. So, what are the chances of the sands shifting? The British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference was set up through the Good Friday peace agreement, signed in 1998. It aims to promote bilateral co-operation between the British and Irish governments. Until last summer, it had not met since 2007, butnationalist parties had urged the two governments to hold it, in the absence of a breakthrough at Stormont. The conference is due to take place in Westminster Meanwhile, the first of five working groups set up to deal with outstanding issues at Stormont also met on Wednesday. The rest will begin meeting over the course of this week. The working groups are being chaired by current and former Stormont senior civil servants, with the political parties nominating three representatives to sit on each group. A source involved in the process said they were ""open-minded"" about the new talks format, and that the ""most crucial"" groups were those dealing with reform of the petition of concern, and language and culture. The governments have also announced that there will be weekly meetings of the five main parties with Mrs Bradley and Mr Coveney, to ""take stock"". Prime Minister Theresa May and Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar will review progress at the end of May.

"This video can not be played Prince Harry held their two-day-old son The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have named their newborn son Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor. Introducing him to the cameras earlier in the day, Meghan said: ""He has the sweetest temperament, he's really calm. He's been the dream."" As they laughed, Prince Harry said: ""I don't know who he gets that from."" The announcement came after the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh met their eighth and newest great-grandchild for the first time at Windsor Castle. By deciding to call their son Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, Harry and Meghan have chosen not to use a title for their first born. As the first born son of a duke, Archie could have become Earl of Dumbarton - one of Harry's subsidiary titles - or have been Lord Archie Mountbatten-Windsor, but instead he will simply be Master Archie Mountbatten-Windsor. The meaning behind Archie Harrison How do you decide on a baby name? BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said it was a ""strong indication that they don't want to bring him up as a formal 'royal'"". Talking about their first few days as parents, Meghan said: ""It's magic, it's pretty amazing. I have the two best guys in the world so I'm really happy."" The duke added: ""It's great. Parenting is amazing. ""It's only been two and a half days, three days, but we're just so thrilled to have our own little bundle of joy."" On which parent the baby resembled more, Harry said: ""Everyone says that babies change so much over two weeks. ""We're basically monitoring how the changing process happens over this next month really. But his looks are changing every single day, so who knows."" In pictures: A look back at Meghan's pregnancy Royal Family tree and line of succession Privacy, publicity and the royal baby Later, asked to show more of their son's face to the cameras, Meghan laughed as Harry joked: ""He's already got a little bit of facial hair as well, wonderful."" Meghan added: ""Thank you everybody for all the well-wishes and kindness, it just means so much."" A surprise choice, Archie was not among the bookmakers' favourites of Alexander, Arthur and Albert. ""I don't think anyone of us saw either of these names coming,"" says Joe Little, managing editor of Majesty royal magazine. As far as he is aware, Archie does not have any British royal connotations - and Harrison too is a totally new name for the Royal Family. Archie means ""genuine"", ""bold"" or ""brave"" - and is more popular in Britain than the US. It was originally a shortened form of Archibald but is now often used as a name on its own. Read more about the baby's name here. Pictures of the new family's first photocall were then shared on the SussexRoyal Instagram account. ""The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are delighted to share their first public moment as a family,"" the post said. The images shared on social media were taken by Chris Allerton, who was the couple's private wedding party photographer, and took the picture of the newlyweds watching fireworks in the grounds of Frogmore House at their evening reception. The infant, who is seventh in line to the throne, was delivered at 05:26 BST on Monday, with Harry saying after the birth that he and Meghan were ""absolutely thrilled"". The Duke of Cambridge has welcomed his brother to ""the sleep deprivation society that is parenting"". Prince William - a father-of-three - said he looked forward to seeing the new parents ""when things have quietened down"". The Prince of Wales has also expressed his joy at the birth. During an official visit to Germany with the Duchess of Cornwall, Prince Charles said: ""We couldn't be more delighted at the news and we're looking forward to meeting the baby when we return."" A statement added that Meghan's mother, Doria Ragland, was ""overjoyed at the arrival of her first grandchild"" and was with her daughter at Frogmore Cottage - the new parents' home on the Windsor Estate. By BBC News correspondent Helena Wilkinson As settings for first family photographs go this was rather more grand than most, to say the least - St. George's Hall in Windsor Castle is a room used for state banquets. But for Meghan and Harry it is a special room already filled with memories - it was where they held their wedding reception last year. Today they created new ones. Wrapped in a white shawl and hat, baby Sussex was oblivious to it all, sleeping soundly in his father's arms. As soon as the pictures of the newborn emerged news crews outside the castle beamed them live across the world. This two-day baby may only be seventh in line to the throne but interest in him is huge. Something his parents, who guard their privacy closely, will be very aware of. Buckingham Palace said Harry was present for the birth, which is understood to have taken place in hospital as opposed to at home. The baby will not automatically become a prince - although he could get that title if the Queen steps in. Harry and Meghan might otherwise want him to inherit one of Harry's titles, such as Earl of Dumbarton,or they could reject any royal title at all. This video can not be played Prince Harry says he and Meghan are ""absolutely thrilled"" The baby weighed 7lbs 3oz (3.2kg), making him lighter than each of his cousins. Prince George was 8lb 6oz (3.8kg) when he was born in July 2013. His sister Princess Charlotte was 8lbs 3oz (3.7kg) when she arrived in May 2015, while their younger brother Prince Louis weighed 8lb 7oz (3.8kg) when he was born in April last year. The average weight of a baby in the UK is about 7lb 7oz (3.4kg). Duchess of Sussex gives birth to boy How do you decide on a baby name?

A priest received a standing ovation at Lyra McKee's funeral when he asked why it took her death to unite politicians. Politicians attended a vigil in Londonderry after her murder, and also her funeral in Belfast on Wednesday.

The disagreements over Brexit and the return of the Stormont Assembly were put into context by matters of life and death. But those political disputes were not forgotten; quite the opposite. The message from the pulpit to political leaders in Northern Ireland was clear - sort out your differences now, don't wait. The funeral took two hours. Those involved in the service hope its impact will be long lasting and far reaching. Ms McKee's sister, Nichola Corner, told mourners: ""In the words of Lyra herself, we must change our own world, one piece at a time. Now let's get to work."" Hundreds gathered for the funeral of Ms McKee, who was from a Catholic background, at a Protestant cathedral. The congregation was led by Ms McKee's partner, mother Joan McKee, brothers Gary and David and sisters Joan, Nichola and Mary. Her family chose the location due to its reputation as a ""shared space"" in a divided city. Many friends of the journalist and campaigner for LGBT rights wore Harry Potter-themed T-shirts, scarves and badges to the service. Ms McKee was an avid fan of the series. Hundreds of mourners attended the funeral in Belfast's St Anne's Cathedral Messages of condolence left by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Prime Minister Theresa May At the beginning of the service, the Anglican dean of Belfast, the Very Reverend Stephen Forde, said: ""Lyra was a person who broke down barriers and reached across boundaries, this was her hallmark in life, this is her legacy in death. ""She was a child of the Good Friday agreement. She was a primary school pupil in north Belfast when the agreement was signed. ""She grew up to champion its hope for a society that was free from the prejudices of the past."" Grief and outrage over Ms McKee's murder has sparked hopes there is now momentum to break the political deadlock in Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland has been without a functioning devolved government since January 2017,when the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in split in a bitter row. On Wednesday, NI Secretary Karen Bradley said she intended tohold talks with Stormont party leaders in a bid to make progress. This video can not be played Family, friends and political leaders mourn Lyra McKee The Democratic Unionist Party's Sammy Wilson told BBC News NI that his party had offered solutions, including a time-limited process running parallel alongside the running of the assembly. Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald rejected Mr Wilson's criticisms. ""He knows that the issues that have held us back are issues of equality and recognition,"" she said. ""This stalemate is not acceptable and we need to act to resolve it."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Three people have been arrested over the murder, and all have been released without charge. Speaking after her funeral, Northern Ireland's top police officer said Ms McKee ""cared passionately about issues and worked hard and with integrity"". ""Of course that is in complete contrast to those people who came out of the shadows last Thursday night, fired shots at police lines, hitting Lyra and fatally injuring her,"" said Chief Constable George Hamilton. ""I suppose the outpouring of condemnation from the communities of Derry, Creggan all standing together in Creggan last Friday, was something I think was quite unique and quite different."" Members of the public stood outside the church to pay their respects to Ms McKee Ms McKee had written for publications including Private Eye, the Atlantic, Mosaic Science and Mediagazer. She had also signed a two-book deal with the publisher Faber and Faber, with her forthcoming book The Lost Boys due out in 2020. The hashtag #IStandWithLyra has been trending on Twitter, which Ms McKee used prolifically. Comedian Patrick Kielty, who is from Northern Ireland,tweeted:,external""Today Lyra McKee is laid to rest. She believed in peace, tolerance and equality. The exact opposite of those responsible. They will never win because Lyra will always be the future. And her truth will continue to be told. #IStandWithLyra"" Fellow members of the National Union of Journalists formed a guard of honour at the cathedral. The union described Ms McKee as ""one of the most promising journalists"" in Northern Ireland. There was also a gathering at Guildhall Square in Derry for those who could not attend the funeral.

"Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex revealed they had named their baby Archie Harrison Naming a baby is a big decision. Even if you're not a member of the Royal Family and your choice won't be shared with millions, choosing the right name is important. In England and Wales, new parents have 42 days to register the name after the baby is born, meaningthe Duke and Duchess of Sussexcould have had six weeks of thinking time if they had needed it before choosing Archie Harrison. Missing this deadline - as wasreportedly the case,externalfor former celebrity couple Liam Payne and Cheryl Cole in 2017 - could incur a fine of up to Â£200. In other countries the naming deadline is longer - parents in Sweden have three months to decide, while those in Denmark have half a year. The meaning behind Archie and Harrison Sarah Redshaw, managing editor of parenting website BabyCentre, urged parents to spend some time alone testing the name they choose. ""You don't want to regret it a year down the line,"" she said. ""We sometimes see posts that they have named a baby, then a year down the line they don't like it."" Sarah Redshaw, from BabyCentre, said she has noticed popular culture influencing baby names as well, for example more babies named Arya after TV show Game of Thrones Ms Redshaw added that her first baby remained unnamed for three weeks as she and her husband disagreed. ""I wore my husband down,"" she said. ""We had a shortlist of about five or six but there was one I certainly preferred more than the others. In the end, he chose the middle name."" Other new parents take different approaches to naming their child. Alan Marritt, 79, from Leeds, said he called his daughter Christine Donna, so her initials - with her surname - spelt out CDM. Why? ""For the simple reason her mum was eating a hundred weight of Cadbury's dairy milk chocolate before the child was born,"" he explained. ""I bought a whole box of it so I didn't have to go out when it was raining."" He also had a novel way for naming his second daughter. ""The other one was born a minute after midnight so we called her Andrea,"" he said, so the initials spelt out AM. Donna Slater, 40, who comes from Swansea but now lives in Bristol, came up with the name for her firstborn by scrolling through the Welsh rugby team and reading out each name to her husband. Welsh mum Donna Slater used her country's rugby team for inspiration ""I was kind of surreptitiously on my phone looking at the Welsh rugby team. 'What about Gareth?' and he'd say 'no, I don't like that one'"". She eventually got to Toby - after player Toby Faletau - which they both liked. Donna did not tell her English husband how she'd come up with the name until weeks later. And when player Faletaulater became knownby his actual Tongan name Taulupe, Donna joked: ""We thought should we update our child's name?"" Richard Jones, a university lecturer from Salford, said he and his wife had an ""exhaustive list"" of criteria for naming his first daughter. ""We were really keen to have a name that was unusual, but not wacky. We didn't want one that there was going to be a whole class full of them. We also didn't want to go for a made-up one."" The couple ruled out anything in the top 100 most popular names list and, because he is Scottish and his wife is Welsh, wanted the name to originate from either of those places. Richard Jones with daughters Gwendolen (Gwen), nine, and Callista (Callie), five It needed to be easily shortened, both the short and long names had to work with both the single and double-barrelled versions of their surname and it couldn't start with the same initial as the mum or dad. ""But apart from that we didn't really think too much about it,"" he joked. They were happy with their choice of Gwendolen - Gwen for short - because it's unique but a ""name that everyone knows"". Meanwhile, within the Sikh tradition parents have part of the name decided for them. During a naming ceremony, the Sikh holy scripture - the Guru Granth Sahib - is randomly opened. On whatever page it falls, the first letter of the first word of that passage will be the first letter of the baby's name. Hunter and Aurora in top 100 baby names Is Muhammad the most popular boys' name? In terms of the name itself, the UK's rules on baby names are among the most liberal in the world. According to the General Register Office, there are no restrictions on parents in the UK when naming their child - except for in exceptional cases, such as a name which could be deemed offensive, when an official could refuse to register it. But that does not mean anything can be allowed. In 2016,a mother in Powys was bannedfrom naming her baby daughter Cyanide - a type of poison which Adolf Hitler took before shooting himself. In that case, Lady Justice King said the courts would intervene to prevent a parent naming a child ""in only the most extreme cases"". Denmarkis known for its strictest naming laws, which was set up to protect the country's cultural heritage from odder name choices and spellings. Parentshave a list of names,externalfrom which they must choose - or seek permission from the government and local church. Unisex names are also not allowed and each name on the list is assigned to a gender. This video can not be played With the arrival of another royal baby due in the UK, Reality Check takes a look at baby naming rules around the world Meanwhile, inGermany, the parents' chosen name must also indicate the gender - and needs to be approved by the registry office, the Standesamt, in the area of the birth. In theUS, parents are mostly free to name their child whatever they like - although there are restrictions which depend on the state. Some states have limits on how long the name can be, or ban the use of numbers or obscenities. More recently, so-called ""baby name consultants""have reportedly cropped up,,externaloffering help to find a name. InEgypt, a naming ceremony is held seven days after the baby is born, with three candles - each representing a name- set alight. The one that burns the longest is the winning name. Joe Little, managing editor of Majesty magazine, said the couple had a lot more freedom than the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, because of a ""bit more distance between this new baby and the throne"". Speaking before the name was announced, Mr Little said: ""William and Catherine, when naming their baby, were aware their first born was destined to be king one day. ""Harry, as time goes on, will move from being sixth in line to much further down so the likelihood of many of his offspring on the throne will become more and more remote. ""One thing to bear in mind, this child is still going to be quite high profile. He will never lead a totally private life, so convention still needs to be adhered to but to a lesser degree.""

"The victims of the attack clockwise - Chrissy Archibald, Sebastien Belanger, Kirsty Boden, Ignacio Echeverria, Sara Zelenak, Xavier Thomas, Alexandre Pigeard, James McMullan One of the London Bridge attackers was seen washing his knife and wiping it on his beard shortly after eight people were killed, an inquest has heard. Khuram Butt, 27, was caught on CCTV cleaning his 12in pink ceramic knife inside the Black and Blue restaurant. In the same footage, an accomplice, Youssef Zaghba, 22, was seen having a drink from behind the bar. The inquest also heard two victims might still be alive if barriers had been put up after a similar attack. Khuram Butt, Youssef Zaghba and Rachid Redouane were shot dead by police after they drove a van into pedestrians, stabbed others, and confronted unarmed police officers shouting ""Allahu Akbar"" on 3 June 2017. Counsel for the coroner Jonathan Hough QC had warned the families of the victims at the inquest at the Old Bailey that ""distressing images"" would be shown and that Butt's reaction was ""the most chilling"". The inquest was also shown footage of diner Roy Larner,dubbed the Lion of London Bridge,being savagely stabbed in the stomach. Mr Larner appeared not to react after he was stabbed twice in quick succession before he stood up and ran away. In other footage, the third attacker, Rachid Redouane, 30, was shown on CCTV bending down to tie his shoelaces in the street during the attack through Borough Market. Redouane was also seen, in other images, talking to an unidentified man and then walking away without attacking him, for reasons that are not known. Mr Hough said: ""There is clearly some form of discussion. We don't know what was said. Despite appeals for witnesses, he [the man in the footage] never came forward."" In the space of three minutes, the attackers had struck Xavier Thomas, 45, and Christine Archibald, 30, with a van on the bridge then fatally stabbed Alexandre Pigeard, 26, Sara Zelenak, 21, Kirsty Boden, 28, Sebastien Belanger, 36, James McMullan, 32, and Ignacio Echeverria, 39, around Borough Market. Within 10 minutes, the attackers, who injured 48 more people, had been shot dead by police marksmen. In the CCTV, pedestrians were seen running for their lives as the attackers' van mounted the pavement on the bridge. An image of the van used by the attackers The inquest also heard that two victims of the attack, Christine Archibald, 30, and Xavier Thomas, 45, might still be alive if barriers had been put up following the Westminster Bridge attack, which took place two months earlier. The pair were among 10 people struck by a 2.5-ton hire van driven by Zaghba. Mr Thomas was knocked into the Thames and found dead three days later, while Ms Archibald died after being dragged under the wheels of the powerful vehicle. Gareth Patterson, QC, representing some victims, questioned a senior officer about why no barriers were put in place on London Bridge following the earlier attack in Westminster. He said: ""There were no barriers in place on that pavement protecting pedestrians from traffic on that road. ""If there had been barriers Christine Archibald and Xavier Thomas would now be with us today."" Senior investigating officer Det Supt Rebecca Riggs agreed, saying: ""That may well be the case."" The court heard barriers were put up on London Bridge within two days of the attack. Earlier, the inquest heard armed officers kept shooting at the attackers even after gunning them down, fearing they were wearing explosive vests. Det Supt Rebecca Riggs said police withdrew but had to fire extra shots when they saw the men were ""still moving"". ""They believed they were going to activate the explosive devices they were wearing and they fired a number of shots,"" she said. Neil McLelland, who was looking out of the window of the nearby Wheatsheaf pub, was hit in the head by a bullet and fell to the ground, while five other people were injured by shrapnel from the shooting. The court heard the officers then put ""themselves in harm's way"" to evacuate the pub, taking Mr McLelland and others to safety. Mr McLelland survived his injuries. The armed officers who killed the knifemen have not been named at the inquest The second day of the inquest was also told one victim was killed after he tried to beat the attackers with his skateboard. Det Supt Riggs said Spaniard Ignacio Echeverria, 39, had been cycling with friends when he came across PC Wayne Marques and PC Charlie Guenigault trying to tackle the knifemen. The officers had stepped in to help Oliver Downing and Marie Bondeville, who had been hurt by the trio. Mr Echeverria, an HSBC financial crime analyst, ran across to help and swung his board at one of the killers but was knocked to the ground by Redouane, the inquest was told. Ignacio Echeverria was the last of eight people to be killed in the attack Det Supt Riggs said: ""Ignacio got off his bike and ran across to where the two officers were to assist [them]."" ""He had taken his board from his rucksack and swung at the attackers and managed to hit them. [Rachid] Redouane retaliated, causing him to fall on the ground,"" she added. ""The attackers then set upon him on the ground."" Counsel to the coroner Jonathan Hough QC added: ""It was a brief but furious assault."" BBC reporter Marie Jackson, at the inquest Over several hours, the inquest watched the horrific attack unfold from every angle, second by second, from cameras on buildings, in restaurants, in taxis and buses, on police body-cams and the public's mobile phones. The hearing gasped as the attackers' van was shown careering over London Bridge, knocking over pedestrians like skittles. One camera captured Tyler Ferguson running to the side of his fiancÃ©e, Chrissy Archibald, as she lay dying in the middle of the road. Other footage showed the attackers striding side-by-side through Borough Market, indiscriminately stabbing anyone in their path. Their victims are filmed bleeding in the street, clutching their faces, heads and chests. In the Black and Blue restaurant, the men stabbed customers with their knives before ducking behind the bar to swig some water from a tap. On their way out, they picked up a couple of bottles, smashed them on the side of a table - another weapon. On Thursday, the hearing is due to hear from an eyewitness, Christine Delcros, whose partner Xavier Thomas was knocked off the bridge and into the Thames by the attackers' van. Earlier, Ms Delcros wept in court as CCTV footage showed the French couple walking hand in hand towards the bridge, their final moments together. In a touching moment, Julie Wallace, the bereaved mother of Sara Zelenak, crossed the courtroom to take a seat beside Ms Delcros to comfort her. The inquest continues.

"King Charles III has stepped back from royal duties while he is treated for cancer. His elder son Prince William - along with other senior royals - will take on some of his engagements. Find out more about the Royal Family and the line of succession below. Born: 1948 Charles has been King since his mother Elizabeth II died on 8 September 2022. The now former Prince of Wales married Lady Diana Spencer, who became the Princess of Wales, on 29 July 1981. The couple had two sons, William and Harry. They later separated and their marriage was dissolved in 1996. On 31 August 1997, the princess was killed in a car crash in Paris. He married Camilla Parker Bowles on 9 April 2005. When Charles became King, she became Queen Consort, as per the wishes of the late queen. Following the coronation she is now known as Queen Camilla. King Charles III, the new monarch Camilla, the new Queen Consort Complete guide to King Charles III's Coronation Born: 1982 Prince William is the elder son of King Charles III and Diana, Princess of Wales, and is nowfirst in line to the throne. He was 15 when his mother died. He went on to study at the University of St Andrews, where he met his future wife, Kate Middleton. The couple were married in 2011. On his 21st birthday he was appointed a Counsellor of State - standing in for the late queen on official occasions. He and his wife had their first child, George, in July 2013, their second, Charlotte, in 2015 and third, Louis, in 2018. The prince trained with the Army, Royal Navy and RAF before spending three years as an RAF search-and-rescue pilot with RAF Valley on Anglesey, north Wales. He also worked part-time for two years as a co-pilot with the East Anglian Air Ambulance alongside his royal duties. He left the role in July 2017 to take on more royal duties on behalf of his grandparents. William inherited the Duchy of Cornwall estate from his father and is now the Prince of Wales. Catherine is now the Princess of Wales. As heir to the throne, his main duties are to support the King in his royal commitments. Born: 2013 George Alexander Louis was born on 22 July 2013 at St Mary's Hospital in London. His father was present for the birth of his son, who weighed 8lb 6oz (3.8kg). Prince George of Wales, as he is formally known, issecond in line to the throne, after his father. Born: 2015 Catherine, Princess of Wales gave birth to her second child, Charlotte Elizabeth Diana, on 2 May 2015, again at St Mary's Hospital. William was present for the birth of the 8lb 3oz (3.7kg) baby. She isthird in line to the throne,after her father and older brother, and is known as Her Royal Highness Princess Charlotte of Wales. Born: 2018 The new Princess of Wales gave birth to her third child, a boy weighing 8lbs 7oz, on 23 April 2018, at St Mary's Hospital in London. William was present for the birth of Louis Arthur Charles, who isfourth in line to the throne. Born: 1984 Prince Harry trained at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and went on to become a lieutenant in the Army, serving as a helicopter pilot. During his 10 years in the armed forces, Capt Wales, as he became known, saw active service in Afghanistan twice, in 2012 to 2013 as an Apache helicopter co-pilot and gunner. He left the Army in 2015 and now focuses on charitable work, including conservation in Africa and organising the Invictus Games for injured members of the armed forces. He has been a Counsellor of State since his 21st birthday and stood in for the late queen on official duties. He married US actress Meghan Markle on 19 May 2018, at Windsor Castle. In January 2020, the royal couple said they would step back as ""senior"" royals and divide their time between the UK and North America. They said they intended to ""work to become financially independent"". Just over a year later, Buckingham Palace confirmed the couple would not be returning to royal duties, and would give up their honorary military appointments and royal patronages. Born: 2019 The Sussexes' first child, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, was born on 6 May 2019, weighing 7lbs 3oz, with the duke present for his birth. Archie was not automatically a prince when he was born because he was not a grandson of the monarch. But he gained the right to that title when King Charles acceded to the throne. Harry and Meghan are understood to want their children to decide for themselves whether or not to use their titles when they are older. Born: 2021 The Duchess of Sussex gave birth to her second child in Santa Barbara, California, on 4 June 2021. Lilibet Diana Mountbatten-Windsor - to be known as Lili - is named after the Royal Family's nickname for the late queen. She was given the middle name Diana in honour of Prince Harry's mother, who died in a car crash in 1997 when he was 12 years old. Like her brother, she gained the right to use the royal title when her grandfather became king. Born: 1960 Prince Andrew,eighth in line to the throne,was the third child of Elizabeth II and Prince Philip - but the first to be born to a reigning monarch for 103 years. He was created the Duke of York on his marriage to Sarah Ferguson, who became Duchess of York, in 1986. They had two daughters - Beatrice, in 1988, and Eugenie, in 1990. In March 1992 it was announced the duke and duchess were to separate. They divorced in 1996. The duke served for 22 years in the Royal Navy and saw active service in the Falklands War in 1982. In addition to royal engagements, he served as a special trade representative for the government until 2011. Prince Andrew stepped away from royal duties in 2019 after an interview with the BBC about his relationship with US financier Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking and conspiracy charges. In February 2022, the dukeagreed to pay an undisclosed sum to settle a civil sexual assault case brought against himin the US by one of Epstein's victims, although he made no admission of liability and had repeatedly denied the allegations. Born: 1988 Princess Beatrice is the elder daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York. Her full title is Her Royal Highness Princess Beatrice. She married property tycoonEdoardo Mapelli Mozziat The Royal Chapel of All Saints at Royal Lodge, Windsor, in July 2020. The couple had been due to marry in May, but coronavirus delayed the plans. Born: 2021 Princess Beatrice had a baby girl, Sienna Elizabeth, in September 2021, who is10th in line to the throne. Princess Beatrice is also stepmother to Mr Mapelli Mozzi's son Christopher Woolf, known as Wolfie, from his previous relationship with Dara Huang. Complete guide to the King's coronation 360Â° video: Explore inside Westminster Abbey Born: 1990 Princess Eugenie is the younger daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York. Her full title is Her Royal Highness Princess Eugenie and she is11th in line to the throne. Like her sister Princess Beatrice, she has no official surname, but uses York. She married her long-term boyfriend Jack Brooksbank at Windsor Castle on 12 October 2018. Born: 2021 Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank's son, August, born on 9 February 2021. Born: 2023 Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank's second son was born on 30 May 2023. It is the first royal birth since the coronation of King Charles, Eugenie's uncle. Ernest is13th in line to the throne, moving the Duke of Edinburgh down to 14th place. Born: 1964 Prince Edward was given the title Duke of Edinburgh on his 59th birthday, almost two years after the death of his father Prince Philip, who previously held the title. It was understood that Philip had wanted Edward to take on the title, but the decision was left to King Charles. Prince Edward's wife Sophie becomes the Duchess of Edinburgh and the prince's former title, the Earl of Wessex, has now been given to his son James, Viscount Severn. The couple also have a daughter, Lady Louise, born in 2003. After a brief period with the Royal Marines, the prince formed his own TV production company. He subsequently supported the late queen in her official duties and carried out public engagements for charities. He is14th in line to the throne. Born: 2007 James, Earl of Wessex is the younger child of the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh. He was given the title after his father Prince Edward became the Duke of Edinburgh in March 2023. When James was born, he was given the title Viscount Severn - a ""courtesy"" title as son of an earl, rather than using prince. It is thought his parents made this decision to avoid some of the burdens of royal titles. Born: 2003 Born in 2003, Lady Louise Windsor is the elder child of the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh. However, she is lower in the line of succession than her younger brother because she was born before a law came into force scrapping the system that meant a younger son could displace an older daughter. Born: 1950 Anne, Princess Royal is Elizabeth II and Prince Philip's second child and only daughter. When she was born she was third in line to the throne, but is now17th. She was given the title Princess Royal in June 1987. Princess Anne has married twice; her first husband Captain Mark Phillips is the father of her two children, Peter and Zara, while her second is Vice-Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence. The princess was the first royal to use the surname Mountbatten-Windsor in an official document, in the marriage register after her wedding to Capt Phillips. She competed in equestrian events for Great Britain in the 1976 Montreal Olympics and is involved with a number of charities, including Save the Children, of which she has been president since 1970. Born: 1977 Peter Phillips is the eldest of the late queen's grandchildren. He married Canadian Autumn Kelly in 2008 and together they have two daughters, Savannah, born in 2010, and Isla, born in 2012. The children of the Princess Royal do not have royal titles, as they are descended from the female line. Mark Phillips refused the offer of an earldom when he married so their children do not have courtesy titles. Peter Phillips and his wife announced they were getting divorced in February 2020. Born: 2010 Savannah, born in 2010, is the elder daughter of Peter Phillips and Autumn Kelly and was the late queen's first great-grandchild. Born: 2012 Isla, born in 2012, is the second daughter of Peter Phillips and Autumn Kelly.

"This video can not be played ""This will help so many allergy sufferers,"" said Tanya Ednan-Laperouse Food outlets should list all ingredients in order to protect customers with allergies, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) has proposed. The FSA has recommended ministers adopt strict new rules, which include highlighting the 14 major allergens. The proposals followthe death in 2016 of Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, who had eaten a sandwich from Pret a Manger. Pret a Manger said it supported the FSA's recommendations. The government said it welcomed the agency's input, adding: ""We are working at pace to bring forward legislation that ensures food allergy suffers can feel safe and secure."" FSA chairwoman Heather Hancock said the FSA had chosen the strictest of the options they had under discussion because ""ultimately this is a life-threatening issue for a proportion of the population"". Does your dinner come from a 'dark kitchen'? Food allergy alert service begins in Scotland How safe is chlorine-washed chicken? However she acknowledged that there was a risk that business might find the new rules onerous and might consider not serving people with allergies altogether. ""We are balancing consumer protection, public health protection, with the ability of people being able to deliver good business service and choice for people with an allergy or intolerance,"" she said. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs will have the final say over whether new rules are introduced. The FSA board discussed several options, ranging from light-touch intervention of promoting best practice in the food industry to requiring firms to list the 14 most common allergens. Supermarket sandwich:already has to list full ingredients including allergens Over-the-counter sandwich:if it's made to order in front of you, it doesn't currently need a label. This will not change under the new plans. Pre-prepared sandwich:if it is made on the premises, it doesn't currently need a label, just a sign nearby prompting customers to ask about allergens. But if these recommendations are adopted, any sandwich that is wrapped and picked from a shelf will need to carry a label listing all ingredients, and highlighting major allergens If ministers choose to proceed with the recommendation, food outlets will be required to provide a full list of ingredients on each product, highlighting nuts, eggs and dairy and other products that are frequent allergens. However sandwich shops that make up food at the point of sale will not have to provide the labelling, since it is assumed a conversation will take place between staff and customer. They will still need to display signage, telling the customer to ask for allergen information if they need it. Ms Hancock said businesses had voiced objections to the proposal, saying it would push up costs. She said the intention was to provide the food industry with the time to implement the changes, and to provide support for smaller businesses. While the new policy would improve customers' trust in the food they were buying, the FSA admitted it would also introduce a risk of ""mislabelling incidents, particularly in busy kitchen environments"". The FSA said it might also lead to businesses removing some foods from their menus and limiting changes to menus to avoid the costs of extra labelling. The proposed changes follow the death of Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, who had an allergy to sesame seeds and died after eating a sandwich from Pret a Manger. Natasha's family has welcomed the FSA's recommendations Natasha's parents, Nadim and Tanya Ednan-Laperouse described the FSA's recommendation to introduce stricter labelling as ""a momentous decision"". ""Business must always listen to its consumers particularly in matters of life and death. ""It is now for government ministers to implement legislation to save lives. We are now one step nearer to making Natasha's Law a reality. A label saves a life."" Ms Hancock said it was impossible to eliminate risk entirely and that food safety relied on a ""layering up"" of protection, by providing labelling, staff training and customers taking personal responsibility. Michelle Victor from law firm Leigh Day, who is representing Mr and Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, said: ""Business should now embrace change and work on how they are going to implement full ingredient labelling. ""We encourage the government to follow these recommendations from the FSA and implement Natasha's Law this year."" A Pret A Manger spokesperson said: ""After careful piloting, we have begun our nationwide roll-out of full ingredient labels on all our freshly made products, which will be complete this summer.

"The bell was donated to St Catharine's College by a former student in 1960 A Cambridge University college has removed a historic bell from view amid fears it has links to the slave trade. The Demerara Bell was donated to St Catharine's College by a former student who went on to work for a sugar company in British Guiana. In April, the university announced a two-year investigation into its own historical links with slavery. A spokesperson for St Catharine's College said the bell ""most likely"" came from a slave plantation. As reported in the Daily Telegraph,external, archived articles from the college magazine, St Catharine's College Society, state that the 18th Century bell was donated by industrialist Edward Goodland with the inscription ""De Catherina 1772"" two years after his arrival in British Guiana in 1958. It was initially hung in a belfry outside the Porter's lodge but was moved in 1994 to an accommodation block. The Demerara bell at St Catharine's College has been removed from view The university has appointed an advisory group, chaired by Prof Martin Millett and based in the Centre of African Studies, which will examine the institution's archives to establish whether it benefitted financially from the slave trade. ""It is only right that Cambridge should look into its own exposure to the profits of coerced labour,"" said vice-chancellor Stephen Toope. A spokesperson for the college said: ""As part of the ongoing reflection taking place about the links between universities and slavery, we are aware that a bell currently located at the College most likely came from a slave plantation. ""A more detailed investigation is underway into the bell's provenance as part of a wider project researching the College's historical links to the slave trade."" Cambridge investigates its slavery links Senior tutor Dr Miranda Griffin said: ""It is important that the college, along with the rest of the collegiate university, acknowledges historical links to slavery and the slave trade. ""As an academic community, we will continue to conduct rigorous research into all aspects of our past and to reflect on our commitment to diversity, inclusion and asking challenging questions.""

"The US has been ratcheting up the pressure on Iran over the past year Iran has suspended commitments under the 2015 international nuclear deal, a year after it was abandoned by the US. President Hassan Rouhani said he would keep enriched uranium stocks in the country rather than sell them abroad. He also threatened to resume production of more-highly-enriched uranium in 60 days if other signatories did not act to protect Iran from US sanctions. The 2015 accord was aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear ambitions in return for relief from sanctions. But since the US left the deal it has imposed new sanctions, hitting Iran's economy and raising Iran-US tensions. Battle for the fate of the Iran deal begins Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words Iran informed the remaining parties to the deal - France, Germany, Russia, China and the UK - of its decision on Wednesday morning. Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said Iran was acting within its rights under the deal and it was up to the three European powers to act. Allow Twitter content?

Under the deal Iran is required to sell its surplus enriched uranium abroad, rather than keep it. Iran nuclear deal - all you need to know How reinstated sanctions have hit Iranians Is it about to become more expensive to fill my car? This is important as the material, which is a by-product of Iran's civilian nuclear power generation, can be used in the manufacture of nuclear weapons. By selling it abroad, Iran can continue to generate nuclear power and the parties to the agreement can be sure it is not building nuclear weapons. The US has recently been increasing pressure on Iran Iran's announcement comes after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made an unscheduled visit to Iraq, and a US aircraft carrier was deployed to the Gulf region. US officials have reported threats to US forces and their allies from Iran, but have given few details about the exact nature of the threat. Mr Rouhani said he was suspending two parts of the deal, which is known asthe Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA),external, that Iran was adhering to - the sale of surplus enriched uranium and heavy water. He then gave the European powers, Russia and China 60 days to meet their financial and oil commitments to the deal. If they did so, Iran would resume the sales. If, however, those commitments were not met and the powers chose to follow US sanctions, he said Iran would begin higher enrichment of uranium, which is currently capped, and begin developing its Arak heavy water reactor based on plans made prior to the deal. But Iran's president added: ""We do not want to leave the agreement. All the people of the world should know that today is not the end of the JCPOA; it is a new step within the framework of the JCPOA."" However, he said the five powers would face a ""very decisive reaction"" if Iran's nuclear case was referred to the UN Security Council. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov quickly urged all of the remaining parties to the deal to fulfil their obligations. Both Russia and China have blamed Washington's withdrawal from the deal for the current situation. A spokesman for UK PM Theresa May said the deal was ""crucial"" and that Britain would ensure it remained in place as long as Iran upheld its commitments. Foreign Office minister Mark Field told parliament Iran's move was an ""unwelcome step"". French Defence Minister Florence Parly told French media that the European powers were doing everything they could to keep the deal alive but there would be consequences and possibly sanctions if the deal was not adhered to. Germany remained ""fully committed"" to its pledges on the deal if Iran reciprocated, a German foreign ministry spokesman said. Iran is seeking to strike a difficult balance: pushing back against some of the restrictions imposed by the JCPOA, while not doing so much as to withdraw from it altogether. This is an alarm signal but also a warning. Iran is facing growing pain from re-imposed US sanctions. It wants the Europeans to take urgent practical steps to provide some relief. And if relief does not come, then Iran may well have to re-consider its overall adherence to the JCPOA - which the US abandoned a year ago. This presents the Europeans with a huge dilemma. They are caught between the Iranians and the Trump administration. Can they continue to back the agreement if Iran is not fully complying with its terms? The US is likely to insist that there can be no middle way. Iran is either honouring the terms of the JCPOA or it is not. Read more from Jonathan In January,the UK, Germany and France set up a new payments mechanismto allow businesses to trade with Iran without being subject to sanctions. The three countries opposed last year's decision by President Donald Trump to abandon the deal. The system, known as Instex, is supposed to focus on ""legitimate trade"" in goods ""where the immediate need of the Iranian people is greatest"", for example food, pharmaceutical products and consumer goods not subject to sanctions. Oil, Iran's main source of foreign exchange, is at the moment not covered, and it is thought so far that the payment system has done little to soften the impact of sanctions. Iran now wants the Europeans to give the system more bite. The landmark nuclear deal was thrown into flux when President Trump announced the US withdrawal one year ago. The value of Iran's currency has since been pushed to record lows, its annual inflation rate quadrupled and foreign investment driven away. Despite this, Iran has upheld its commitments to the deal, according to inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Tensions between the US and Iran can be traced back to Iran's Islamic Revolution in 1979, which overthrew the pro-Western Shah and established a radical anti-US regime in its place. President Trump has taken a particularly hard line towards Iran since he took office in 2016. His administration wants to renegotiate the nuclear deal and widen its scope so that it also curbs Iran's ballistic missile programme and ""malign"" activities in the Middle East. Why has Trump been so harsh on Iran? Donald Trump had campaigned against the Iran nuclear deal long before he even took office The US has recently raised the pressure on Iran, with two significant moves in April: It ended exemptions from sanctions for five of Iran's main customers still buying oil, including China, India and Turkey It blacklisted Iran's elite Islamic Revolution Guard Corps, designating it a foreign terrorist group And earlier this week, National Security Adviser John Bolton saidthe US was deploying an aircraft carrier to the Middle Eastfollowing a number of ""troubling and escalatory indications and warnings"" from Iran.

"This video can not be played Sir Graham Brady: ""No public clarity"" on Theresa May's departure date The PM has rejected calls to quit over her handling of Brexit, saying it is ""not an issue about me"". Theresa May was replying to Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns, who said she had ""failed to deliver on her promises"" and had lost public trust. Calls have been growing for the prime minister to name an exit date. The PM's spokesman said she had already promised to leave after delivering the first stage of Brexit and was sticking to that ""generous and bold offer"". Mrs May has agreed to address a meeting of the 1922 Committee - an elected body of Tory MPs which represents backbenchers and oversees leadership contests - next week. Its chairman, Sir Graham Brady, told the BBC he had had two ""very good meetings"" with the PM, organised to raise concerns about her leadership. Watch: What does the 1922 Committee do? May meets senior Tory amid calls to resign A really simple guide to the European elections He said it was clear she ""wishes and is determined to do her best to secure our departure [from the EU]"", but the 1922's executive would have the opportunity after next week's meeting ""to decide if the assurances they have had [from her] are sufficient or not"". This video can not be played Andrea Jenkyns says Theresa May should make way for a new leader Sir Graham also said he believed the PM would ask the Commons to vote again on the terms of the UK's exit before elections to the European Parliament take place on 23 May. The withdrawal agreement has effectively been rejected by MPs three times already. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says the prime minister has bought herself a bit more time.

In March, Mrs May pledged to stand down if and when Parliament ratified her Brexit withdrawal agreement, but she has not made it clear how long she intends to stay if no deal is reached. Pressure has grown on her sincethe Tories' local election drubbing last week,and there have been warnings they face a meltdown in elections to the European Parliament too. At Prime Minister's Questions, Mrs May said she was ""very sorry"" that so many councillors - 1,300, in fact - lost their seats. But she told Ms Jenkyns the resolution to the Brexit crisis was ""not an issue about me or her"" - and if it was up to the prime minister, the UK would have already left the EU. Much of the anger in the parliamentary party is focusing on Mrs May's efforts to find a Brexit compromise with Labour. Further pressure is also coming from the grassroots, with local Tory associations confirmingthey will hold a vote of confidencein her leadership on 15 June. Analysis:By BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake Sometimes it can seem like Theresa May is surrounded by an invisible force field, deflecting blows from all directions. Political flaming asteroids which might've seen off a prime minister in simpler times lie smouldering on the floor as she doggedly pushes on. A failed snap election, no confidence votes, defeat after defeat in Parliament have all left her standing somehow. But that survival is down in no small part to factors beyond her control; nobody wanting to inherit the mess, Tories terrified of losing power to Labour, and a party increasingly ill at ease with itself. But if something shifts then her time and her luck may run out. A candidate to replace her could decide it's now or never, her own MPs may run out of patience entirely or the European election results may simply be too bad to bear. Holding her hands up and walking away would not be in Theresa May's nature, but just as events have shaped her survival, they may yet lead to her demise. The 1922 has previously rejected calls to re-write its rulesto bring forward another confidence vote in the PM's leadership, meaning that at the moment, the earliest it can happen is in mid-December. Brexit: A really simple guide Why the UK couldn't avoid the European elections Eurosceptic Conservative MP Peter Bone said ""the majority"" of Tory MPs ""acknowledge she needs to go and needs to go soon"". Tory Brexiteer Sheryll Murraytweeted,externalthat she believed the PM ""should resign immediately"". Former minister Robert Halfon said Mrs May had to set out a ""proper timetable"" for departure, but it had to be done in a ""dignified way"". Some Conservatives, though, think she should be allowed to stay until the autumn, if necessary, to deliver the UK's exit from the EU. Mel Stride, financial secretary to the Treasury, said: ""At end of the day - if you change the pilot, you are not going to change the weather."" Discussions with Labour could still yield a way forward, he said - although as yet, the talks have not borne fruit. Negotiations finished on Wednesday without an agreement between the two sides, but Downing Street said there will be more talks ""over the coming days"". Conservative MPs have already begun to voice their intentions to stand in a Tory leadership contest once Mrs May leaves,including new International Development Secretary Rory Stewart. Cabinet minister Andrea Leadsom is the latest to indicate an interest, saying she is ""seriously considering"" standing for a second time - she ran in 2016, but pulled out to give Mrs May a clear run at the job. The beauty contest to be next Tory leader The UK had been due to leave the EU on 29 March, but the deadline was pushed back to 31 October after Parliament was unable to agree a way forward. No confidence vote of Tory MPs:Theresa May won a leadership ballot by 200 to 117 votes on 12 December 2018. Under current party rules, there can't be another vote for a further year so the PM is technically safe until 12 December this year. Many MPs want to change the rules to allow an earlier contest but this would need to be agreed by the 1922 Committee. No confidence vote in Parliament:The PM would have to resign if she lost a confidence vote in Parliament. Labour tried this manoeuvre in December but Tory MPs and their DUP allies backed the PM. Might some Tories now withhold their support if they think it will usher in a new leader rather than a general election? Grassroots Tory revolt:Local Conservative associations seem to be turning against the PM, with one - Clwyd South - already passing a motion of no confidence in her. The National Conservative Convention's vote on 15 June is non-binding, though, so the PM could ignore it. Cabinet revolt:Margaret Thatcher quit in 1990 after a number of ministers told her it was time to go. Could history repeat itself? There has been no sign of that so far and colleagues who want to succeed her - and there are many - may not want to be seen to be the ones wielding the knife or to risk sacrificing their own careers.

"This video can not be played ""This will help so many allergy sufferers,"" said Tanya Ednan-Laperouse Food outlets should list all ingredients in order to protect customers with allergies, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) has proposed. The FSA has recommended ministers adopt strict new rules, which include highlighting the 14 major allergens. The proposals followthe death in 2016 of Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, who had eaten a sandwich from Pret a Manger. Pret a Manger said it supported the FSA's recommendations. The government said it welcomed the agency's input, adding: ""We are working at pace to bring forward legislation that ensures food allergy suffers can feel safe and secure."" FSA chairwoman Heather Hancock said the FSA had chosen the strictest of the options they had under discussion because ""ultimately this is a life-threatening issue for a proportion of the population"". Does your dinner come from a 'dark kitchen'? Food allergy alert service begins in Scotland How safe is chlorine-washed chicken? However she acknowledged that there was a risk that business might find the new rules onerous and might consider not serving people with allergies altogether. ""We are balancing consumer protection, public health protection, with the ability of people being able to deliver good business service and choice for people with an allergy or intolerance,"" she said. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs will have the final say over whether new rules are introduced. The FSA board discussed several options, ranging from light-touch intervention of promoting best practice in the food industry to requiring firms to list the 14 most common allergens. Supermarket sandwich:already has to list full ingredients including allergens Over-the-counter sandwich:if it's made to order in front of you, it doesn't currently need a label. This will not change under the new plans. Pre-prepared sandwich:if it is made on the premises, it doesn't currently need a label, just a sign nearby prompting customers to ask about allergens. But if these recommendations are adopted, any sandwich that is wrapped and picked from a shelf will need to carry a label listing all ingredients, and highlighting major allergens If ministers choose to proceed with the recommendation, food outlets will be required to provide a full list of ingredients on each product, highlighting nuts, eggs and dairy and other products that are frequent allergens. However sandwich shops that make up food at the point of sale will not have to provide the labelling, since it is assumed a conversation will take place between staff and customer. They will still need to display signage, telling the customer to ask for allergen information if they need it. Ms Hancock said businesses had voiced objections to the proposal, saying it would push up costs. She said the intention was to provide the food industry with the time to implement the changes, and to provide support for smaller businesses. While the new policy would improve customers' trust in the food they were buying, the FSA admitted it would also introduce a risk of ""mislabelling incidents, particularly in busy kitchen environments"". The FSA said it might also lead to businesses removing some foods from their menus and limiting changes to menus to avoid the costs of extra labelling. The proposed changes follow the death of Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, who had an allergy to sesame seeds and died after eating a sandwich from Pret a Manger. Natasha's family has welcomed the FSA's recommendations Natasha's parents, Nadim and Tanya Ednan-Laperouse described the FSA's recommendation to introduce stricter labelling as ""a momentous decision"". ""Business must always listen to its consumers particularly in matters of life and death. ""It is now for government ministers to implement legislation to save lives. We are now one step nearer to making Natasha's Law a reality. A label saves a life."" Ms Hancock said it was impossible to eliminate risk entirely and that food safety relied on a ""layering up"" of protection, by providing labelling, staff training and customers taking personal responsibility. Michelle Victor from law firm Leigh Day, who is representing Mr and Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, said: ""Business should now embrace change and work on how they are going to implement full ingredient labelling. ""We encourage the government to follow these recommendations from the FSA and implement Natasha's Law this year."" A Pret A Manger spokesperson said: ""After careful piloting, we have begun our nationwide roll-out of full ingredient labels on all our freshly made products, which will be complete this summer. ""It hasn't been an easy transition for our business so we remain committed to sharing what we have learnt so far with government, regulators and industry.""

"The US has been ratcheting up the pressure on Iran over the past year Iran has suspended commitments under the 2015 international nuclear deal, a year after it was abandoned by the US. President Hassan Rouhani said he would keep enriched uranium stocks in the country rather than sell them abroad. He also threatened to resume production of more-highly-enriched uranium in 60 days if other signatories did not act to protect Iran from US sanctions. The 2015 accord was aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear ambitions in return for relief from sanctions. But since the US left the deal it has imposed new sanctions, hitting Iran's economy and raising Iran-US tensions. Battle for the fate of the Iran deal begins Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words Iran informed the remaining parties to the deal - France, Germany, Russia, China and the UK - of its decision on Wednesday morning. Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said Iran was acting within its rights under the deal and it was up to the three European powers to act. Allow Twitter content?

Under the deal Iran is required to sell its surplus enriched uranium abroad, rather than keep it. Iran nuclear deal - all you need to know How reinstated sanctions have hit Iranians Is it about to become more expensive to fill my car? This is important as the material, which is a by-product of Iran's civilian nuclear power generation, can be used in the manufacture of nuclear weapons. By selling it abroad, Iran can continue to generate nuclear power and the parties to the agreement can be sure it is not building nuclear weapons. The US has recently been increasing pressure on Iran Iran's announcement comes after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made an unscheduled visit to Iraq, and a US aircraft carrier was deployed to the Gulf region. US officials have reported threats to US forces and their allies from Iran, but have given few details about the exact nature of the threat. Mr Rouhani said he was suspending two parts of the deal, which is known asthe Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA),external, that Iran was adhering to - the sale of surplus enriched uranium and heavy water. He then gave the European powers, Russia and China 60 days to meet their financial and oil commitments to the deal. If they did so, Iran would resume the sales. If, however, those commitments were not met and the powers chose to follow US sanctions, he said Iran would begin higher enrichment of uranium, which is currently capped, and begin developing its Arak heavy water reactor based on plans made prior to the deal. But Iran's president added: ""We do not want to leave the agreement. All the people of the world should know that today is not the end of the JCPOA; it is a new step within the framework of the JCPOA."" However, he said the five powers would face a ""very decisive reaction"" if Iran's nuclear case was referred to the UN Security Council. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov quickly urged all of the remaining parties to the deal to fulfil their obligations. Both Russia and China have blamed Washington's withdrawal from the deal for the current situation. A spokesman for UK PM Theresa May said the deal was ""crucial"" and that Britain would ensure it remained in place as long as Iran upheld its commitments. Foreign Office minister Mark Field told parliament Iran's move was an ""unwelcome step"". French Defence Minister Florence Parly told French media that the European powers were doing everything they could to keep the deal alive but there would be consequences and possibly sanctions if the deal was not adhered to. Germany remained ""fully committed"" to its pledges on the deal if Iran reciprocated, a German foreign ministry spokesman said. Iran is seeking to strike a difficult balance: pushing back against some of the restrictions imposed by the JCPOA, while not doing so much as to withdraw from it altogether. This is an alarm signal but also a warning. Iran is facing growing pain from re-imposed US sanctions. It wants the Europeans to take urgent practical steps to provide some relief. And if relief does not come, then Iran may well have to re-consider its overall adherence to the JCPOA - which the US abandoned a year ago. This presents the Europeans with a huge dilemma. They are caught between the Iranians and the Trump administration. Can they continue to back the agreement if Iran is not fully complying with its terms? The US is likely to insist that there can be no middle way. Iran is either honouring the terms of the JCPOA or it is not. Read more from Jonathan In January,the UK, Germany and France set up a new payments mechanismto allow businesses to trade with Iran without being subject to sanctions. The three countries opposed last year's decision by President Donald Trump to abandon the deal. The system, known as Instex, is supposed to focus on ""legitimate trade"" in goods ""where the immediate need of the Iranian people is greatest"", for example food, pharmaceutical products and consumer goods not subject to sanctions. Oil, Iran's main source of foreign exchange, is at the moment not covered, and it is thought so far that the payment system has done little to soften the impact of sanctions. Iran now wants the Europeans to give the system more bite. The landmark nuclear deal was thrown into flux when President Trump announced the US withdrawal one year ago. The value of Iran's currency has since been pushed to record lows, its annual inflation rate quadrupled and foreign investment driven away. Despite this, Iran has upheld its commitments to the deal, according to inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Tensions between the US and Iran can be traced back to Iran's Islamic Revolution in 1979, which overthrew the pro-Western Shah and established a radical anti-US regime in its place. President Trump has taken a particularly hard line towards Iran since he took office in 2016. His administration wants to renegotiate the nuclear deal and widen its scope so that it also curbs Iran's ballistic missile programme and ""malign"" activities in the Middle East. Why has Trump been so harsh on Iran? Donald Trump had campaigned against the Iran nuclear deal long before he even took office The US has recently raised the pressure on Iran, with two significant moves in April: It ended exemptions from sanctions for five of Iran's main customers still buying oil, including China, India and Turkey It blacklisted Iran's elite Islamic Revolution Guard Corps, designating it a foreign terrorist group And earlier this week, National Security Adviser John Bolton saidthe US was deploying an aircraft carrier to the Middle Eastfollowing a number of ""troubling and escalatory indications and warnings"" from Iran.

"The victims of the attack clockwise - Chrissy Archibald, Sebastien Belanger, Kirsty Boden, Ignacio Echeverria, Sara Zelenak, Xavier Thomas, Alexandre Pigeard, James McMullan One of the London Bridge attackers was seen washing his knife and wiping it on his beard shortly after eight people were killed, an inquest has heard. Khuram Butt, 27, was caught on CCTV cleaning his 12in pink ceramic knife inside the Black and Blue restaurant. In the same footage, an accomplice, Youssef Zaghba, 22, was seen having a drink from behind the bar. The inquest also heard two victims might still be alive if barriers had been put up after a similar attack. Khuram Butt, Youssef Zaghba and Rachid Redouane were shot dead by police after they drove a van into pedestrians, stabbed others, and confronted unarmed police officers shouting ""Allahu Akbar"" on 3 June 2017. Counsel for the coroner Jonathan Hough QC had warned the families of the victims at the inquest at the Old Bailey that ""distressing images"" would be shown and that Butt's reaction was ""the most chilling"". The inquest was also shown footage of diner Roy Larner,dubbed the Lion of London Bridge,being savagely stabbed in the stomach. Mr Larner appeared not to react after he was stabbed twice in quick succession before he stood up and ran away. In other footage, the third attacker, Rachid Redouane, 30, was shown on CCTV bending down to tie his shoelaces in the street during the attack through Borough Market. Redouane was also seen, in other images, talking to an unidentified man and then walking away without attacking him, for reasons that are not known. Mr Hough said: ""There is clearly some form of discussion. We don't know what was said. Despite appeals for witnesses, he [the man in the footage] never came forward."" In the space of three minutes, the attackers had struck Xavier Thomas, 45, and Christine Archibald, 30, with a van on the bridge then fatally stabbed Alexandre Pigeard, 26, Sara Zelenak, 21, Kirsty Boden, 28, Sebastien Belanger, 36, James McMullan, 32, and Ignacio Echeverria, 39, around Borough Market. Within 10 minutes, the attackers, who injured 48 more people, had been shot dead by police marksmen. In the CCTV, pedestrians were seen running for their lives as the attackers' van mounted the pavement on the bridge. An image of the van used by the attackers The inquest also heard that two victims of the attack, Christine Archibald, 30, and Xavier Thomas, 45, might still be alive if barriers had been put up following the Westminster Bridge attack, which took place two months earlier. The pair were among 10 people struck by a 2.5-ton hire van driven by Zaghba. Mr Thomas was knocked into the Thames and found dead three days later, while Ms Archibald died after being dragged under the wheels of the powerful vehicle. Gareth Patterson, QC, representing some victims, questioned a senior officer about why no barriers were put in place on London Bridge following the earlier attack in Westminster. He said: ""There were no barriers in place on that pavement protecting pedestrians from traffic on that road. ""If there had been barriers Christine Archibald and Xavier Thomas would now be with us today."" Senior investigating officer Det Supt Rebecca Riggs agreed, saying: ""That may well be the case."" The court heard barriers were put up on London Bridge within two days of the attack. Earlier, the inquest heard armed officers kept shooting at the attackers even after gunning them down, fearing they were wearing explosive vests. Det Supt Rebecca Riggs said police withdrew but had to fire extra shots when they saw the men were ""still moving"". ""They believed they were going to activate the explosive devices they were wearing and they fired a number of shots,"" she said. Neil McLelland, who was looking out of the window of the nearby Wheatsheaf pub, was hit in the head by a bullet and fell to the ground, while five other people were injured by shrapnel from the shooting. The court heard the officers then put ""themselves in harm's way"" to evacuate the pub, taking Mr McLelland and others to safety. Mr McLelland survived his injuries. The armed officers who killed the knifemen have not been named at the inquest The second day of the inquest was also told one victim was killed after he tried to beat the attackers with his skateboard. Det Supt Riggs said Spaniard Ignacio Echeverria, 39, had been cycling with friends when he came across PC Wayne Marques and PC Charlie Guenigault trying to tackle the knifemen. The officers had stepped in to help Oliver Downing and Marie Bondeville, who had been hurt by the trio. Mr Echeverria, an HSBC financial crime analyst, ran across to help and swung his board at one of the killers but was knocked to the ground by Redouane, the inquest was told. Ignacio Echeverria was the last of eight people to be killed in the attack Det Supt Riggs said: ""Ignacio got off his bike and ran across to where the two officers were to assist [them]."" ""He had taken his board from his rucksack and swung at the attackers and managed to hit them. [Rachid] Redouane retaliated, causing him to fall on the ground,"" she added. ""The attackers then set upon him on the ground."" Counsel to the coroner Jonathan Hough QC added: ""It was a brief but furious assault."" BBC reporter Marie Jackson, at the inquest Over several hours, the inquest watched the horrific attack unfold from every angle, second by second, from cameras on buildings, in restaurants, in taxis and buses, on police body-cams and the public's mobile phones. The hearing gasped as the attackers' van was shown careering over London Bridge, knocking over pedestrians like skittles. One camera captured Tyler Ferguson running to the side of his fiancÃ©e, Chrissy Archibald, as she lay dying in the middle of the road. Other footage showed the attackers striding side-by-side through Borough Market, indiscriminately stabbing anyone in their path. Their victims are filmed bleeding in the street, clutching their faces, heads and chests. In the Black and Blue restaurant, the men stabbed customers with their knives before ducking behind the bar to swig some water from a tap. On their way out, they picked up a couple of bottles, smashed them on the side of a table - another weapon. On Thursday, the hearing is due to hear from an eyewitness, Christine Delcros, whose partner Xavier Thomas was knocked off the bridge and into the Thames by the attackers' van. Earlier, Ms Delcros wept in court as CCTV footage showed the French couple walking hand in hand towards the bridge, their final moments together. In a touching moment, Julie Wallace, the bereaved mother of Sara Zelenak, crossed the courtroom to take a seat beside Ms Delcros to comfort her. The inquest continues.

"The victims of the attack clockwise - Chrissy Archibald, Sebastien Belanger, Kirsty Boden, Ignacio Echeverria, Sara Zelenak, Xavier Thomas, Alexandre Pigeard, James McMullan One of the London Bridge attackers was seen washing his knife and wiping it on his beard shortly after eight people were killed, an inquest has heard. Khuram Butt, 27, was caught on CCTV cleaning his 12in pink ceramic knife inside the Black and Blue restaurant. In the same footage, an accomplice, Youssef Zaghba, 22, was seen having a drink from behind the bar. The inquest also heard two victims might still be alive if barriers had been put up after a similar attack. Khuram Butt, Youssef Zaghba and Rachid Redouane were shot dead by police after they drove a van into pedestrians, stabbed others, and confronted unarmed police officers shouting ""Allahu Akbar"" on 3 June 2017. Counsel for the coroner Jonathan Hough QC had warned the families of the victims at the inquest at the Old Bailey that ""distressing images"" would be shown and that Butt's reaction was ""the most chilling"". The inquest was also shown footage of diner Roy Larner,dubbed the Lion of London Bridge,being savagely stabbed in the stomach. Mr Larner appeared not to react after he was stabbed twice in quick succession before he stood up and ran away. In other footage, the third attacker, Rachid Redouane, 30, was shown on CCTV bending down to tie his shoelaces in the street during the attack through Borough Market. Redouane was also seen, in other images, talking to an unidentified man and then walking away without attacking him, for reasons that are not known. Mr Hough said: ""There is clearly some form of discussion. We don't know what was said. Despite appeals for witnesses, he [the man in the footage] never came forward."" In the space of three minutes, the attackers had struck Xavier Thomas, 45, and Christine Archibald, 30, with a van on the bridge then fatally stabbed Alexandre Pigeard, 26, Sara Zelenak, 21, Kirsty Boden, 28, Sebastien Belanger, 36, James McMullan, 32, and Ignacio Echeverria, 39, around Borough Market. Within 10 minutes, the attackers, who injured 48 more people, had been shot dead by police marksmen. In the CCTV, pedestrians were seen running for their lives as the attackers' van mounted the pavement on the bridge. An image of the van used by the attackers The inquest also heard that two victims of the attack, Christine Archibald, 30, and Xavier Thomas, 45, might still be alive if barriers had been put up following the Westminster Bridge attack, which took place two months earlier. The pair were among 10 people struck by a 2.5-ton hire van driven by Zaghba. Mr Thomas was knocked into the Thames and found dead three days later, while Ms Archibald died after being dragged under the wheels of the powerful vehicle. Gareth Patterson, QC, representing some victims, questioned a senior officer about why no barriers were put in place on London Bridge following the earlier attack in Westminster. He said: ""There were no barriers in place on that pavement protecting pedestrians from traffic on that road. ""If there had been barriers Christine Archibald and Xavier Thomas would now be with us today."" Senior investigating officer Det Supt Rebecca Riggs agreed, saying: ""That may well be the case."" The court heard barriers were put up on London Bridge within two days of the attack. Earlier, the inquest heard armed officers kept shooting at the attackers even after gunning them down, fearing they were wearing explosive vests. Det Supt Rebecca Riggs said police withdrew but had to fire extra shots when they saw the men were ""still moving"". ""They believed they were going to activate the explosive devices they were wearing and they fired a number of shots,"" she said. Neil McLelland, who was looking out of the window of the nearby Wheatsheaf pub, was hit in the head by a bullet and fell to the ground, while five other people were injured by shrapnel from the shooting. The court heard the officers then put ""themselves in harm's way"" to evacuate the pub, taking Mr McLelland and others to safety. Mr McLelland survived his injuries. The armed officers who killed the knifemen have not been named at the inquest The second day of the inquest was also told one victim was killed after he tried to beat the attackers with his skateboard. Det Supt Riggs said Spaniard Ignacio Echeverria, 39, had been cycling with friends when he came across PC Wayne Marques and PC Charlie Guenigault trying to tackle the knifemen. The officers had stepped in to help Oliver Downing and Marie Bondeville, who had been hurt by the trio. Mr Echeverria, an HSBC financial crime analyst, ran across to help and swung his board at one of the killers but was knocked to the ground by Redouane, the inquest was told. Ignacio Echeverria was the last of eight people to be killed in the attack Det Supt Riggs said: ""Ignacio got off his bike and ran across to where the two officers were to assist [them]."" ""He had taken his board from his rucksack and swung at the attackers and managed to hit them. [Rachid] Redouane retaliated, causing him to fall on the ground,"" she added. ""The attackers then set upon him on the ground."" Counsel to the coroner Jonathan Hough QC added: ""It was a brief but furious assault."" BBC reporter Marie Jackson, at the inquest Over several hours, the inquest watched the horrific attack unfold from every angle, second by second, from cameras on buildings, in restaurants, in taxis and buses, on police body-cams and the public's mobile phones. The hearing gasped as the attackers' van was shown careering over London Bridge, knocking over pedestrians like skittles. One camera captured Tyler Ferguson running to the side of his fiancÃ©e, Chrissy Archibald, as she lay dying in the middle of the road. Other footage showed the attackers striding side-by-side through Borough Market, indiscriminately stabbing anyone in their path. Their victims are filmed bleeding in the street, clutching their faces, heads and chests. In the Black and Blue restaurant, the men stabbed customers with their knives before ducking behind the bar to swig some water from a tap. On their way out, they picked up a couple of bottles, smashed them on the side of a table - another weapon. On Thursday, the hearing is due to hear from an eyewitness, Christine Delcros, whose partner Xavier Thomas was knocked off the bridge and into the Thames by the attackers' van. Earlier, Ms Delcros wept in court as CCTV footage showed the French couple walking hand in hand towards the bridge, their final moments together. In a touching moment, Julie Wallace, the bereaved mother of Sara Zelenak, crossed the courtroom to take a seat beside Ms Delcros to comfort her. The inquest continues.

"This video can not be played Sir Graham Brady: ""No public clarity"" on Theresa May's departure date The PM has rejected calls to quit over her handling of Brexit, saying it is ""not an issue about me"". Theresa May was replying to Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns, who said she had ""failed to deliver on her promises"" and had lost public trust. Calls have been growing for the prime minister to name an exit date. The PM's spokesman said she had already promised to leave after delivering the first stage of Brexit and was sticking to that ""generous and bold offer"". Mrs May has agreed to address a meeting of the 1922 Committee - an elected body of Tory MPs which represents backbenchers and oversees leadership contests - next week. Its chairman, Sir Graham Brady, told the BBC he had had two ""very good meetings"" with the PM, organised to raise concerns about her leadership. Watch: What does the 1922 Committee do? May meets senior Tory amid calls to resign A really simple guide to the European elections He said it was clear she ""wishes and is determined to do her best to secure our departure [from the EU]"", but the 1922's executive would have the opportunity after next week's meeting ""to decide if the assurances they have had [from her] are sufficient or not"". This video can not be played Andrea Jenkyns says Theresa May should make way for a new leader Sir Graham also said he believed the PM would ask the Commons to vote again on the terms of the UK's exit before elections to the European Parliament take place on 23 May. The withdrawal agreement has effectively been rejected by MPs three times already. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says the prime minister has bought herself a bit more time.

In March, Mrs May pledged to stand down if and when Parliament ratified her Brexit withdrawal agreement, but she has not made it clear how long she intends to stay if no deal is reached. Pressure has grown on her sincethe Tories' local election drubbing last week,and there have been warnings they face a meltdown in elections to the European Parliament too. At Prime Minister's Questions, Mrs May said she was ""very sorry"" that so many councillors - 1,300, in fact - lost their seats. But she told Ms Jenkyns the resolution to the Brexit crisis was ""not an issue about me or her"" - and if it was up to the prime minister, the UK would have already left the EU. Much of the anger in the parliamentary party is focusing on Mrs May's efforts to find a Brexit compromise with Labour. Further pressure is also coming from the grassroots, with local Tory associations confirmingthey will hold a vote of confidencein her leadership on 15 June. Analysis:By BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake Sometimes it can seem like Theresa May is surrounded by an invisible force field, deflecting blows from all directions. Political flaming asteroids which might've seen off a prime minister in simpler times lie smouldering on the floor as she doggedly pushes on. A failed snap election, no confidence votes, defeat after defeat in Parliament have all left her standing somehow. But that survival is down in no small part to factors beyond her control; nobody wanting to inherit the mess, Tories terrified of losing power to Labour, and a party increasingly ill at ease with itself. But if something shifts then her time and her luck may run out. A candidate to replace her could decide it's now or never, her own MPs may run out of patience entirely or the European election results may simply be too bad to bear. Holding her hands up and walking away would not be in Theresa May's nature, but just as events have shaped her survival, they may yet lead to her demise. The 1922 has previously rejected calls to re-write its rulesto bring forward another confidence vote in the PM's leadership, meaning that at the moment, the earliest it can happen is in mid-December. Brexit: A really simple guide Why the UK couldn't avoid the European elections Eurosceptic Conservative MP Peter Bone said ""the majority"" of Tory MPs ""acknowledge she needs to go and needs to go soon"". Tory Brexiteer Sheryll Murraytweeted,externalthat she believed the PM ""should resign immediately"". Former minister Robert Halfon said Mrs May had to set out a ""proper timetable"" for departure, but it had to be done in a ""dignified way"". Some Conservatives, though, think she should be allowed to stay until the autumn, if necessary, to deliver the UK's exit from the EU. Mel Stride, financial secretary to the Treasury, said: ""At end of the day - if you change the pilot, you are not going to change the weather."" Discussions with Labour could still yield a way forward, he said - although as yet, the talks have not borne fruit. Negotiations finished on Wednesday without an agreement between the two sides, but Downing Street said there will be more talks ""over the coming days"". Conservative MPs have already begun to voice their intentions to stand in a Tory leadership contest once Mrs May leaves,including new International Development Secretary Rory Stewart. Cabinet minister Andrea Leadsom is the latest to indicate an interest, saying she is ""seriously considering"" standing for a second time - she ran in 2016, but pulled out to give Mrs May a clear run at the job. The beauty contest to be next Tory leader The UK had been due to leave the EU on 29 March, but the deadline was pushed back to 31 October after Parliament was unable to agree a way forward. No confidence vote of Tory MPs:Theresa May won a leadership ballot by 200 to 117 votes on 12 December 2018. Under current party rules, there can't be another vote for a further year so the PM is technically safe until 12 December this year. Many MPs want to change the rules to allow an earlier contest but this would need to be agreed by the 1922 Committee. No confidence vote in Parliament:The PM would have to resign if she lost a confidence vote in Parliament. Labour tried this manoeuvre in December but Tory MPs and their DUP allies backed the PM. Might some Tories now withhold their support if they think it will usher in a new leader rather than a general election? Grassroots Tory revolt:Local Conservative associations seem to be turning against the PM, with one - Clwyd South - already passing a motion of no confidence in her. The National Conservative Convention's vote on 15 June is non-binding, though, so the PM could ignore it. Cabinet revolt:Margaret Thatcher quit in 1990 after a number of ministers told her it was time to go. Could history repeat itself? There has been no sign of that so far and colleagues who want to succeed her - and there are many - may not want to be seen to be the ones wielding the knife or to risk sacrificing their own careers.

"This video can not be played ""This will help so many allergy sufferers,"" said Tanya Ednan-Laperouse Food outlets should list all ingredients in order to protect customers with allergies, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) has proposed. The FSA has recommended ministers adopt strict new rules, which include highlighting the 14 major allergens. The proposals followthe death in 2016 of Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, who had eaten a sandwich from Pret a Manger. Pret a Manger said it supported the FSA's recommendations. The government said it welcomed the agency's input, adding: ""We are working at pace to bring forward legislation that ensures food allergy suffers can feel safe and secure."" FSA chairwoman Heather Hancock said the FSA had chosen the strictest of the options they had under discussion because ""ultimately this is a life-threatening issue for a proportion of the population"". Does your dinner come from a 'dark kitchen'? Food allergy alert service begins in Scotland How safe is chlorine-washed chicken? However she acknowledged that there was a risk that business might find the new rules onerous and might consider not serving people with allergies altogether. ""We are balancing consumer protection, public health protection, with the ability of people being able to deliver good business service and choice for people with an allergy or intolerance,"" she said. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs will have the final say over whether new rules are introduced. The FSA board discussed several options, ranging from light-touch intervention of promoting best practice in the food industry to requiring firms to list the 14 most common allergens. Supermarket sandwich:already has to list full ingredients including allergens Over-the-counter sandwich:if it's made to order in front of you, it doesn't currently need a label. This will not change under the new plans. Pre-prepared sandwich:if it is made on the premises, it doesn't currently need a label, just a sign nearby prompting customers to ask about allergens. But if these recommendations are adopted, any sandwich that is wrapped and picked from a shelf will need to carry a label listing all ingredients, and highlighting major allergens If ministers choose to proceed with the recommendation, food outlets will be required to provide a full list of ingredients on each product, highlighting nuts, eggs and dairy and other products that are frequent allergens. However sandwich shops that make up food at the point of sale will not have to provide the labelling, since it is assumed a conversation will take place between staff and customer. They will still need to display signage, telling the customer to ask for allergen information if they need it. Ms Hancock said businesses had voiced objections to the proposal, saying it would push up costs. She said the intention was to provide the food industry with the time to implement the changes, and to provide support for smaller businesses. While the new policy would improve customers' trust in the food they were buying, the FSA admitted it would also introduce a risk of ""mislabelling incidents, particularly in busy kitchen environments"". The FSA said it might also lead to businesses removing some foods from their menus and limiting changes to menus to avoid the costs of extra labelling. The proposed changes follow the death of Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, who had an allergy to sesame seeds and died after eating a sandwich from Pret a Manger. Natasha's family has welcomed the FSA's recommendations Natasha's parents, Nadim and Tanya Ednan-Laperouse described the FSA's recommendation to introduce stricter labelling as ""a momentous decision"". ""Business must always listen to its consumers particularly in matters of life and death. ""It is now for government ministers to implement legislation to save lives. We are now one step nearer to making Natasha's Law a reality. A label saves a life."" Ms Hancock said it was impossible to eliminate risk entirely and that food safety relied on a ""layering up"" of protection, by providing labelling, staff training and customers taking personal responsibility. Michelle Victor from law firm Leigh Day, who is representing Mr and Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, said: ""Business should now embrace change and work on how they are going to implement full ingredient labelling. ""We encourage the government to follow these recommendations from the FSA and implement Natasha's Law this year."" A Pret A Manger spokesperson said: ""After careful piloting, we have begun our nationwide roll-out of full ingredient labels on all our freshly made products, which will be complete this summer. ""It hasn't been an easy transition for our business so we remain committed to sharing what we have learnt so far with government, regulators and industry.""

"This video can not be played Falklands veteran left isolated by navy axe A Falklands veteran forced out of the Royal Navy over his sexuality plans to sue for the return of military honours. Joe Ousalice, 68, served for nearly 18 years but was discharged in 1993 when there was a ban on LGBT people serving in the armed forces. His lawyers want other military personnel who were dismissed over their sexuality to have lost medals returned. The MoD said it would be ""inappropriate"" to comment as legal proceedings are ongoing. A spokesperson added: ""We are currently looking at how personnel discharged from service because of their sexuality, or now abolished sexual offences, can have their medals returned."" Mr Ousalice's lawyer Emma Norton says the MoD has made similar statements in the past. Mr Ousalice is a former radio operator who now lives in Southampton. He served in the Falklands War in which he lost two comrades, did six tours of duty in Northern Ireland and was also posted to conflict zones in the Middle East. ""I loved life in the navy, because of the comradeship,"" he said. ""It was my life."" His work was praised by his seniors and he was awarded a Long Service and Good Conduct medal in 1991. But he knew when he joined up that he had to hide the fact that he was bisexual. ""It was a double life I was living. I was watching every day what I was saying, what I was doing."" He says that when ashore he never visited gay pubs and on board ship he didn't associate with sailors who he knew were gay. ""I knew if I did I would have the SIB (Special Investigation Branch) on my back doing covert operations, shadowing me with cameras, taking photographs of what I was getting up to."" Mr Ousalice says he would never visit gay pubs as he feared investigators would track him But throughout his career he felt the SIB was monitoring his behaviour and he says he was regularly questioned by investigators. While ashore in 1992, he was arrested by civilian police and charged with gross indecency with another man. He pleaded not guilty but was convicted. He lost an appeal but his sentence was reduced to a conditional discharge. Battling to be Bi Soon afterwards he was accused by the navy of indecently assaulting another sailor. ""It wasn't true,"" he said. ""The navy had interviewed me several times about my sexuality and they could never get shut of me."" At a court martial he was cleared of the assault charge but was found guilty of being in bed with the other sailor - something he has always denied. He says he was also forced to disclose his sexuality. He was dismissed on the grounds that his conduct was prejudicial to good order and naval discipline. An officer wrote: ""He may attempt to corrupt others in the future"", adding that ""the needs of the service must come first"". Mr Ousalice's medal and three Good Conduct Badges were taken from him. Joe Ousalice (on right) receiving a medal ""After the court martial was completed a guy came in with a pair of scissors and said 'sorry mate, I need your medal' and just cut the medal off me. ""The fact that I had been to the Middle East, to the Falklands, to Northern Ireland six times means a lot to me and that medal is proof to me that I was good enough for all those years and yet somebody can just come and take it away from you."" He was allowed to keep his medals from the Falklands and Northern Ireland. Mr Ousalice had hoped that the lifting of the ban on LGBT people in the armed forces in 2000 would help him in his long battle to have his medal returned. Down the years he has appealed to politicians of both main parties without success. Now, human rights organisation Liberty has taken on his case and plans to sue the MoD. The group argues that Mr Ousalice was discharged ""entirely because of his sexuality"" and it is calling on the MoD to apologise. Emma Norton, its head of legal casework, argues that the MoD's actions infringed Mr Ousalice's human rights.

"This video can not be played Prince Harry held their two-day-old son The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have named their newborn son Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor. Introducing him to the cameras earlier in the day, Meghan said: ""He has the sweetest temperament, he's really calm. He's been the dream."" As they laughed, Prince Harry said: ""I don't know who he gets that from."" The announcement came after the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh met their eighth and newest great-grandchild for the first time at Windsor Castle. By deciding to call their son Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, Harry and Meghan have chosen not to use a title for their first born. As the first born son of a duke, Archie could have become Earl of Dumbarton - one of Harry's subsidiary titles - or have been Lord Archie Mountbatten-Windsor, but instead he will simply be Master Archie Mountbatten-Windsor. The meaning behind Archie Harrison How do you decide on a baby name? BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said it was a ""strong indication that they don't want to bring him up as a formal 'royal'"". Talking about their first few days as parents, Meghan said: ""It's magic, it's pretty amazing. I have the two best guys in the world so I'm really happy."" The duke added: ""It's great. Parenting is amazing. ""It's only been two and a half days, three days, but we're just so thrilled to have our own little bundle of joy."" On which parent the baby resembled more, Harry said: ""Everyone says that babies change so much over two weeks. ""We're basically monitoring how the changing process happens over this next month really. But his looks are changing every single day, so who knows."" In pictures: A look back at Meghan's pregnancy Royal Family tree and line of succession Privacy, publicity and the royal baby Later, asked to show more of their son's face to the cameras, Meghan laughed as Harry joked: ""He's already got a little bit of facial hair as well, wonderful."" Meghan added: ""Thank you everybody for all the well-wishes and kindness, it just means so much."" A surprise choice, Archie was not among the bookmakers' favourites of Alexander, Arthur and Albert. ""I don't think anyone of us saw either of these names coming,"" says Joe Little, managing editor of Majesty royal magazine. As far as he is aware, Archie does not have any British royal connotations - and Harrison too is a totally new name for the Royal Family. Archie means ""genuine"", ""bold"" or ""brave"" - and is more popular in Britain than the US. It was originally a shortened form of Archibald but is now often used as a name on its own. Read more about the baby's name here. Pictures of the new family's first photocall were then shared on the SussexRoyal Instagram account. ""The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are delighted to share their first public moment as a family,"" the post said. The images shared on social media were taken by Chris Allerton, who was the couple's private wedding party photographer, and took the picture of the newlyweds watching fireworks in the grounds of Frogmore House at their evening reception. The infant, who is seventh in line to the throne, was delivered at 05:26 BST on Monday, with Harry saying after the birth that he and Meghan were ""absolutely thrilled"". The Duke of Cambridge has welcomed his brother to ""the sleep deprivation society that is parenting"". Prince William - a father-of-three - said he looked forward to seeing the new parents ""when things have quietened down"". The Prince of Wales has also expressed his joy at the birth. During an official visit to Germany with the Duchess of Cornwall, Prince Charles said: ""We couldn't be more delighted at the news and we're looking forward to meeting the baby when we return."" A statement added that Meghan's mother, Doria Ragland, was ""overjoyed at the arrival of her first grandchild"" and was with her daughter at Frogmore Cottage - the new parents' home on the Windsor Estate. By BBC News correspondent Helena Wilkinson As settings for first family photographs go this was rather more grand than most, to say the least - St. George's Hall in Windsor Castle is a room used for state banquets. But for Meghan and Harry it is a special room already filled with memories - it was where they held their wedding reception last year. Today they created new ones. Wrapped in a white shawl and hat, baby Sussex was oblivious to it all, sleeping soundly in his father's arms. As soon as the pictures of the newborn emerged news crews outside the castle beamed them live across the world. This two-day baby may only be seventh in line to the throne but interest in him is huge. Something his parents, who guard their privacy closely, will be very aware of. Buckingham Palace said Harry was present for the birth, which is understood to have taken place in hospital as opposed to at home. The baby will not automatically become a prince - although he could get that title if the Queen steps in. Harry and Meghan might otherwise want him to inherit one of Harry's titles, such as Earl of Dumbarton,or they could reject any royal title at all. This video can not be played Prince Harry says he and Meghan are ""absolutely thrilled"" The baby weighed 7lbs 3oz (3.2kg), making him lighter than each of his cousins. Prince George was 8lb 6oz (3.8kg) when he was born in July 2013. His sister Princess Charlotte was 8lbs 3oz (3.7kg) when she arrived in May 2015, while their younger brother Prince Louis weighed 8lb 7oz (3.8kg) when he was born in April last year.

"The Barnard Castle-based Teesdale Mercury was founded in 1854 A newspaper has addressed its ""awful"" reporting of a woman's suicide more than 100 years ago. A Teesdale Mercury reader complained to the paper after finding a report in a 1912 edition on the death of 16-year-old parlour maid Dorothy Balchin. The old report called her suicide notes ""pathetic"", with an inquest jury finding her ""temporarily insane"". Editor Trevor Brookes said ""pathetic"" had a different meaning at the time, but it was good attitudes had changed. ""We agree that this is an awful way to report a tragic death of a young woman,"" Brookes said. But he said it would ""inappropriate"" to publish an apology so many years later, adding: ""We must be careful not to judge the past with today's morals but instead learn from what happened."" The report was published in the Teesdale Mercury in 1912 ""We should be thankful attitudes have changed, and mental health, depression and suicide get the attention they so thoroughly deserve, and there are strict guidelines issued to modern media."" Suicide-prevention charitySamaritans advises,externaltoday's media not to include details of method of suicide in reports, but the 1912 press cutting includes such information. The report detailed how Ms Balchin killed herself on her employer's tennis lawn at Albury near Guildford, Surrey. It included details of suicide notes she had written which the report called ""pathetic"". ""Pathetic is the adjective of pathos meaning emotion and it was once used very differently to how it is used today,"" said Brookes. The Teesdale Mercury is a weekly-newspaper based in Barnard Castle, County Durham. Brookes said the report was part of a ""syndicated section"" of the paper, meaning it would have appeared in similar titles across the country.

A statement added that Meghan's mother, Doria Ragland, was ""overjoyed at the arrival of her first grandchild"" and was with her daughter at Frogmore Cottage - the new parents' home on the Windsor Estate. By BBC News correspondent Helena Wilkinson As settings for first family photographs go this was rather more grand than most, to say the least - St. George's Hall in Windsor Castle is a room used for state banquets. But for Meghan and Harry it is a special room already filled with memories - it was where they held their wedding reception last year. Today they created new ones. Wrapped in a white shawl and hat, baby Sussex was oblivious to it all, sleeping soundly in his father's arms. As soon as the pictures of the newborn emerged news crews outside the castle beamed them live across the world. This two-day baby may only be seventh in line to the throne but interest in him is huge. Something his parents, who guard their privacy closely, will be very aware of. Buckingham Palace said Harry was present for the birth, which is understood to have taken place in hospital as opposed to at home. The baby will not automatically become a prince - although he could get that title if the Queen steps in. Harry and Meghan might otherwise want him to inherit one of Harry's titles, such as Earl of Dumbarton,or they could reject any royal title at all. This video can not be played Prince Harry says he and Meghan are ""absolutely thrilled"" The baby weighed 7lbs 3oz (3.2kg), making him lighter than each of his cousins. Prince George was 8lb 6oz (3.8kg) when he was born in July 2013. His sister Princess Charlotte was 8lbs 3oz (3.7kg) when she arrived in May 2015, while their younger brother Prince Louis weighed 8lb 7oz (3.8kg) when he was born in April last year.

"The planning application includes the creation of a new stillhouse at Port Ellen Whisky production could be revived at an iconic distillery on Islay for the first time in more than 35 years, under plans put forward by Diageo. The drinks giant has submitted a planning application to overhaul the Port Ellen Distillery, which closed in 1983. The proposals include restoring the distillery's original kiln building and traditional sea-front warehouses. There are also plans for a new stillhouse. The move is part of a Â£35m investment programme by Diageo to reopen Port Ellen Distillery and Brora Distillery in Sutherland, both of which closed in 1983. Port Ellen Distillery closed in 1983 The buildings at Port Ellen Distillery have undergone many changes since it first opened in 1824. In the 1930s the distillery was closed and largely demolished, before being rebuilt in the 1960s. Following its most recent closure in 1983, only a handful of the original buildings remained. The plan is for two pairs of copper pot stills and two separate distillation regimes. Two will replicate the original Port Ellen copper pot stills.  The smaller stills are to produce alternative spirit characters, and to experiment with new styles of whisky. Georgie Crawford, master distiller leading the Port Ellen project, said: ""This is another hugely significant milestone on our journey to bring Port Ellen Distillery back to life. ""This is no ordinary distillery project - we are bringing a true whisky legend back to life and we believe our plans do justice to the iconic status of Port Ellen and will capture the imagination of whisky fans from all over the world."" Last month, Diageo submitted plans to overhaul visitor facilities at two distilleries in the north of Scotland.

"The Barnard Castle-based Teesdale Mercury was founded in 1854 A newspaper has addressed its ""awful"" reporting of a woman's suicide more than 100 years ago. A Teesdale Mercury reader complained to the paper after finding a report in a 1912 edition on the death of 16-year-old parlour maid Dorothy Balchin. The old report called her suicide notes ""pathetic"", with an inquest jury finding her ""temporarily insane"". Editor Trevor Brookes said ""pathetic"" had a different meaning at the time, but it was good attitudes had changed. ""We agree that this is an awful way to report a tragic death of a young woman,"" Brookes said. But he said it would ""inappropriate"" to publish an apology so many years later, adding: ""We must be careful not to judge the past with today's morals but instead learn from what happened."" The report was published in the Teesdale Mercury in 1912 ""We should be thankful attitudes have changed, and mental health, depression and suicide get the attention they so thoroughly deserve, and there are strict guidelines issued to modern media."" Suicide-prevention charitySamaritans advises,externaltoday's media not to include details of method of suicide in reports, but the 1912 press cutting includes such information. The report detailed how Ms Balchin killed herself on her employer's tennis lawn at Albury near Guildford, Surrey. It included details of suicide notes she had written which the report called ""pathetic"". ""Pathetic is the adjective of pathos meaning emotion and it was once used very differently to how it is used today,"" said Brookes. The Teesdale Mercury is a weekly-newspaper based in Barnard Castle, County Durham. Brookes said the report was part of a ""syndicated section"" of the paper, meaning it would have appeared in similar titles across the country.

"British and Irish ministers have signed a deal to preserve the Common Travel Area after Brexit. It guarantees free movement for citizens crossing the Irish border and cross-border access for study and health care. It comes as NI's parties meet in an attempt to break the Stormont deadlock. Northern Ireland has been without devolved government for more than two-and-a-half years, after the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in split in a bitter row. A memorandum of understanding, which is not legally binding, was signed at a meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference on Wednesday. The conference was scheduled by the two governments following last month's murder ofLyra McKee, and is part of efforts to restore power-sharing in Belfast. David Lidington, who is Theresa May's de facto deputy, stressed the importance of the latest memorandum. ""It guarantees that whatever the terms of the UK's exit from the EU, there will be no change to the rights of British and Irish citizens,"" he said. New Common Travel Area treaty call Governments set out NI talks plan British and Irish ministers hold London conference Journalist shot dead during Derry riots The TÃ¡naiste Simon Coveney gave an illustration of the kind of rights the governments want to protect. ""British and Irish people will be able to travel to each others' countries, to study, to work, access social welfare, access health care and vote in each other's elections,"" he said, Some politicians argue this memorandum is insufficient as it is not a binding treaty. However the Irish government said people should be assured by the fact that the deal has been copper fastened by legislation in both countries. On Tuesday, thegovernments set out details for a fresh talks processto take place over the next few weeks. They held talks with the five main parties, the first since substantive negotiations collapsed last year. Talks got under way at Stormont on Tuesday The Common Travel Area (CTA) gives UK and Irish citizens certain reciprocal rights in each others' countries. The rights include largely unrestricted travel between each jurisdiction. It is an arrangement between the UK and Ireland which pre-dates their membership of the European Union. The memorandum will be signed by Cabinet Minister David Liddington and Tanaiste (Deputy prime minister) Simon Coveney. Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley will also be in attendance. By Enda McClafferty, BBC News NI Political Correspondent It may have been in place for more than a century but in reality it was an agreement written in sand with no real legal weight. The Common Travel Area and the rights which flowed from it for citizens crossing the border, survived because of an arrangement between London and Dublin built on trust. Brexit threatened that trust and exposed the legal shortcoming in the arrangement. On Wednesday, ministers shored up the Common Travel Area in a Memorandum of Understanding which we are told will be Brexit-proof. But, by definition, a Memorandum of Understanding is not a legally binding document but instead signals the intention of both sides to move forward with a contract. So, what are the chances of the sands shifting? The British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference was set up through the Good Friday peace agreement, signed in 1998. It aims to promote bilateral co-operation between the British and Irish governments. Until last summer, it had not met since 2007, butnationalist parties had urged the two governments to hold it, in the absence of a breakthrough at Stormont. The conference is due to take place in Westminster Meanwhile, the first of five working groups set up to deal with outstanding issues at Stormont also met on Wednesday. The rest will begin meeting over the course of this week. The working groups are being chaired by current and former Stormont senior civil servants, with the political parties nominating three representatives to sit on each group. A source involved in the process said they were ""open-minded"" about the new talks format, and that the ""most crucial"" groups were those dealing with reform of the petition of concern, and language and culture. The governments have also announced that there will be weekly meetings of the five main parties with Mrs Bradley and Mr Coveney, to ""take stock"". Prime Minister Theresa May and Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar will review progress at the end of May.

"Northern Ireland is bucking the UK trend of falling GP numbers The number of GPs per head of population in NI is rising despite falling elsewhere in the UK, the BBC can reveal. The Nuffield Trust analysis looked at GPs working in the NHS, both full and part-time, per 100,000 people. While there are more doctors, fewer of them are choosing to work full time, said the Royal College of GPs. Recognising issues linked to an ageing population, the Department of Health said it needed to train more GPs. Currently, there are 67 per 100,000 people in Northern Ireland, meaning there are almost six more doctors per 100,000 people than there were a decade ago - in England they are down by six. County Fermanagh, Omagh and Mid Ulster have the lowest number of doctors per head of population, with a number of practices being forced to merge in order to stay open. Northern Ireland's Royal College of GPs said it required more doctors to work full time in general practice - particularly in rural areas - but acknowledged that years of lobbying for additional funding had paid off. Grainne Doran says more GPs are choosing not to work full time ""We have had an increase in the total number of GPs but unfortunately they are not all choosing to work full time in GP practices,"" said the college's chairwoman, Dr Grainne Doran. ""Instead, they are expanding their portfolios in other areas - which is great but doesn't mean we have enough GPs working in surgeries to meet the needs of a growing population. ""For instance, they are working in emergency departments perhaps one night a week, and they are also involved in hospice care, even involved in training."" GP numbers in first sustained drop for 50 years Rise in patients waiting more than a year GP practices: New services to be offered Concerns over future of GP services The nature of general practice is changing. Gone are the days when a GP worked full time from one practice. Dr Mark Cromie, who has been qualified for almost three years, works in both a rural practice in Lisnaskea, Enniskillen, and in the local hospital, as well as being involved in teaching. ""GPs want to work differently now,"" he said. ""We don't want to work on our own and isolated but instead as part of a wider team where we can bounce ideas off one another. ""We are involved in a team of physiotherapists, social workers, dermatologists, often under the one roof and that provides better care for patients."" Dr Mark Cromie enjoys the variety of work available to a rural GP Northern Ireland is struggling to get more people like Dr Cromie. Despite lobbying for additional GP training places, and securing 111, only 86 were filled this year. The Royal College of GPs admits it must now adopt a more positive tone about the profession. It has called on the Department of Health to ensure the HSC (Health and Social Care) workforce strategy analyses workforce needs and trends in general practice to ensure Northern Ireland has enough GPs. The department said Northern Ireland had the UK's most ambitious approach to delivering multi-disciplinary working in primary care. ""Every practice now has access to a practice-based pharmacist - the largest scheme of its kind in the UK, relative to population,"" said a spokesperson. Elsewhere, the NHS is seeing the first sustained fall in GP numbers per head of population for nearly 50 years. In England, the number of GPs per 100,000 people fell from 63.9 in 2014 to 58 last year. The last time numbers fell like this was in the late 1960s. From 1970 to 2010, numbers were rising as the population aged. But after 2010, the increases started tailing off, before falling in each of the last four years. The fall in GPs means the average doctor now has 125 more patients to look after than they did in 2014. The Nuffield Trust, an independent think tank, believes another 3,500 GPs would be needed to get the NHS back to where it was in 2014. There are just over 42,000 working currently, down by nearly 1,500 in four years.

"Union organiser Lydia Hughes joined Uber drivers in their strike Hundreds of Uber drivers in London, Birmingham, Nottingham and Glasgow have staged a protest against the firm. They will be joined by drivers in the US cities of New York, San Francisco, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Diego, Philadelphia and Washington DC in striking over pay and work conditions. The protests come days before the company lists its shares on the New York Stock Exchange. Uber said drivers were ""at the heart of our service"". The United Private Hire Drivers Branch of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) said the nine-hour boycott of the app would take place between 07:00 and 16:00. Union members organised a protest near Uber's London offices In the US, members of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance will strike from 07:00 to 09:00 local time. There, Uber drivers will be joined by members working for Lyft and other taxi-booking apps. Union branch co-ordinator Lydia Hughes joined Uber drivers in their strike today. ""They're going public and their founders are going to make billions off the hard work of Uber drivers who make the app run,"" she told World Service radio. Drivers ""are demanding rights, a minimum wage, holiday pay and there's no reason they don't deserve that."" Uber drivers were also protesting in New York The unions would like to cut the commission the taxi-hailing apps take. The IWGB in the UK said it would like Uber's commissions to be reduced from 25% to 15% and for fares to be increased to Â£2 a mile from about Â£1.25. The NYTWA in New York said it wanted commissions of 15% to 20% and better job security. ""I'm striking for my kid's future. I have a five-year-old son, and I drive for Uber to support him,"" said Sonam Lama, a NYTWA member and Uber driver since 2015. This video can not be played 'I was working more than 60 hours a week' An Uber spokeswoman said: ""Drivers are at the heart of our service - we can't succeed without them - and thousands of people come into work at Uber every day focused on how to make their experience better, on and off the road. ""Whether it's being able to track your earnings or stronger insurance protections, we'll continue working to improve the experience for and with drivers."" The company has argued previously that it is transparent when it comes to pay and that drivers have earned more than $78bn (Â£59.7bn) since 2015, as well as $1.2bn in tips since tipping was introduced on its software in July 2017. Uber last month warned it ""may not achieve profitability"" when it released details of its share plan listing. Uber said that its most recent annual sales rose to $11.2bn and losses narrowed to $3bn. Traffic grinds to a halt during a protest against Uber on 12 April in Buenos Aires But it also said it expected operating expenses to ""increase significantly"". The company did not disclose how it will price its shares on 9 May, but it is reportedly targeting a range of $48 to $55. That would potentially give the 10-year old firm a value of up to $100bn, making it the biggest initial public offering this year. Uber is also expected to raise about $10bn through the flotation. Last year, Uber lost an appealagainst a ruling that its drivers should be treated as workers rather than self-employed. In March, German cab drivers protested in Munich against the liberalisation of the Taxi market and Uber In 2016 a tribunal ruled drivers Mr Farrar and Yaseen Aslam were Uber staff and entitled to holiday pay, paid rest breaks and the minimum wage and the ruling was upheld by the Court of Appeal. But Uber pointed out that one of the three judges backed its case and said it would appeal to the Supreme Court.

"Talks got under way at Stormont on Tuesday The British and Irish governments have set out details of how they intend to proceed with talks to restore Northern Ireland power-sharing. In a joint statement, they said a series of working groups would be set up to deal with key sticking points. Stormont's five main party leaders will also hold weekly meetings with the NI Secretary and Tanaiste (Irish deputy PM) to ""take stock"" and set the agenda. The talks involving the NI parties and governments got under way on Tuesday. Alliance hails 'breakthrough' NI election Revolving council doors usher in new faces Election 2019: Northern Ireland results It is the first fully-fledged talks process since negotiations collapsed in February 2018. Northern Ireland has been without a devolved power-sharing government for more than two and a half years, after the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in split in a bitter row. There have been several failed talks processes since January 2017. Last month, the British and Irish governments agreed to convene a new set of talks from 7 May, that they said should be short and focused. In their statement issued after meeting the Stormont party leaders on Tuesday, they said the prime minister and taoiseach (Irish prime minister) would review progress at the end of May. The working groups will be led by, (from left): David Sterling; Paul Sweeney; Sir Malcolm McKibbin; Hugh Widdis and Sue Gray There will be a weekly round-table meeting involving party leaders and the working groups will deal with several key issues. They will be made up of three representatives from each of the five parties in the talks, and representatives from the British and Irish governments will advise them. The separate working groups will seek agreement on: Programme for government, led by the head of the NI civil service David Sterling, looking at issues around prosperity, industrial and investment strategies in a restored executive - and improving public services Reform of the petition of concern, led by Hugh Widdis, departmental solicitor and former assembly legal counsel Rights, language and identity issues led by former culture department permanent secretary, Paul Sweeney Improving the sustainability, stability and operation of the Good Friday Agreement institutions, led by ex-NI civil service boss Sir Malcolm McKibbin Transparency, accountability and the operation of the Executive led by the permanent secretary of finance, Sue Gray Several parties at Stormont have called for the reform of the petition of concern mechanism - it is effectively a Stormont veto which the DUP used to block same-sex marriage. The talks were announced by the British and Irish governmentsafter the murder of journalist Lyra McKee. At her funeral,politicians came under pressure to solve the Stormont impasse. The talks are beginning just days after council elections which saw a surge of support for smaller parties not aligned to either unionism or nationalism. Most notably, Northern Ireland's fifth largest party, Alliance, saw its number of council seats rise from 32 to 53 - an increase of 65%. The talks were announced after the murder of journalist Lyra McKee Speaking ahead of Tuesday's talks, DUP leader Arlene Foster said her party would go into the talks process to try to find a solution. She said she hoped all parties would engage with a ""willingness to look forward and not backwards"". Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald said her party was ready to get down to business. ""People know what the outstanding equality issues are and they need to be resolved and they can be,"" she said. Alliance leader Naomi Long said the new format provided a ""short window of opportunity"" for progress. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said: ""We've all committed to power sharing, we've all committed to working together and that'll take compromise, it'll take real effort."" Ulster Unionist leader Robin Swann said:  ""If today is simply window dressing, we're wasting our time and we're insulting the people of Northern Ireland."" In the local government election, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FÃ©in were again returned as the two largest parties in the council elections, but they had mixed fortunes. The DUP lost eight of its 130 seats and, although Sinn FÃ©in's seat count held steady at 105, there was a slight drop (0.8%) in the party's share of first preference votes.

"Scotland has the highest number of GPs per head of population in the UK, research commissioned by the BBC shows. Analysis by the Nuffield Trust think tank shows there are 76 GPs per 100,000 people, compared to a national UK average of 60. But Scotland's doctors have warned major challenges still exist with recruitment and retention. The Scottish government haspledged to recruit a further 800over the next decade to fill gaps. The pressures on GPs across the UK are being examined by the BBC as part of a special day of coverage, including a Panorama investigation. The UK-wide figures show there has been four consecutive years of falls with the biggest drops being seen in England. Unlike south of the border, Scottish GP numbers have stayed relatively static in recent years. This comes against a backdrop of increased patient numbers, many elderly with complex medical needs, and a fall in the number of GP practices. Latest figures also show a 8% drop in the number of GP surgeries since 2008, from 1,025 in 2008 to 944 last year. Over the same period the number of registered patients has increased by 5% to 5.7m. There are reasons why Scotland has a higher ratio of GPs to patients than other parts of the UK. One is topography - in parts of the Highlands, one GP may cover a vast area with a small number of inhabitants - and we have one of the largest island populations in Europe. Most doctors say we still face a crisis in GP recruitment and retention, with high vacancy rates and almost a third of doctors nearing retirement age. A commitment to recruit 800 family doctors by 2027 has been welcomed but even then there are worries that many of those jobs will be part-time ones and will still leave significant gaps. The move to bigger practices with advanced nurse practitioners, pharmacists, physiotherapists and even paramedics taking on new roles is part of the answer, but there are recruitment problems in these professions too. Doctors in Scotland are being offered incentives such as ""golden hello"" payments or relocation costs as part of a plan to recruit 800 GPs in a decade. The move is part of thenew GP contractagreed in 2018 but unions say there are still significant gaps in GP numbers. Dr Alasdair Forbes, of the Royal College of General Practitioners Scotland, warned that the country faces a shortfall of 856 family doctors by 2021. He said: ""Our members have told us that the current shortage of GPs is taking a toll on their wellbeing and reduces the likelihood that they will remain in general practice for the long-term. ""A commitment to increase the number of whole-time-equivalent GPs must be in tandem with the growth of the wider primary care team workforce such as nurses, pharmacists and physiotherapists. ""General practice is at the frontline of the NHS, carrying out the vast majority of patient contacts and holding clinical risk as gatekeepers to the other parts of the health service. ""By investing in general practice, the NHS will be enabled to be at its best where it is needed most, tackling many of the root causes of health inequalities and reducing the pressure on secondary care services."" Olive Watson, 93, has lived in the village of Stoneyburn all her life and can't remember a time when it didn't have a GP practice. But that changed last year when the doctors who ran the West Lothian village's health centre handed the keys back to NHS Lothian. The health board was unable to find a replacement, despite an extensive recruitment drive. For Olive, who is registered blind, and the rest of the village this means the closest practice is three miles away in Fauldhouse. ""It is murder,"" Olive told BBC Scotland. ""It is just not convenient in anyway, when you get off the bus it is a hill and a bit of a walk to get there,"" said the pensioner, who now mostly relies on taxis to get to her new GPs. ""I would like to see a doctor, even part time, put in the village here, that would be handy for me and other people like me who are elderly but also young families. ""I met a lady with two kids who spent Â£12 going up and down to the doctor with one of them who was ill. ""You feel sorry for people like that, it is a lot of money in bus fares."" Olive, who also has asthma, said the village's surgery closing down had sometimes put her off going to see a GP. She added:  ""If I am really very ill I phone for the paramedics and they are very good."" The Nuffield Trust analysis looked at the number of GPs working in the NHS per 100,000 people across the UK. It shows that during the late 1960s the numbers were falling, before four decades of almost continuous growth. A peak of 66.5 was reached in 2009, before the increases tailed off. There has now been four consecutive years of falls with the biggest drops being seen in England. A  Scottish government spokeswoman said:  ""We have a record number of GPs working in Scotland, and are committed to increasing numbers by at least 800 in the next 10 years. ""We are committed to investing Â£250m more in direct support of general practice by the end of this parliamentary period. ""The new GP contract agreed with the BMA and GPs, ensures GPs are able to spend more time with patients and less on bureaucracy, making a career in general practice even more attractive to younger doctors.""

"The US has been ratcheting up the pressure on Iran over the past year Iran has suspended commitments under the 2015 international nuclear deal, a year after it was abandoned by the US. President Hassan Rouhani said he would keep enriched uranium stocks in the country rather than sell them abroad. He also threatened to resume production of more-highly-enriched uranium in 60 days if other signatories did not act to protect Iran from US sanctions. The 2015 accord was aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear ambitions in return for relief from sanctions. But since the US left the deal it has imposed new sanctions, hitting Iran's economy and raising Iran-US tensions. Battle for the fate of the Iran deal begins Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words Iran informed the remaining parties to the deal - France, Germany, Russia, China and the UK - of its decision on Wednesday morning. Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said Iran was acting within its rights under the deal and it was up to the three European powers to act. Allow Twitter content?

Under the deal Iran is required to sell its surplus enriched uranium abroad, rather than keep it. Iran nuclear deal - all you need to know How reinstated sanctions have hit Iranians Is it about to become more expensive to fill my car? This is important as the material, which is a by-product of Iran's civilian nuclear power generation, can be used in the manufacture of nuclear weapons. By selling it abroad, Iran can continue to generate nuclear power and the parties to the agreement can be sure it is not building nuclear weapons. The US has recently been increasing pressure on Iran Iran's announcement comes after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made an unscheduled visit to Iraq, and a US aircraft carrier was deployed to the Gulf region. US officials have reported threats to US forces and their allies from Iran, but have given few details about the exact nature of the threat. Mr Rouhani said he was suspending two parts of the deal, which is known asthe Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA),external, that Iran was adhering to - the sale of surplus enriched uranium and heavy water. He then gave the European powers, Russia and China 60 days to meet their financial and oil commitments to the deal. If they did so, Iran would resume the sales. If, however, those commitments were not met and the powers chose to follow US sanctions, he said Iran would begin higher enrichment of uranium, which is currently capped, and begin developing its Arak heavy water reactor based on plans made prior to the deal. But Iran's president added: ""We do not want to leave the agreement. All the people of the world should know that today is not the end of the JCPOA; it is a new step within the framework of the JCPOA."" However, he said the five powers would face a ""very decisive reaction"" if Iran's nuclear case was referred to the UN Security Council. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov quickly urged all of the remaining parties to the deal to fulfil their obligations. Both Russia and China have blamed Washington's withdrawal from the deal for the current situation. A spokesman for UK PM Theresa May said the deal was ""crucial"" and that Britain would ensure it remained in place as long as Iran upheld its commitments. Foreign Office minister Mark Field told parliament Iran's move was an ""unwelcome step"". French Defence Minister Florence Parly told French media that the European powers were doing everything they could to keep the deal alive but there would be consequences and possibly sanctions if the deal was not adhered to. Germany remained ""fully committed"" to its pledges on the deal if Iran reciprocated, a German foreign ministry spokesman said. Iran is seeking to strike a difficult balance: pushing back against some of the restrictions imposed by the JCPOA, while not doing so much as to withdraw from it altogether. This is an alarm signal but also a warning. Iran is facing growing pain from re-imposed US sanctions. It wants the Europeans to take urgent practical steps to provide some relief. And if relief does not come, then Iran may well have to re-consider its overall adherence to the JCPOA - which the US abandoned a year ago. This presents the Europeans with a huge dilemma. They are caught between the Iranians and the Trump administration. Can they continue to back the agreement if Iran is not fully complying with its terms? The US is likely to insist that there can be no middle way. Iran is either honouring the terms of the JCPOA or it is not. Read more from Jonathan In January,the UK, Germany and France set up a new payments mechanismto allow businesses to trade with Iran without being subject to sanctions. The three countries opposed last year's decision by President Donald Trump to abandon the deal. The system, known as Instex, is supposed to focus on ""legitimate trade"" in goods ""where the immediate need of the Iranian people is greatest"", for example food, pharmaceutical products and consumer goods not subject to sanctions. Oil, Iran's main source of foreign exchange, is at the moment not covered, and it is thought so far that the payment system has done little to soften the impact of sanctions. Iran now wants the Europeans to give the system more bite. The landmark nuclear deal was thrown into flux when President Trump announced the US withdrawal one year ago. The value of Iran's currency has since been pushed to record lows, its annual inflation rate quadrupled and foreign investment driven away. Despite this, Iran has upheld its commitments to the deal, according to inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Tensions between the US and Iran can be traced back to Iran's Islamic Revolution in 1979, which overthrew the pro-Western Shah and established a radical anti-US regime in its place. President Trump has taken a particularly hard line towards Iran since he took office in 2016. His administration wants to renegotiate the nuclear deal and widen its scope so that it also curbs Iran's ballistic missile programme and ""malign"" activities in the Middle East. Why has Trump been so harsh on Iran? Donald Trump had campaigned against the Iran nuclear deal long before he even took office The US has recently raised the pressure on Iran, with two significant moves in April: It ended exemptions from sanctions for five of Iran's main customers still buying oil, including China, India and Turkey It blacklisted Iran's elite Islamic Revolution Guard Corps, designating it a foreign terrorist group And earlier this week, National Security Adviser John Bolton saidthe US was deploying an aircraft carrier to the Middle Eastfollowing a number of ""troubling and escalatory indications and warnings"" from Iran.

"It's the moment many of us dread at the end of every festival - taking down your tent and packing it up. This is perhaps one reason why more than 250,000 tents get left behind in UK fields from Glastonbury to Reading and Leeds. Now, more than 60 independent festivals are urging shops to stop marketing tents as single-use items. The Association of Independent Festivals (AIF) says some places advertise them as 'festival tents,' which gives the impression that you only need to use them once.

""I think many people believe they'll go to charities and the reality is that most won't - they will go to landfill with no other option."" This comes a year after the AIF'sDrastic On Plastic campaign,which pledges for festival sites to get rid of single-use plastic by 2021. Paul says with the climate crisis more on people's minds, urgent action needs to be taken, with the help of retailers. ""The research out there narrows it down to this - a third of abandoned tents at festivals can be traced back to major retailers like Argos and Tesco. ""I think a lot of it is to do with the marketing of these items and the implication these are festival items and only for single-use.""

"It's the moment many of us dread at the end of every festival - taking down your tent and packing it up. This is perhaps one reason why more than 250,000 tents get left behind in UK fields from Glastonbury to Reading and Leeds. Now, more than 60 independent festivals are urging shops to stop marketing tents as single-use items. The Association of Independent Festivals (AIF) says some places advertise them as 'festival tents,' which gives the impression that you only need to use them once. It says the average tent is mostly made of plastic  - which is equivalent to 8,750 straws or 250 pint cups. Jordan says his tent is the last thing on his mind after a festival ends Jordan Bellamy, 23, has gone to Reading Festival a couple of times and admits he always leaves his tent behind. ""After a whole weekend of dancing I'm so tired, and the thought of carrying the tent back was daunting as my legs were killing. ""It's quite a sad time to be honest at the end of the festival - you get the festival blues don't you? ""So at the end, we really only get our stuff together as in all our actual belongings and leave the tent."" 60 independent UK festivals have already committed to getting rid of single-use plastic at their events by 2021 Paul Reed, AIF's chief executive, says a major problem is the huge misconception about what happens to your tent. ""I think many people believe they'll go to charities and the reality is that most won't - they will go to landfill with no other option."" This comes a year after the AIF'sDrastic On Plastic campaign,which pledges for festival sites to get rid of single-use plastic by 2021. Paul says with the climate crisis more on people's minds, urgent action needs to be taken, with the help of retailers. ""The research out there narrows it down to this - a third of abandoned tents at festivals can be traced back to major retailers like Argos and Tesco. ""I think a lot of it is to do with the marketing of these items and the implication these are festival items and only for single-use."" In a statement Argos says: ""We offer a variety of tents at a range of prices. They are all sold with a bag to encourage re-use."" Tesco has yet to reply to our request for a statement. Jenny Cawthorn (L) says she and her friends had assumed discarded tents were picked up by charities Twenty-year-old Jenny Cawthorn is a regular festival goer and says it's not always easy taking a tent home. ""If it just is in a mess or it's been battered by the rain or the weather then we will just end up leaving it in the field. ""I think for a lot of people the priority is just to get home as they're feeling rough and not fussed. ""But me and my friends are trying harder now because we're all trying to make changes to help the environment."" People are being encouraged to pick up their rubbish and take their tents home For those heading to Boomtown Festival in Winchester in August, be prepared for a near zero-tolerance policy when it comes to abandoning tents. Emily Ford, the festival's sustainability coordinator, says there will be a campsite patrol at the festival. The Eco Camp plans to create a zero waste space with people on hand to help festival goers keep the site clean. Emily says: ""If people aren't living up to our ethos there'll be a warning system and if people breach it, we may ask them to leave the Eco Camp."" Matt Wedge will be running a free shop at the festival, providing tents and other items like camping chairs for a Â£10 deposit. ""It's not illogical for someone who never goes camping to abandon their tent, you  just need to convince them there is an alternative."" Major festivals like Reading already have a policy, where they advise people to buy a durable tent to use again each year. As for Jordan, he says he's probably going to think twice when he's packing up at the next festival. ""After hearing that a tent is equivalent to hundreds of plastic cups, I feel bad for leaving the tent there now. ""At the time it honestly really didn't cross my mind but next time, I'm definitely not going to leave my tent there.""

"Voters continue to queue to cast their ballots as night falls in Johannesburg, South Africa Polls have shut in South Africa's elections, widely seen as a test for the ruling ANC. The party is forecast to have a reduced majority following anger over the economy and land reform. Casting his vote in the country's sixth democratic national election since apartheid ended 25 years ago, President Cyril Ramaphosa apologised. He said South Africa would ""never again"" see the ""rampant corruption"" of recent years. ""We have made mistakes but we have been sorry about those mistakes and we are saying our people should reinvest their confidence in us,"" Mr Ramaphosa said. ""Corruption got into the way, patronage got into the way and not focusing on the needs of our people got in the way,"" he added. President Cyril Ramaphosa arrives to cast his vote at a primary school in Soweto The African National Congress (ANC), which led the fight against apartheid, has governed the country since 1994. The centrist Democratic Alliance (DA) and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) are its main challengers. Opinion polls suggest that the ANC will get just over 50% of the vote with the DA forecast to get about 20%, reports AFP news agency. If the poll proves to be true then this would mean a fall in the ANC's vote share. It won 62% of the vote in 2014. There are concerns about voter apathy. Despite more than 26 million people registering to vote, the highest number in South Africa's history, local surveys suggest that six million people under the age of 30 are not on the electoral roll. Young people queuing to vote spoke of their difficulties in finding jobs, with unemployment at 27%. One young voter said that her future employment prospects were on her mind. ""I don't feel confident about getting the job I want,"" she said. Africa Live: Updates on the elections and other stories from Africa Can Ramaphosa call time on corruption? How South Africa has changed since apartheid - in charts Apartheid, in place from 1948 to 1994, legalised racial discrimination privileging white people, and land ownership has remained a contentious issue. The white minority still owns disproportionately more land than the black majority. The EFF has led the charge in trying to change this. ""I'm a member of the ANC but I didn't vote for them this time,"" construction worker Thabo Makhene told the Reuters news agency. ""They need to catch a wake-up. The way they run the state, mishandling state funds, they've lost their morals."" Many voters stayed loyal to the ANC. Esau Zwane, 90, waiting to vote in Soweto, Johannesburg, lived under white-minority rule. He told the BBC he was celebrating ""that our country is now ruled by black people"". This video can not be played 'I am not voting - I'm very upset' The BBC's Andrew Harding in Johannesburg says the party's stance has forced the ANC to consider drastic measures to transfer more land, more quickly, into black hands, which has resulted in a pledge to conduct land expropriation without compensation. The main opposition party, the DA, says it does not believe land reform needs to be ""carried out in a way that takes from one to give to another"", and instead promises to prioritise land reform in the budget and to release unused government land. Other election issues include discontent over poor basic services such as water, housing and electricity and anger over violent crime. As well as the continued inequalities, it is thought that the failure to tackle corruption has damaged the ANC. President Cyril Ramaphosa came to power last year pledging to get to grips with the issue but some voters still associate the party with the corruption which thrived under his predecessor, Jacob Zuma. Mr Zuma faces trial on numerous charges of corruption but has denied any wrongdoing. 26.76 million registered voters 55% of them are female A record 48 parties are on the ballot 28,757 voting stations 220,000 members of electoral staff Six million young people did not register to vote Allow Twitter content?

Shingai Nyoka, BBC News, Norwood For most of the day, the lines here at the polling station in the Johannesburg suburb of Norwood have been relatively long. People have braved the winter chill and some rain to vote in what is being seen here as one of the most hotly contested polls since the first democratic elections 25 years ago. The ballot paper is half a metre long, filled with new political parties including a former residence association, and a pro-local content media group. Is inequality rising in South Africa? Who runs South African business? Two young women in their 20s, who are voting for the first time, told me they don't believe promises made by any of the parties, especially the promise to create jobs. They say they are voting out of a sense of obligation. Another man tells me he is happy with the leaders of the three major parties. ""It's the best it has ever been,"" he said. The location of Norwood polling station reflects some of the key electoral issues, especially the economic inequality that South Africa has come to be known for. On one side is Houghton estate with its swanky, expensive mansions cloistered in gated communities. It is where Nelson Mandela, South Africa's first democratically elected president, lived after his release from 27 years in prison. ANC'sCyril Ramaphosa - union leader, mine boss, president DA'sMmusi Maimane - the man who vows to end ANC rule EFF'sJulius Malema - South Africa's radical agenda setter On the other side are the overcrowded suburbs of Yeoville and Hillbrow, with their grinding poverty and high crime rates. They are also home to migrants from neighbouring countries seeking a better life. Some of the people who live here feel let down by the governing African National Congress (ANC) since it took power in 1994. The party has reduced poverty, especially amongst the black majority, but not enough in the eyes of some. Youth unemployment stands at 54% - a truly staggering figure.

"This video can not be played Brexit: European elections will go ahead says senior minister The UK will have to hold European elections, despite hopes from the government a Brexit deal would be done by then, says the PM's de facto deputy. The vote is due on 23 May, but Theresa May said the UK would not have to take part if MPs agreed a Brexit plan first. Now, David Lidington says ""regrettably"" it is ""not going to be possible to finish that process"" before the date the UK legally has to take part. He said the government would try to make the delay ""as short as possible"". The UK was due to leave the EU on 29 March, but as no deal was agreed by Parliament, the EU extended the deadline to 31 October. It can leave the bloc earlier, but if the UK has not left by 23 May, it is legally obliged to take part in the EU-wide poll and to send MEPs to Brussels. Mrs May's spokesman said she ""deeply regrets"" that the UK did not leave as planned in March and recognised many people felt ""great frustration"" that the European elections were going ahead. But she hoped Parliament would agree a Brexit plan before MEPs start their session in July. Thedeadline to register for the EU electionswas Tuesday 7 May. The government has resumed talks with Labour to try to break the deadlock in Parliament over the terms of withdrawing from the EU. It has promised that if no compromise is reached it will offer indicative votes on possible next steps to Parliament. Labour's shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey said Tuesday's talks were ""very robust"", but nothing had been agreed, and the government still needed to move on its ""red lines"" in order to reach a compromise. This video can not be played Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey: ""Nothing agreed"" in cross-party Brexit talks A Labour source told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg that talks had been ""tense"" with some frustration on the Labour side and said there were still ""fundamental"" problems and divisions between the two sides. The government was being ""disingenuous"" to suggest that ministers were offering a significant new compromise beyond what was already available in the existing agreements with the EU, the source said. Downing Street said the talks had been ""constructive and detailed"" and they would continue on Wednesday afternoon. ""Constructive and detailed"" - that sounds quite positive - Number 10's description of the talks today. ""Robust"" - not quite so chirpy - Labour's use of political speak for what most of us might call a bit tricky. ""Disingenuous"" - oh dear - a different Labour source's description of ministers' claim that what they were putting on the table in the cross-party talks today was something genuinely new on the vexed question of customs arrangements after we leave the EU. As we reported this morning there didn't really seem to be much from the government that was concrete beyond what's already possible under the agreement that's been hammered out with Brussels. The divorce deal and indeed yes, you guessed it, the backstop, both have forms of temporary customs unions in them to make trade between the UK and the EU easier. Of course the precise language and mechanisms matter enormously. But was there some big shiny new offer today? The short answer is: no. Read more from Laura A number of other parties have already announced their candidates and launched their European election campaigns, but the Conservatives have yet to do the same. May meets senior Tory amid calls to resign Brexit: Stepping stone to progress? European elections: What you need to know Cabinet Office Minister Mr Lidington said: ""We very much hoped that we would be able to get our exit sortedâ¦ so that those elections did not have to take place, but legally they do have to take place unless our withdrawal has been given legal effect."" Mr Lidington said the government would be ""redoubling efforts"" in its talks with other parties to find a way forward to ""make sure that the delay after [the elections] is as short as possible"". He added: ""We would like to be in a situationâ¦ certainly to get this done and dusted by the summer recess."" Government sources say if the Brexit process is completed before 30 June, UK MEPs will not take up their seats at all. If it is done and dusted after that date but before Parliament begins its summer recess in July, MEPs will only need to sit for a month, until 1 August. Sources estimate that the cost of holding the European elections will be roughly Â£150m. Analysis:By Chris Morris, BBC Reality Check Even if an unexpected deal were to emerge in the next few days between the Conservatives and Labour, it would only be a very tentative first step towards Brexit, with no guarantee that it would enjoy a parliamentary majority. And a first step isn't enough. The conclusions of last month's EU summit, agreed by all EU leaders including Theresa May, said that if the Brexit withdrawal agreement has not been ratified in parliament by 22 May, the European elections will have to take place in the UK. The ratification process means Parliament would have to pass a meaningful vote on the withdrawal agreement (the deal negotiated between the government and the EU), and then turn it into UK law in the form of a Withdrawal Agreement Bill. And, as Mr Lidington has now conceded formally, time to do all of that has run out. Read more from Chris. Some Brexiteers are angry at Mrs May's efforts to find a compromise with Labour after her deal with the EU was effectively rejected by MPs three times. One leading Eurosceptic, Sir Bill Cash, told the Press Association ""the time has come"" for the PM to resign and she ""needs to be given a date"". But Chancellor Philip Hammond defended the cross-party talks, suggesting the government had no other option. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg saysNo 10 is trying to get Labour over the line by presenting the withdrawal agreement as a stepping stone - i.e. hold your nose for now and you can carve out your own deal if you win the next election. Key to that, she says, is the promise of a ""temporary customs union"", but Labour sources are warning that would not be enough. Labour has previously said it wants a permanent customs union - an arrangement not to carry out checks or put tariffs (extra payments) on goods that move around between the UK and the EU after Brexit. The election in May will see 751 MEPs sent to the European Parliament to make laws and approve budgets for the EU. Each country is allocated a set number of seats, depending on the size of its population. The smallest member, Malta (population: around half a million) has six MEPs, while the largest, Germany (population: 82 million) has 96. The UK is divided into 12 regions, each represented by between three and 10 MEPs depending on population size, ending with a total of 73. Seats in England, Scotland and Wales are awarded to parties according to their share of the vote, then to the candidates on the lists drawn up by the parties. Northern Ireland elects MEPs using asingle transferable vote system, with voters able to rank candidates in order of preference. The European Parliament has agreed that 46 of the UK's 73 seats will be abolished after Brexit, and the remaining 27 will be redistributed among countries that have complained of under-representation. 2019 European elections: List of candidates What are your questions about Brexit?
