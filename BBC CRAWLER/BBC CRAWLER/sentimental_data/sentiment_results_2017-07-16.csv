"This video can not be played See how Jodie Whittaker was revealed as the next Time Lord Jodie Whittaker has been announced as Doctor Who's 13th Time Lord - the first woman to be given the role. The new Doctor's identity was revealed in a trailer broadcast at the end of the Wimbledon men's singles final. The Broadchurch star succeeds Peter Capaldi, who took over the role in 2013 and leaves in the forthcoming Christmas special. Whittaker, 35, said it was ""overwhelming, as a feminist"" to become the next Doctor. She will make her debut on the sci-fi show when the Doctor regenerates in the Christmas special. All the Doctors so far, from Hartnell to Whittaker Time Lord's new gender splits Doctor Who fans The Huddersfield-born star, who was a late favourite to become the Doctor, will find a familiar face for her on set - Doctor Who's new showrunner is Broadchurch creator Chris Chibnall. Whittaker said: ""I'm beyond excited to begin this epic journey - with Chris and with every Whovian on this planet. ""It's more than an honour to play the Doctor. It means remembering everyone I used to be, while stepping forward to embrace everything the Doctor stands for: hope. I can't wait."" The actress also shares another Broadchurch link with Doctor Who -  co-star David Tennant was the 10th Doctor. By Lizo Mzimba, BBC entertainment correspondent It was always unlikely that the Doctor would continue to be white and male, especially as the BBC has committed itself to greater diversity on its programmes. Casting the first female Doctor is something many viewers have been calling for. And strong female-led stories have been successful on the big and small screen in recent  years, in films ranging from The Hunger Games and Star Wars to Wonder Woman, and in TV series like Game of Thrones. The BBC will be hoping today's announcement will not just excite viewers, but will also demonstrate that the time travel show has firmly moved into the 21st century. Whittaker said it felt ""incredible""to take on the role, saying: ""It feels completely overwhelming, as a feminist, as a woman, as an actor, as a human, as someone who wants to continually push themselves and challenge themselves, and not be boxed in by what you're told you can and can't be."" And she told fans not to be ""scared"" by her gender. ""Because this is a really exciting time, and Doctor Who represents everything that's exciting about change,"" she said, adding: ""The fans have lived through so many changes, and this is only a new, different one, not a fearful one."" Whittaker said she had used the codename ""Clooney"" when discussing the part with her husband and agent - as actor George is ""an iconic guy"". Peter Capaldi will bow out in this year's Christmas special, featuring David Bradley as the First Doctor Chibnall said the 13th Doctor was always going to be a woman. He said: ""I always knew I wanted the 13th Doctor to be a woman and we're thrilled to have secured our number one choice. ""Her audition for the Doctor simply blew us all away. Jodie is an in-demand, funny, inspiring, super-smart force of nature and will bring loads of wit, strength and warmth to the role. The 13th Doctor is on her way."" Chibnall is taking over from Steven Moffat, who leaves the series at the same time as Capaldi. Capaldi, who had said he wanted to see a woman replace him, said: ""Anyone who has seen Jodie Whittaker's work will know that she is a wonderful actress of great individuality and charm. ""She has above all the huge heart to play this most special part. She's going to be a fantastic Doctor."" Former companions Billie Piper and Karen Gillan had called for a female Time Lord, while Doctor Who and Sherlock writer Mark Gatiss said it was the perfect time for a woman to take the lead role. After the announcement, Piper tweeted the word: ""YES"" with a red rose emoji, while fellow former companion Freema Agyeman tweeted: ""Change isn't a dirty word!!!!"" Dedicated Whovians were quick to react to the news of Jodie Whittaker taking over the Tardis. On social media, some said it would encourage them to watch the show for the first time - but others said the casting meant they would be switching off, and that the Doctor should be played by a man. Carla Joannatweeted,externalto say that she would be tuning in and that the trailer ""made me choke up a little"". Another tweeter, Ayad, said: ""I don't even watch Doctor Who but a woman doctor is so cool."" But Samantha Meltonsaid,external: ""I am a woman and a feminist but I don't want a female Doctor. To me it's trying too hard to tick the boxes."" Doctor Who writerJenny Colgan, who has written for the series' books and audio dramas, said: ""I am of course incredibly excited the new Doctor is a woman; Steven Moffat has been paving the way for this for ages and it is absolutely about time. ""I can't imagine what it's like for Jodie: she must be so scared and excited all at once, but I couldn't be happier, and 100% can't wait to write for her."" Will Howells, who writes for the Doctor Who magazine and has been a fan for 25 years, said: ""In 2017, there shouldn't be anything major about a TV series changing from a male lead to a female one. We'll also maybe see a solo male companion as a regular feature for the first time. ""I don't think it's a risky choice at all - but if a show that can go anywhere and do anything can't take risks, what can?"" Science fiction and fantasy authorPaul Cornellsaid: ""It's always been time for a woman Doctor and it's great we got there. ""Well done to Steven Moffat for laying the groundwork. She's going to be amazing. And that first episode of hers is going to get a lot of new people watching."" ActressOlivia Colman, who starred in a Doctor Who episode and was one of the possible candidates for the role, said it was a ""classy decision"". ""The creatives made the right decision that the part should be a woman and it's about time,"" she told BBC News. She added that those unhappy about Whittaker being the new Time Lord should ""leave her alone and let her do her job brilliantly"". Whittaker starred as Beth Latimer in the three series of the ITV crime drama Broadchurch, as the mother of a murdered boy. As well as TV work, Whittaker has appeared on the big screen, in One Day, Attack the Block and St Trinian's. She made her film debut in 2006's Venus, opposite Peter O'Toole. Traditionally, each Doctor has their own distinctive look, raising questions about the cloak Whittaker wears in the trailer. However, she has said it is not part of her official Doctor Who outfit, and that she does not yet know what she will wear.

"George A Romero promoting 2005's Land of the Dead in Cannes The American-born filmmaker George A Romero, who created the Living Dead movie franchise, has died at the age of 77, his manager has said. Romero died in his sleep on Sunday with his wife and daughter at his side, after a ""brief but aggressive battle"" with lung cancer, Chris Roe said. Romero co-wrote and directed the film that started the zombie series Night of the Living Dead in 1968. It led to a number of sequels - and a host of imitators. BBC Culture - Where do zombies come from? Zombie maestro lays down the lore,external Roe said Romero died listening to the score of The Quiet Man, ""one of his all-time favourite films"". At the time of its release, Night of the Living Dead was criticised for being gory but it went on to be a cult classic and shape horror and zombie films for decades. While it did not use the word zombies, it was the first film to depict cannibalistic reanimated corpses. The Living Dead franchise began in 1968, with the most recent made in 2009 Previous films had shown zombies as being living people who had been bewitched through voodoo. Despite having a budget of just $114,000, the film made $30m at the box office and was followed by five sequels and two remakes. Mr Romero had a non-starring and uncredited role in the film as a news reporter. He went on to direct other films including the 1971 romantic comedy There's Always Vanilla, the 1978 vampire film Martin, and the 1982 Stephen King adaptation Creepshow. His only work to top the box office success enjoyed by Night of the Living Dead was Dawn of the Dead, released in 1978, which earned more than $40m. Fellow film directors including Max Landis and Jordan Peele paid tribute to Romero on Twitter. Director and producer Eli Roth wrote: ""Just heard the news about George Romero. Hard to quantify how much he inspired me & what he did for cinema. Condolences to his family."" He continued in athread of tweets,external: ""Romero used genre to confront racism 50 years ago. He always had diverse casts, with Duane Jones as the heroic star of NOTLD."" Roth said that ""very few others in cinema were taking such risks"" and that Romero ""as ""both ahead of his time and exactly what cinema needed at that time"". Baby Driver director Edgar Wrightwrote that ""he couldn't into one tweet"",externalhow he felt, so he wrote a blog post in memory of Romero. He said: ""It's fair to say that without George A. Romero, I would not have the career that I have now. A lot of people owe George a huge debt of gratitude for the inspiration. I am just one of many."" Ed Harris on Romero: ""He was a great friend. I miss him."" Ed Harris said on Radio 4's Today programme: ""I really loved George. He was big, beautiful, gregarious bear of a guy."" Romero worked with Harris on the 1981 drama film, Knightriders. Harris continued to explain how it was his first lead role in a film and that George A. Romero was ""a joy work with and treated everyone with respect.""

"This video can not be played Chancellor Philip Hammond tells Andrew Marr: ""Cabinet meetings are supposed to be a private space"" Public sector workers get a 10% ""premium"" over their private sector counterparts, Philip Hammond said as he warned ministers against leaking cabinet talks on the pay cap. The chancellor refused to comment on reports he had said at a meeting that public servants were ""overpaid"". And he suggested some colleagues who do not agree with his approach on Brexit were trying to undermine him. Minister Liam Fox said he ""deplored"" the briefing by some of his colleagues. The international trade secretary told the BBC's Sunday Politics they should ""be very quiet"" and ""stick to their own departmental duties"", adding: ""Our backbenchers are furious and the only people smiling at this will be in Berlin and Paris."" Reality Check: Is public sector pay higher? Since the general election, cabinet splits have surfaced over the issue of the 1% cap on public sector pay rises, with some ministers pressing for it to be lifted. Labour is promising Â£4bn which it says would offer a pay rise to workers. On the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Hammond defended his stance, saying public sector pay had ""raced ahead"" of the private sector after the economic crash in 2008. While in terms of salary alone, that gap had now closed, he continued, when ""very generous"" pension contributions were taken into account, the 10% disparity between public and private salaries was a ""simple fact"". This video can not be played John McDonnell produces a cleaner's payslip to challenge Philip Hammond Asked about aSunday Times,externalreport claiming he had said the former were ""overpaid"", the chancellor insisted he was not going to discuss what was and wasn't said in a cabinet meeting. ""I do think on many fronts it would be helpful if my colleagues - all of us - focused on the job at hand,"" he said. He added: ""If you want my opinion, some of the noise is generated by people who are not happy with the agenda that I have, over the last few weeks, tried to advance, of ensuring that we achieve a Brexit which is focused on protecting our economy, protecting our jobs and making sure that we can have continued rising living standards in the future."" Mr Fox, one of the leading Brexit campaigners in the cabinet, rejected press reports he had clashed with Mr Hammond over the EU, saying the two had a ""very good working relationship"". ""I don't know where the briefing is coming from, but I do know it's got to stop,"" he said. He added: ""I think there's too much self-indulgence, and I think people need to have less prosecco and have a longer summer holiday."" Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith criticised those briefing against Prime Minister Theresa May, saying: ""Just for once shut up, for God's sake, and let everybody else get on with the business of governing."" Pay rises for most public sector workers are set by independent pay review bodies, but have effectively been capped at 1% each year since 2013. Before that, there was a two-year freeze on pay for all but the lowest-paid workers. The government has come under pressure over the policy since the general election, with some Conservative ministers speaking out in favour of lifting the cap. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Labour would spend Â£4bn on ending the cap, insisting this would be enough to give a real-terms increase for public sector workers. Pay review bodies would be asked to come up with an ""honest judgement"" and a Labour government would follow their advice, he said. On Pienaar's Politics on BBC Radio 5 live, First Secretary of State Damian Green was asked whether Mr Hammond said public sector workers were ""overpaid"". ""I'm not going to report from inside cabinet because cabinet ministers should not do that,"" he said. ""But the chancellor does not think that public sector workers are overpaid - the government obviously respects the millions of people who do really important jobs.""

"This video can not be played Chancellor Philip Hammond criticises John McDonnell over Grenfell ""social murder"" comments Chancellor Phillip Hammond has called comments made by Labour's John McDonnell about the Grenfell fire tragedy ""disgraceful"". The shadow chancellor told the BBC's Andrew Marr he stood by his claim that victims of the disaster in west London were ""murdered by political decisions"". He said ""social murder"" had occurred and ""people should be accountable"". But Mr Hammond told the programme there was ""not a shred of evidence to support that"" accusation. At least 80 people are believed to have been killed in the tower block fire in north Kensington on 14 June. This video can not be played Grenfell fire was social murder, says McDonnell Asked if the politicians who sanctioned cuts were murderers, Mr McDonnell said he did not ""resile"" from that view. He cited cuts to local government, to the fire service and the housing crisis. ""There's a long history in this country of the concept of social murder, where decisions are made with no regard to consequences of that, and as a result of that, people have suffered,"" he told Andrew Marr. ""That's what's happened here, and I'm angry."" He previously blamed the decision to ""view housing as only for financial speculation"". German socialist, Friedrich Engels John McDonnell's turn of phrase is one that was actually coined more than 170 years ago. It was in the 19th Century that philosopher Friedrich Engels sought to prove that society commits ""social murder"" in his book Condition of the Working-Class in England in 1844. ""When society places hundreds of proletarians in such a position that they inevitably meet a too early and an unnatural death... When it deprives thousands of the necessaries of life... forces them, through the strong arm of the law, to remain in such conditions until that death ensues... its deed is murder,"" he wrote of Victorian England. Engels went on to found Marxist theory with fellow German philosopher, Karl Marx. Mr McDonnell recently said there wasmuch to learnfrom reading Marx's study of capitalism, Das Kapital. Speaking ahead of June's general election, he said he was going to be the ""first socialist in the tradition of the Labour Party"".

"This video can not be played Footage shows voters panicking as a shot is heard More than seven million voters have taken part in an opposition-organised referendum in Venezuela, according to academics monitoring the poll. Voters strongly opposed government plans for a new constituent assembly with the power to scrap the National Assembly and rewrite the constitution. Venezuela is polarised between backers of President NicolÃ¡s Maduro and opponents, who want fresh elections. A nurse was shot dead while queuing to vote in the capital, Caracas. Men on motorbikes opened fire, killing 60-year-old Xiomara Soledad Scott, and wounding three others. The opposition blamed a ""paramilitary"" gang for the shooting, which prosecutors said they would investigate. Separately, journalist Luis Olavarrieta was grabbed by what he said were a group of government supporters who robbed and beat him, but he managed to escape. ""We don't want to be Cuba,"" says the head of the National Assembly President Maduro's plan will see a vote on 30 July for the new constituent assembly. Its 545 members will have the power to dissolve state institutions, including the National Assembly, where opposition parties are in the majority. The opposition wants new elections before Mr Maduro's term expires in early 2019 and say rewriting the constitution would almost certainly delay this year's regional elections and next year's presidential election. It fears the new body could herald dictatorship. As Julio Borges, who heads the National Assembly, puts it: ""We don't want to be Cuba. We don't want to be a country without freedom."" ""Not legal"" - President Maduro's verdict on Sunday's poll Mr Maduro argues that the constituent assembly is the only way to help Venezuela out of its economic and political crisis and he described Sunday's vote as ""meaningless"". ""They have convened an internal consultation with the opposition parties, with their own mechanisms, without electoral rulebooks, without prior verification, without further verification. As if they are autonomous and decide on their own,"" he said. On the same day as the unofficial referendum, the government held a ""trial run"" for the 30 July vote, which it described as a success. This video can not be played Your video guide to the crisis gripping Venezuela Nearly 100 people have been killed in clashes stemming from the political conflict The deep economic crisis is made worse by the falling price of oil, which accounts for about 95% of Venezuela's export revenues and was used to finance some of the government's social programmes. Forced to make cuts, President NicolÃ¡s Maduro has seen his support fall among core backers Basic necessities, such as medicine and food, are in short supply The opposition accuses Mr Maduro of mismanaging the economy and eroding democratic institutions In March, the Supreme Court decided it would take over the National Assembly. The decision was reversed, but Mr Maduro was accused by opponents of trying to stage a coup. That sparked almost daily protests calling for his resignation Mr Maduro says the opposition is trying to overthrow his government More on Venezuela's turmoil The rector of the Central University of Venezuela, Cecilia GarcÃ­a Arocha, said 6,492,381 people voted inside Venezuela and another 693,789 at polling stations abroad. However, the vote has no legal status. The turnout is slightly less than the 7.7m people who voted for opposition candidates at the 2015 parliamentary elections. There are 19.5m registered voters in the country. Voting on three questions, 98% rejected the new assembly proposed by President Maduro and backed a call for elections before 2019. They also voted for the armed forces to defend the current constitution. Sunday's unofficial poll was held in improvised polling stations at theatres, sports grounds and roundabouts. The opposition plans to burn ballot papers from the informal poll so those who voted against the government cannot be identified and victimised. While the vote was only symbolic, BBC South America correspondent Katy Watson said the opposition hopes the high turnout will heap pressure on the government. Are you in the region?

"A promotional image for 2013's 50th anniversary special, The Day of the Doctor Doctor Who's Peter Capaldi has passed on his sonic screwdriver to Jodie Whittaker who becomes the 13th doctor and first woman to take on the role of television's famous Time Lord. She follows a distinguished line-up of thespian (male) talent that stretches all the way back to the sci-fi favourite's first episode in 1963. William Hartnellwas the first actor to play the Doctor on television, appearing in the BBC show from 1963 to 1966. Hartnell, who died in 1975, had previously appeared in TV's The Army Game and Carry On Sergeant, the first Carry On film, in 1958. While Hartnell was playing the Doctor on television,Peter Cushingcould be found playing him on film in Dr Who and the Daleks, in which Roy Castle co-starred. That 1965 film and its 1966 follow-up, Daleks - Invasion Earth: 2150 A.D., depicted the Doctor as a human scientist rather than a time-travelling Gallifreyan and are not considered part of the Doctor Who timeline. When ill health forced Hartnell to relinquish the role, the Doctor regenerated - for the first time - intoPatrick Troughton. Memorably scruffy and eccentric, Troughton spent three years travelling time and space before stepping down in 1969. When the raffishJon Pertweebecame the third Doctor, he also became the first to be seen on television in colour. His tenure, which ran from 1970 to 1974, saw the Time Lord exiled to Earth and working with Unit, aka the United Nations Intelligence Taskforce. Pertwee's time with the show also saw the first of the popular ensemble stories in which previous Doctors appear alongside the current one. Broadcast over December 1972 and January 1973, The Three Doctors saw him joined by Patrick Troughton and William Hartnell in what would be the latter's final acting engagement. When Pertwee moved on in 1974,Tom Bakermoved in - and would become the longest-serving Doctor to date. Deep-voiced, curly-haired and eternally long of scarf, his seven years in the Tardis earned him legions of fans who were delighted anew in 2013 when he popped up at the end of a 50th anniversary special. When Baker finally stepped down from the role in 1981, his shoes were filled by the fresh-facedPeter Davison. The boyish actor spent three years as the Fifth Doctor before taking his leave at the end of the show's 21st series. Davison's tenure coincided with Doctor Who's 20th anniversary, celebrated by a feature-length special that saw him joined by Jon Pertwee and Patrick Troughton. The First Doctor also made an appearance, with Richard Hurndall filling in for the late William Hartnell. Tom Baker opted not to return for The Five Doctors, which covered over his absence by incorporating material from one of the actor's unbroadcast adventures. Similar subterfuge was required for this 1983 photo shoot, which saw Hurndall, Davison, Pertwee and Troughton joined by an unconvincing Baker mannequin. Davison's departure opened the door for another Baker to take controls of the Doctor's time-travelling police box in 1984. Colin Baker(no relation of Tom's) spent less than three years in the role, with his appearances limited further by an 18-month hiatus in production. Though Baker had limited time to enjoy the Tardis, he did get the chance to meet one of his predecessors when Patrick Troughton returned - for the third time - in 1985. The Two Doctors marked Troughton's final reprise of his signature role. Some years later, his sons David and Michael would both make Doctor Who appearances. Scottish actorSylvester McCoytook over from Colin Baker in 1987 and played the Doctor until the show's axing in 1989. Michael Grade - the controller of BBC One at the time - was no fan of the programme, which was looking increasingly threadbare and cheap-looking in the face of glossier cinema fare. Some feel, though, that this period in the show's evolution has beenharshly judged. An attempt was made to revive Doctor Who in 1996 with a TV film that saw McCoy regenerate intoPaul McGannon American soil. It was hoped the special would spawn a TV series but it never materialised, making McGann's tenure the shortest of all the Doctors. In 2005 Doctor Who regenerated into the ambitious, well-financed property it is today. It also introduced a new Doctor in the form ofChristopher Eccleston. To the disappointment of many, the Salford-born actor chose to make only one series of the rebooted show. His departurewas confirmed,externalonly days after his debut episode was broadcast. Eccleston's exit sawDavid Tennantjoin the show, with his first full episode - The Christmas Invasion - shown on BBC One on Christmas Day 2005. Tennant's amiable style and enthusiasm made him a popular choice for the role, which he finally relinquished on the first day of 2010. The spate of junior Doctors continued with the casting ofMatt Smith, who was just 27 when he made his debut as the Time Lord's 11th incarnation. His four years in the role, which coincided with Doctor Who's 50th anniversary, saw the programme both maintain and bolster its renewed popularity. Doctor Who's 50th anniversary in 2013 was marked by The Day of the Doctor, a feature-length special in which Matt Smith's Time Lord was joined by David Tennant's version of the character. The Day of the Doctor also introduced a previously unknown incarnation of the Doctor, known as The War Doctor and played bySir John Hurt. The character rejected referring to himself as 'The Doctor' and is not considered to have the same status as his fellow TV Time Lords. Peter Capaldiwas no stranger to the Doctor Who universe when he was cast as the Doctor in 2013. A lifelong fan of the show, he appeared in an episode of the programme in 2008 and also had a role in its spin-off Torchwood. His hawkish features brought a new intensity, and maturity, to the Tardis from the moment his first full episode was broadcast in August 2014. Capaldi's most recent adventure saw him briefly joined by the ""original"" Doctor, played on this occasion byDavid Bradley. Bradley will return in this year's Doctor Who Christmas special. Bradley's appearance was a pleasing one for Whovians after his role as William Hartnell in An Adventure in Space and Time, a 2013 dramatisation of the show's early years. Jodie Whittakerhas been named as the 13th Doctor and will be the first woman to play the role - if one discounts Joanna Lumley, who briefly played the Doctor in a 1999Comic Relief sketch,external. Whittaker will make her debut on the sci-fi show this Christmas when Peter Capaldi regenerates. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

"This video can not be played Tony Blair told Newsnight's Ian Katz it was ""possible"" that Jeremy Corbyn could become prime minister Tony Blair says he now accepts Jeremy Corbyn could become prime minister. The ex-PM told BBC Newsnight that a year ago he would have said it was impossible for the left-wing Labour leader to win. But he added: ""There's been so many political upsets, it's possible Jeremy Corbyn could become prime minister and Labour could win on that programme."" Mr Blair, a consistent critic of Mr Corbyn, said he had not changed his mind on the ""wisdom"" of electing him. Having defied predictions of a heavy defeat at last month's general election - and stripped the Conservatives of their majority - Mr Corbyn now describes his party as a ""government-in-waiting"". Many of his critics have since admitted they underestimated him. Speaking to Newsnight, Mr Blair said he still believed ""it's a surer route to power to fight from the centre"" and that it would be damaging for the country if Mr Corbyn became prime minister and imposed ""an unreconstructed far Left programme"". This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""I hope he (Tony Blair) has looked very carefully at our manifesto"" But on Mr Corbyn's chances of reaching Downing Street, he said nothing could be ruled out. ""For most of my political life I've been saying: 'I think this is the right way to go, and what's more it's the only way to win an election'. ""I have to qualify that now.  I have to say 'no - I think it's possible you end up with Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister.'"" The Labour leadership has dismissed Mr Blair's recent interventions - which included claiming Brexit followed by a Corbyn government would leave Britain ""flat on its back"". ""To be frank, Mr Blair hasn't really listened to the nature of the debate that is going on in the pubs, the clubs and school gates etc,"" shadow chancellor John McDonnell said on Saturday. The interview will be shown on Newsnight, on BBC Two, at 22:30 BST on 17 July.

"Venetians have long complained of the big ships, and they are not alone There are places where the surge of global tourism is starting to feel like a tidal wave. Ancient cities around the shores of the Mediterranean and Adriatic are on the front line, their stone streets squeezed full of summer visitors as budget airlines and giant cruise ships unload ever-growing armies of tourists. Take the Croatian city of Dubrovnik: a perfectly preserved historical miniature, carved from honey-coloured stone set in a sea of postcard blue. Around 1,500 people live within the walls of its Old City, custodians of cultural treasures left by everyone from the Romans and the Ostrogoths to the Venetians and the Habsburgs. On a busy day three modern cruise ships, each one the size of a floating apartment building, can disgorge five or six times that number of people into the city. Dubrovnik's allure for tourists has been amplified by Game of Thrones They join the throngs of tourists staying in local hotels and in rooms rented over the internet, in streets where almost every elegant stone house has been converted into a B&B. Keeping busy on the world's biggest cruise ship Italian tourist treasure turned into ghost town by earthquake Will Venice be loved to death? Bulgarian resort 'best value in Europe' The overall effect is Disneylandish - a sense that you meet no-one but other tourists or ice-cream sellers, tour guides, waiters, reception clerks and buskers who are there to keep the tourist wheels turning. Mark Thomas, who edits The Dubrovnik Times, explains the phenomenon like this. ""When I first got here, I'd stand back if I saw that people were taking photographs of each other. Now there are so many people that I know if I did that, I'd never get anywhere here."" Dubrovnik has a particular problem because its ancient appeal has now been bolstered by that most modern of phenomena - the HBO mini-series. The city, unchanged for centuries, provides the main locations for Game of Thrones. Game of Thrones premiere 'very emotional' Fans come on pilgrimages to visit the settings. One souvenir shop owner, who told me he doesn't watch the series himself, admitted he had Googled a couple of catchphrases to help attract customers. ""It does seem crazy,"" he admitted, ""to stand here when it's 35 degrees, shouting that 'Winter is Coming'."" The idyllic Italian island of Capri is buckling under the thousands of daily tourists Dubrovnik is not alone in struggling to balance its need for tourists' money with the need to ensure that those tourists don't end up destroying the beauty they've come to see. The tiny Italian island of Capri has warned that it could ""explode"" under the pressure of the trade that sees as many as 15,000 visitors a day travelling by boat from the mainland, to visit its once-idyllic streets and squares. One local official told The Daily Telegraph: ""You can't fit a litre-and-a-half into a litre pot."" Florence, Barcelona and some Greek islands like Santorini have suffered too, and it was perhaps Venice which experienced the problem first. Its population has been falling since the 1950s, effectively forced out by the hordes of cruise-ship visitors. Tourism, of course, remains essentially a good thing and in the developed world we nearly all do it. It means trade and cultural exchange and it's both a symbol of rising prosperity and a generator of future wealth. Not everyone in Barcelona is happy with the summer 'invasion' of tourists Part of the ""problem"" is that travellers from traditional sources like the UK, Germany and the USA are increasingly being joined by the new middle classes of countries like Russia, China and India. Add to that the issue of security, which means that many tourists feel safer in Europe than they do in alternative destinations like Tunisia, Turkey or Egypt, and it's hard to see the numbers falling any time soon. It will fall to local governments in places like Dubrovnik and Capri and Venice to find a way of reducing those growing pressures. For now, ideas like installing turnstiles on ancient squares and pedestrian traffic lights on crowded streets may sound rather fanciful. But if that tourist tide keeps rising they might start to seem a little more tempting.

"A moped ridden by three teenagers was in collision with a police car at the junction of South Park Road and Trinity Road in Wimbledon A 16-year-old boy is in a critical condition after a collision between a police car and a moped being ridden by three teenagers in south-west London. The crash happened at 02:15 BST on Sunday in South Park Road, Wimbledon. All three boys were taken to a south London hospital for treatment. The moped was believed to have been involved in an attempted robbery and was being monitored by the National Police Air Service helicopter, said the Metropolitan Police. A second 16-year-old suffered a serious injury to his leg and a 15-year-old sustained minor injuries. All three were arrested at the scene and two large knives were recovered. The moped had been reported to police as lost or stolen, on 12 July. The Met said the Directorate of Professionals Standards has been informed and the incident had been referred to the police watchdog. In a statement, the Met said the moped was not being ""pursued by police vehicles on the ground"" at the time of the collision but ""was monitored by police helicopter"".

Some 789 people at a music festival in eastern Finland went skinny dipping on Saturday, organisers said, beating the previous record set in Australia by just three, reports said.

"Europol released photos of police visiting horses A Spanish-led police operation has cracked a racket in horsemeat unfit for human consumption, the EU's police agency Europol says. Police in Spain made 65 arrests for crimes including animal abuse, forgery, money laundering and racketeering. Horses in Portugal and Spain deemed unfit for consumption were slaughtered and their meat passed off as edible. A Dutch businessman arrested in Belgium is said to have controlled the illegal trade from south-east Spain. He was first sought in connection with a scandal in the Republic of Ireland in 2013, when horsemeat was found in beef burgers, but his whereabouts were unknown at that time. The issue in theearlier scandalwas one of food fraud rather than food safety. Spain's Guardia Civil (police) began Operation Gazel a year ago after detecting unusual behaviour in horsemeat markets. They worked in co-ordination with Belgium, France, Italy, Portugal, Romania, Switzerland and the UK, Europol said in astatement,external. The unnamed Dutchman controlled the crime ring from Calpe in Alicante, on Spain's Costa Blanca, ""putting his most trusted men in charge in every country affected by the scam"", Europol says. Police carried out raids in both Alicante and Leon, in the north of Spain, blocking or seizing bank accounts and properties, and confiscating five luxury cars. Other charges brought against those arrested were perverting the course of justice and committing crimes against public health. Horses in bad shape, too old or simply labelled as ""not suitable for consumption"" were being slaughtered in two different slaughterhouses, Europol says. Police inspected abattoirs Meat from the animals, which came from Portugal and several parts of northern Spain, was processed in a specific facility and from there sent to Belgium, a major horsemeat exporter. Microchips and documentation were modified by the crime group. Analysis of samples conducted in The Hague concluded the meat was destined mainly for markets outside Spain, as the samples matched others found abroad. One of the charges brought is animal abuse but details are not yet available. However, a photo released by Europol shows one horse with a bloody slash close to its mane. Men jailed for horse cruelty in Northern Ireland 'Horse guru' convicted of pony cruelty in England Horsemeat on sale in a butcher's shop in Germany Italy and France are the biggest consumers of equidae (horses, donkeys etc) meat, according toa report by the UK's Guardian newspaper,externalin 2013. According to that report, Italy imported 21,693 tonnes and France 11,898 in 2012, while Belgium was the chief exporter, shipping 17,320 tonnes. Spain exported 3,910 tonnes in that period. However, the trade is small compared, for instance, to the beef market. Total EU horsemeat imports in 2012 came to 50,250 tonnes and exports 54,853, while EU beef imports in 2011 totalled 315,000 tonnes and exports - 510,200.

"Maid Marian Sally Pollard was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2015 Nottingham's official Robin Hood said he had been overwhelmed by donations for Maid Marian - his wife who died of breast cancer. Sally Pollard, 39, who had played the role for more than 12 years, died at their home on 16 June. Tim Pollard, 53, said his wife was ""absolutely brilliant"". About Â£6,000 has been raised which will go to the charities that helped her stay at home in her final months, he said. Sally Pollard was Nottingham's official Maid Marian for more than 12 years Dr Pollard was a genetics scientist and lecturer at the University of Nottingham. Mr Pollard has played Robin Hood for more than two decades. The couple fell in love while playing the famous duo and married last September. They have a daughter, Scarlett, aged three. Mr Pollard, who is employed by the city council to appear as Robin Hood at special events, said: ""Sally was absolutely brilliant, not just as a Maid Marian, which she loved doing, being part of the Robin Hood legend and representing the city, but she was a great scientist, teacher, working at the university and helping others. ""Some of her research is ongoing and that's a great legacy for her."" Following his wife's death he decided to raise some money for the charities that had helped her. He said: ""We thought we might get a couple of hundred pounds, but the goodwill Sally has engendered means we've raised well over Â£6,000."" Sally Pollard's funeral took place on Friday.

"The BBC 1995 adaption of Pride and Prejudice spawned a new generation of Austen fans Almost 200 years after Jane Austen's death, the English writer is still adored around the world. BBC News spoke to some of the fans for whom a love of Austen's work has evolved into a way of life. Australia may still have been a penal colony when Jane Austen was writing her novels, but two centuries on, Austen fans Down Under get together each year to recreate Regency England in Canberra. Aylwen Gardiner-Garden and her husband John have run the annual Jane Austen Festival for 10 years. The event grew out of their love of Regency dancing and now more than 300 people come from all over Australia and New Zealand for promenades, grand balls, talks and dance workshops. ""Jane Austen is very popular in Australia - especially after the BBC series aired here in the 1990s - Colin Firth just did it for everyone. And it's generational - there was another whole new set of fans after the Keira Knightley film,"" she explained. ""I don't think it's harking back to the old country - it's more the sense of romance and escaping from reality. It's not the seedy side of England, like Dickens. ""At the festival, the women can dress up, feel feminine and elegant, and the guys are gentlemen. Teenagers grow up overnight on the dance floor - their manners are fantastic. ""It's people coming together to learn about the costumes, the books, the dancing. It's become part of people's lives, so I keep doing it for the love of it.""

She still remembers 10 September 2009 - the day she first read Austen's biography and instantly ""fell in love"". Within a year she had read all her novels and written the stage show she has been performing ever since. ""Her work is so well written - every time I read it I find something new - her concise use of language and its elegance is so beautiful,"" she said. In researching her show, Ms Miller visited the Smithsonian Institution to find the earliest audio recording of a Hampshire accent and listened over and over again to find the correct stage voice. ""I do have to slow it down a bit - they are not used to a Hampshire accent on the south side of Chicago."" With more than 5,000 members of Jane Austen societies in the US and Canada, there is an eager audience for her shows. ""People have read the novels, but not the letters. People at the shows cry and say that I am Jane Austen. ""It's the ease and geniality of the time, the romance and the reassurance - in the current political climate, a Jane Austen novel has integrity and truth."" Adge Secker is a full-time police officer in Bath who is also a tour guide for ECT Travel's Strictly Jane Austen tours - one of the companies chasing the bonnet bucks - tapping into the market of Austen enthusiasts keen to learn more about their heroine. He described his clients as ""just mad crazy"" about Austen with Americans in particular ""absolutely nuts for her"". ""We take them to where she lived, where she danced, the places that inspired the stories and just immerse them in the history.  I get people enthused and at the end tell them what they've done is walk in her footsteps. ""It's just good fun to do - they love to soak up the history and the culture."" Tour-goers get to visit places in the city where Jane Austen lived for five years from 1801. Locations include the Gravel Walk - where Anne Elliot and Captain Wentworth were engaged in Persuasion - or visitors can have Regency experiences like tasting the spa water or attending a grand ball. ""Many Jane Austen experts come on the tours to see the places in her life. I'm like a sponge - always learning new stories. But you have to get your facts right, otherwise Jane Austen fans will find you out."" Austen's work was first published in Italy in the 1930s, while films and dubbed BBC dramas have boosted her popularity in recent decades. Venetian Mara Barbuni first saw Ang Lee's Sense and Sensibility in 1995 and immediately borrowed the book from her local library. Since then she has written extensively on the author - her most recent research project is into how houses and homes are represented in Austen's novels. In the course of her research, she has travelled to many of the ""Austenland"" sites - including Winchester, Bath and Lyme Regis. Austen's work is ""really popular and much loved"" in Italy, she explains. ""Many Italian readers of Jane Austen declare they love her settings, the old-fashioned but fashionable flair of her novels, and the love stories of her characters."" More than 300 academics and devotees are in the Jane Austen Society of Italy which was founded in Bologna in 2013. It is holding a ""Grand Tour"" of conferences around Italian cities this year, based on each of Austen's novels. Nicole Kang and Margy Supramaniam are members of Singapore's Jane Austen Circle, enthusiasts who regularly meet for balls, tea and dramatised readings in costume. UK-born Mrs Supramaniam, who moved to Singapore in the 1980s, said: ""I'm no seamstress but I do enjoy dressing bonnets to look authentic and finding Indian trimming to make dresses look Regency. ""I have also used saris for dresses, the muslin ones with borders are the best. In the late 18th and early 19th Century cloth was imported in large quantities from India as it was in great demand in England for clothes, so some of it works really well in achieving a period look. ""Many older Singaporeans, who had a fairly British-style colonial education, were brought up with Jane Austen but the younger generation are less familiar, and often their first introduction may have been watching a film adaptation. It is exciting to see Jane Austen's popularity spread. ""The largest group of followers that we have are millennial Chinese Singaporeans who can somehow relate to Jane Austen across culture and centuries."" One of those younger members, Nicole Kang (pictured above left, in the dress), gives Regency dance lessons in Singaporean schools. ""I first read Northanger Abbey when I was 15 years old as I had more or less finished reading most of the 'teen' books in my school library and I think I had fancied a bit of a challenge in my reading. ""I love Austen's work because she writes about familiar subjects - not just about love - but she had such a keen insight into human nature that I believe that her characters still exist in real life today.""

"A man holds a rainbow flag after taking part in the Pride Run in Shanghai in June. Homosexuality is legal in China, but authorities have implemented new rules which censor online videos featuring same sex relationships A crackdown on a wide range of internet videos by Chinese censors has caused a backlash on the country's popular micro-blogging site Sina Weibo, with many users objecting to a decision to ban content which features same-sex relationships. On Chinese social media, many were left angry, baffled, and upset: ""Aren't people born equal? ... What right do you have to discriminate against others?"" said one. Another commented: ""Aren't homosexuals normal? Why do you push them to a corner?"" The outcry was prompted a decision by Beijing regulators to censor the portrayal of homosexual activity in online videos. The regulations, which came into force at the beginning of July, classify homosexuality as ""abnormal"" sexual behaviour and cover not only explicit sexual content but any portrayal of same-sex relationships, positive or negative - for instance in popular online dramas. On Weibo, thehashtag,external""Online Content Review Discriminating [Against] Gays"" was viewed by millions and generated thousands of comments. And while the decision sparked the biggest backlash from Chinese social media users, the censorship extends further. There are 84 categories of material that were banned from online video programmes by Chinese censors, including prostitution, drug addiction, extra-marital affairs and what authorities deem to be ""unhealthy"" views of the family, relationships and money. A ban on the portrayal of ""erotic behaviour"" includes kisses which last for a long time. The guidance stipulates that all online content should help ""realize the China dream of a great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation."" A screenshot from Addicted, an online series that was censored after the new rules came into force One prominent voice who has criticised Chinese government censorship is Li Yinhe, China's first female sexologist and a well-known commentator on LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) issues. ""To [the government], homosexuality is regarded as obscene,"" she says, adding that the LGBT community is ""very angry."" Li Yinhe tells BBC Trending radio that when she recently wrote a piece calling on the government to end the censorship mechanism entirely, the article was taken down by Weibo censors just a few hours after publication. ""Well, this is the reality in China,"" she says. Beijing's 'snobbish' dating scene mocked LISTEN:on BBC Trending radio Visit BBC Trending onFacebook,external Listen:China's rush for divorce Under the latestguidelines,external, which were issued by the China Netcasting Services Association, at least two to three ""auditors"" will have to check all online content to make sure it adheres to the ""advanced culture of socialism."" The latest regulations are part of a wide campaign by the authorities to control discourse online through the censorship of a wide range of content including live streaming, news and social media. Just over a year ago Beijing issued a set of regulations which banned the portrayal of homosexuality on television as part of what they described as being a cultural crackdown on ""vulgar, immoral and unhealthy content."" A number of Chinese gay dating apps have also been shut down in the country - the mostrecent examplebeing the lesbian dating app Rela which had more than five million users and was shut down at the end of May this year. Homosexuality is not illegal in China, and was removed from an official list of mental disorders in 2001. Tim Hildebrandt, an assistant professor of social policy and development at the London School of Economics, says the recent censorship around homosexuality is surprising. ""Social acceptance of homosexuality had really gone up in China over the last five to 15 years,"" he says. ""Unlike a lot of places with institutionalised religion, it's not a place that has ever viewed homosexuality as inherently sinful. It's been viewed over time as an oddity, but not an inherent threat to society. The only threat it served was as one of non-conformity to a perfect model of the family."" Hildebrandt adds that the latest guidelines issued around homosexual content online are ""particularly worrisome."" ""Some might assume this is just about pornography,"" he says. ""This is not really the case. It's any portrayal of homosexuality in online videos. As to what that means for gay people in China, essentially the internet is one of the few safe spaces to meet others within the community. This is how people are meeting each other both in a platonic and romantic setting."" Wenxiong, a gay Chinese man who is currently studying in the US, says that the homosexuality ban online feels ""like the Cultural Revolution again."" ""We are seeing a group of people as a target of antagonism and people can say bad things about them, or insult them,"" he says. ""The government, aside from the regulations on LGBT content, is also issuing a lot of other cultural tightening regulations,"" he says. ""It's like Big Brother is watching you now. The government is telling you that you cannot have a gay life.""

"President Trump claims the news media isn't paying attention to real policy issues, like jobs, the economy, so-called Islamic State and the border. ""At some point the Fake News will be forced to discuss our great jobs numbers, strong economy, success with ISIS, the border & so much else!"" he tweeted. Six months into his presidency, how is he faring in these areas? And how much is he tweeting about these policy priorities? During the campaign, Mr Trump vowed to create 25 million jobs over 10 years and become ""the greatest jobs president... ever"". In the past he discredited US jobless figures, claiming the actual unemployment rate was over forty per cent.  Now he's America's CEO, he's embracing the same figures he once described as ""phony"". So, are the jobs numbers ""great"", as his tweet suggests? Yes - the jobs market is looking healthy, with the overall trend showing that unemployment is falling. The president is also right when he says there are more jobs around - in June 222,000 jobs were created. But this steady economic performance isn't a drastic change from what we saw under President Barack Obama, when job growth increased at a steady pace. One area where that growth isn't being matched is in wages, and there have been calls for President Trump to address this issue. This video can not be played Where did Trump the Outsourcing Slayer go? Then there's his promise to bring more jobs back to the US from overseas - a pledge which energised much of his base. Shortly after his election victory he spoke of how he had saved 1,100 jobs with the Indiana based air conditioner firm, Carrier.  Months later, 600 of those jobs are still moving to Mexico. Other companies like Ford are expanding production overseas, rather than in the US. Despite the president's assurances he would reverse what he described as ""job theft"" overseas, it's proving difficult. The latest growth figures, released since President Trump took office, showed a decline in the GDP rate (1.4%) in the first three months of this year, compared with the three months preceding (2.1%). It was one of the worst readings for nearly a year, but not necessarily bad news for President Trump, as economists say the first quarter of the year usually posts a lower rate. This video can not be played Fact-checking Trump's US economy boasts Overall, the president is correct when he characterises the US economy as ""strong"". Upward growth is part of a trend, in which the US economy has picked up since the financial crisis in 2008. The White House has set a growth target of 3%, but this does look like a challenge, as growth has only averaged less than 2% a year since 2001.  The Congressional Budget Office currently estimates growth at about 1.9%. This video can not be played Trump : 'I just don't want a poor person' running the US economy President Trump often boasts about how the stock market has risen since he took office. He can take credit for this in part. Some of the improvement in the markets can be attributed to anticipation that the president and the Republican pledge to reduce taxes and cut regulations will be implemented. But he's still not managed to pass tax reform laws. What will Trump's tax plan actually do? During the campaign Donald Trump didn't mince his words when it came to so-called Islamic State (IS), famously using an expletive to describe how much bombing he would carry out. He added: ""I'd just bomb those suckers. I'd blow up the pipes, I'd blow up the refineries, I'd blow up every single inch - there would be nothing left."" Back then Mr Trump was wary to reveal details but promised he had a ""secret plan"". Since entering office, he has ordered a review of US policy on IS. Despite criticising his predecessor's handling of the militant group (""he's the founder of ISIS""), the Trump administration's strategy is strikingly similar. It includes continuing strikes and targeted raids, more support to local forces, and freezing the assets of IS operatives. The goals are the same too - to take control of IS strongholds like Raqqa in Syria and Mosul in Iraq - and coalition forces have already seen success in the latter. But there are some key differences in tactics.  One is the decision to arm Syrian Kurds to help take Raqqa, despite objections from the Turkish government. The second is a tougher stance on ""annihilating"" IS fighters, which has led to a rise in the number of civilian casualties caught up in attacks. The third is that the Trump administration is authorising a far greater number of air strikes as it makes its push, and has ramped up operations against IS in Afghanistan, Yemen and Somalia. In Afghanistan his administration dropped the ""Mother of All Bombs"" to kill IS militants. And, when President Trump authorised a strike against a chemical weapons factory in Syria earlier this year, he showed he's not afraid to use military force when he feels it is necessary. It shows another key difference between him and his predecessor Barack Obama, who promised such action, but didn't deliver. Securing America's borders was the centrepiece of Donald Trump's election pitch. At campaign rallies he promised to crack down on illegal immigrants in the US, with his focus on criminals. He often raised the case of Kate Steinle, a young woman from Seattle who was killed by an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times. Six things that could topple Trump's wall At the end of June he introduced ""Kate's law"" which would increase penalties for immigrants who re-enter the US after they've been deported.  It was passed by the House of Representatives, and will now come before the Senate. In the president's first 100 days, more than 41,000 people were arrested on the suspicion they were in the US illegally, an increase on the previous year.  About 10,800 had no criminal conviction, compared with 4,200 the previous year. This video can not be played US immigration raids leave many 'afraid to open the door' But despite his tough talk on the issue, President Trump actually deported fewer people in his first 100 days than Barack Obama. In Trump's first 100 days 54,564 people were deported, compared with 62,062 for the same time period in the previous year under his predecessor. And let's not forget Donald Trump's plans to tighten the border even further - his flagship plan to ""build a wall"" is moving along. Companies have until September to pitch their prototypes. At a recent rally in Iowa, the president said it could be a ""solar wall"" which would pay for itself. This video can not be played How will President Trump deliver on border wall promise? For months the president's travel ban was blocked by the courts and failed to become law. After a decision by the US Supreme Court in June, it's partially in effect, but it's not as drastic. Visitors from the six designated countries can still enter, if they have a bona fide connection to the US.

"Emannuel Macron: Can anyone in the UK emulate his success? New political parties have a remarkably high failure rate in the UK. They almost never succeed - but are things different now? The success of new French President Emmanuel Macron, who created a liberal pro-European party of government, En Marche, from scratch in less than two years, has made some people wonder if it could happen in the UK. Conventional wisdom says a fresh face could never rise so rapidly to the top - the first-past-the-post electoral system is biased in favour of the existing ""big two"" parties, the argument goes. But politics is more fast-moving and fluid than it has ever been and there appears, to some at least, to be a gap in the market. ""The Tories are committing Euro-suicide. Labour is kidding itself that a party with no economic policy can govern. There is a chasm in the middle of British politics,"" wrote Tony Blair's former speech writer Philip Collins recently in the Times. En Marche of the Day: Gary Lineker is looking for a political home Dominic Cummings, who masterminded the Vote Leave campaign, said on Twitter this week that a new party looks increasingly ""tempting"" (although he does not spell out what it might stand for). Even Gary Lineker has got in on the act. ""Anyone else feel politically homeless? Everything seems far right or way left. Something sensibly centrist might appeal?"" Lineker asked Twitter recently. Within minutes, one of the Match-of-the-Day-presenter's followers had called for the creation of En Marche of the Day, with the ex-England footballer as leader, naturally. Anti-Brexit Conservative MP Anna Soubry sounded like she could hardly wait for the birth of a new party ina New Statesman interview,external. ""If it could somehow be the voice of a moderate, sensible, forward-thinking, visionary middle way, with open minds - actually things which I've believed in all my life - better get on with it."" But she was speaking before the general election. The Corbyn surge has silenced talk of a Labour breakaway for now Jeremy Corbyn's better-than-expected performance at the general election has killed off any talk of new parties in the Labour ranks, for now. ""Moderate"" Labour MPs who thought Mr Corbyn was leading their party to oblivion have been forced to eat their words and rally behind him, as he agitates for another general election. But the truce may be temporary, says Prof Tim Bale, of London's Queen Mary university, with continued ""scepticism"" among Labour MPs about ""whether the direction Jeremy Corbyn is taking the Labour Party can actually get it into government in the long term"". ""I don't think the split between the Parliamentary Labour Party and Jeremy Corbyn has gone away. It's probably gone underground for a little bit but it hasn't disappeared,"" he adds. Sir Vince Cable offers a friendly welcome to Labour ""refugees"" ""Why don't you join the Liberals?"" is the taunt currently being directed at ""moderate"" Labour MPs by the more hard core Corbynistas. Lib Dem leader elect Sir Vince Cable has said he would happily provide shelter for ""refugees"" from Labour but he is directing his energy towards ""cross-party"" working to scupper what he regards as Theresa May's ""hard"" Brexit. With just 12 MPs, he knows that this is his party's best hope of wielding any real influence, for now. Tony Blair: It's a ""new policy platform"", not a party, OK? If launching a new party is too hard, why not launch something that looks a bit like a new party but isn't? Something that could, perhaps, be quickly turned into one if the time was right. Earlier this year, Tony Blair launched a ""new policy platform to refill the wide open space in the middle of politics"". The former Labour prime minister insisted his Institute for Global Change was more than a think tank, saying it will arm politicians with policies to ""rebuild"" the centre ground and combat the growth of right wing populism. Former Lib Dem leader, Lord Ashdown, has, meanwhile, helped to set up More United, an organisation inspired by the words of murdered Labour MP Jo Cox, who famously appealed for tolerance in her maiden Commons speech. More United pumped some fairly serious cash into the campaigns of mainly Labour and Lib Dem MPs - the sole Tory was Anna Soubry - at this year's general election. The money was raised through crowdfunding and the MPs who got elected, and who had signed up to More United's policy agenda - tolerance, ""working with the EU"" and fighting inequality - areproudly displayed on the group's website,external, sans party branding. Robert Kilroy-Silk: He ran out of parties to join Recent British politics is littered with the remains of dead parties. Here are just a few of them: Libertas- Ambitious attempt to set up a pan-European party by Irish telecom magnate Declan Ganley. Won one European Parliament seat in France. Veritas- Where Robert Kilroy-Silk went when he stormed out of UKIP. Merged with another Eurosceptic fringe outfit, the English Democrats, after Kilroy-Silk's departure. NO2EU- Late rail union leader Bob Crow's bid to make the left-wing case for leaving the EU. Morphed into a trade-unions-against-the-EU campaign. The Jury Team- Late millionaire Tory donor Sir Paul Judge poured money into independent candidates. Few were elected. Your Party- An early stab at crowd sourcing policies by a group of marketing executives. Met with apathy and quietly killed off. Nigel Farage: Owes it all to the European Parliament? It is not all doom - small parties can and do break through on to the national stage in the UK. The public are willing to give them a hearing in a way that they never did in the past - witness the seven-way debates at election time and the extraordinary rise of the SNP. But the ones that succeed tend to be born in the angry margins, speaking up for voters who feel their views are being ignored by the mainstream. The ""centre ground"" tends to be the preserve of political insiders, who can come with a lot of unhelpful baggage. UKIP and the Green Party both built successful grass-roots movements from the ground up, gaining their first foothold in the European Parliament, which uses a form of proportional representation and is therefore kinder to smaller parties. Neither has been able to get more than one MP elected at Westminster, however. To do that, you probably still need to attract significant numbers of MPs from other parties, to make you look like a serious contender for power. Like the SDP did. The Gang of Four: Cheer up, it might never happen They were going to ""break the mould of British politics"" and for a brief period it looked like they might just do it. The Social Democratic Party (SDP) was formed in the early 1980s by a group of high-profile Labour MPs disillusioned with the ""hard left"" direction their party was taking. The new ""centre ground"" force soared in the opinion polls and eventually recruited 28 Labour MPs, and one Tory, to its ranks. Their efforts to gain power through an alliance with the Liberal Party succeeded in getting a quarter of votes at the 1983 election, but, thanks to first-past-the-post voting, that only translated into 23 MPs. They had a similar result in 1987 prompting moves which ended up with a merger with the older party - to form what would become the Liberal Democrats. The Lib Dems went on to get more than 50 MPs at later elections but the party has so far failed to match their 1980s vote share. SDP leader Steve Winstone: Yes, it is still a thing The SDP never quite died. David Owen's party lives on, minus David Owen or any of the original ""gang of four"" founders, its flickering flame kept alive by a handful of diehards who never accepted the merger with the Liberals and new members attracted by what they see as its ""sensible"", centrist message. ""Just because we failed once, it doesn't mean we are going to fail again,"" says SDP leader Steve Winstone, a former UKIP election candidate. Today's SDP, which got fewer than 500 votes at the general election, is all about ""direct democracy"", electoral reform and regional government. It is based in Sheffield and claims to be growing quickly. The Liberal Party also survived the 1988 merger. Its leader, Steve Radford, got 2,000 more votes than the Liberal Democrat candidate at this year's general election in the Liverpool, West Derby constituency, although still finished third. He looks forward to the creation of a new centre ground party at Westminster because it would ""take a great weight off our shoulders"", ending the public's confusion between the Liberal Democrat ""defectors"" and his own party, which he says is the true home of ""liberalism"". ""They (the Lib Dems) have damaged our brand,"" he tells BBC News. The SDP and the Liberal Party are both in favour of Brexit because, they say, the people voted for it. Neither leader would discuss the size of their parties' membership, but it is not a large number.  Oh, and - 80s nostalgists take note - Steve Winstone has not ruled out an alliance with the Liberals to fight for electoral reform... Is there anybody out there who could lead a new party? So, if building a movement from the grass roots is a non-starter, if you have ambitions of running the country, but launching a new party with the same old, tarnished Westminster faces is likely to turn voters off, then what exactly would it take? ""You would need at least 100 or so MPs,"" and it would need to be a ""spectacular"" and game-changing coup, says Prof Tim Bale. ""It would need to be exciting enough - and big enough and sexy enough - to convince people."" A charismatic leader, without too much baggage (sorry, Tony) is a must. And timing would be everything. If the launch is too far from the next general election, the shine could come off and the whole enterprise come crashing to the ground before anyone gets a chance to vote for it, says Prof Bale. The disappointing performance of the Lib Dems at the general election suggests a new party would need to have a broader policy agenda than just being against Brexit, he adds. ""It still seems to me to be unlikely. But we do live in interesting times so I wouldn't rule anything out.""

He was part of the team which discovered the first ocean ""garbage patch"" in the North Pacific gyre in 1997 and has now turned his attention to the South Pacific. Although plastic is known to occur in the Southern Hemisphere gyres, very few scientists have visited the region to collect samples. Oceanographer Dr Erik van Sebille, from Utrecht University, says the work of Capt Moore and his colleagues will help fill ""a massive knowledge gap"" in our understanding of ocean plastics. ""Any data we can get our hands on is good data at this point,"" he told BBC News. Capt Moore explained that the space occupied by sub-tropical gyres - areas of the ocean surrounded by circulating ocean currents - is approximately the same size as the entire land mass of the Earth, but they are now being ""populated by our trash"". The phenomenon of oceanic garbage patches was originally documented in the North Pacific, but plastic has now been found in the South Pacific, Arctic and Mediterranean. ""It's hard not to find plastic in the ocean any more,"" Dr van Sebille said. ""That's quite shocking"". Capt Charles Moore has been searching the ocean for plastic since 1997 Capt Moore is the founder of Algalita Marine Research, a non-profit organisation aiming to combat the ""plastic plague"" of garbage floating in the world's oceans. For more than 30 years, he has transported scientists to the centre of remote debris patches aboard his research ship, Alguita. Dragging nets behind the vessel, the crew sieves particles of plastic from the ocean, which are then counted and fed into estimates of global microplastic distribution. Although scientists agree that plastic pollution is a widespread problem, the exact distribution of these rafts of ocean garbage is still unclear. ""If we don't understand where the plastic is, then we don't really understand what harm it does and we can't really work on solving the problem,""  said Dr van Sebille. Capt Moore and his crew hope to address this lack of data through their research trips. On this latest voyage, Capt Moore and his colleagues are also investigating how plastic in the South Pacific Ocean may be threatening the survival of fish. Lanternfish, that live in the deep ocean, are an important part of the diet of whales, squid and king penguins and the Algalita team says that plastic ingestion by lanternfish could have a domino effect on the rest of the food chain. Christiana Boerger, a marine biologist in the US Navy, who has worked with the organisation, told BBC News that the problem of plastic consumption in fish can be ""out of sight, out of mind"". Most of the plastic is made up of tiny pieces floating at the surface She explained that ""scientists need to actually travel to these accumulation zones"" in order to bring the issue to the world's attention. Ms Boerger has seen the impact of oceanic garbage patches first hand, aboard the Alugita and she says that some fish species ""have more man-made plastic in their stomach than their natural food"". Globally, most of the plastic that ends up in the oceans comes from the land. Litter is typically transported offshore by currents, which then form large revolving bodies of water, or gyres. But Capt Moore says the South Pacific garbage patch is different from those in the Northern Hemisphere, because most of the litter appears to have come from the fishing industry. Elsewhere, scientists are shifting their attention away from remote mid-ocean garbage patches to locations closer to home. ""If you think about plastic in terms of its impact, where does it harm marine life?"" Dr van Sebille posed. ""Near coastlines is where biology suffers. It's also where the economy suffers the most."" Dr van Sebille also says that future research efforts need to focus on ecologically sensitive regions along the continental shelf. Even though the garbage patches cover a very large area ""they are not that ecologically important"", he said. Our plastic rubbish has floated to islands that are thousands of miles from the nearest human population His team has previously studied the risk of plastics to marine animals, including turtles and sea birds. ""Every time, we found that the risk is mostly outside of the garbage patches,"" he warned. In the future, Dr van Sebille hopes to understand more about how plastic ends up on the coastline and is then subsequently transported to the oceans by storms. Interrupting this process might be an important mechanism for halting the growth of ocean garbage patches. ""A beach clean-up might turn out to be a very efficient way of cleaning up the ocean,"" he suggests. In the meantime, humanity's love affair with plastic is unlikely to end soon. Plastic ""will never be the enemy"", concedes Capt Moore, ""It has too many uses"". He explained that plastic pollution travels across national borders, so dealing with it required international collaboration. Are your clothes polluting the ocean? Plastic oceans: What do we know?

"A promotional image for 2013's 50th anniversary special, The Day of the Doctor Doctor Who's Peter Capaldi has passed on his sonic screwdriver to Jodie Whittaker who becomes the 13th doctor and first woman to take on the role of television's famous Time Lord. She follows a distinguished line-up of thespian (male) talent that stretches all the way back to the sci-fi favourite's first episode in 1963. William Hartnellwas the first actor to play the Doctor on television, appearing in the BBC show from 1963 to 1966. Hartnell, who died in 1975, had previously appeared in TV's The Army Game and Carry On Sergeant, the first Carry On film, in 1958. While Hartnell was playing the Doctor on television,Peter Cushingcould be found playing him on film in Dr Who and the Daleks, in which Roy Castle co-starred. That 1965 film and its 1966 follow-up, Daleks - Invasion Earth: 2150 A.D., depicted the Doctor as a human scientist rather than a time-travelling Gallifreyan and are not considered part of the Doctor Who timeline. When ill health forced Hartnell to relinquish the role, the Doctor regenerated - for the first time - intoPatrick Troughton. Memorably scruffy and eccentric, Troughton spent three years travelling time and space before stepping down in 1969. When the raffishJon Pertweebecame the third Doctor, he also became the first to be seen on television in colour. His tenure, which ran from 1970 to 1974, saw the Time Lord exiled to Earth and working with Unit, aka the United Nations Intelligence Taskforce. Pertwee's time with the show also saw the first of the popular ensemble stories in which previous Doctors appear alongside the current one. Broadcast over December 1972 and January 1973, The Three Doctors saw him joined by Patrick Troughton and William Hartnell in what would be the latter's final acting engagement. When Pertwee moved on in 1974,Tom Bakermoved in - and would become the longest-serving Doctor to date. Deep-voiced, curly-haired and eternally long of scarf, his seven years in the Tardis earned him legions of fans who were delighted anew in 2013 when he popped up at the end of a 50th anniversary special. When Baker finally stepped down from the role in 1981, his shoes were filled by the fresh-facedPeter Davison. The boyish actor spent three years as the Fifth Doctor before taking his leave at the end of the show's 21st series. Davison's tenure coincided with Doctor Who's 20th anniversary, celebrated by a feature-length special that saw him joined by Jon Pertwee and Patrick Troughton. The First Doctor also made an appearance, with Richard Hurndall filling in for the late William Hartnell. Tom Baker opted not to return for The Five Doctors, which covered over his absence by incorporating material from one of the actor's unbroadcast adventures. Similar subterfuge was required for this 1983 photo shoot, which saw Hurndall, Davison, Pertwee and Troughton joined by an unconvincing Baker mannequin. Davison's departure opened the door for another Baker to take controls of the Doctor's time-travelling police box in 1984. Colin Baker(no relation of Tom's) spent less than three years in the role, with his appearances limited further by an 18-month hiatus in production. Though Baker had limited time to enjoy the Tardis, he did get the chance to meet one of his predecessors when Patrick Troughton returned - for the third time - in 1985. The Two Doctors marked Troughton's final reprise of his signature role. Some years later, his sons David and Michael would both make Doctor Who appearances. Scottish actorSylvester McCoytook over from Colin Baker in 1987 and played the Doctor until the show's axing in 1989. Michael Grade - the controller of BBC One at the time - was no fan of the programme, which was looking increasingly threadbare and cheap-looking in the face of glossier cinema fare. Some feel, though, that this period in the show's evolution has beenharshly judged. An attempt was made to revive Doctor Who in 1996 with a TV film that saw McCoy regenerate intoPaul McGannon American soil. It was hoped the special would spawn a TV series but it never materialised, making McGann's tenure the shortest of all the Doctors. In 2005 Doctor Who regenerated into the ambitious, well-financed property it is today. It also introduced a new Doctor in the form ofChristopher Eccleston. To the disappointment of many, the Salford-born actor chose to make only one series of the rebooted show. His departurewas confirmed,externalonly days after his debut episode was broadcast. Eccleston's exit sawDavid Tennantjoin the show, with his first full episode - The Christmas Invasion - shown on BBC One on Christmas Day 2005. Tennant's amiable style and enthusiasm made him a popular choice for the role, which he finally relinquished on the first day of 2010. The spate of junior Doctors continued with the casting ofMatt Smith, who was just 27 when he made his debut as the Time Lord's 11th incarnation. His four years in the role, which coincided with Doctor Who's 50th anniversary, saw the programme both maintain and bolster its renewed popularity. Doctor Who's 50th anniversary in 2013 was marked by The Day of the Doctor, a feature-length special in which Matt Smith's Time Lord was joined by David Tennant's version of the character. The Day of the Doctor also introduced a previously unknown incarnation of the Doctor, known as The War Doctor and played bySir John Hurt. The character rejected referring to himself as 'The Doctor' and is not considered to have the same status as his fellow TV Time Lords. Peter Capaldiwas no stranger to the Doctor Who universe when he was cast as the Doctor in 2013. A lifelong fan of the show, he appeared in an episode of the programme in 2008 and also had a role in its spin-off Torchwood. His hawkish features brought a new intensity, and maturity, to the Tardis from the moment his first full episode was broadcast in August 2014. Capaldi's most recent adventure saw him briefly joined by the ""original"" Doctor, played on this occasion byDavid Bradley. Bradley will return in this year's Doctor Who Christmas special. Bradley's appearance was a pleasing one for Whovians after his role as William Hartnell in An Adventure in Space and Time, a 2013 dramatisation of the show's early years. Jodie Whittakerhas been named as the 13th Doctor and will be the first woman to play the role - if one discounts Joanna Lumley, who briefly played the Doctor in a 1999Comic Relief sketch,external. Whittaker will make her debut on the sci-fi show this Christmas when Peter Capaldi regenerates. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

"Rip currents can catch out even experienced swimmers A group of youth footballers were rescued from the water near Bundoran, County Donegal, on Saturday after being swept out to sea and into rocks by a rip current. The Fermanagh Super Cup team had been training on Tullan Strand on Saturday morning and had entered the water to cool down after their session. Surfers helped the footballers to safety. An inshore lifeboat and a Sligo based rescue helicopter attended the scene. The lifeboat crew gave first aid to eight of the players, some whom were bruised and had swallowed sea water, before ambulances arrived. A number of the casualties were taken to Sligo University Hospital as a precaution. How rip currents work Surviving a deadly rip current The chairperson of County Fermanagh Super Cup NI Dessie Kerr has confirmed that their premier team were on a ""team building exercise"" in the area. He said: ""We are pleased to say that all the boys are alright. ""Our attention at this minute is making sure that the boys are looked after and in time we will look at exactly what happened."" ""We are glad and relieved that all involved have now returned home safely and we will be supporting all affected, in any way that we can, over the coming days,"" he added. Following the incident, Bundoran RNLI helm James Cassidy warned potential visitors to the area about the dangers of rip currents. ""We would remind locals and visitors alike that Tullan Strand and particularly the area along the cliffs is notorious for rip currents and under currents and is really not suitable for swimming,"" he said. ""Rips are strong currents running out to sea which can catch even the most experienced beachgoers out. ""Should you get caught in a rip, the best advice is to stay calm and don't panic. If you can stand, wade. Don't try to swim. ""If you have an inflatable or board, keep hold of it to help you float. Raise your hand and shout for help loudly. Don't swim directly against the rip or you will get exhausted."" He added that people should ""swim parallel to the beach until free of the rip, then make for shore"".

"A moped ridden by three teenagers was in collision with a police car at the junction of South Park Road and Trinity Road in Wimbledon A 16-year-old boy is in a critical condition after a collision between a police car and a moped being ridden by three teenagers in south-west London. The crash happened at 02:15 BST on Sunday in South Park Road, Wimbledon. All three boys were taken to a south London hospital for treatment. The moped was believed to have been involved in an attempted robbery and was being monitored by the National Police Air Service helicopter, said the Metropolitan Police. A second 16-year-old suffered a serious injury to his leg and a 15-year-old sustained minor injuries. All three were arrested at the scene and two large knives were recovered. The moped had been reported to police as lost or stolen, on 12 July. The Met said the Directorate of Professionals Standards has been informed and the incident had been referred to the police watchdog. In a statement, the Met said the moped was not being ""pursued by police vehicles on the ground"" at the time of the collision but ""was monitored by police helicopter"".

"This video can not be played Speaking in Paris, Mr Netanyahu warned of the rise of ""extremist forces"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in Paris to commemorate the victims of a mass arrest of Jews in Nazi-occupied France in 1942. More than 13,000 Jews were rounded up and detained at a cycling stadium, the Velodrome d'Hiver, before being deported to Nazi death camps. Mr Netanyahu also held direct talks for the first time with French President Emmanuel Macron. He is the first Israeli prime minister to attend the Vel d'Hiv commemorations. ""I'm here to mourn the victims,"" Mr Netanyahu told an audience in Paris, which included Jewish groups and Holocaust survivors. ""Seventy-five years ago, a heavy darkness descended on this city... It seems the values of the French revolution - equality, fraternity, liberty - was crushed brutally under the boot of anti-Semitism."" He hailed the ""great, great human beings"" who had risked their lives to save Jews in France during Nazi occupation, and warned of a rise in ""extremist forces"" in modern society. More than 13,000 Jews were arrested by French police on 16 and 17 July 1942. About 4,000 were children. France's Jewish deportation documented New Holocaust row for French far right This photo taken in 1942 shows Jewish deportees in the Drancy transit camp before being sent to Auschwitz The families were taken to the Velodrome D'Hiver, a cycling stadium near the Eiffel Tower, or an internment camp set up just outside the capital at Drancy. They were then deported by train, mostly to Auschwitz concentration camp. Fewer than 100 people survived. The episode remains controversial in France. Marine Le Pen, Mr Macron's far-right opponent in this year's election, drew strong criticism on 9 April when she suggested France was not responsible for the tragedy. But speaking at the ceremony on Sunday, President Macron reaffirmed that ""it was France that organised"" the mass arrest, deportations and therefore ""the death of 13,152 people of Jewish faith"". ""Not a single German"" took part, he said. After the ceremony, Mr Netanyahu and Mr Macron met for direct discussions on subjects including security and the fight against extremism. In a joint statement with Mr Netanyahu, Mr Macron (right) said he hoped ""everything will be done"" for the resumption of peace talks Mr Netanyahu's last official visit to France was to attendthe unity marchfollowing the attacks on satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, police officers, and a kosher supermarket in January 2015. On Sunday Mr Netanyahu said he would like to see greater cooperation between the two countries and ""expressed his concerns about the Iranian regime"". At a joint news conference, Mr Macron assured his visitor of his ""vigilance"" regarding the nuclear accord reached by Western powers with Iran in 2015. Calling for a resumption of peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians, he reiterated France's support for a two-state solution and opposition to Israel's building of settlements in occupied territory. President Macron met Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas in Paris earlier this month. The meeting with Mr Netanyahu comes amid concerns of another increase in violence. Two Israeli policemen werekilled and a third wounded by three Israeli Arabsin a gun attack close to the compound in Jerusalem known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif on Friday. The attackers were later killed by security forces. The holy site was closed after shooting but it reopened on Sunday. Israel and the Palestinians have not held peace talks for three years.

"This video can not be played First-time Labour candidate Emily Owen received abuse through social media British politics is at a ""dangerous moment"" with the level of personal abuse aimed at election candidates having reached a ""tipping point"", the head of the standards watchdog says. Lord Bew warned the level of vitriol was now such that it could deter people from running for office. Labour MP Diane Abbott said this week she had endured a torrent of ""mindless"" racist and sexist abuse. MPs have blamed hard-left and far-right groups and the rise of social media. During a parliamentary debate on Wednesday,MPs from all parties spoke about the harassment they and their staff had receivedboth in person and online, including death threats, rape threats and anti-Semitic abuse. Conservative MP Simon Hart said he had heard of candidates having swastikas painted on their offices, and that the ""hashtag Tory scum had become a regular feature of our lives"" on social media. First-time candidate Emily Owen, who stood for Labour in Aberconwy in this year's general election, has also spoken out about the sexually explicit messages she received online. ""I started having messages come through and they quickly became very explicit, with people explaining what they wanted to do to me - with or without my consent - asking lots of questions, what I would do to get votes,"" the 22-year-old told BBC Breakfast. Using strong and graphic language, Ms Abbott gave the debate examples of the offensive messages she and her staff had to endure every day, not just at election time, including people tweeting she should be hung. This video can not be played Diane Abbott describes 'racist, sexist' abuse Theresa May has asked Lord Bew, who chairs the Committee on Standards in Public Life, to look into what went on during the election campaign and whether existing laws need to be strengthened to protect candidates in future. In an interview withBBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour,Lord Bew said there was a problem in public life that had not been seen before. ""We are in a bad moment and we have to respond to it,"" he said. ""We cannot afford to lose people of quality in our public life and we may be approaching a tipping point."" Lord Bew says his committee will not rule anything out but it can only make recommendations Conservative MPs say Jeremy Corbyn has been too slow to condemn the actions of left-wing activists, including members of the Momentum pressure group, who they claim have been targeting them as well some Labour MPs. Momentum has denied any involvement whatsoever. Lord Bew said it was ""absolutely clear"" that the Labour leadership believed there was no place for threats or fear in politics but that political leaders, as a whole, needed to be more outspoken on the issue. ""Above all, we do need leadership from Parliament itself on this point. We have reached a point where this is not a sermon. This has got to be said with some sharpness."" The committee, he added, was ""in listening mode"" and would not rule out anything at this stage. ""It's perfectly obvious that the ways in which the culture of civility in this country has been eroded has come from a number of different sources. ""And we need to see if we can find ways of getting a tone in our public debate which is still vigorous but avoids that tinge of nastiness and hatred which has definitely entered into things in more recent times.""

"This video can not be played A survivor describes how a wall fell directly onto the crowd A wall collapsed at a football stadium in Senegal on Saturday, killing eight people and injuring almost 90. It fell in after fighting began between rival fans and police responded with tear gas, with a stampede ensuing. Stade de Mbour were playing Union Sportive Ouakam at the Demba Diop stadium in the capital Dakar. The country has suspended all sporting and cultural events for the rest of the month. During the clashes, home fans threw projectiles including stones at others. Pictures circulating online appear to show people scrambling over a low wall amid clouds of gas. Passions were high at the game, the League Cup final. With the score 1-1 after 90 minutes, Mbour took a goal in the first period of extra time to win 2-1, and violence broke out at the final whistle. Cheikh Maba Diop, whose friend died in the incident and who helped move people out of the stadium, told AFP news agency: ""All of a sudden when the wall fell... we knew exactly that some of our own had lost their lives because the wall fell directly on to people."" A spokesman for President Macky Sall said campaigning for upcoming elections would be suspended on Sunday as a mark of respect, and that there should be ""punishments serving as a warning"". There are also suggestions that the stadium itself was in a poor state of repair, BBC Africa reporter James Copnall says. An enquiry announced by the government will no doubt examine all this, he adds.

"This video can not be played ""My helmet saved me,"" says London acid attack victim Jabed Hussain People who carry out acid attacks in England and Wales could face longer jail terms as part of a ""wide-ranging"" review, following a rise in incidents. Perpetrators can already face a life sentence, but Home Secretary Amber Ruddtold the Sunday Times,externalshe wanted them to ""feel the full force of the law"". ""Life sentences must not be reserved for acid attack survivors,"" she said. There are calls to tighten laws for the sale and possession of acid after five attacks in a night in London. According to the Home Office, carrying out an attack with a corrosive substance can already result in a prison sentence of up to life, depending on the nature of the charges. Being found in possession of acid, with intent to carry out an attack, can mean a sentence of up to four years. What has led to the rise in acid attacks? How to treat a chemical burn Announcing the plans, Ms Rudd said: ""Acid attacks are horrific crimes which have a devastating effect on victims, both physically and emotionally."" She said it was ""vital that we do everything to prevent these sickening attacks"". ""The law in this area is already strong, with acid attackers facing up to a life sentence in certain cases. But we can and will improve our response."" And she said she would ensure everyone working within the criminal justice system has the power to ""punish severely"" acid attackers. Politicians and acid attack survivors have called for tougher sentences on perpetrators, and MPs are alsodue to debate,externalthe issue in the Commons on Monday. The review will look at existing laws, the response of police, sentencing, how people access harmful products and the support offered to acid attack victims. Assaults involving corrosive substances have more than doubled in England since 2012 to 504 in 2016-17, according to a Freedom of Information request to police forces by the BBC. Separately, the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) said more than 400 acid or corrosive substance attacks were carried out in England and Wales in the six months to April 2017. Where the age of the offender was known, one in five was younger than 18. A 16-year-old boy has beencharged in connection with the attacksin London on Thursday. Whether judges have sufficient sentencing powers to deal with acid attack perpetrators New guidance for police officers on preventing attacks, searching potential perpetrators and helping victims at the scene The Poisons Act 1972 will be assessed for whether it should cover more acids and harmful substances Crown Prosecution Service guidance to prosecutors - and how they class acid and corrosive substances as ""dangerous weapons"" - will be reviewed Retailers to agree measures to restrict sales of acids and other corrosive substances New research to understand the motivations for carrying out acid attacks Ensuring victim impact statements are completed in every case by the police Confirming appropriate support is provided to victims - including the initial medical response, giving evidence in court and long-term recovery Monday's Commons debate will be led by Labour MP Stephen Timms, who is calling for carrying acid to be made a crime - similar to carrying a knife. Under the current law, if police stop someone carrying acid they have to prove intent to cause harm. Acid attack survivor Katie Piper has said victims face a ""life sentence"" and also called on tougher sentencing to act as a deterrent. In a letter published in the Scars, Burns & Healing medical journal on Thursday, she said: ""I will continue to need operations and therapy for life. For acid attack survivors, the aftermath is a life sentence."" Ms Piper's attacker was given a life sentence, with a minimum of six years, while the man who organised the attack was also imprisoned for life, to serve a minimum of 16 years. Another measure in the government's plan includes ensuring that police record victim impact statements so courts are made aware of the ""full impact"" of the attack. Acid attack survivor Katie Piper said the aftermath was a ""life sentence"" for victims Sarah Newton, minister for crime, safeguarding and vulnerability, told BBC 5live this was not a ""new crime"", but ""has been escalating in London"". ""Unfortunately, these substances are used in so-called honour-based violence, in domestic violence, and by gangs in retribution. ""It's not a clear picture, so we need to get more intelligence, more data together."" She had admitted that tighter regulations would be difficult to enforce because ""these chemicals are under everyone's kitchen sinks"". Assistant Chief Constable Rachel Kearton, the NPCC's lead for corrosive attacks, also said it was ""virtually impossible"" to ban the sale of all corrosive substances. Bleach, ammonia and acid were the most commonly used substances, according to the NPCC. She said: ""We are working closely with the Home Office and retailers to determine how we can keep these products from people who intend to cause harm. ""Police have dealt with a number of high-profile cases in recent months and we continue to collect data from police forces across England and Wales to understand the scale and extent of these attacks and develop our ability to support and protect victims.""

"Maria Victoria Barros is a politician in Parana state A Brazilian politician has accused left-wing protesters of physically and verbally abusing her wedding guests over her family's support for President Michel Temer. Maria Victoria Barros, 25, is a member of the state assembly in Parana and daughter of Mr Temer's health minister. Hundreds of demonstrators gathered outside the church where the ceremony was taking place on Friday evening. Pelted with eggs, she had to leave the church protected by riot police. The lavish ceremony attracted the state's political elite, including her father, Ricardo Barros, and her mother, Cida Borghetti, Parana's deputy governor. At least 30 members of the Brazilian Congress were invited to travel from the capital Brasilia for the wedding in the Parana state capital, Curitiba. Demonstrators carried anti-government signs and shouted slogans at Ms Barros, accusing her of being a ""coup plotter"". Footage posted on YouTube shows security guards opening umbrellas to try to protect the bride and groom as they left the Church of the Rosary. The bride's father, Ricardo Barros (right), has been in Mr Temer's cabinet since May 2016 A detachment of riot police was eventually called in to protect the newly-weds and their guests. Ms Barros said the protest was linked to her mother's recent decision to run for state governor and had been ""financed by left-wing parties and unions"". She regretted the attacks against some of the guests but added: ""This is the price of democracy"". The incident is another illustration of how split and bitter Brazilian politics has become since the impeachment last year of Mr Temer's predecessor, Dilma Rousseff. During the impeachment trial, Ms Rousseff described the move as a right-wing coup, supported by her vice-president at the time, Mr Temer. Supporters of her Workers' Party were further angered by theconviction of former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silvaon Wednesday to nine years and six months in jail for corruption. Lula has rejected claims that he received an apartment as a bribe in a corruption scandal linked to state oil company Petrobras. He has appealed against the verdict, saying the trial was politically-motivated, aimed at preventing him from running for office again next year. Lula served eight years as president until 2011. Federal Judge Sergio Moro, from Parana state, ruled that he could remain free pending an appeal.

"This video can not be played Chancellor Philip Hammond tells Andrew Marr: ""Cabinet meetings are supposed to be a private space"" Public sector workers get a 10% ""premium"" over their private sector counterparts, Philip Hammond said as he warned ministers against leaking cabinet talks on the pay cap. The chancellor refused to comment on reports he had said at a meeting that public servants were ""overpaid"". And he suggested some colleagues who do not agree with his approach on Brexit were trying to undermine him. Minister Liam Fox said he ""deplored"" the briefing by some of his colleagues. The international trade secretary told the BBC's Sunday Politics they should ""be very quiet"" and ""stick to their own departmental duties"", adding: ""Our backbenchers are furious and the only people smiling at this will be in Berlin and Paris."" Reality Check: Is public sector pay higher? Since the general election, cabinet splits have surfaced over the issue of the 1% cap on public sector pay rises, with some ministers pressing for it to be lifted. Labour is promising Â£4bn which it says would offer a pay rise to workers. On the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Hammond defended his stance, saying public sector pay had ""raced ahead"" of the private sector after the economic crash in 2008. While in terms of salary alone, that gap had now closed, he continued, when ""very generous"" pension contributions were taken into account, the 10% disparity between public and private salaries was a ""simple fact"". This video can not be played John McDonnell produces a cleaner's payslip to challenge Philip Hammond Asked about aSunday Times,externalreport claiming he had said the former were ""overpaid"", the chancellor insisted he was not going to discuss what was and wasn't said in a cabinet meeting. ""I do think on many fronts it would be helpful if my colleagues - all of us - focused on the job at hand,"" he said. He added: ""If you want my opinion, some of the noise is generated by people who are not happy with the agenda that I have, over the last few weeks, tried to advance, of ensuring that we achieve a Brexit which is focused on protecting our economy, protecting our jobs and making sure that we can have continued rising living standards in the future."" Mr Fox, one of the leading Brexit campaigners in the cabinet, rejected press reports he had clashed with Mr Hammond over the EU, saying the two had a ""very good working relationship"". ""I don't know where the briefing is coming from, but I do know it's got to stop,"" he said. He added: ""I think there's too much self-indulgence, and I think people need to have less prosecco and have a longer summer holiday."" Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith criticised those briefing against Prime Minister Theresa May, saying: ""Just for once shut up, for God's sake, and let everybody else get on with the business of governing."" Pay rises for most public sector workers are set by independent pay review bodies, but have effectively been capped at 1% each year since 2013. Before that, there was a two-year freeze on pay for all but the lowest-paid workers. The government has come under pressure over the policy since the general election, with some Conservative ministers speaking out in favour of lifting the cap. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Labour would spend Â£4bn on ending the cap, insisting this would be enough to give a real-terms increase for public sector workers. Pay review bodies would be asked to come up with an ""honest judgement"" and a Labour government would follow their advice, he said. On Pienaar's Politics on BBC Radio 5 live, First Secretary of State Damian Green was asked whether Mr Hammond said public sector workers were ""overpaid"". ""I'm not going to report from inside cabinet because cabinet ministers should not do that,"" he said. ""But the chancellor does not think that public sector workers are overpaid - the government obviously respects the millions of people who do really important jobs.""

"Scotland's Brexit Minister Mike Russell has written to MSPs seeking support Scotland's Brexit Minister Mike Russell has urged MSPs to back calls for changes to the repeal bill to guarantee protection for devolved powers. The legislation,externalwill convert EU law into British law. First minister Nicola Sturgeon has described it as a ""naked power grab"" as it does not immediately return EU powers to devolved administrations. But Scottish Secretary David Mundell has insisted the bill would result in a powers ""bonanza"" for Holyrood. Speaking on the BBC'sSunday Politics Scotland programme, Mr Russell said the bill was ""badly drafted"" and ""unworkable"". He said he believed the UK government would use it to make decisions on matters which should be devolved without consulting the Scottish government or Holyrood. He also warned of a ""constitutional crisis"" if Westminster ignores the Scottish Parliament withholding consent for the repeal bill. The legislation, published earlier this week, is designed to transpose EU law into British law so the same rules apply on the day of Brexit as the day before, while giving parliaments and assemblies in Westminster, Edinburgh, Belfast and Cardiff the power to drop or change them, in devolved areas, in the future. Both Nicola Sturgeon and Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones have said they would not recommend legislative consent for the bill as it stands. Sturgeon: EU repeal bill a 'power grab' Warning of 'immense crisis' over EU bill What is the repeal bill all about? Mr Russell has written to all MSPs seeking support for the Scottish government's position. He said that Scotland ""risks having to fight for powers that should rightfully belong to the Scottish Parliament"" because the legislation ""contains no promise to protect these"". His letter highlighted concerns that the bill enables UK-wide frameworks on devolved matters to be ""imposed"" by the UK government rather than ""agreed"" with the devolved administrations. On the Sunday Politics Scotland programme, Mr Russell revealed that the Scottish government had seen a draft of the repeal bill two weeks ago. ""The normal thing for a bill of this nature would be that officials would work together over a long period of time to get it right because it affects Scotland so much,"" he said. Formally known as the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill, the draft legislation is a key plank of the government's Brexit strategy The first line of the bill says the European Communities Act 1972, which took Britain into the EU, will be ""repealed on exit day"" This will end the supremacy of EU law and stop the flow of new regulations from Brussels But all existing laws derived from the EU will continue to be in force - they can be changed or scrapped by further legislation The bill does not detail policies line-by-line but transfers all regulations into domestic law It gives the UK two years after Brexit to correct any ""deficiencies"" arising from the transfer Mr Russell went on: ""Up until now there is a list of things that are devolved and a list of things that are reserved. ""Now there will be areas which are neither, or both, and decisions will be made by UK ministers without consulting the Scottish Parliament and Scottish government on matters which are actually devolved. That is unacceptable and it would lead to chaos."" Asked if he was concerned that the UK government would use ""these so-called Henry VIII powers"" - which enables UK-wide frameworks to be drawn up without going to Parliament - to decide what was devolved and what was not, he said: ""Of course, that is what they are intending to do."" The UK government said it expected the outcome of the process to be ""a significant increase in the decision-making power of each devolved administration"". A spokesman added: ""We welcome the Scottish and Welsh governments recognising common frameworks may be needed in some areas. Our aim is to establish common frameworks only where they are needed."" Dr Ian Duncan warned against ""brinkmanship"" from the Scottish government Nicola Sturgeon has she could not recommend that the Scottish Parliament give the repeal bill its backing, in its current state. Also speaking on the Sunday Politics Scotland programme, Dr Ian Duncan, Undersecretary of State for Scotland, warned against entering into ""a period of brinkmanship"". Asked if the UK government would make decisions on what was devolved and what was not, without consultation, he said: ""What we are talking about in this interim period is a transition period."" He added ""These powers will be used to determine what should be part of a common framework, replacing the common framework of the EU, and that should be done through an agreement between each of the particular powers moving forward. ""There will also be elements that go straight back to Scotland, to Wales, to Northern Ireland because they do not fit into a necessary component of a common framework."" In a briefing to journalists following the publication of the repeal bill, Scottish Secretary David Mundell said: ""This is not a power grab, it is a power bonanza for the Scottish Parliament because after this bill has been implemented the Scottish Parliament will have more powers and responsibilities than it has today."" Scottish Labour has called for a ""jobs-first Brexit"" which will protect workplace rights, consumer rights or environmental standards. A party spokesman said: ""Labour will seek a clear and binding commitment to repatriate powers in devolved areas to the Scottish Parliament. We will insist this must be done in a short, but achievable timeframe. ""Labour has been clear that unless the Tory government addresses the issues we have raised, we will not be supporting the bill as it stands. ""Labour will however seek to amend the bill in the UK Parliament, and our attitude to legislative consent motion in the Scottish Parliament will depend on what amendments are made at Westminster."" Scottish Liberal Democrat business manager Mike Rumbles described the bill as a ""huge executive power grab"" and said his party would work with others to protect devolution. He added: ""It is essential that the Scottish government and the Scottish Parliament have a central role in devolved policy areas and that any powers repatriated from the EU in these areas come to Scotland."" The Scottish Greens said the bill was ""a significant threat to the devolved parliaments in Wales and Scotland, attempting to impose UK-wide arrangements on what are devolved powers rather than negotiate for agreed frameworks"".
