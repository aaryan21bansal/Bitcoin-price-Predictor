"This video can not be played Watch: Boris Johnson says people need to understand the ""sheer cost in human life"" war could entail Evidence suggests Russia is planning ""the biggest war in Europe since 1945"", Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. He told the BBC's Sophie Raworth in an interview: ""All the signs are that the plan has already in some senses begun."" Intelligence suggests Russia intends to launch an invasion that will encircle Ukrainian capital Kyiv, Mr Johnson said. ""People need to understand the sheer cost in human life that could entail,"" he said. The prime minister was speaking from Munich, where world leaders are meeting for an annual security conference. Ukraine: How big is the Russian military build-up? UK vows to step up support for Ukraine Ukraine invasion would shock the world - PM The latest estimates by the US government suggests that between 169,000 and 190,000 Russian troops are stationed along Ukraine's border, both in Russia and neighbouring Belarus - but this figure also includes Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine. Mr Johnson warned that any conflict could be ""bloody and protracted"", saying Russian President Vladimir Putin was possibly ""thinking illogically about this"" and did not ""see the disaster ahead"". ""I think it's vital for us all now to get over what a catastrophe it would be for Russia,"" he added. He indicated that the UK and US would bring further sanctions against Russiathan have been suggested before,including stopping its companies ""trading in pounds and dollars"" - a move that he said would ""hit very, very hard"". Mr Johnson added: ""The lesson of [the Russian seizure of Crimea from Ukraine in] 2014 is that you can't just let Vladimir Putin get away with it."" An invasion of Ukraine would strengthen, rather than weaken, Nato, he predicted, saying Western countries could not allow opposition forces to come to ""the false conclusion that might is right"". ""If [Mr Putin] thinks he's going to get less Nato as a result of this, he's totally wrong,"" Mr Johnson said. ""He's going to get more Nato."" By Peter Saull, political correspondent While a full-blown Russian invasion of Ukraine is yet to materialise, Boris Johnson's latest comments ratchet up the war of words. The prime minister raising the prospect of a conflict as devastating as World War II is designed to focus minds. The ongoing tensions in eastern Europe have given Mr Johnson, who's faced a myriad of problems at home, a chance to show leadership on the world stage. And on the sidelines of the Munich security conference, he seems to have made some progress on the question of sanctions. Stopping Russian companies' ability to trade in pounds and dollars is a new proposal designed to do serious damage to the country's finances. Ukraine is not a member of Nato or the European Union but has close relations with both. Russia is insisting its neighbour should not be allowed to join Nato, which it sees as a threat to its security. Western nations have accused Russia of trying to stage a fake crisis on Ukraine's border, warning in recent weeks Mr Putin's forces could be preparing to invade at any time. But Russia has denied the claims, saying the massed troops are just conducting military exercises. Asked whether a Russian invasion was still thought to be imminent, Mr Johnson said: ""I'm afraid that that is what the evidence points to. There's no burnishing it."" The prime minister said US President Joe Biden had told Western leaders that intelligence suggested Russian forces were not just planning on entering Ukraine from the east, via Donbas, but down from Belarus and the area surrounding Kyiv. ""I'm afraid to say that the plan we are seeing is for something that could be really the biggest war in Europe since 1945, just in terms of sheer scale,"" he said. People needed to not only consider the potential loss of life of Ukrainians, but also of ""young Russians"", he added. Mr Johnson was speaking after meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky andtelling world leaders in a speechthat any invasion of Ukraine by Russia would ""echo around the world"". During a phone call on Sunday, the prime minister and French President Emmanuel Macron agreed the next week would be ""crucial for diplomacy"". A No 10 spokeswoman said the two leaders updated one another on their ""respective diplomatic efforts"", including Mr Macron's call with Mr Putin on Sunday. ""The prime minister noted that President Putin's commitments to President Macron were a welcome sign that he might still be willing to engage in finding a diplomatic solution,"" the spokeswoman added. She said Mr Johnson stressed Ukraine's ""voice must be central"" in any talks, and that the two leaders ""underscored the need for President Putin to step back from his current threats and withdraw troops from Ukraine's border"". Labour said it stood ""four-square behind the UK government and Nato, with shadow health secretary Wes Streeting telling Sky News: ""There should be no doubt on the resolve of the UK, on a cross-party basis, and the resolve of Nato across the alliance."" But he also urged the government to do more to prevent the City of London being a ""centre"" for ""Russian kleptocrats and money laundering"". Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Home Secretary Priti Patel warned the crisis could bring an increased risk of cyber attacks in Britain. She said past Russian cyber activity had included interference with UK media, telecommunications, and energy infrastructure, and the government expected to see an escalation of similar operations in the coming months. In the same paper, Lindy Cameron, head of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), said that ""attacks targeting Ukraine's digital infrastructure could be felt here in Britain"". She said that, in 2017, malware used by the Russian military to target infrastructure in Ukraine ""spiralled recklessly out of control to affect many other countries, including the UK'.

"This video can not be played Visiting Kyiv, UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss praised Ukrainians' stoicism and fortitude Foreign Secretary Liz Truss says the UK is increasing its financial support for Ukraine, amid tensions with Russia. Speaking in Kyiv, Ms Truss said the UK would be spending an additional Â£12m on democracy and energy independence projects in the country. Western allies have warned Russia could try to stage an attack to justify invading Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly denied it has plans to invade despite amassing more than 100,000 troops along the border. As part of ongoing diplomatic efforts, Ms Truss visited the Ukrainian capital, holding a press conference alongside the country's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. She praised the country's ""fortitude in the face of Russian aggression"" and pledged UK's ""steadfast support"". Mr Kuleba said Ukrainian-British relationships had ""reached an unprecedentedly high level"". LIVE: West must not be fooled by Russia's claims - Truss What is Nato and why doesn't Russia trust it? Russian troop withdrawal claim is false, says US In addition to increasing funding for Ukraine's defence capabilities from Â£88m to Â£100m, Ms Truss also announced a new ""trilateral partnership"" with Ukraine and Poland to ""intensify work on defence and security, sanctions, energy security and countering disinformation"". The foreign secretary also warned that ""false-flag"" operations were taking place in the region adding: ""We are very clear the aggressor in this situation is Russia."" A false-flag attack is where one side stages or fabricates an attack against it in order to justify the use of force in retaliation. Earlier in the day, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Russia could be ""trying to stage a pretext for an armed attack against Ukraine"". Russia has accused the West of ""hysteria"" over such warnings in recent weeks. It has also called on Nato to guarantee Ukraine will not be allowed to join the defence alliance. Nato insists it will keep its open door policy, and has been increasingly concerned an invasion is on the cards. Mr Stoltenberg, said there were ""signs from Moscow that diplomacy could continue"", but that the West had ""not seen any sign of withdrawal or de-escalation"". Speaking from an RAF base in Waddington, Lincolnshire, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there was ""still time to avoid a catastrophe"" but said the picture from the region was ""very grim"". He added that a Russian invasion would result in a ""bloody and protracted conflict in which, I'm afraid, there will be many casualties and including many Russian casualties"" In a speech following the press conference in Kyiv, Ms Truss, who became foreign secretary last year, said the current crisis in the region was a ""litmus test"" for the West. ""The free world needs to draw the line under a decade of drift... we must stand up to and defuse Russian aggression now, because if we don't it will embolden not only the Kremlin, but aggressors, authoritarians and autocrats everywhere. ""The West needs to wise up. We need to work together to discredit their arguments in public."" Ms Truss is now travelling to Poland for a meeting with her Polish counterpart, before heading to the Munich Security Conference on Saturday for meetings with allies. The UK has no troops in Ukraine but it has increased numbers in Estonia to the ""high hundreds,"" according to the Ministry of Defence, as well as sending additional helicopters, jets and warships to the region. A further 1,000 British troops are also on standby to support Nato if called upon.

"The last remaining Covid restriction in England could be gone in weeks, after the prime minister announcedthe legal requirement to isolate after a positive test may be scrapped early. The plan had been to end it on 24 March - but if the trends remained positive, Boris Johnson said, it could go a month early. The move has taken many experts by surprise, with one describing it as either brave or stupid. When will the self-isolation rules be scrapped? What Covid rules remain across the UK? As often with Covid, the evidence is unclear. Certainly questions are being asked about the politics of the move, with the prime minister under continuing pressure. But there is plenty of positive news in the latest data - as the prime minister suggested. Hospital cases are falling and, despite the large wave of Omicron infections, overall deaths have not risen above what would normally be seen in winter. With new treatments and a huge amount of immunity in the population, from both vaccination and infection, the risk from the virus is lessening all the time. Other nations are also relaxing rules around self-isolation. Denmark, for example, now requires people to stay at home only if they have symptoms. Nonetheless, there are also grounds for caution. Infection levels remain high. And the Office for National Statistics (ONS) monitoring programme suggests they may even be rising again, with about one out of every 19 people in England positive last week. Coupled with this is the rise of a sub-variant of Omicron, BA.2, thought to be even more transmissible than the version, first identified in South Africa, that caused the Christmas surge. BA.2 now accounts for an estimated one out of every six infections - a proportion that is growing every week. This is one of the reasons Prof Paul Hunter, an expert in infectious disease, at the University of East Anglia, was surprised by the announcement on self-isolation. ""At some point, it is going to be the case that all remaining restrictions are dropped, including the need to self-isolate, though I certainly didn't expect that to happen this month,"" he says. Prof Hunter would have preferred to wait a little bit longer to see what happens with infections and the sub-variant. Dr Simon Clarke, from the University of Reading, who says that the move is either ""brave or stupid"", explains that the problem is nobody knows for sure what the impact will be. Some believe people could now feel pressurised into returning to work before they are physically ready or no longer infectious. It is worth bearing in mind, though, not every infected person was isolating anyway. This winter, the testing system has been picking up only half of all infections - so at the peak, an estimated 200,000 people a day in England who should have been were not being formally asked to isolate. Furthermore, about one in five of those who test positive does not fully adhere to the isolation requirements, according to the ONS. It is easy to overestimate the impact of government rules and the significance of removing them. After all, at Christmas there were no limits on mixing in England - but contact levels were still at incredibly low rates, similar to those seen in the first lockdown. Just because the public is no longer under a legal requirement to isolate, it does not mean they will suddenly stop staying home when ill. After all, when the rules do end, there will be guidance about the importance of staying at home if you are ill. Those willing and able to follow the rules - some say there has been insufficient financial support to help people on low incomes isolate when they risk losing earnings - may largely continue with their current behaviours, University College London epidemiologist Prof Tim Colbourn says. ""Ending legal isolation requirements doesn't meant everyone will freely spread Covid everywhere,"" he says. ""People still care about family, friends and colleagues. ""Given the availability of rapid tests and current isolation law being largely unenforceable, it might not actually make much difference."" Follow Nickon Twitter,external. Read morefrom Nick.

The figures, compiled for the accountancy firm PwC, reflect the rise of online shopping and the impact of the pandemic. However, the data suggests the rate of closures is slowing as more independent firms take on space. ""The worst could now be over,"" said Lisa Hooker, head of consumer markets at PwC. The research was compiled by the Local Data Company, which has been tracking more than 200,000 outlets on High Streets, shopping centres and retail parks operated by businesses with more than five shops. The figures include retailers, restaurants, bars and gyms as well as banks, takeaways and hairdressers. As the chart below shows, there was a slight reduction in the number of closures last year, to 17,219. That's an average of 47 stores shutting every day and down from 48 in 2020. But there was also another sharp drop in the number of openings, which led to a net loss of 10,059 outlets, the biggest fall since 2014. ""There's no doubt that the numbers are stark and 2021 saw an acceleration in net closures across this sector, which in isolation looks dramatic,"" said Lucy Stainton, commercial director at the Local Data Company. The pandemic has accelerated the changes already under way across retail, causing upheaval for many High Streets and town centres. But it's not the death of the High Street, insists Ms Stainton, but rather a final shake-out of some of the heritage brands. The last two years have seen the fall of some of big household names, such as Sir Philip Green's retail empire, Arcadia, and Debenhams. These closures, along with a host of other retail restructurings, are captured in the figures. Retail sales rebound in January as Omicron eases What do you do with an empty department store? Meanwhile, some locations continue to do better than others. Yet again, retail parks - clusters of large stores often on the edge of town - have proved to be the most resilient. They've become more popular with shoppers during Covid thanks to easier access and parking. In contrast, shopping centres have gone from being the most popular retail locations in 2015 to the worst performing over the last two years. They've been hit hard by a swathe of closures of fashion shops, department store chains and casual dining outlets. ""Location matters most to consumers,"" said PwC's Lisa Hooker. ""Retail parks and standalone sites have broad appeal. Multiple operators are taking note of this changing consumer behaviour and are relocating stores to where their customers need them to be."" So what are the kinds of businesses stepping in to fill the huge gaps right across our High Streets and town centres? When it comes to chain outlets, there has been growth among takeaways, cake shops and job centres. But this expansion is nowhere near enough to make up for the wave of closures led by fashion retailers and banks that have accelerated during the pandemic. Although 2021 was extremely challenging for retailers, Lucy Stainton says vacancy rates have started to stabilise and that the number of empty shops is no longer increasing. She said: ""The rental tone is softening, and more space has become available in prime locations previously occupied by bigger brands, paving the way for new and upcoming operators. ""There's been a big uptick in independent retail and leisure firms taking on empty sites,"" she added. These businesses are not included in the figures. But the numbers do highlight the huge challenges ahead, with many places still blighted by vacant units and shop fronts. There's now a pressing need to radically reshape or even repurpose some of our towns and city centres, says Lisa Hooker. ""The last two years have been tumultuous for retailers. ""To regain lost footfall, High Streets must understand why retail parks are so attractive to consumers or look for ways to better serve local needs, encouraging independent retailers and entrepreneurs to take this opportunity to grow into the gaps that are emerging.""

"This video can not be played Watch: ""If Ukraine is invaded, the shock will echo around the world"" - UK PM Boris Johnson The shock of any invasion of Ukraine by Russia would ""echo around the world"", Boris Johnson has told world leaders. He said we must be ""unflinchingly honest"" about the situation in Ukraine and should not ""underestimate the gravity of this moment"". In a speech at a security conference in Munich, Mr Johnson said he does not know what Russian President Vladimir Putin intends, but ""omens are grim"". ""And that is why we must stand strong together,"" he said. Western nations have warned Russia could invade Ukraine imminently, with over 130,000 of its troops near the border. They accuse Russia of trying to stage a fake crisis in a breakaway eastern region of Ukraine to give it a reason to invade. But Russia has repeatedly denied having plans to invade, saying troops are conducting military exercises in the region, accusing the West of ""hysteria"". Is Russia going to invade Ukraine? How might Russia stage a false flag attack? Satellite images show Russian activity near Ukraine Russia does not want war, Putin says Mr Johnson stressed the UK still hoped diplomacy and dialogue would succeed in resolving the crisis. Urging unity among the UK's Western allies, he said: ""Every time that Western ministers have visited Kyiv, we have assured the people of Ukraine and their leaders that we stand foursquare behind their sovereignty and independence. ""How hollow, how meaningless, how insulting those words would seem, if at the very moment when their sovereignty and independence is imperilled, we simply look away."" If Ukraine were invaded, Mr Johnson said ""we will witness the destruction of a democratic state, a country that has been free for a generation, with a proud history of elections"". Ukraine is a former Soviet republic with historic ties to Russia and shares borders with both the EU and Russia. Russia has long resisted Ukraine's move towards Western institutions, including Nato, seeing the eastward expansion of the military alliance as a threat to its security. Boris Johnson warned ""we will witness the destruction of a democratic state"" if Ukraine is invaded The prime minister warned that any invasion would also be met with sanctions on Russian individuals and companies. He said the UK would ""open up the Matryoshka dolls"" of certain Russian-owned companies and make it impossible for them to raise finance in London. His comments follow the announcement ofnew legislationallowing the UK to widen its sanctions against the country. ""If Ukraine is invaded, the shock will echo around the world, and those echoes will be heard in East Asia they will be heard in Taiwan,"" he told the Munich Security Conference. Mr Johnson met Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky, whosaid,externalthey had agreed ""joint next steps"" and remained united in the pursuit of de-escalation and diplomacy. In a statement, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the party was ""steadfast in our support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine"". ""We stand in solidary with the Ukrainian people and in unity with our international partners and Nato allies in warning President Putin that any attack will lead to immediate, severe and extensive sanctions,"" he said. He said Labour supported the actions the government was taking to bring about an end to the stand-off, adding that ""diplomacy can still succeed"". Writing on Twitter, former Prime Minister Theresa May said Boris Johnson was ""right to press the case for continued diplomacy, while preparing the most severe sanctions for Russia if Putin chooses the catastrophe of war"". Mr Zelensky and Mr Johnson met at the security conference In a joint statement, foreign ministers from the G7 group of wealthy nations said they had seen ""no evidence"" that Russia has withdrawn some of its forces, as it has claimed, and that they remained ""gravely concerned"" by the situation. ""We call on Russia to choose the path of diplomacy, to de-escalate tensions, to substantively withdraw military forces from the proximity of Ukraine's borders and to fully abide by international commitments,"" the statement said. ""As a first step, we expect Russia to implement the announced reduction of its military activities along Ukraine's borders. We will judge Russia by its deeds."" US Vice-President Kamala Harris is also attending the conference in Munich, and said in a speech that Russia faced ""swift, severe and united"" economic consequences if it were to invade. She accused Russia of narrowing the avenues for diplomacy, saying ""their simply do not match their words"". Her remarks come after Moscow said some of its troops had moved away from the border in recent days - but Western powers said there was no evidence of withdrawal. On Friday, US President Joe Bidensaid he is convincedMr Putin has decided to invade and that an assault could happen in the ""coming days"". Mr Biden said the assessment was based on US intelligence, which suggested the capital Kyiv would be targeted. Other Western politicians taking part in the three-day security conference include German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and US Vice-President Kamala Harris. But Russia will not be officially represented at the summit for the first time since 1999 amid the rising tensions over the situation at Ukraine's borders. Meanwhile, the Home Office hasscrapped a visa schemeoffering rich foreign investors fast-track residency, amid pressure on ministers over UK links to Russia. Labour has demanded the immediate publication of an ongoing review into visas granted between 2008 - when the scheme was introduced - and 2015 when checks on applicants were tightened. The Liberal Democrats have also demanded a ""clear timetable"" for revoking visas issued to any Russians ""who have been flagged as posing a national security risk"". The security conference in Germany comes as Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed rebels in the country's east continued to accuse each other of shelling and other ceasefire violations on Friday. Such breaks in the area's years-long ceasefire are not uncommon, and each side blamed the other for the violence on Thursday. On Friday, Washington increased its estimate of the number of Russian troops deployed around Ukraine to between 169,000 and 190,000. Ukraine's defence minister has suggested a figure of 149,000.

"This video can not be played Watch as US Vice-President Kamala Harris warns Russia of consequences if it invades Ukraine Ukraine's Russian-backed breakaway eastern territories have ordered military mobilisations amid a deadly escalation in fighting. Men of fighting age in the self-declared people's republics of Donetsk and Luhansk are being put on stand-by. US President Joe Biden says he is convinced Russia will invade Ukraine, an allegation Moscow denies. Western nations have accused Russia of trying to stage a fake crisis in the eastern regions as a pretext to invade. International monitors report a ""dramatic increase"" in attacks along the line dividing rebel and government forces. Two Ukrainian soldiers were killed and four injured by shelling on Saturday, the first deaths to be reported in weeks. Mr Biden's Defence Secretary, Lloyd Austin, said Russian forces were beginning to ""uncoil and move closer"" to the border with Ukraine. In the German city of Munich, US Vice-President Kamala Harris told a security conference that if Russia did invade, the US and its allies would impose a ""significant and unprecedented economic cost"", targeting its financial institutions and key industries, as well as those who aided and abetted such an invasion. Echoing her remarks, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that, in the event of an invasion, his country would ""open up the Matryoshka dolls"" of strategic Russian-owned companies and make it impossible for them to raise finance in London. Mr Johnson had talks in Munich with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who was visiting for the security conference against the advice of President Biden, who had said it might not be a ""wise choice"" for the Ukrainian leader to be out of his country at this time. The US estimates there are 169,000-190,000 Russian personnel massed along Ukraine's borders, a figure that includes separatist fighters in Donetsk and Luhansk. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who oversaw major drills of Russia's strategic nuclear missile forces from Moscow on Saturday, has said the situation in eastern Ukraine is deteriorating. He said he remained willing to discuss the crisis with Western leaders, but accused them of ignoring Russia's security concerns. As we climbed the viewing platform, gale-force winds and hail storms were sweeping across the vast Obuz-Lesnovsky Military Range, around 100 miles (160km) from the border with Ukraine. Fluttering furiously, side by side, the flags of Belarus and Russia. The skies cleared and an announcement came over the loudspeaker: ""These are purely defensive drills."" For the next half an hour, Russian and Belarusian forces rehearsed repelling an attacker, with tanks, fighter jets and rocket launchers. Nato considers this the largest Russian military deployment in Belarus since the Cold War. The numbers we've been hearing range from 10,000 to 30,000 Russian troops. Ukraine views the exercises as part of Moscow's ""psychological pressure"" on Kyiv. The drills are due to end on Sunday. When they do, a key question will be how quickly will the Russian soldiers pack up and go home? Ukraine, a former Soviet republic with historic ties to Russia, is not a member of Nato or the European Union but has close relations with both. Russia is insisting Ukraine should not be allowed to join Nato, which it sees as a threat to its security. Accurate figures are difficult to establish but as many as 3.5 million people live in the two rebel territories, which broke away in 2014 after Ukraine's pro-Russian government was overthrown. Since then, at least 720,000 have acquired Russian citizenship, according to Russian media. A number of civilians have been evacuated from the rebel territories to neighbouring Russia, with at least 6,500 leaving Donetsk, according to the separatists. In Luhansk, the first train to Russia since 2014 left with 650 evacuees aboard, Russian media report. One person in rebel-controlled Luhansk told BBC News on condition of anonymity that the separatists were trying to stir panic deliberately and said local people were wary of evacuating. A children's home was evacuated from Luhansk across the border to Russia on Friday Another in rebel-controlled Donetsk confirmed that some people were leaving and added, ""People just want that somebody finally can take control and responsibility for these separatist-held territories whoever it would be - Russia or Ukraine"".

A former teacher, she will go to prison for up to three years under her plea deal with federal prosecutors. Her husband, Jonathan Toebbe, 42, pleaded guilty earlier this week. Under his plea deal, he will receive a sentence of about 12-17 years. Both of the Toebbes pleaded guilty in federal court in Martinsburg, West Virginia, to conspiring to communicate restricted data. The Toebbe home in Annapolis, Maryland The crime carried the possibility of a life sentence. Jonathan Toebbe was an expert in nuclear-propulsion systems on submarines, one of the nation's most closely guarded secrets. He tried to sell the information to a foreign government, sending messages to someone who he believed was a foreign official, according to the justice department. In fact, the individual was an undercover FBI agent. Before their arrest in October, the Toebbes lived with their two children in Annapolis, Maryland, home of the US Naval Academy. Diana Toebbe taught history and English at a private school. She has a PhD in anthropology from Emory University in Atlanta. Jonathan Toebbe served in the Navy before becoming a member of the military reserve. He worked in the office of the chief of naval operations in Arlington, Virginia. Prosecutors had argued the Toebbes were a flight risk, citing messages between the couple about quickly fleeing the US. Diana Toebbe's lawyers said those messages were about her dislike of then-President Donald Trump and had nothing to do with the plot to sell classified information to a foreign nation. For years, according to the investigators, Jonathan Toebbe collected information on nuclear submarines, smuggling documents out of work, a few pages at a time, so that he could get past security checkpoints. ""I was extremely careful to gather the files I possess slowly and naturally in the routine of my job, so nobody would suspect my plan,"" he wrote to the investigator, the individual who he believed worked for the foreign government. Toebbe, unaware he had fallen into the trap, came to trust the investigator. The couple tried to sell secrets about US nuclear submarines In one of the notes, Toebbe wrote about their friendship and his hopes for the future: ""One day, when it is safe, perhaps two old friends will have a chance to stumble into each other at a cafe, share a bottle of wine and laugh over stories of their shared exploits."" A plea bargain in this kind of case is unusual, but they can be reached. Federal investigators take these cases very seriously, say legal experts, yet they may be willing to support a lesser sentence for defendants in exchange for information from them. Sometimes, says Daniel Richman, a Columbia law professor in New York, ""prosecutors back off the maximum sentence for a defendant in order to get them to say things that might assist them in counterintelligence operations"". In this case, the investigators certainly wanted to find something out from the defendants: Jonathan Toebbe had asked for $100,000, paid in cryptocurrency, according to an affidavit drawn up by the federal investigators, in exchange for the nuclear secrets. As part of their plea deal, the Toebbes said that they would help the FBI recover the cryptocurrency that was sent to them during the federal investigation that led to their arrest.

"Foie gras is controversial because it involves force-feeding ducks to fatten their liver The UK government is likely to drop plans to ban imports of fur and foie gras, amid cabinet opposition. The measures were due to be included in the Animals Abroad Bill, to be introduced soon. But several cabinet ministers have raised different concerns about the proposals. The government said a final decision had not been taken but sources said the measures look set to be parked to allow other elements of the bill to progress. A spokesperson for the government said it was ""united in its commitment to upholding its world-leading standards in animal welfare"". Foie gras imports may be banned after Brexit UK to be 'global leader' on animal welfare Attempt to ban foie gras fails in Parliament British farmers are already banned from producing foie gras, a liver-based luxury French food opposed by animal rights campaigners because its production involves force-feeding ducks or geese. Fur farming has also been illegal in the UK since 2000, but campaigners have long been pushing for an import ban on fur farmed abroad. The Animals Abroad Bill is one of three pieces of legislation the government has drafted in a bid to improve animal welfare. It will include measures to crack down on hunting animals for trophies, as well as holidays that lead to the neglect of animals like elephants. But the bill has been delayed, amid debate over how parts of the legislation would be enforced. The UK imports almost all of its foie gras from France, where it is considered a heritage product Ministers have confirmed in recent weeks that they intend to ban importing hunting trophies from threatened species like lions, elephants and rhinos. But it's understood a ban on foie gras and fur imports is now likely to be dropped from the legislation, after a number of concerns raised by cabinet ministers. Some - including Brexit opportunities minister Jacob Rees Mogg - have raised concerns about personal choice. The BBC has been told that Mr Rees Mogg believes the government should not be imposing restrictions on consumers. He has also argued the planned ban would have no impact on animal welfare in the UK. Other ministers - including Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis - raised concerns the measures would not have included Northern Ireland, creating different rules in different parts of the UK. There were concerns over problems relating to theNorthern Ireland protocol, the part of the UK's Brexit deal under which Northern Ireland continues to follow product rules from the EU - where foie gras is traded freely. Defence secretary Ben Wallace also raised concerns about banning the bear fur used by the military for the hats worn by Guardsmen. Mr Wallace argues this is responsibly sourced under a cull run by the Canadian government - thoughcampaigners say that process still involves cruelty,external. The use of bearskin hats in the British Army has proved controversial with animal rights groups Towards the end of last year, Environment minister Lord Goldsmith told the BBC the government would legislate to ban imports at ""the earliest possible slot"". Claire Bass, executive director at the Humane Society International UK, said the government has said ""warm words"" about a ban, ""but the question is will they follow through with action"". ""I think a very large number of people will be disappointed if they don't,"" she said. She said the public backed action on animal welfare, but ""there can be a small number of influential Conservatives who perhaps want to  be eating foie gras while wearing fur and going hunting, who apparently sway the government's decision-making"". ""People won't stand for that."" Abigail Penny, executive director at Animal Equality UK, told the BBC that foie gras was an ""immensely cruel"" food product that could lead to liver disease in ducks and geese. She added: ""The UK government has been claiming for many years now that they would be looking to ban the importation. ""I think the ban matters a lot to those animals that are currently suffering and struggling. "" Fur has long been used in hats and coats, but has attracted controversy in the fashion world Frank Zilberkweit from the British Fur Trade Association said it would be difficult to enforce a ban - and the industry was transparent and sustainable. He said: ""The UK public will decide for themselves whether they wish to purchase fur. If the public agree that fur is not a suitable product to wear, they won't buy it."" He added: ""The fur trade is always happy to liaise with the government about ways to improve standards in the industry, and to explain what we are doing"" A government spokesperson emphasised no final decision on imports had been made. They added that under its Action plan for Animal Welfare, the government was committed to ""world-leading reforms"" to improve animal welfare in the UK and abroad, and planned to ""legislate further to protect animals abroad as soon as parliamentary time allows"". The spokesman added that the government had committed to building a ""clear evidence base to inform decisions on the import of foie gras"". They added that a recent call for evidence on fur products would be published ""soon"" and would inform ""any future decisions on the fur trade"".

"This video can not be played Watch: ""If Ukraine is invaded, the shock will echo around the world"" - UK PM Boris Johnson The shock of any invasion of Ukraine by Russia would ""echo around the world"", Boris Johnson has told world leaders. He said we must be ""unflinchingly honest"" about the situation in Ukraine and should not ""underestimate the gravity of this moment"". In a speech at a security conference in Munich, Mr Johnson said he does not know what Russian President Vladimir Putin intends, but ""omens are grim"". ""And that is why we must stand strong together,"" he said. Western nations have warned Russia could invade Ukraine imminently, with over 130,000 of its troops near the border. They accuse Russia of trying to stage a fake crisis in a breakaway eastern region of Ukraine to give it a reason to invade. But Russia has repeatedly denied having plans to invade, saying troops are conducting military exercises in the region, accusing the West of ""hysteria"". Is Russia going to invade Ukraine? How might Russia stage a false flag attack? Satellite images show Russian activity near Ukraine Russia does not want war, Putin says Mr Johnson stressed the UK still hoped diplomacy and dialogue would succeed in resolving the crisis. Urging unity among the UK's Western allies, he said: ""Every time that Western ministers have visited Kyiv, we have assured the people of Ukraine and their leaders that we stand foursquare behind their sovereignty and independence. ""How hollow, how meaningless, how insulting those words would seem, if at the very moment when their sovereignty and independence is imperilled, we simply look away."" If Ukraine were invaded, Mr Johnson said ""we will witness the destruction of a democratic state, a country that has been free for a generation, with a proud history of elections"". Ukraine is a former Soviet republic with historic ties to Russia and shares borders with both the EU and Russia. Russia has long resisted Ukraine's move towards Western institutions, including Nato, seeing the eastward expansion of the military alliance as a threat to its security. Boris Johnson warned ""we will witness the destruction of a democratic state"" if Ukraine is invaded The prime minister warned that any invasion would also be met with sanctions on Russian individuals and companies. He said the UK would ""open up the Matryoshka dolls"" of certain Russian-owned companies and make it impossible for them to raise finance in London. His comments follow the announcement ofnew legislationallowing the UK to widen its sanctions against the country. ""If Ukraine is invaded, the shock will echo around the world, and those echoes will be heard in East Asia they will be heard in Taiwan,"" he told the Munich Security Conference. Mr Johnson met Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky, whosaid,externalthey had agreed ""joint next steps"" and remained united in the pursuit of de-escalation and diplomacy. In a statement, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the party was ""steadfast in our support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine"". ""We stand in solidary with the Ukrainian people and in unity with our international partners and Nato allies in warning President Putin that any attack will lead to immediate, severe and extensive sanctions,"" he said. He said Labour supported the actions the government was taking to bring about an end to the stand-off, adding that ""diplomacy can still succeed"". Writing on Twitter, former Prime Minister Theresa May said Boris Johnson was ""right to press the case for continued diplomacy, while preparing the most severe sanctions for Russia if Putin chooses the catastrophe of war"". Mr Zelensky and Mr Johnson met at the security conference In a joint statement, foreign ministers from the G7 group of wealthy nations said they had seen ""no evidence"" that Russia has withdrawn some of its forces, as it has claimed, and that they remained ""gravely concerned"" by the situation. ""We call on Russia to choose the path of diplomacy, to de-escalate tensions, to substantively withdraw military forces from the proximity of Ukraine's borders and to fully abide by international commitments,"" the statement said. ""As a first step, we expect Russia to implement the announced reduction of its military activities along Ukraine's borders. We will judge Russia by its deeds."" US Vice-President Kamala Harris is also attending the conference in Munich, and said in a speech that Russia faced ""swift, severe and united"" economic consequences if it were to invade. She accused Russia of narrowing the avenues for diplomacy, saying ""their simply do not match their words"". Her remarks come after Moscow said some of its troops had moved away from the border in recent days - but Western powers said there was no evidence of withdrawal. On Friday, US President Joe Bidensaid he is convincedMr Putin has decided to invade and that an assault could happen in the ""coming days"". Mr Biden said the assessment was based on US intelligence, which suggested the capital Kyiv would be targeted. Other Western politicians taking part in the three-day security conference include German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and US Vice-President Kamala Harris. But Russia will not be officially represented at the summit for the first time since 1999 amid the rising tensions over the situation at Ukraine's borders. Meanwhile, the Home Office hasscrapped a visa schemeoffering rich foreign investors fast-track residency, amid pressure on ministers over UK links to Russia. Labour has demanded the immediate publication of an ongoing review into visas granted between 2008 - when the scheme was introduced - and 2015 when checks on applicants were tightened. The Liberal Democrats have also demanded a ""clear timetable"" for revoking visas issued to any Russians ""who have been flagged as posing a national security risk"". The security conference in Germany comes as Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed rebels in the country's east continued to accuse each other of shelling and other ceasefire violations on Friday. Such breaks in the area's years-long ceasefire are not uncommon, and each side blamed the other for the violence on Thursday. On Friday, Washington increased its estimate of the number of Russian troops deployed around Ukraine to between 169,000 and 190,000. Ukraine's defence minister has suggested a figure of 149,000.

A 122mph gust on the Isle of Wight set a provisional record in England, while the storm closed schools, disrupted travel and tore off roofs. About 400,000 homes were without power as of Friday night. Five people died elsewhere in Europe. Coastal areas of south-west England and south Wales, along with south-east England, had been on alert after rare red weather warnings were issued by the Met Office early on Friday, indicating a danger to life. There are several less-serious yellow warnings in place across Scotland, Northern Ireland and parts of northern England - because of concerns about wind, snow and ice.

London Fire Brigade declared a major incident in response to the volume of calls, and the Ambulance service in South Central England declared a critical incident due to demand on its emergency services. Among those injured were a woman with her baby, who was hit by a tree in Bedford - hurting her but leaving the baby unharmed. A driver in Wiltshire was in a serious condition and two passengers were taken to hospital after a car collided with a fallen tree, while others were injured in south London and Henley-on-Thames by falling trees and debris. Ms Price said her daughter was now really frightened of the wind, and the house had been condemned One minute Holly Price and her five-year-old daughter Olivia were having a normal day, the next they were forced to flee the house after the roof caved in. Holly, from Newport, south Wales, said: ""My daughter was upstairs and we heard an almighty bang and a lot of noise. ""I just dropped to the ground, then ran upstairs to grab my daughter because she was screaming."" The chimney breast had fallen through and left ""dust and debris everywhere"". ""The sound will never, ever leave me - it was just heart-breaking to hear my daughter screaming,"" said Holly, adding they were ""lucky to be alive"". The pair will be staying at a family member's house tonight, then see if they can get emergency shelter.

"Kara McIvor pressed the panic button after a customer became aggressive towards her Staff running high street pharmacies in Scotland say they are increasingly being abused by aggressive customers. They have told the BBC that a combination of Covid pandemic pressure and unrealistic expectations is causing customers to become increasingly angry. Harry McQuillan, of Community Pharmacy Scotland, said a rise in aggression had been seen across Scotland. He said an increasing number of owners felt they needed to employ security guards to protect staff. Earlier this month, Kara McIvor, who works at a pharmacy in Glenrothes in Fife, had to call the police when a customer lost his temper. Lack of planning blamed for Scotland's NHS 'crisis' The 'harsh reality' of abuse faced by NHS staff MSPs slam 'serious failings' in medicines system Pharmacy uses tea trolley to keep customers safe She said the man had been sitting down and she had not realised he was waiting to be served. ""He was very angry from the beginning of our interaction,"" Ms McIvor said. ""I did everything in my power to calm down the situation but he wasn't for listening."" Ms McIvor then pressed the ""panic button"" behind the counter which alerts the police because she did not know how the customer was going to react next. Her mother Bernadette Brown, who runs the pharmacy, said a shortage of face-to-face appointments with GPs and hospitals was pushing more patients her way. Public health campaigns are also encouraging people to make the pharmacist their first port of call. Ms Brown said: ""We have noticed since lockdown that our customers are behaving differently, especially elderly people. ""They are getting more easily upset than they did prior to lockdown. They are getting anxious and concerned so they are taking that out in being more aggressive towards our counter staff."" Simon Wilson said people did not understand the pressures the system was under On Dalry Road in Edinburgh, pharmacist Simon Wilson said the barrier he put in place in his reception area to prevent the transmission of Covid had protected his staff from violence on at least three occasions. ""We do see increasing levels of frustration,"" he said. ""People do not understand the pressures the system is under. All they understand is 'I have not got what I am meant to have'."" Mr Wilson gives the example of a man who was visiting from London and got extremely angry when his medication did not get delivered by the wholesaler. ""The gentleman then appeared with his two brothers who were basically threatening me with violence unless I gave them what they were meant to have,"" he said. A Scottish government spokesman said it was completely unacceptable for pharmacy staff to be targeted by aggressive behaviour from members of the public.

"This video can not be played Watch: ""If Ukraine is invaded, the shock will echo around the world"" - UK PM Boris Johnson The shock of any invasion of Ukraine by Russia would ""echo around the world"", Boris Johnson has told world leaders. He said we must be ""unflinchingly honest"" about the situation in Ukraine and should not ""underestimate the gravity of this moment"". In a speech at a security conference in Munich, Mr Johnson said he does not know what Russian President Vladimir Putin intends, but ""omens are grim"". ""And that is why we must stand strong together,"" he said. Western nations have warned Russia could invade Ukraine imminently, with over 130,000 of its troops near the border. They accuse Russia of trying to stage a fake crisis in a breakaway eastern region of Ukraine to give it a reason to invade. But Russia has repeatedly denied having plans to invade, saying troops are conducting military exercises in the region, accusing the West of ""hysteria"". Is Russia going to invade Ukraine? How might Russia stage a false flag attack? Satellite images show Russian activity near Ukraine Russia does not want war, Putin says Mr Johnson stressed the UK still hoped diplomacy and dialogue would succeed in resolving the crisis. Urging unity among the UK's Western allies, he said: ""Every time that Western ministers have visited Kyiv, we have assured the people of Ukraine and their leaders that we stand foursquare behind their sovereignty and independence. ""How hollow, how meaningless, how insulting those words would seem, if at the very moment when their sovereignty and independence is imperilled, we simply look away."" If Ukraine were invaded, Mr Johnson said ""we will witness the destruction of a democratic state, a country that has been free for a generation, with a proud history of elections"". Ukraine is a former Soviet republic with historic ties to Russia and shares borders with both the EU and Russia. Russia has long resisted Ukraine's move towards Western institutions, including Nato, seeing the eastward expansion of the military alliance as a threat to its security. Boris Johnson warned ""we will witness the destruction of a democratic state"" if Ukraine is invaded The prime minister warned that any invasion would also be met with sanctions on Russian individuals and companies. He said the UK would ""open up the Matryoshka dolls"" of certain Russian-owned companies and make it impossible for them to raise finance in London. His comments follow the announcement ofnew legislationallowing the UK to widen its sanctions against the country. ""If Ukraine is invaded, the shock will echo around the world, and those echoes will be heard in East Asia they will be heard in Taiwan,"" he told the Munich Security Conference. Mr Johnson met Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky, whosaid,externalthey had agreed ""joint next steps"" and remained united in the pursuit of de-escalation and diplomacy. In a statement, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the party was ""steadfast in our support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine"". ""We stand in solidary with the Ukrainian people and in unity with our international partners and Nato allies in warning President Putin that any attack will lead to immediate, severe and extensive sanctions,"" he said. He said Labour supported the actions the government was taking to bring about an end to the stand-off, adding that ""diplomacy can still succeed"". Writing on Twitter, former Prime Minister Theresa May said Boris Johnson was ""right to press the case for continued diplomacy, while preparing the most severe sanctions for Russia if Putin chooses the catastrophe of war"". Mr Zelensky and Mr Johnson met at the security conference In a joint statement, foreign ministers from the G7 group of wealthy nations said they had seen ""no evidence"" that Russia has withdrawn some of its forces, as it has claimed, and that they remained ""gravely concerned"" by the situation. ""We call on Russia to choose the path of diplomacy, to de-escalate tensions, to substantively withdraw military forces from the proximity of Ukraine's borders and to fully abide by international commitments,"" the statement said. ""As a first step, we expect Russia to implement the announced reduction of its military activities along Ukraine's borders. We will judge Russia by its deeds."" US Vice-President Kamala Harris is also attending the conference in Munich, and said in a speech that Russia faced ""swift, severe and united"" economic consequences if it were to invade. She accused Russia of narrowing the avenues for diplomacy, saying ""their simply do not match their words"". Her remarks come after Moscow said some of its troops had moved away from the border in recent days - but Western powers said there was no evidence of withdrawal. On Friday, US President Joe Bidensaid he is convincedMr Putin has decided to invade and that an assault could happen in the ""coming days"". Mr Biden said the assessment was based on US intelligence, which suggested the capital Kyiv would be targeted. Other Western politicians taking part in the three-day security conference include German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and US Vice-President Kamala Harris. But Russia will not be officially represented at the summit for the first time since 1999 amid the rising tensions over the situation at Ukraine's borders. Meanwhile, the Home Office hasscrapped a visa schemeoffering rich foreign investors fast-track residency, amid pressure on ministers over UK links to Russia. Labour has demanded the immediate publication of an ongoing review into visas granted between 2008 - when the scheme was introduced - and 2015 when checks on applicants were tightened. The Liberal Democrats have also demanded a ""clear timetable"" for revoking visas issued to any Russians ""who have been flagged as posing a national security risk"". The security conference in Germany comes as Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed rebels in the country's east continued to accuse each other of shelling and other ceasefire violations on Friday. Such breaks in the area's years-long ceasefire are not uncommon, and each side blamed the other for the violence on Thursday. On Friday, Washington increased its estimate of the number of Russian troops deployed around Ukraine to between 169,000 and 190,000. Ukraine's defence minister has suggested a figure of 149,000.

"Amazon's UK chief executive has been nominated to take over as president of the leading UK business organisation, the CBI. Brian McBride started his business life selling photocopiers for Xerox in the 1970s. He then joined IBM before being hired by Michael Dell to run Dell's operations in UK and Northern Europe. He built his career in digital and tech, first as boss of T-Mobile, where he launched 3G in the UK. He then moved to Amazon as UK chief executive, where he was responsible for building up its UK operations. Mr McBride, who grew up in Glasgow, was a non-executive director of Celtic between 2005 and 2009. Since his retirement, he has undertaken numerous portfolio roles, including chairman of Asos and, most recently, Trainline, as well as being on the board of the BBC. CBI director-general Tony Danker said he was ""hugely excited"" by Mr McBride's nomination. ""His career journey makes him an unmistakably authentic business leader who understands the challenges facing local SMEs and global listed firms alike,"" he said. ""His typical Glaswegian candour combined with his experience in some of the most prestigious boardrooms in the corporate world will prove invaluable to CBI and our members as we work to help them grasp the exciting opportunities in the decade ahead."" Mr McBride's nomination for the role of president will now go forward for a vote among members at the CBI's AGM on 28 June.

"Haileigh Ashton Lamont said she feels ""duty bound to speak up and help others"" after her own court case Last year, Haileigh Ashton Lamont saw her abuser jailed. The Belfast woman waived her anonymity to speak about the decade of childhood sexual abuse she had suffered at the hands of her stepfather. Tommy Harris receiveda 16-year sentence - eight to be spent in prison and eight on licence -after admitting 42 charges of sexual assault. Now, Haileigh wants to help other victims and survivors navigate the court system. She says the criminal justice system must change, and believes that change must start within society. ""By not speaking about child sexual abuse, the perpetrators are getting away with it,"" she told BBC News NI. ""There's absolutely no shame in talking about it and raising awareness to make people who are suffering feel supported. ""I'm never going to stop talking about this and I'm doing it because I don't want anyone to suffer the way I did because it was so tough. ""I feel duty bound to speak up and help others."" Haileigh believes that victims being given more information on the legal process, and being more involved, would improve the experience. ""Having gone through each stage of the process myself, I understand why some victims want to wash their hands of the process because it is re-traumatising,"" she said. ""And not knowing what to expect is hard. If victims were better prepared and had more knowledge, they could go to court with insight and support."" Haileigh is also calling for two legal changes. She does not think that defendants who plead guilty in historic abuse cases should be given reduced sentences. ""For me, the people who carried out this abuse had time to come forward. They're only in court because they were brought there, years later, so why should they get credit?"" she said. She also wants victims to be given the chance to deliver what is known as a victim impact statement in court. During her case, Haileigh was not allowed to read her statement in front of her abuser. ""That was so important for me, to face him like that, and I wasn't allowed to do it. And I felt brave and empowered to do it, but I wasn't allowed to,"" she said. ""It's not so much the words that you would say. It's the sound of your voice in a courtroom in front of other people saying: 'I've exposed you, you didn't get away with it. There are consequences.' ""We're not nameless or faceless statistics, and there's no shame so I think that victims should be able to stand in court and read out a statement and then choose, if they want to, to leave, never want to talk about it again - or confidently use their voice and be supported in doing that. ""We're not weak. What was done to us hasn't made us weak. ""Other people will want their anonymity and of course they should have that, but the choice should be there."" Haileigh Ashton Lamont last spoke to BBC News NI on the day her stepfather was jailed for abusing her Haileigh's case ended with a conviction but many other cases involving sexual abuse do not have the same outcome. The last available figures from the Public Prosecution Service show that between 2020 and 2021: 608 people were charged or reported for rape 26 defendants were brought to Crown Court for rape Eight people were convicted of rape ""My message has never been to encourage other victims to come forward,"" Haileigh said. ""I'm not saying you will go to police and your journey will be the same as mine, I know that's not the reality, and the statistics reflect that it's not going to be the same as my journey. ""All I want to do is to share my story to give other people hope and to better prepare victims for what to expect, if and when they do come forward. ""Whenever people hear a victim's story, I feel as though those sympathetic eyes need to turn to - what can we do to help? How are we going to change this? What can we do to come together and make a change? ""I respect that change will take time, but it does need to happen."" Haileigh has met Justice Minister Naomi Long to discuss her concerns. Naomi Long said the experience of abuse victims is crucial in shaping legislation to improve the justice system The minister told BBC News NI her department had introduced a two-year pilot scheme providing victims of sexual assault with sexual offences legal advisors to help guide them through the legal process. Ms Long said change takes time, but she is listening. ""We need to hear those real lived-in experiences that are sometimes less than perfect in order to challenge ourselves to do better,"" she said. ""Genuinely sitting down and listening to what victims have been through, working with them to try to address any deficit in the system, is to me one of the most important things we do as a department. ""It leads to real change, and I hope that Haileigh will see that too."" 'It has been a war, but today is my victory day' Man jailed for eight years for abusing stepdaughter 'While I was quiet, I was protecting a paedophile' After all that she has been through, would Haileigh go to court again? ""Every day I get up and I ask myself - if you'd have known everything you know now - back on the seventh of July 2020, when you walked into the police station, would you have still walked in?"" she said. ""And the answer is always, absolutely.""

"Amazon's UK chief executive has been nominated to take over as president of the leading UK business organisation, the CBI. Brian McBride started his business life selling photocopiers for Xerox in the 1970s. He then joined IBM before being hired by Michael Dell to run Dell's operations in UK and Northern Europe. He built his career in digital and tech, first as boss of T-Mobile, where he launched 3G in the UK. He then moved to Amazon as UK chief executive, where he was responsible for building up its UK operations. Mr McBride, who grew up in Glasgow, was a non-executive director of Celtic between 2005 and 2009. Since his retirement, he has undertaken numerous portfolio roles, including chairman of Asos and, most recently, Trainline, as well as being on the board of the BBC. CBI director-general Tony Danker said he was ""hugely excited"" by Mr McBride's nomination. ""His career journey makes him an unmistakably authentic business leader who understands the challenges facing local SMEs and global listed firms alike,"" he said. ""His typical Glaswegian candour combined with his experience in some of the most prestigious boardrooms in the corporate world will prove invaluable to CBI and our members as we work to help them grasp the exciting opportunities in the decade ahead."" Mr McBride's nomination for the role of president will now go forward for a vote among members at the CBI's AGM on 28 June.

"Foie gras is controversial because it involves force-feeding ducks to fatten their liver The UK government is likely to drop plans to ban imports of fur and foie gras, amid cabinet opposition. The measures were due to be included in the Animals Abroad Bill, to be introduced soon. But several cabinet ministers have raised different concerns about the proposals. The government said a final decision had not been taken but sources said the measures look set to be parked to allow other elements of the bill to progress. A spokesperson for the government said it was ""united in its commitment to upholding its world-leading standards in animal welfare"". Foie gras imports may be banned after Brexit UK to be 'global leader' on animal welfare Attempt to ban foie gras fails in Parliament British farmers are already banned from producing foie gras, a liver-based luxury French food opposed by animal rights campaigners because its production involves force-feeding ducks or geese. Fur farming has also been illegal in the UK since 2000, but campaigners have long been pushing for an import ban on fur farmed abroad. The Animals Abroad Bill is one of three pieces of legislation the government has drafted in a bid to improve animal welfare. It will include measures to crack down on hunting animals for trophies, as well as holidays that lead to the neglect of animals like elephants. But the bill has been delayed, amid debate over how parts of the legislation would be enforced. The UK imports almost all of its foie gras from France, where it is considered a heritage product Ministers have confirmed in recent weeks that they intend to ban importing hunting trophies from threatened species like lions, elephants and rhinos. But it's understood a ban on foie gras and fur imports is now likely to be dropped from the legislation, after a number of concerns raised by cabinet ministers. Some - including Brexit opportunities minister Jacob Rees Mogg - have raised concerns about personal choice. The BBC has been told that Mr Rees Mogg believes the government should not be imposing restrictions on consumers. He has also argued the planned ban would have no impact on animal welfare in the UK. Other ministers - including Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis - raised concerns the measures would not have included Northern Ireland, creating different rules in different parts of the UK. There were concerns over problems relating to theNorthern Ireland protocol, the part of the UK's Brexit deal under which Northern Ireland continues to follow product rules from the EU - where foie gras is traded freely. Defence secretary Ben Wallace also raised concerns about banning the bear fur used by the military for the hats worn by Guardsmen. Mr Wallace argues this is responsibly sourced under a cull run by the Canadian government - thoughcampaigners say that process still involves cruelty,external. The use of bearskin hats in the British Army has proved controversial with animal rights groups Towards the end of last year, Environment minister Lord Goldsmith told the BBC the government would legislate to ban imports at ""the earliest possible slot"". Claire Bass, executive director at the Humane Society International UK, said the government has said ""warm words"" about a ban, ""but the question is will they follow through with action"". ""I think a very large number of people will be disappointed if they don't,"" she said. She said the public backed action on animal welfare, but ""there can be a small number of influential Conservatives who perhaps want to  be eating foie gras while wearing fur and going hunting, who apparently sway the government's decision-making"". ""People won't stand for that."" Abigail Penny, executive director at Animal Equality UK, told the BBC that foie gras was an ""immensely cruel"" food product that could lead to liver disease in ducks and geese. She added: ""The UK government has been claiming for many years now that they would be looking to ban the importation. ""I think the ban matters a lot to those animals that are currently suffering and struggling. "" Fur has long been used in hats and coats, but has attracted controversy in the fashion world Frank Zilberkweit from the British Fur Trade Association said it would be difficult to enforce a ban - and the industry was transparent and sustainable. He said: ""The UK public will decide for themselves whether they wish to purchase fur. If the public agree that fur is not a suitable product to wear, they won't buy it."" He added: ""The fur trade is always happy to liaise with the government about ways to improve standards in the industry, and to explain what we are doing"" A government spokesperson emphasised no final decision on imports had been made. They added that under its Action plan for Animal Welfare, the government was committed to ""world-leading reforms"" to improve animal welfare in the UK and abroad, and planned to ""legislate further to protect animals abroad as soon as parliamentary time allows"". The spokesman added that the government had committed to building a ""clear evidence base to inform decisions on the import of foie gras"". They added that a recent call for evidence on fur products would be published ""soon"" and would inform ""any future decisions on the fur trade"".

Fierce winds from Storm Eunice toppled trees and sent debris flying, causing the deaths of a woman in her 30s in London, a man in his 20s in Hampshire, and a man in his 50s in Merseyside. A 122mph gust on the Isle of Wight set a provisional record in England, while the storm closed schools, disrupted travel and tore off roofs. About 400,000 homes were without power as of Friday night. Five people died elsewhere in Europe. Coastal areas of south-west England and south Wales, along with south-east England, had been on alert after rare red weather warnings were issued by the Met Office early on Friday, indicating a danger to life. There are several less-serious yellow warnings in place across Scotland, Northern Ireland and parts of northern England - because of concerns about wind, snow and ice.

The passenger was pronounced dead at the scene while the driver was taken to hospital with serious injuries. One man died and another was seriously injured when their pickup truck hit a tree on the A31 in Hampshire Coastal areas experienced some of the strongest winds Fallen trees blocked roads and railway lines across the country Police forces and local authorities across the country reported being inundated with phone calls related to the storm, with some having to ask the public only to dial 999 if there was a risk to life. London Fire Brigade declared a major incident in response to the volume of calls, and the Ambulance service in South Central England declared a critical incident due to demand on its emergency services. Among those injured were a woman with her baby, who was hit by a tree in Bedford - hurting her but leaving the baby unharmed. A driver in Wiltshire was in a serious condition and two passengers were taken to hospital after a car collided with a fallen tree, while others were injured in south London and Henley-on-Thames by falling trees and debris. Ms Price said her daughter was now really frightened of the wind, and the house had been condemned One minute Holly Price and her five-year-old daughter Olivia were having a normal day, the next they were forced to flee the house after the roof caved in. Holly, from Newport, south Wales, said: ""My daughter was upstairs and we heard an almighty bang and a lot of noise. ""I just dropped to the ground, then ran upstairs to grab my daughter because she was screaming."" The chimney breast had fallen through and left ""dust and debris everywhere"". ""The sound will never, ever leave me - it was just heart-breaking to hear my daughter screaming,"" said Holly, adding they were ""lucky to be alive"". The pair will be staying at a family member's house tonight, then see if they can get emergency shelter.

"Western leaders repeated warnings that a Russian invasion could come in the next few days The British Embassy office in the capital Kyiv is temporarily relocating to the western city of Lviv Russia has been accused of staging a fake crisis in a breakaway eastern region of Ukraine as a pretext for invasion Russian President Vladimir Putin said the situation in Eastern Ukraine was deteriorating Russia has been backing rebels in separatist-held areas there since 2014 Russia continues to increase the number of troops around Ukraine according to US officials Moscow continues to deny planning an invasion of Ukraine and accuses the West of stoking ""hysteria"" Edited by Deirdre Finnerty We're pausing our live coverage of the Ukraine crisis for today. Here's a round-up of some of Friday's key developments: Keep up with all thelatest developments here. A former high-ranking US national security official believes that Russia is working to manipulate media perceptions at home and abroad ahead of a potential invasion of Ukraine. Andrea Kendall-Taylor, an ex-senior analyst at the CIA and Deputy National Intelligence Officer for Russia and Eurasia at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, said she believes Russia is ""accelerating its efforts in the information domain"" to build the case for conflict. As examples, she pointed to Russian media coverage of purported mass graves discovered in separatist areas or the recent shelling of a kindergarten, which Russian-backed separatists blamed on Ukraine. ""The Russian media is really trying to spin this all up as Ukraine mounting an offensive,"" she said. ""It creates justification."" Kendall-Taylor added that Russian military doctrine views the ""information space"" as a key part of their competition with the US and the West. She added that this sort of media is aimed both at the Russian public and at external observers across the world. ""They're going to flood the information space with fabricated stories and half-truths in order to confuse and disorient, and make it hard for outside observers to discern the truth,"" she said.  The BBC's Moscow correspondent Steve Rosenberg sounds a note of scepticism about Russian claims of Ukrainian shelling in an eastern breakaway region. Allow Twitter content?

Russian media is reporting a fire at a gas pipeline has reportedly been put out. The BBC could not independently verify the reports. The cause of the fire and subsequent blast are not immediately clear. State media agency RIA has reported the director of the energy company that operates the pipeline has blamed ""sabotage"". It is unclear whether a second blaze reported in the Luhansk area has also been put out. US officials have said Russia may attempt to manufacture a reason to launch a military operation in Ukraine. Russian has denied the allegations. Russian news agencies have reported a second explosion in the separatist-held Luhansk area. A number of Russian media outlets, including Tass, Ria Novosti and Interfax - citing separatist sources - have reported the blast, which came approximately 40 minutes after another explosion was reported at a gas pipeline in the area. The causes of the explosions remain unclear. No casualties have so far been reported. Unverified video being shared on Twitter appears to show flames at the site of the explosion.

Kyiv's Independence Square, pictured on Friday President Biden says that Russian forces intend to strike at Ukraine's capital Kyiv. In his remarks at the White House, Biden said that the US believes that Russian forces are likely to act ""in the coming week"". ""We believe that they will target Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, a city of 2.8 million innocent people,"" he said. Biden added that the US is ""calling out"" Russia's plans repeatedly in a bid to ""remove any reason that Russia may give to justify invading Ukraine and prevent them from moving"". Biden is asked if the Ukrainian president's decision to attend the Munich Security Conference tomorrow is wise given the tensions with Russia, to which he says it is the president's call.  ""To be clear, you are convinced that President Putin is going to invade Ukraine, is that what you just said?"" Biden is asked. ""Yes,"" he replies. Mr Biden says that Russia is pushing out ""more and more disinformation to the Russia public"" including allegations that Ukraine is planning an offensive into rebel-held territory. ""There is simply no evidence for these assertions and it defies basic logic,"" he says. He says that Ukraine would not make any military advances in the region while the Russian build-up of troops along its borders continues. ""Throughout these tense moments, the Ukrainian forces have shown great judgement and restraint,"" Mr Biden adds. ""They refuse to let the Russian troops bait them into war."" He goes on to call for Russia to avoid a ""catastrophic and needless war of choice"". ""Russia has still choose diplomacy. It's not too late to return to the negotiation table."" Biden says Nato allies are ""united and resolved"" in the face of Russian disinformation. He accuses Russia of trying to ""set up false justification"" for war against Ukraine. The White House has just provided a readout of Mr Biden's call with western leaders. The 45-minute meeting was held to discuss ""the likelihood of further Russian aggression against Ukraine,"" according to the statement. The leaders also ""expressed deep concern over Russiaâs continued build-up of forces, reiterated their strong support for Ukraineâs sovereignty and territorial integrity, and discussed the importance of further economic assistance to Ukraine"". The group also pledged to continue pursuing diplomacy and discussed efforts to ""ensure the defence and security of Nato's eastern flank"". The call was joined by the leaders of Canada, France, the UK, Germany, Italy, Poland, Romania, Nato the European Commission and the European Council. President Biden has started speaking about the situation in Ukraine, beginning by describing calls he has made with the US Congress and with US allies. Video being widely shared on social media purports to show a large explosion in Luhansk, the capital and administrative centre of the Russian-backed separatist Luhansk People's Republic. The video could not be immediately verified, but has been reported as being from a gas pipeline that caught on fire. The cause of the fire and subsequent blast are not immediately clear. Tensions have been high in the region following repeated US claims that Russia is planning a ""false flag"" operation to give it a pretext to launch a military operation in Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly denied it plans to invade Ukraine.  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The UK has become the latest Western nation to accuse Russian intelligence of being behind a cyberattack on the Ukrainian government and bank websites earlier this week. Earlier, US officials claimed Russia was behind the hack that targeted the Ukrainian defence ministry and two of the country's biggest financial institutions. Moscow has denied responsibility for the attacks. The UK foreign office says the attacks had ""involved the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate"". It adds: ""The decision to publicly attribute this incident underline the fact that the UK and its allies will not tolerate malicious cyber activity"". The video of separatist leader Leonid Pasechnik ordering an evacuation was recorded two days ago, according to metadata As Ukraine accuses Russia of trying to create a fake crisis in the breakaway eastern region of Donbas, the BBC has obtained evidence that casts doubt on claims made by pro-Russian separatists that a Ukrainian assault is imminent. Earlier today, the leadership of the pro-Russian Donetsk and Luhansk rebel republics in eastern Ukraine released videos giving details of the evacuation of residents. In one of the videos, the leader claims that, due to Ukrainian shelling, the order has been given to evacuate civilians, saying: âToday, Friday 18 Februaryâ¦"". Following reports on social media, the BBC has checked the metadata of the videos posted, and has found that the metadata shows they were recorded on Wednesday 16 February - two days ago, before the recent flare-up in hostilities. This suggests that the escalation was pre-planned. President Biden is due to make a televised address in the coming moments. It comes after a 45-minute phone call he held earlier today with western leaders. The White House says that it is up to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to decide whether to leave his country to attend a security conference in Munich, Germany. ""Regardless of what decision he makes, he will have the support of the United States,"" White House spokesperson Jen Psaki told reporters. The Munich Security Conference was founded in 1963 as a way for Western leaders to discuss threats and dangers. Russia is not attending for first time since 1999. The US is prepared to unleash major sanctions that would inhibit Russia's ability to import technology from other countries, including China, according to a top US economic official. Deputy National Economic Council Director Daleep Singh said the US was prepared to launch crippling sanctions in the event that Russia ""weaponises its energy supply"" by cutting off supplies to western Europe. He added that measures to ban Russia from the Swift electronic financial system - a network used by global banks to transfer money - are not likely to be included in the initial sanctions package in the event of invasion. As we await to hear from President Joe Biden at 21:00GMT, here's a round-up of the key events in the Ukraine crisis so far today: White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki says that the US continues to believe that Russia is preparing to invade, adding that the evacuations from rebel-held provinces in Ukraine today are an example of Moscow using misinformation as a pretext for war. ""If Russia doesn't invade we would be relieved,"" she told reporters on Friday. She refused to say whether President Biden read the lengthy list of Russian demands that Moscow submitted to the US ambassador on Thursday. The news conference comes as Mr Biden holds a conference call with transatlantic Nato leaders. The call, she said, is ""an effort to have a conversation with his counterparts about what we are seeing, where things stand and continue that close co-ordination that's been going on for months now.""
