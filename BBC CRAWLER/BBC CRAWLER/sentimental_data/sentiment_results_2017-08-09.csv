"Despite reported threat to Guam, Americans can ""sleep soundly"", says Rex Tillerson US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis has told North Korea to avoid actions that could usher in the ""end of its regime and the destruction of its people"". The Pentagon chief also said Pyongyang would be ""grossly overmatched"" in a war against the US and its allies. His stark warning comes a day after President Donald Trump threatened North Korea with ""fire and fury"". US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson sought to assure Americans there was no imminent threat. In Wednesday's strongly worded statement, Mr Mattis called on Pyongyang to halt its arms programme. Should you worry about war? The North Korea crisis in 300 words Analysis: Where do we go after 'fire and fury'? ""The DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) must choose to stop isolating itself and stand down its pursuit of nuclear weapons,"" the US Marine Corps general said. ""While our state department is making every effort to resolve this global threat through diplomatic means, it must be noted that the combined allied militaries now possess the most precise, rehearsed and robust defensive and offensive capabilities on Earth."" This video can not be played North Koreans rally to denounce 'gangster' US Pyongyang's actions ""will continue to be grossly overmatched by ours and would lose any arms race or conflict it initiates"", Mr Mattis added. Mr Trump - who has said he will not allow Pyongyang to develop a nuclear weapon capable of hitting the US - boasted earlier on Wednesday of America's atomic arsenal. In early morning tweets from New Jersey where he is on holiday, the president said the US nuclear stockpile was ""more powerful than ever before"". He added,externalthat he was hopeful ""we will never have to use this power"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The tweets come amid escalating rhetoric between the two sides. North Korea's state-run KCNA news agency said on Wednesday that Pyongyang was ""carefully examining"" a plan to strike the US territory of Guam. The Pacific island is home to US military bases, strategic bombers and about 163,000 people. Stopping in Guam to refuel after a trip to South East Asia, Mr Tillerson said he was hopeful a global ""pressure campaign"" involving Russia and China could lead to new dialogue with Pyongyang ""about a different future"". This video can not be played President Trump threatened a response 'like the world has never seen' America's top diplomat also defended President Trump's language. He said North Korean leader Kim Jong-un did not understand diplomatic language, and a strong message was needed that he could understand. Mr Tillerson added the situation had not dramatically changed over the last few days, and that Americans ""should sleep well at night"". China has urged calm, describing the situation as ""complex and sensitive"". Anthony Zurcher, BBC senior North America reporter As Donald Trump made his ""fire and fury"" threat against North Korea, the lone camera in the room zoomed in for a tight shot. It would have been telling to see the effect those words had on his advisers. Did they nod knowingly or look surprised? Was this part of the plan or an off-the-cuff presidential remark they'd have to clean up? A day later and thousands of miles away, Rex Tillerson had out his mop and broom. The secretary of state said Mr Trump was merely reasserting that the US would defend itself if attacked, using language North Korea would understand. That's not exactly what the president said, however. He warned of retribution if Kim Jong-un continued to make threats - punishing words with action. It could simply be unfortunate phrasing from a man who is sometimes loose with words. Mr Tillerson would not be the first presidential aide intent on framing Mr Trump's blunt statements in a softer light. With the president touting US nuclear might and test-firing an ICBM, however, the secretary of state - already considered to have little sway in this administration - may find his efforts at clarification buried in a torrent of bluster. The White House on Wednesday denied reports that Mr Trump's ""fire and fury"" statement a day earlier, unusually provocative for a US president, was an off-the-cuff remark that had caught his inner circle unawares. Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters: ""The tone and strength of the message were discussed beforehand."" What damage could N Korea do without nuclear weapons? Pyongyang releases Canadian pastor N Korea hides anti-US message in cartoon Despite rounds of UN sanctions, Pyongyang carried out two nuclear bomb tests last year and two intercontinental ballistic missile tests in July. On Tuesday,media reports in the US,externalclaimed the North had achieved its goal of making a nuclear warhead small enough to fit inside its missiles. However, most analysts doubt the tiny dictatorship would launch a suicidal pre-emptive attack on the US.

US military bases cover about a quarter of the island. About 6,000 personnel are based there and there are plans to move in thousands more. It was a key US base in World War Two, and remains a vital staging post for US operations, giving access to potential flashpoints like theSouth China Sea,the Koreasand theTaiwan Straits.

"This video can not be played A couple are helpless as they watch online as a burglar targets their home A horrified couple watched a burglar break into their home on a CCTV app while they were on holiday 120 miles away. Donna Marusamy, 37, was with her husband and children in Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset, when she had a notification that sensors had detected movement in their back garden in the West Midlands. The couple looked on in horror as the burglar walked into their living room. She alerted her brother-in-law and the thief fled when he arrived. The head teacher, of Streetly, said: ""I wish to God I hadn't seen it unfold."" Wedding rings belonging to her husband, Nathan, 45, and his father were taken along with an Air-King Rolex, Indian gold jewellery and passports at about 22:15 BST on Friday.

"Lawrence was photographed by Annie Leibovitz for US Vogue's September issue Jennifer Lawrence has said the leaking of nude photos of her left her feeling ""blindsided"". Intimate images of the Oscar-winning actress were published onlinein 2014. She toldVogue,external: ""I think people saw [the hacking] for what it was, which was a sex crime, but that feeling, I haven't been able to get rid of it. ""Having your privacy violated constantly isn't a problem if you're perfect. But if you're human, it's terrifying."" She added: ""When my publicist calls me, I'm like, 'Oh, my God, what is it?'

Lawrence spoke to Vogue for their 125th anniversary issue The actress is the cover star for US Vogue's prestigious September issue, for which she has been photographed by Annie Leibovitz and Inez & Vinoodh. Vogue also commissioned artist John Currin to paint her for one of the four covers as part of the celebrations for the magazine's 125th anniversary issue. Lawrence also spoke about her relationship with director Darren Aronofsky, who she's been dating for the past year. The pair met while filming her new movie Mother!, which Aronofsky directs, and became an item shortly after. ""When I saw the movie, I was reminded all over again how brilliant he is,"" Lawrence said of the 48-year-old.

The vulnerable victims, some as young as 14, were exploited by a ""cynical organisation"", a court heard. The 17 men and one woman were convicted of rape, supplying drugs and conspiracy to incite prostitution. Over the course of four trials, 20 young women gave evidence covering a period from 2011 to 2014. These trials involved 26 defendants facing a total of more than 100 charges and 22 victims. Those prosecuted were from the Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Indian, Iraqi, Iranian and Turkish communities and mainly British-born, with most living in the West End of Newcastle. Of the 26, four people have been jailed. The rest will be sentenced next month. It also emerged during the court process thatpolice paid a convicted child rapist Â£10,000 as an informant. Reaction after 18 people convicted over abuse ""Vile crimes committed by evil men"" The victims were at first flattered by the attention of the men who apparently befriended them, but were then lured to parties, known as ""sessions"", by the promise of alcohol and drugs - often mephedrone (or M-Kat), Newcastle Crown Court heard. Bags of M-Kat were left on coffee tables for the girls to help themselves. The parties took place at premises around the West End, including the top floor of tower block Todd's Nook, where one teenager said she was raped three times. The prosecution said they became the ""vulnerable victims of an organised, cynical, systematic organisation in which they were passed between their abusers."" This video can not be played Operation Sanctuary was the biggest investigation into sexual exploitation by Northumbria Police Some spoke of being ""too intoxicated"" to defend themselves, while others became addicted and had to commit sexual acts in return for drugs. One victim said she had attended about 60 parties and another told of going to an address where there were two older men and a woman, who seemed ""frightened and scared, like a slave"". She said: ""They told us what she would do for them for money and drugs or she'd get battered."" Another victim said: ""I knew that if we wanted drugs or alcohol we would have to do something. ""[He] had us too intoxicated to fight him off. One time, [he] locked the door. I was told I would only be allowed out if I had sex."" Northumbria Police set up Operation Sanctuary in December 2013 to investigate claims of sexual abuse against girls and young women. The investigation is ongoing and to date has resulted in 461 arrests. Police have spoken to 703 potential complainants and 278 victims have been identified. The victims were abused at addresses around the West End of Newcastle Due to its size, the investigation was split into a number of spin-off operations. Operation Shelter uncovered groups of men in the West End of Newcastle - many of whom were known to each other - who exploited vulnerable young women and girls over a period from 2010 to 2014. This eventually led to four separate trials, the first commencing in September 2015 and the final one which has just concluded, allowing previous reporting restrictions to be lifted. Chris Jackson, BBC Inside Out in the North East and Cumbria Sarah (not her real name) was 19, extremely vulnerable and unable to look after herself. Along with other at-risk teenagers she was regularly abused by older men. In the new year of 2014, Sarah told the police she had been raped by Abdul Minoyee. A police officer took Sarah on a tour of the West End to try identify Minoyee's house and car and other places where these ""parties"" had taken place. Sarah's information was a red flag - the abuse was on a much bigger scale. The detective in charge of Sarah's case told his bosses that what she had said signalled something much bigger. Days later the officer's hunch was given added weight when two girls in care reported that they had been repeatedly raped by a group of older Asian men. The girls were aged 14 and 15. They described being driven into Newcastle where they were plied with alcohol and cocaine before being raped and beaten by several men. They were given money before being returned home. One of the victims was in local authority care at the time. Newcastle City Council has launched a serious case review that is due to be published in December. Council leader Nick Forbes said: ""These were vile crimes committed by evil men. ""The victims ... have been brave beyond belief and undoubtedly have made our city safer."" Chief Constable Steve Ashman said: ""We have not and will not stop. ""There has been no political correctness here. These are criminals and there has been no hesitation in arresting them and targeting them using all the means at our disposal."" Now that reporting restrictions can be lifted, it can be revealed that a police officer was sacked for failing to investigate a sex offender's phone. It related to an earlier Operation Sanctuary investigation, which resulted in theconviction of Bahmani Ahmadi. Mr Ashman said the officer should have been much more diligent, and that his dismissal should provide reassurance that the police culture in Northumbria had changed.

"This video can not be played How could war with North Korea unfold? The US president has threatened to ""totally destroy"" North Korea if his country is forced to defend itself or its allies. North Korea has conducted its sixth nuclear test, threatened to fire off missiles towards the US island territory of Guam and said it might test a hydrogen bomb in the Pacific Ocean. And all this comes amid reports that Pyongyang may have finally succeeded in miniaturising a nuclear weapon that could fit on an inter-continental missile - a prospect long dreaded by the US and its Asian allies. Is this a precursor to military conflict? Experts say you should not panic - just yet. This is why: This is one of the most important things to keep in mind. A war on the Korean peninsula serves no-one's interests. The North Korean government's main goal is survival - and direct conflict with the US would seriously jeopardise it. As BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Marcus notes, any North Korean attack against the US or its allies in the current context could quickly spiral into a wider war - and we have to assume the Kim Jong-un government is not suicidal. In fact, this is why North Korea has been trying so hard to become a nuclear-armed power. Having this capability, it reasons, would protect the government by raising the costs of toppling it. Kim Jong-un does not want to go the way of Libya's Muammar Gaddafi or Iraq's Saddam Hussein. What damage could North Korea do without nuclear weapons? Trump and Kim call each other mad Andrei Lankov of Kookmin University in Seoultold the UK's Guardian newspaper,externalthere was ""very little probability of conflict"" but North Koreans were equally ""not interested in diplomacy"" at this point. ""They want to get the ability to wipe out Chicago from the map first, and then they will be interested in diplomatic solutions,"" Mr Lankov said. What about a pre-emptive US strike? The US knows that a strike on North Korea would force the government there to retaliate against US allies South Korea and Japan. This would result in a massive loss of life, including the deaths of thousands of Americans - troops and civilians. Additionally, Washington does not want to risk any nuclear-tipped missiles being fired off towards the US mainland. Finally, China - Pyongyang's only ally - has helped to prop up the North Korean government precisely because its collapse is deemed to be a strategically worse outcome. US and South Korean troops just across the Chinese border is a prospect that Beijing does not want to have to face - and that is what war would bring. President Trump may have threatened North Korea with language uncommon for a US president but this does not mean the US is actively moving on to a war footing. As one anonymous US military official told Reuters news agency back in August: ""Just because the rhetoric goes up, doesn't mean our posture changes."" New York Times columnist Max Fisher agrees: ""These are the sorts of signals, not a leader's offhand comments, that matter most in international relations."" In a tense environment, a misinterpreted move could lead to war What is more, after North Korea's sixth nuclear test in early September and missile tests over Japan, the US has reverted to a tried and true tactic: squeezing Pyongyang through UN Security Council and unilateral sanctions. And its diplomats are still speaking hopefully of returning to the negotiating table - pointing to support from China and Russia. These send conflicting signals to Pyongyang but also moderate the tough rhetoric coming from President Trump. The North Korea crisis in 300 words What missiles does North Korea have? Decoding Kim's nuclear Pacific threat Still, some analysts say a misinterpreted move in the current tense environment could lead to an accidental war. ""There could be a power outage in North Korea that they mistake as a part of a pre-emptive attack,"" Daryl Kimball, of US think tank Arms Control Association, told the BBC. ""The United States might make a mistake on the [Demilitarised Zone]. So there are various ways in which each side can miscalculate and the situation escalates out of control"". It is worth noting that US bombers recentlyflew close to North Koreain a show of force. Days later North Korea's foreign ministersaid Pyongyang had the right to shoot down US bombersas President Trump had ""declared war"" on North Korea - a reference to a particularly pugnacious tweet from Mr Trump. However it is not the first time that North Korea has accused the US of declaring war on it. As former US Assistant Secretary of State PJ Crowley points out, the US and North Korea came close to armed conflict in 1994, when Pyongyang refused to allow international inspectors into its nuclear facilities. Diplomacy won out. Over the years, North Korea has regularly made incendiary threats against the US, Japan and South Korea, several times threatening to turn Seoul into a ""sea of fire"". And Mr Trump's rhetoric - in content, if not style - is also not exactly unprecedented from a US president. ""In many different forms, albeit not as colourful, the US has always said that if North Korea ever attacks, the regime will cease to exist,"" Mr Crowley writes. PJ Crowley: Where to now after 'fire and fury'? The difference this time, he adds, is the US president has appeared to suggest he might take pre-emptive action (though Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has played this down.) This kind of unpredictable, bellicose rhetoric coming from the White House is unusual and does have people worried, analysts say. South Korea - the US ally with the most to lose from a confrontation with the North - has called for a cooling of rhetoric from both Pyongyang and the White House. No one wants Kim Jong-un to think an attack might be imminent.

"European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker spent 25,000 euros (Â£22,600) on a private plane to take a nine-person delegation to Rome, campaigners have discovered. The use of the ""air taxi"" was among almost â¬500,000 (Â£451,000) in EU commissioners' transport and hotel bills during January and February 2016. They were unearthed by Spanish-based Access Info and Belgian magazine Knack. The Commission said the spending was within the EU's rules. Brexit: All you need to know It was also scrutinized annually by the European Parliament, a spokeswoman added. On Mr Juncker's trip from Brussels to Italy, he held meetings with then-Italian PM Matteo Renzi, the Senate president and the president of the chamber of deputies, among others. Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva said the private jet was chartered because there was ""no viable commercial plane available that would fit the president's agenda"" and stressed the 2,927 euro (Â£2,650) per person cost of the flight. If the European Commission fears the return of the allegation that the EU is a giant gravy train (or a ""gravy plane,"" maybe), then they did not show it. Officials mounted a passionate defence of how much the 28 European commissioners spend on travel. It's their job to promote EU policies abroad! It's all within the rules! And the European Parliament approves the accounts! Jean-Claude Juncker's â¬25,000 private plane to Rome was shared with eight officials who had no other way of getting there. And rules specify the maximum that can be claimed for a hotel room. For example, a night in Latvia cannot cost more than â¬105. And is the commission in first class when it comes to the cost of diplomacy? Vice president Frans Timmermans spent the equivalent of Â£6,200 on travel in two months. In comparison, separate documents in the UK show that, say, the Brexit Secretary David Davis spent Â£10,576 over a similar period. She also described flights on ""air taxis"" as ""hard work"", which includes ""reading documents with your files and marking them"", adding: ""So I think you will be disappointed as to the travelling experience."" Among the other expenditure detailed, the foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini spent â¬75,000 (Â£67,700) on a trip to Azerbaijan and Armenia. Campaigners have spent several years trying to obtain detailed information about officials' expenses, with the commission arguing that collating it poses a big administrative burden. UKIP MEP Nigel Farage,whose own expenses claims have come under scrutiny in the past, said Mr Juncker's use of a private plane over a commercial option was ""outrageous"".

"When a man took an upskirt photograph of Gina Martin at a music festival she went straight to the police. And when they closed her case, she began a petition to get it reopened, as she explains here. On 8 July 2017, I was standing in the crowd at the British Summer Time music festival in London's Hyde Park having a laugh with my big sister and waiting for The Killers to take the stage. Two men were standing next to us, and after offering us some chips (and me accepting a couple) they became incredibly creepy. One of the men - with dark hair - was worse than his taller blond friend. He constantly asked me questions, I caught him looking me up and down and he was laughing and joking with his friend about me. Then he rubbed up against me. I think that's when it happened. At some point he put his phone between my legs, positioned his camera up my skirt and took pictures of my crotch in broad daylight. Gina and her sister at British Summer Time, about an hour before it happened At the time I had no idea what he had done. My sister and I were excitedly waiting to see a band we've loved since we were teenagers. But while we were watching the stage I saw something out of the corner of my eye. The tall, blond guy was looking at something on his phone and laughing. It was my crotch covered by a thin strip of underwear. Even though it was a small picture, I knew it was me straight away. I snatched the phone out of his hand and started shouting that he'd taken a photo up my skirt. He screamed back at me - towering over me and pointing in my face - that it was a picture of the stage. Next, he grabbed hold of my shoulders and pushed me, demanding I give him his phone back. I couldn't loosen his grip so I made eye contact with as many people around me as I could, shouting: ""Help me. Help me!"" I slipped the phone into the hand of a girl next to me who I had been chatting to minutes earlier. He stood over her aggressively. ""Give me the phone,"" he spat. She refused. I caught the eye of a young guy who was standing near me: ""Run!"" he said. So I did. I grabbed the phone back and bolted through the crowd, crying, and appealing to people to let me through. I ran as fast as I could, but could hear him right behind me. ""Give me my phone!"" he screamed. I made a bee-line for the security staff and as soon as they saw the state I was in - and the man running after me - they formed a protective circle around me. He ran into them, flailing, trying to reach me and screaming that he hadn't taken the picture. I tried to calm him down but it wasn't working. The security guard told me to slip the phone into his back pocket. I did. This video can not be played Gina Martin and Professor of Law Clare McGlynn discuss upskirt photography on Woman's Hour We waited for a minute or two for the police to come, and I asked if we could stand nearer the crowd and sing. I wanted to pretend this wasn't happening. Security allowed us to move about three metres away from them. We stood near the security gate, hugged each other and forced ourselves to dance to The Killers' first song. In reality I was just blubbing through every word and my sister was trying not to cry. When the police officers arrived - a man and a woman - I did my best to explain what had happened, even though I was a complete mess. They were kind and compassionate. One of them told me I ""should be able to go to a festival in 30-degree heat and wear a skirt without worrying about this happening"". They separated me and the blond guy and questioned him for a minute or two. When they came back over to me the male police officer was apologetic - he told me, ""Unfortunately, I've had to look at the picture. It shows more than you'd likeâ¦ but it's not graphic. So there's not much we can do because you can't see anything bad. I'm going to be honest - you might not hear much from us."" He asked me if I wanted to give a statement and I didn't feel I could at the time. I was standing in the middle of a field, crying, and I could hardly think. I just wanted to enjoy what was left of my (very expensive) night out and worry about it later. The police finished by reassuring me that they had ""made him delete the picture"". At this point, because of the mess I was in, it didn't occur to me that this was my evidence. The photograph wasn't considered graphic because I had knickers on - if I had chosen not to wear any underwear it might have been dealt with entirely differently - but I don't see how what I was wearing should affect their response. Five days later I was sitting on a bus to the Latitude festival with a bag of clothes I'd spent far too long considering. Should I pack skirts, or was that stupid after what just happened? I received a call from the police, who told me that the case had been closed but they once again assured me that they had deleted the picture. With a clear head and time to think about it, I couldn't believe what I was hearing. This wasn't good enough. Gina Martin at Latitude festival A few days later I posted a status update on Facebook with a picture of the guys, after realising they were in the background of a picture of me and my sister at the gig. I wanted to embarrass them. I wanted someone to tell me who they were. My post went viral within days, on both Twitter and Facebook. Other women shared similar experiences with me and that's when I realised this was a bigger problem. I began receiving messages, some of support and some of hate. Some people told me to wear a longer skirt, to stop trying to get attention and to stop lying. Others told me I was doing it for publicity and that it was my own fault I'd been targeted. An upskirt photo is a photo taken up someone's skirt without consent Such photos may end up on dedicated upskirt websites - which are big business Some perpetrators have been known to use a camera embedded in the top of their shoe To discourage covert photos, phones sold in Japan have a shutter sound that cannot be disabled Upskirting is an offence in Scotlandunder the Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2009,external In England, Wales and Northern Ireland it's harder to prosecute Source:Prof Clare McGlynn,external I started a petition with Care2 to get my case reopened (it now stands at more than 50,000 signatures). I struggled to get anything done at work that week. For seven days I was being trolled and receiving awful messages. At one point I became a meme - teenagers tagged themselves in my post with phrases like ""Viva la upskirters!"" and crying-laughing emojis. Their friends replied with ""Lol. Slag."" I struggled to sleep, from the attention and stress, and I lost my appetite. I don't think you really know how victim-blaming affects you until you've been there. It's awful. I started to research how I could prosecute, and through conversations with lawyers, friends and organisations such as ""Safe gigs for Women"" and ""Girls Against"", I found out that upskirt photos aren't specifically listed as a sexual offence in England and Wales. Perpetrators don't often get charged with voyeurism, either - voyeurism laws only protect victims if they're in a private place like a changing room or at home. But I was at a festival - a public place. I found out that the one law I could charge under was an old common law called ""outraging public decency"" - a law that states something lewd or indecent happened in public and at least two people saw it. Ironically, it is usually applied to flashers. So, to put it plainly, the only law that protects a victim of upskirting in England and Wales is one that worries about what the public saw, not the victim who's been harassed. It's an old law too - victims don't push for it because they don't know about it. If they had known about that law would the police have dealt with my case differently? Something has to change here, and that's why I'm campaigning to make upskirt photography a sexual offence. Scotland just did it. So we could too. My case has since been reopened and I hope that the men are prosecuted. But this isn't just about my case. My next step is to have the laws amended so that upskirt photos are listed as a sexual offence and a ""victim crime"", not a public nuisance. The Met takes allegations of voyeurism seriously and does and will investigate them thoroughly. We use a range of policing tactics and deploy officers on specific operations to target this sort of criminal behaviour based on intelligence. We understand that it can be incredibly invasive and distressing for those that this happens to. In this specific case we believed the allegation had originally been dealt with in line with the victim's wishes. We have subsequently recontacted the victim and inquiries are ongoing.

"Peter Wrighton's body was found in woodland close to East Harling at about 10:45 BST on Saturday The family of an 83-year-old dog walker ""brutally"" stabbed to death have described him as ""immensely kind"". Peter Wrighton's body was found on Saturday near Fiveways Junction, three miles south of East Harling in Norfolk. He was repeatedly stabbed in his neck and head, post-mortem examination tests showed. The murder weapon has not yet been found. Norfolk Police said it was not yet known if retired BT worker Mr Wrighton, from Banham, knew his killer. LIVE: Updates on this story and other Norfolk news Officers said they had received more than 100 calls in the past three days about the murder. Mr Wrighton, a married father-of-two and grandfather, has been described as ""gentle"" and ""mild mannered"". Peter Wrighton, who lived in Banham, near Attleborough, leaves two children and a wife of 59 years Peter Wrighton was out walking his two dogs when he was killed In a statement, his wife of 59 years and family said: ""Peter was immensely kind and never had a bad word to say about anybody and people always seemed to take a liking to him. ""We are extremely thankful for all the people who have come forward to speak with the police and hope we will soon be able to understand why this has happened."" Mr Wrighton had volunteered at Snetterton Dogs Trust and Bressingham Steam Museum as a guard on the trains. Phil Moore, parish secretary at the St Mary the Virgin church in Banham, said he was shocked and saddened The dogs trust said his murder was a ""devastating situation"". Phil Moore, parish secretary at the St Mary the Virgin church in Banham, who knew Mr Wrighton, said: ""He was a very nice man, a very gentle man. He would stop and have a chat. He loved his dogs and loved his family. He never had a bad word to say about anybody. ""I am very sad. It will be a shock not to see him around the village."" Police are asking anyone who lives close to the murder scene to check their bins for a weapon Alastair Baker, from the steam museum, added: ""We were already shocked that something had happened so locally but to find out it involved Peter is even more shocking. ""He was a kind, gentle guy who everybody liked. Our thoughts are with his family who must be devastated."" Mr Wrighton's body was found at about 10:45 BST on Saturday. Norfolk Constabulary has about 50 officers working on the murder case. A police cordon remains in place at the scene Mr Wrighton's dogs were found close to where he was murdered and are safe and well The force has asked people who live within five miles (8km) of the scene tocheck their binsfor ""a weapon or anything unusual"". Ch Supt Mike Fawcett said: ""It's unusual to have an attack where we can't show if there's any connection between the victim and the offender, and we don't know the motive for the attack."" He added: ""If the victim is not known to the attacker, it is really strange for somebody to just attack somebody in the open. ""We have somebody who is violent out there and it's somebody we need to find quick."" He said if someone is ""protecting somebody"" they should consider the victim of the crime. Police said there was no indication Mr Wrighton had been killed in a robbery. A71-year-old woman was raped,externalat West Harling heath in 1994, close to the location of Saturday's murder.

"Aleix was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes aged 18 The first trial of a pioneering therapy to retrain the immune system and slow the advance of type 1 diabetes has shown it is safe. The disease is caused by the body destroying cells in the pancreas that control blood sugar levels. The immunotherapy - tested on 27 people in the UK - also showed signs of slowing the disease, but this needs confirming in larger trials. Experts said the advance could one day free people from daily injections. Aleix Rowlandson, from Lancashire, was diagnosed in 2015 aged 18. ""Your blood sugars affect how much energy you have,"" she told the BBC. ""If they're high, they can make you feel tired. If they're low, you can feel shaky. ""I'm more optimistic knowing that the study has gone well and they can use that to find further treatments. ""Even if it doesn't help me, myself, and it might help other people in the future, I'm very happy."" Aleix's immune system is attacking her beta cells, which release the hormone insulin to keep blood sugar levels stable. As a result, she has to inject insulin several times a day. Aleix is taking part in the trials of immunotherapy at the National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre at Guy's and St Thomas'. It is an attempt to stop her diabetes by tapping into the immune system's natural checks and balances. The body's defence system is primed to attack hostile invaders. But it also has ""regulatory T cells"", which calm the immune response and prevent it attacking the body's own tissues. Immunotherapies try to get regulatory T cells on-side by exposing them to fragments of proteins found in beta cells. Prof Mark Peakman, from King's College London, told the BBC News website: ""This is a landmark in the sense it's the first time it has been done. ""Importantly, [the trial] shows the overall safety is good and there is some evidence we're restoring the balance and getting some regulatory T cells activated."" Patients given the therapy did not need to increase their dose of insulin during the trial. However, it is too soon to say this therapy stops type 1 diabetes and larger clinical trials will be needed. And further types of immunotherapy that should deliver an even stronger reaction are already underway. The trial focused on patients newly diagnosed with type 1 as they still have about a fifth of their beta cells left. Even retaining these cells would make it easier to manage the condition, but the ultimate goal is to intervene even earlier to hopefully prevent the disease starting. However, it is not likely to help people diagnosed with type 1 years ago. Prof Peakman added: ""At that stage, most of the beta cells have gone and we don't find, with any therapies tried, any evidence of regeneration so it seems unlikely to help someone who has had the disease for a while."" All the volunteers were injected either every two or four weeks for six months. Karen Addington, the UK chief executive of the type 1 diabetes charity JDRF, said: ""Exciting immunotherapy research like this increases the likelihood that one day insulin-producing cells can be protected and preserved. ""That would mean people at risk of type 1 diabetes might one day need to take less insulin, and perhaps see a future where no-one would ever face daily injections to stay alive."" Follow Jameson Twitter,external. There are two main types of diabetes: type 1 - where the pancreas does not produce any insulin type 2 - where the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or the body's cells do not react to insulin Type 1 diabetes can develop at any age, but usually appears before the age of 40, particularly in childhood. About 10% of all diabetes is type 1, but it is the most common type of childhood diabetes, so it is sometimes called juvenile diabetes or early onset diabetes Type 2 diabetes tends to develop later in life and is linked to lifestyle and being overweight.

Since media outlets from across the country and globe started requesting interviews with her, asking her to explain her bold attempt to halt homicides for three days in a city where someone is murdered almost every day, Bridgeford started bringing them to her childhood neighbourhood in West Baltimore. After a local television crew packed up and left, the 44-year-old mediation trainer decided to push through the unlocked door of the townhouse and show her three children - aged 17 to 21 - around for the first time. Erricka Bridgeford, right centre, sits with her friend Ellen Gee, right, and her children outside of an abandoned rowhouse The family wanders the empty rooms in matching orange #BaltimoreCeasefire T-shirts. The air smells of urine, the walls are pocked with holes and smudged with the dirty outline of missing appliances. Upstairs, a used condom lies on the floor of what was once Bridgeford's parents' room. ""This is the house that made me,"" she tells her children. ""I feel sad that it looks like this. This looks like a light left out."" The empty townhouse is a reflection of some of the underlying causes of the violence in Baltimore. From that second-storey window, Bridgeford watched as drugs moved into her neighbourhood in the 1980s, and the families moved out. Her friends started dropping out of school and selling dope. The grass turned to dirt. Along with the poverty and drugs came the guns - Mike was the first of nearly 20 people Bridgeford knew who've died from violence. But on this particular morning, Bridgeford is in high spirits - it's Friday, 4 August, day one of the ""Baltimore Ceasefire"". Although the campaign is not affiliated with the Baltimore Police Department or any other arm of the city government, a trusted police contact has promised to text her if anyone is killed over the three days. Eleven hours in, the peace is holding. ""The air feels different,"" says Bridgeford. ""Even the sceptics are saying, 'I hope it works.'"" Erricka Bridgeford stands at the window of her childhood bedroom The naysayers have some reason to feel that way. The idea for the weekend was set in motion after Bridgeford had a conversation with her 19-year-old son about the city murder rate, which is on track to be the worst in its recorded history and could rise to the highest in the country. Per capita, it's already surpassed Chicago, Detroit and New Orleans. Bridgeford bristles at some of the comments that have been made online, mocking her and the city for even needing such an effort. ""We want to purposefully have a pause and a sacred space where everybody's intention is 'nobody gets killed'. A cultural shift, so that it dawns on people that they can make this choice,"" she says. ""I hate the idea that people think 'Oh, Baltimore is violent. Chicago is violent. Detroit is violent.' These places are a reflection of America."" Momentum built slowly, first on social media and word of mouth. The ceasefire has no single group or person as its leader. There is no celebrity headliner, no sponsorships or logos, save one: a stark black, white and red sign that reads ""Baltimore Ceasefire: Nobody Kill Anybody for 72 Hours"". The idea is to convince the residents of the city to take ownership. A large part of that involved canvassing the most violent parts of Baltimore, walking into the city's open-air drug markets and making a plea to people working the corners to commit to a weekend free of violence. Two brothers, same murder, but one goes free. Why? The view from Philando Castile's empty seat on the porch Chicago goes high-tech in search of answers to gun crime surge One of the first people Bridgeford called was PFK Boom, co-founder of 300 Gangstas, a group of former gang members and ex-offenders who came together after the death of Freddie Gray in 2015 to police and advocate for themselves. ""It was a no-brainer,"" Boom says of Bridgeford's request for help. ""I respect what she does. I seen her work, what she stands for, so that's why I will accept that call and put my men, my reputation, my brand and all that [behind it]."" Bridgeford and the other organisers forbade media from observing the canvassing effort, but she says the outreach was successful enough that people started calling her independently to pledge their commitment. ""There have been people who have called to say 'I am gang affiliated and I'm letting you know whoever I'm responsible for is chilling that weekend,'"" she says. ""If people get killed that weekend, even if we don't know who did it, we know who didn't do it."" Bridgeford is 5 ft 2. Her right arm ends just below the elbow due to a condition she developed while in the womb. Her small stature, glasses and bubbly personality may contribute to the reasons some people write her off as naive. It doesn't bother her. ""I grew up in West Baltimore. I've been raped twice. My brother got killed â¦ I've lost my stepson. I've lost cousins. Two weeks ago, I lost somebody. Some years I go to two funerals in one day,"" she says. ""It's not that I'm naÃ¯ve. It's just that my optimism is gangster."" When the people she talks to scoff at her idea of a violence-free weekend, she turns it around on them. ""Are you saying you can't keep your hood safe?"" she asks them. ""And the answer is always, 'Oh, don't worry about it, it's going to be safe around here.' â¦ I understand male ego."" After three months of canvassing, going on local radio shows weekly, meeting with organisations all over the city, plastering every telephone pole, every boarded-up door and window with Baltimore Ceasefire posters and stickers, the weekend has arrived. There are dozens of public and private events planned throughout the city - cookouts, block parties, peace walks, art shows, vigils. As one of the organisers flicks through her phone, she sees that dozens and dozens of her Facebook friends have changed their profile pictures to the Ceasefire logo. Organiser Ellen Gee's Facebook friends have all changed their profile pictures to the ceasefire logo And she's noticing other things, too, little symbols. Like, for the first time all summer, she's seeing dragonflies. As the afternoon turns into evening, people are getting off work, the bars are filling and the parties are starting - it's the real first test of the ceasefire. Bridgeford and her children head for a busy intersection in southwestern Baltimore where a group of people are waving ceasefire signs, and passing flyers out to motorists. A city bus driver throws open the doors, grabs a Baltimore Ceasefire poster from somebody, and sticks it prominently in the windshield. At some point a tall, thin man appears in their midst, dressed in papery green hospital scrubs - an ID bracelet on his tattooed wrist and EKG leads still stuck to his chest. He picks up a poster and holds it high in the air. ""I got shot last night,"" he says, pointing to a piece of gauze taped to his right cheek. ""I still got two bullets left in me."" His name is Devrone McKnight - the 23-year-old was driving himself home from the hospital when he saw the ceasefire volunteers by the side of the road. He says he's ashamed. He'd heard about the ceasefire effort but had made no plans to participate. ""Now I'm a victim,"" he says. ""From now on, I'm supporting this."" He charges recklessly into the street in his socks and sandals, passing fliers and posters to motorists stopped at the red light. He seems almost frantic. ""Take it,"" he pleads with drivers who won't roll down their windows. Some of the ceasefire events are more private, like on a quiet street called McCulloh across town. This video can not be played Markel Scott was about to graduate - then he became another Baltimore crime statistic Brittany Oliver gathers with her family in front of the stoop where her uncle David Lamont Hill was gunned down exactly one year ago after he stopped to visit friends after work. The family, dressed in matching T-shirts with Hill's picture, silently place tea lights near the spot in the street where he fell after being shot seven times. Despite a $5,000 reward for information, no one has been arrested in connection with his death. ""We haven't had a whole lot of information about who did it or what happened,"" says Oliver. In the last two years, not only have the number of homicides increased, but the number of cases closed by the Baltimore Police Department - either because they've been solved or the perpetrator is themselves killed or imprisoned on other charges - plummeted to one of the worst rates for large cities in the nation. Since a low point of about 33% in 2015 when 242 homicides went unsolved, the city says the closure rate has rebounded to a little less than half. But that still means that the city has a backlog of hundreds of open murder cases, as new ones continue relentlessly rolling in. When Oliver heard that the ceasefire weekend just happened to fall on the first anniversary of her uncle's death, she arranged a canvas of the streets all around McCulloh. Brittany Oliver stands near the spot where her uncle, David Lamont Hill, was shot to death a year ago ""I thought I was going to be crying a lot more today,"" she says. ""To be honest with you, that's the ceasefire. For a long time, I wasn't doing anything. This happened and I didn't know what to do. When the ceasefire came up, it gave me an opportunity to find my voice again."" Hours later, in a car park on the east side of Baltimore, the time is nearing midnight. Bridgeford, PFK Boom, and dozens of community members have gathered for an all-night barbecue. A team of lawyers is staying up all night to help anyone from the neighbourhood who stops by with criminal record expungements, child support issues, tenant and eviction situations - there's even therapists on hand. As the clock strikes midnight, a cheer rises up from the crowd. Rapper Kendrick Lamar's voice booms from the speakers, singing ""We gon' be alright"". ""We just had 24 hours of no murders in Baltimore, ladies and gentlemen,"" Bridgeford calls. ""Who said we couldn't do it? They said we couldn't do one day! C'mon y'all, we can do another 24!"" Baltimore police detectives on the scene of a homicide in the Pigtown neighbourhood on Saturday Forty-one hours into the Baltimore Ceasefire - after a day of peaceful marches, meat on the grill, basketball games - the spell is broken. It started with rumours, chatter over the police scanner about a possible shooting in a neighbourhood known as Pigtown. Then the rumours become fact - a 24-year-old man was shot and killed while walking down the street. His friends picked him up and rushed him to the hospital, but he died not long after. A woman with long dreads braided with purple cloth stands at her doorway just a few houses down from the crime scene, watching as the Baltimore police forensic team take pictures of the blood-stained sidewalk. She'd heard about the ceasefire, seen Bridgeford on television. She's dismayed that the weekend peace came to an end right at her front door. Neighbours say it's the third shooting on this block in the last year and a half. ""Seven of my girlfriends have lost seven sons [in the last two months],"" she says. ""Never seen it this bad, never."" ""Tell 'em to put a [recreation centre] here,"" calls a man in the street. ""Y'all saying, 'Ceasefire,' but how do you ceasefire? You take the kids out of the streets. The kids got something to do other than being in the streets."" A Baltimore firefighter washes blood off of the sidewalk Not long after the police remove the crime scene tape and begin opening the street back up, Erricka Bridgeford and her children arrive. She received the dreaded text message from her contact at the police department and rushed over, just as city firefighters are hosing the blood off the sidewalk. Staring at the place where the man fell, Bridgeford wears a shattered expression. A television reporter with a microphone asks her for comment, but Bridgeford recoils and refuses. ""This means a lot to her,"" her son Paul says quietly. ""This was very likely to happen. We were hoping for the best, but expecting the worst."" Slowly, more and more ceasefire participants begin arriving - a way to show the community support and to shake up the mundanity of these deaths. Bridgeford calls them over to join hands around the wet spot on the street. A few of the neighbours who'd already gone back to their normal Saturdays filter over, including the woman with the purple dreads. As an ice cream truck rolls slowly past playing a tinny, lachrymose version of Korobeiniki, Bridgeford makes a point to pray not only for the young man, but also for his killer. ""They were not born with a gun in their hand. Their mother didn't push them out saying, 'I can't wait 'til my baby grows up and shoots somebody on a ceasefire weekend,'"" she says. ""What has been done to us?"" she cries, her voice breaking. ""What has been done to us?"" Darkness settles on the city. At another cookout on the west side, lawyers again gather to help fill out expungement paperwork. Brittany Oliver and some friends burn sage. PFK Boom and bow-tied members of the Nation of Islam stand guard in stony silence. At 10pm, the police radios crackle to life again - there's been another homicide, a 37-year-old man found dead on an eerily quiet block of south Baltimore. In the car park, one of the ceasefire organisers who goes by Ogun ponders something a tough young man told him during their canvassing. Poster child of US drug wars to be freed Three days that shook America How Chicago violence feels like a war ""He said a lot of people have a beef with someone where there's no mediation. If they see this person somewhere, they're not going to think,"" he says. ""That's a problem that we can't fix."" There is no victory cry come midnight - the moment passes without comment. There are already articles posted online that the ceasefire has ""collapsed"" and Twitter trolls crow that the effort has failed. Around 1am, Bridgeford climbs into the backseat of her car and lets her kids drive her home. In the dark, she switches on Facebook Live. ""That first one - it just knocked the wind out of me. Like it was someone I grew up with got killed. I still don't know the people's names,"" she says. ""I am extremely blessed and extremely heartbroken."" One of the bullet holes from the attack on Devrone McKnight In 2001, a 27-year-old man named Antoin Lamont McKnight was shot to death on a desolate corner in the Sandtown neighbourhood of west Baltimore. He was transported to Maryland Shock Trauma Center, where he died of multiple gunshot wounds. His killer was never caught. Sixteen years later, Antoin McKnight's son Devrone was rushed to the same hospital with a gunshot wound to the face. Unlike his father, Devrone survived. On the final morning of the ceasefire weekend, he sits in his mother's living room, recalling the moment three days ago when a man charged him and his uncle as they sat on the porch. There's a picture of his father on a desk directly beneath a bullet hole punched through the wall from the attack. He was only seven years old when his father was murdered, but Devrone remembers carving pumpkins with him on Halloween, he remembers birthday parties. He doesn't know much about what his dad was involved in, but concedes that like many Baltimoreans, he may have been tangled up in some type of criminal activity. ""I didn't want to be like that so I did everything in my power to stay away from the street life,"" he says. Devrone McKnight stands on the porch where he was shot, the window behind him shattered by gunfire Devrone McKnight still has pieces of bullets embedded in his cheek and neck Devrone works at the same hospital where his father died and attends Morgan State University, studying construction management. Before this point, he'd figured if he just went to school, went to work, and minded his own business, he'd never end up like his father. But the bullet fragments embedded in his face and neck prove otherwise - the shock of that fact sent him running into the street on the first day of the ceasefire in his thin hospital garments, trying to convince strangers to care. In 2017, 404 people have been shot and survived according to figures from the Baltimore Police Department. McKnight feels extraordinarily lucky that, unlike the two men who died on Saturday, he has the opportunity to get involved. ""I just want to be the voice of the victims who can't talk right now. It's sad that two days into the ceasefire programme somebody else got killed,"" he says. ""I kinda feel sorry and bad because I didn't react sooner."" Devrone and his mother head for church, where he thanks God for sparing his life and prays for the hands of the surgeon who will eventually be tasked with removing the bullet still lodged in his neck, close to an artery. Then he heads to downtown Baltimore, where one of the final marches of the weekend is taking place. About 150 marchers gather at the foot of the 234-foot-tall Phoenix Shot Tower, a 19th-Century edifice where molten lead was dribbled from the top into a cold water bath at the bottom - an early technique for fashioning bullets. They march solemnly past Baltimore City Hall, and file into a television studio draped in black curtains where the organisers and marchers take turns reading the names of the more than 200 men and women who were murdered in 2017, beginning on the very first of the year. Sheamon Pearlie James Williams Davonte Jackson Jamal Washington Timothy Stephens Men with hand drums strike two beats after each name. Charles Frazier Tyrell Matthews Carlos Montgomery Channon Simpkins Tony Tingle Brittany Oliver burns sage as a symbol of healing As name after name after name is called in the stuffy room, people start to cry. There are sighs at the reading of ""unidentified man"". TimothyCampbell TyioneBrown Emmanuel Johnson Marco Stevenson Antonio Griffin Finally, Bridgeford leads the crowd in reading two final names, which are still only partially known, from Saturday: Trey Donte, also known as EA Kim Ford carries a picture of her son, Troy Biggus, who was murdered when he was 21 At midnight that evening, the official close of the ceasefire weekend, Bridgeford is home, exhausted, eating pizza. But she is back in high spirits. ""No murders happened in Sandtown. People who called and said my crew won't - their crew didn't,"" she says. ""What Baltimore was able to pull off was a 41-hour stretch of no murder, and then from 10 o'clock last night to 12 am now, that's another 26 hours with no murder. But that five hours in between is what I want you to remember."" The next day, a meeting called Baltimore Ceasefire 365 is planned. The organisers are adamant that their work does not end with the ceasefire - one of the first orders of business is to help pay for the burials of the two men who died. Although six people were shot over the course of the weekend, two fatally, Bridgeford still declares the ceasefire a success. For one single weekend, she says, some of the most beaten-down communities in Baltimore allowed themselves to hope. ""I was born with one hand â¦ I've had to experience what it's like to be Baltimore. To look broken and have to find wholeness,"" she says. ""Don't be numb ... We need to remember that feeling of how it was when we cared."" Early the next morning, the Baltimore Police Department finally releases the names of Saturday's victims: Lamontrey Tynes Donte Johnson They also report yet another murder, the city's 212th. .

"Would you trust her? TV viewers of new BBC drama Trust Me, in which a nurse fakes it as a doctor, have been left wondering whether it could happen in real life. If you didn't catch it, Cath Hardacre, played by Jodie Whittaker, is sacked as a nurse so steals her best friend's identity to become a senior doctor. The psychological thriller shows her attempt to fake it as an experienced emergency doctor, relying only on her nursing knowledge and medical textbooks. The show's writer Dan Sefton - a real-life A&E doctor - says it's not that hard to do if you have some qualifications. ""I think there are loads of people who aren't real doctors,""Sefton told the BBC. There was once a bogus doctor working at his own hospital, he said, who was ""actually pretty competent"". ""Often these doctors are very professional and get along very well with their colleagues. The only flaw is that they aren't real doctors,"" he added. Since 2006, 12 people have been charged under the Medical Act 1983 with pretending to be registered as a doctor, Crown Prosecution Service figures show. It's not known how many of them went on to be prosecuted. It is possible that other bogus doctors have been apprehended too, but were charged under the broader offence in the Fraud Act 2006 of impersonation and giving false or misleading information. This makes it harder to extract figures for doctors. Rachel Power, chief executive of the Patients Association, has some reassuring words for anxious TV viewers. ""It's incredibly rare for people to masquerade as doctors in the NHS. ""The numbers involved are negligible, so patients should not feel concerned that there's any substantial prospect of being seen by someone falsely claiming to be a doctor."" However, it has happened occasionally, as these examples show. Stethoscopes and scrubs Last year, mother-of-four Sarah Caine twice posed as a doctor and stole medical equipment from Lister Hospital in Stevenage, theTelegraph reported.,external She even posted photos on Facebook, one of herself dressed in surgical scrubs and another with a stethoscope draped around her neck. On Twitter in 2014, she pondered which direction her medical ambitions might take her. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

NHS staff caught her out the second time round, and the police were called. Magistrates banned her from every hospital in the UK - except in ""genuine medical emergencies"" - until sentencing. She was given a Â£440 fine after she admitted impersonating a doctor and stealing medical equipment. His CV was 'a work of fiction' Abdul Pirzada, an asylum seeker from Afghanistan, invented a glittering medical career history that allowed him to work as a practice nurse in Birmingham for seven years, as a locum GP and a physician's assistant. Within months of arriving in the UK in 2001, he joined the doctors' union BMA as a refugee member, claiming to be a qualified doctor. This meant he could access online courses, which gave him a superficial air of legitimacy, the CPS said. His CV, which prosecutors described as ""almost entirely a work of fiction"", claimed he had worked as a doctor in Bosnia and Glasgow, and was registered as a doctor in Pakistan. Pirzada gained work at three medical practices in Birmingham between 2004 and 2011, where he performed blood tests on patients and even prescribed medication. His deception came to light when a pharmacist spotted that his name on a prescription did not appear on the NHS-approved list, the CPS said. In 2012, he was jailed for 15 months after admitting two counts of fraud and one of obtaining a financial advantage by deception. Forged documents Two years ago Levon Mkhitarian pleaded guilty to fraud after impersonating a doctor. Mkhitarian, originally from Georgia, had failed to complete his medical training but continued to apply for doctors' jobs. In 2014, he was struck off the GMC register after being caught sending an email pretending to be the GMC. With no job to go to, Mkhitarian forged documents so he could apply for locum positions through agencies. He assumed the identity of another doctor, who was practising at the time, and made up a CV, bank statements, a medical degree and training certificates. Levon Mkhitarian came to the UK from Georgia to study medicine Under his false identity, Mkhitarian treated 3,000 patients on cancer, transplant, general surgery, cardiology and elderly wards, and was on call in A&E. That was until HR staff at the William Harvey Hospital, in Ashford, tried to create a personal smart card for him. A database showed one had already been issued in his assumed name, but with a different photograph. One investigating police officertold Canterbury Crown Courtthe risk of harm to patients was ""not high but nevertheless his actions were selfish and reckless"". Mkhitarian was jailed for six years. TheGeneral Medical Council says,externalthe onus is on employers to thoroughly check a doctor's identity and qualifications before recruiting them. There are currently 270,000 doctors named on itsUK medical register,external, which carries details of where the doctor studied, when they registered and whether they hold a licence. The GMC carries out its own checks before allowing a doctor to register, including on their identity and qualifications, as well as checks with the doctor's medical school and previous employers. Staff at the GMC also help employers by taking photos of doctors during a face-to-face identity check when they apply to register. These can then be sent on to hospitals to confirm the new recruit's identity. NHS Employers saysthere are six checks,externalwhich must be made before giving a doctor a job: Identity - using passport, driving licence and face-to-face checks Employment history and references - a minimum of three years of employment or training should be validated using references Work health assessments Professional registration and qualifications - check the doctor is registered with the GMC, check original qualification documents and contact the awarding body directly to confirm Right to work - the government listsacceptable documents,externalwhich must be checked in the presence of the job applicant and a record made of them all Criminal record - available through the Disclosure and Barring Service (England and Wales), Disclosure Scotland and Access NI Trust Meis available on BBC iPlayer and continues on BBC One on 15 August.

"The collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers saw workers take home their careers in boxes. Then there was the first run on a UK lender in 140 years, and the massive bailout of a British bank that had become the biggest in the world. It all started 10 years ago when a French bank admitted it didn't know what its investments in US property were worth - if anything. That BNP Paribas press release,externalbecame a panic that turned into paranoia as trust between financial institutions evaporated. On 9 August 2007 we felt the first tremor of a full-blown financial earthquake, whose aftershocks we are still dealing with today - nationally, locally and personally. The crisis ripped a huge hole in the nation's finances as a steep economic downturn caused a sharp fall in government tax receipts. By 2010, the government was having to borrow Â£1 in every Â£4 it spent. Although the amount the government is borrowing every year is now falling, the total debt pile is still rising and currently stands at a whopping Â£1.7 trillion. That's nearly 90% of the UK's total national income. The financial stress at a national level was soon felt at local level. As the government desperately tried to cut spending, local authorities saw their funding slashed with consequences for the services they provide. Childcare, social care, museums, roads, libraries and others felt the axe fall in the coalition government's controversial austerity drive. Local government spending has fallen 25% in real terms since the crisis. It's not just public services that felt the impact. Personal incomes have stagnated in the 10 years since the crisis. History tells us that real wages and living standards should rise. In fact, for every Â£100 taken home 10 years ago, workers are now taking home Â£97.80 after allowing for inflation. That reality had the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, reaching for the history books as he recently observed that the UK hasn't seen a period of such weak income growth since the 19th Century. Not all of the income squeeze can be blamed on the crisis. The changing shape of the UK economy - with more jobs created in lower-paying roles - has played its part, but the wages rot really set in after the crisis. The highest level of government debt since the war, swingeing cuts in public services and falling real incomes. The last ten years have been unique - and not in a good way.

"This video can not be played 'I chose surgery due to a lack of toilets' Paralympian Anne Wafula-Strike had to wet herself on a train journey, last year, because the disabled toilet was out of order. Now, she hears from others facing similar problems. Marni Smyth has spinal muscular atrophy, and has used a power chair since she was three. She needs a hoist to get on to a toilet, and says finding disabled loos that could accommodate her needs became a daily struggle. ""When I first went to university, I would avoid drinking as much as I could, because [otherwise] I needed to go home and leave a night out early,"" she tells Anne Wafula-Strike, in the Paralympian's report for the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""I'd need a hoist and plinth to get changed on, and they just weren't [available]."" Two years ago, she took the step of undergoing surgery for which she had no medical need. She had a suprapubic catheter fitted, so she does not have to get out of her chair to go to the toilet. She says she knows others who have also had the operation, and it has ""completely changed my life"". Paralympian Anne Wafula-Strike says having to wet herself on a train was a ""humiliating"" experience ""I'm so much healthier in general. I used to dehydrate myself. I wasn't drinking all day to avoid having to use the toilet,"" she says. The operation, however, can cause infections and complications. Marni says she ""wouldn't change [the catheter] for the world"", but still questions why it got to a stage at which she felt such an operation was necessary. ""I kind of wish I didn't have to have it in the first place, if the facilities were there,"" she says. A 2014 government auditsuggested as many as 40% of restaurantsand a third of department stores still did not have appropriate toilets for people with disabilities. This is despite businesses having a legal duty, under the Equalities Act, to make reasonable adjustments so their loos are accessible. Anne Wafula-Strike doesn't have to look far to find other athletes that have experienced issues over toilet accessibility. ""It happens day in, day out. What's even worse is that some disabled toilets aren't even maintained,"" Emma Alexander says. Gary Donald says he once went on a camping trip, only to discover the disabled toilet's ceiling had caved in. ""I just got off my chair, crawled along the floor and climbed up on to the able-bodied toilet. I'm often doing that,"" he says. Lorna Fillingham shows Anne a Changing Places toilet The lack of suitable facilities can also affect parents and carers, some of whom have had to change their loved ones on a toilet floor. Lorna Fillingham - whose seven-year-old daughter Emily-May has severe disabilities - says: ""There are people out there changing people on toilet floors all day, every day - in towns and cities across the UK. ""There are people with very low immunities at risk of catching infections on toilet floors. ""There are people with feeding tubes, tracheostomies, all sorts of things you do not want to get dirty, which could actually kill somebody if they got an infection into it."" Lorna believes the answer lies with Changing Places toilets, which are designed for people with severe disabilities. They are more spacious and contain specialist equipment, such as an adult changing bench and a hoist to help users out of their wheelchairs. Emily-May requires an adult changing facility An estimated quarter of a million people in the UK require such facilities, but there are currently only about a thousand in place for public use. A recent government committee recommended these toilets be made compulsory in large buildings that serve the public, but no legislation has been put in place to make that happen. A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said ""working with the disability sector, we're helping to make sure facilities improve for disabled people. ""This includes reviewing building regulations so new buildings are more accessible. We've also recently funded a website to help people find the nearest suitable changing facilities."" Anne Wafula-Strike describes the time she wet herself on a train as ""one of the most humiliating experiences of my life"". She had been on a three-hour CrossCountry service from Nuneaton to London Stansted in December 2016 when she discovered the disabled toilet was out of action, with no prior warning. The government's rail minister later assured her he was committed to ensuring no passenger went through the same ordeal. But it has happened since. Chris Stapleton was on a Virgin Trains journey from London to Birmingham when he had to wet himself, after he found the disabled toilet broken. He had booked his ticket six weeks in advance. ""I was angry with the train company's negligence, knowing that there was a wheelchair user needing that toilet potentially on that train,"" he says. ""There should have been a toilet ready and in working order."" Virgin Trains has since apologised to Chris, and says it has introduced measures to prevent such an incident happening again. CrossCountry has apologised to Anne. The Paralympian decided to return to the Rail Minister, Paul Maynard, to hear why Chris's experience had been allowed to happen. He said the government was working on an ""action plan"" to improve accessibility on transport, which contained ""a range of ideas that not just make sure that passengers get a better service on the day, but that we can work more tactically and more strategically to make sure more toilets are in service on trains in the first place"". ""There are strict legal rules in place as to what threshold of achievement train operating companies have to achieve,"" he said. ""The Office of Road and Rail enforces that, and I've made very clear to them I want them to take this very, very seriously indeed."" Anne describes this as a ""step in the right direction"", but is keen to hear more details. She says the issue is not simply about access to toilets, but about ""access to all areas of life"" - and ensuring people are not defined by their disabilities.

" The Premier League is 25 years old on 15 August 2017. To mark the anniversary, BBC Sport has produced five pieces, each covering a five-year period in the competition's history. This is the third piece, focusing on the span from 2002-03 to the end of the 2006-07 campaign. Scroll down for written insight, a visual timeline, Mark Lawrenson's team of the era, a tailored tactics board and tables, before testing yourself with our Merlin sticker quiz. Sometimes you can see the future coming. When Wayne Rooney scored his first league goal for Everton in October 2002, 16 years old and 30 yards out against England’s long-time goalkeeper, you didn’t need to be told to remember the name. Less than two years later, his country’s most exciting player at their most recent major championship disappointment, the teenager signed for the Premier League’s most successful club for a record-breaking transfer fee. What fewer envisaged was that it would be three more years until the combination yielded another title. After United won their eighth Premier League in 11 seasons in 2003, Alex Ferguson decided it was time for one of his periodic rebuilding-from-the-top summers. So it was that David Beckham got his Galactico move to Spain, World Cup winner Fabien Barthez would be lobbed no more and the criminally underwhelming Juan Sebastian Veron was palmed off on Chelsea. In their place came a series of flops – David Bellion for £2m, Eric Djemba-Djemba for £3.5m, Brazilian midfielder Kleberson for £6m – and one uncut diamond, the 18-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo. Cristiano Ronaldo (right) and Kleberson (left) - one would go on to become a Manchester United legend. The other would not His £12.24m price-tag, slightly less than Ferguson would shortly afterwards pay for Louis Saha, would prove arguably the greatest bargain in the league’s burgeoning history. That it was almost an afterthought at the time was because Veron was just a small part of the £110m that Chelsea would spend following their takeover from the brink of bankruptcy under Ken Bates by unknown Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich. What do you buy the shy billionaire who has everything? Glen Johnson at right-back and Scott Parker to sit on the bench, it would transpire. They also bought a striker in Adrian Mutu who would score four goals in his first three matches and end up, after a positive test for cocaine and a series of court cases, owing his new club £17m in damages. Hernan Crespo was another of those trophy buys to promise more than he would eventually deliver, his 12 goals in his first season dwindling into loans back to Italy and a second coming at Stamford Bridge that few noticed. In the background were those who would really bring back the silverware - Claude Makelele for £16m, Damien Duff for £17m, Joe Cole joining his old West Ham team-mate and friend Frank Lampard for £6.6m. It would take time and a new manager in place of Claudio Ranieri to make the blend work. Meanwhile at Arsenal, Arsene Wenger cooked up the Invincibles, the first team to win the top flight unbeaten since Preston 115 years before, led in stirring fashion by Thierry Henry, buttressed by the midfield assists and goals of Robert Pires and Freddie Ljungberg. Ljungberg dyed his hair Gunners red and displayed his abdominal muscles in a series of commercials for Calvin Klein, and complained later that the ads led to him being groped in nightclubs. Neither scenario would have troubled his predecessor on the Arsenal flanks, Paul Merson, but Wenger’s finest team wasn’t all beauty and no beast: Pascal Cygan played a key supporting role in a remorseless defence, while the first of the manager’s summer signings had been Philippe Senderos, and his second Jens Lehmann. Arsenal midfielder Freddie Ljungberg - full-time footballer, part-time model It was a short-lived dynasty. In June 2004 Abramovich made his most important transfer move of all, bringing Porto manager Jose Mourinho to the club. Coaching would turn the former interpreter’s hair from black to grey, but not before the silverware had piled up, and fast: a first league title for Chelsea in 50 years, achieved with a record points tally and the fewest goals conceded yet. Much of that first championship-winning team had been inherited – Lampard, Makelele, Duff, John Terry. The key additions under Mourinho came through the spine – Petr Cech, Ricardo Carvalho and the most important of all, Didier Drogba, who just a season before had been playing for a town of 7,000 people in the middle of the Brittany boondocks. Supporters of rivals welcomed their own overseas investors with expectant arms, only to discover that a foreign passport and a heap of cash were no guarantee of success. Randy Lerner at Aston Villa, Tom Hicks and George Gillett at Liverpool and Eggert Magnusson at West Ham all promised much and delivered less. Malcolm Glazer seldom spoke at all as he took over Manchester United, but the debt he brought with him would make the pips squeak. Mourinho and Chelsea would repeat themselves in 2005-06 so everyone understood just how special they were. Less-heralded clubs enjoyed their own relative surges – Bolton to sixth, Wigan to 10th, Reading to eighth – while others dawdled in their wake, Manchester City finishing 14th, 15th and 16th in the slump before their own storm. The Premier League kept changing, even as its 15,000th goal was scored, even as no-one predicted it would be scored by Fulham defender Moritz Volz. By 2006 three of its clubs had shirts sponsored by internet betting companies, something which no-one would have put money on at its birth, the global reach of the competition illustrated by Everton advertising a beer from Thailand under its own Latin crest. Ferguson, never likely to stand still and watch as Mourinho moved in, made the critical move in his team’s comeback by signing Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra within days of each other in January 2006. Michael Carrick joined that summer, and with the kids Ronaldo and Rooney grown to men and producing 50 goals between them the following season, the title was once again back at Old Trafford. 19 October 2002:I think this kid’s got something! Everton striker Wayne Rooney becomes the youngest goalscorer in Premier League history with a last-minute winner against Arsenal, five days before his 17th birthday. Everton’s win ends the Gunners' 30-match unbeaten Premiership run. 2 July 2003:Chelsea are bought by billionaire Roman Abramovich in a deal worth £140m. The surprise takeover - the biggest in British football history - is finalised after talks with long-time Blues chairman Ken Bates. The club go on to spend £110m on 11 players by the end of the summer. 19 December 2003:Manchester United and England centre-back Rio Ferdinand receives an eight-month ban from football and a £50,000 fine for missing a drugs test on 22 September. He misses the rest of the season and Euro 2004. England players came close to striking for the crucial qualifier in Turkey in October after the Football Association left Ferdinand out of the squad. 15 May 2004:Arsenal, who had relinquished the title to Manchester United the previous season, complete the Premier League campaign unbeaten with a 2-1 win over Leicester as they reclaim the title. They are the first team to avoid losing a game in a league season since Preston in 1889. 2 June 2004:Jose Mourinho takes over as manager of Chelsea, replacing the sacked Claudio Ranieri. His news conference is legendary, during which he says: “Please don't call me arrogant because what I am saying is true. I am European champion. I think I am the special one.” 31 August 2004:After starring in England's run to the quarter-finals of Euro 2004, 18-year-old Wayne Rooney leaves Everton for Manchester United in a £27m deal - a world record for a teenager. He scores a hat-trick on his debut, in the Champions League. 24 October 2004:Arsenal's record streak of unbeaten top-flight league matches ends at 49 with a 2-0 away loss to Manchester United. The game is overshadowed by a post-match altercation which sees Sir Alex Ferguson hit by a slice of pizza. 28 February 2005:Norwich director and celebrity chef Delia Smith takes to the Carrow Road pitch at half-time during the game with Manchester City to rally the fans, telling them: ""A message for the best football supporters in the world: we need a 12th man here. Where are you? Where are you? Let's be 'avin' you! Come on!"" Norwich lose 3-2. 2 April 2005:In a Premier League match between Newcastle United and Aston Villa at St James' Park, Newcastle team-mates Lee Bowyer and Kieron Dyer are sent off for fighting each other. Bowyer is fined £200,000 by the club with captain Alan Shearer calling the incident “a disgrace”. 30 April 2005:Chelsea win their first top-flight title in 50 years, with a 2-0 victory over Bolton at the Reebok Stadium that gives them a still record points tally of 95. Frank Lampard, who would go on to score a record 211 goals for the club, gets both goals. Chelsea will claim the title again the following year. 12 May 2005:US sports tycoon Malcolm Glazer and his family win control of Manchester United in a £790m takeover. It is a move that splits opinion among fans, with many unhappy at the debt the new owners build up at the club. In the Glazers’ second full season in control, United reclaim the title from Chelsea. 22 October 2005:Arsenal pair Thierry Henry and Robert Pires make a mess of a penalty routine against Manchester City when the latter attempts to set up the former by tapping the ball to him from the spot. However, he scuffs his touch and instead concedes a free-kick. Fortunately for the French duo, the Gunners beat City 1-0. 4 February 2006:Alan Shearer becomes Newcastle United's top scorer of all time, netting his 201st goal for the club, against Portsmouth at St James' Park, beating Jackie Milburn's 200-goal tally which had stood for 49 years. He retires in April 2006 after scoring 206 times for the Magpies and 260 Premier League goals in total. Built with Shorthand",Negative,5.2333693e-09
"The crisis surrounding North Korea's nuclear weapons and missile programmes has reached a new and more dangerous phase. For decades efforts have continued to try to persuade or pressure Pyongyang to give up its weapons programme. A fully-fledged nuclear capability - warheads that could actually be delivered to a distant target at the tip of a long-range missile - seemed years away. But no longer. It is impossible to assess the exact capability that North Korea now has. It claims to have missiles that can reach the continental United States - and two recent tests convince Western experts that this may well be a possibility. The Japanese government, in its latest defence white paper, suggests that Pyongyang may already have the capacity to miniaturise a nuclear warhead to be placed on such a long-range missile. US officials, too, believe  that North Korea has manufactured small nuclear warheads suitable for a long range missile, but it is not clear - despite claims from Pyongyang - that these have been tested. A working long-range nuclear capability for North Korea is not now a question of ""if"", but ""when"". And that ""when"" could be within the next few years. That this time-scale coincides with President Donald Trump's tenure in the White House is an accident of history. But while it gives the North Korean nuclear crisis an added danger, it also, perversely may offer a glimmer of a chance for progress. The cacophony of foreign policy bluster, bravado and inexperience that makes up the US president's Twitter feed gives many cause for concern. The North Korean leader is seen in the West as unpredictable and very much a loose cannon. Well now, up to a point, the US has a loose cannon of its own. North Korea's foreign minister (C) has been engaging with other countries in Manila Mr Trump, to paraphrase a former US defence secretary is a ""known unknown"". Nobody knows how he might react. And that makes things more dangerous but it also seems to be concentrating minds, not least in Beijing. Of course, as in so many areas, we don't really know what US policy actually is. In complex diplomacy the clarity of messaging is important. So who actually represents US foreign policy? Is it Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who under the right circumstances seems to be holding out the possibility of talks with Pyongyang? (Even Mr Trump himself has envisioned such a possibility). Or is it the Oval Office's tweet-meister, who seems to be ramping up the pressure on Pyongyang? There is no doubt that a fork in the road has been reached. North Korea's progress means that it will soon be able to threaten the US with a nuclear strike. North Korea has been celebrating its missile tests by issuing stamps This is a game-changer and the policy options facing the Trump administration, the Chinese, the South Koreans and Japan are all difficult and unpalatable to varying degrees. One option would be to confront the North Korean regime by every means possible. So stepped-up sanctions; a regional military build-up; and a willingness to go to war if necessary - ultimately, in other words, to seek a change of regime in Pyongyang. That promises Armageddon on the Korean Peninsula and is not going to appeal to China, the pivotal diplomatic player in this drama. This video can not be played Why does North Korea want nukes? Another option is containment. It is kind of where we are heading right now. Stronger international sanctions - last weekend's UN Security Council decision represents almost a trade embargo against North Korea in a small number of sectors crucial to its foreign revenue earnings; the provision of defensive weapons - like the Thaad anti-missile system deployed in South Korea - to America's allies. But containment is no solution in itself and it risks changing into confrontation as each new crisis develops. Then of course there is diplomacy. This remains, for now,  a tall order. But a combination of factors - North Korea's technical progress, the uncertainties prompted by the Trump administration's arrival in office and the fact that the world does now stand at crossroads on North Korea suggests that a diplomatic moment may just be possible. Importing coal, seafood, iron and iron ore, lead and lead ore from North Korea is banned Countries cannot receive new North Korean workers No new joint ventures with North Korean entities or individuals No new investment in existing joint ventures More individuals targeted with travel bans and assets freezes Member states to report to the UN Security Council within 90 days on how they have implemented resolution An essential precursor was the tougher sanctions regime, passed by the Security Council, endorsed by both China and Russia together with the explicit calls from Beijing for Pyongyang to halt nuclear and missile tests. North Korea's foreign minister was engaging with other countries at the recent Manila meetings even though his message was as hard-line as ever. Now - despite the rising rhetoric - there needs to be a stock-taking. Where will this crisis go? Can a space be created for some kind of diplomatic opening? Diplomacy may not have worked in the past but it has certainly been tried. Remember the Kedo experiment back in the 1990s? This was the so-called Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization which was established after an agreement in 1994. It was intended to provide two nuclear reactors to North Korea of a type less amenable to the diversion of nuclear materials for bomb-making. In return North Korea was to close down much of its existing nuclear industry. There was a plan for improved relations between Washington and Pyongyang and so on. Key North Korean facilities were opened up to IAEA inspection. But Kedo collapsed in 2002 amidst US fears that Pyongyang had a clandestine uranium enrichment programme and the international inspectors were expelled. Kedo, though, had a clear purpose - to roll back and shutter those North Korean nuclear facilities implicated in its military programme. But that was more than 20 years ago. Rolling back North Korea's nuclear weapons and missile programme is no longer a realistic option. What would the goals of a new diplomatic deal be? Is Trump's America willing to live in the shadow of a North Korean nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missile? And would Kim's North Korea really want to open up or liberalise in any way that might call into question the future of the regime? We now wait for a signal from Pyongyang. A temporary halt to testing could mean something of a pause for thought. But if missile testing is renewed then we will be on the launch-pad to a whole new phase in this potentially catastrophic drama. Stop missile tests, China tells North Korea What can the outside world do about N Korea? Can the US defend itself against North Korea?

"A person has been murdered in Baltimorealmostevery day this year, on average - more killings per capita than Chicago. Then a grassroots campaign made an audacious pledge - to orchestrate a 72-hour ceasefire. Did it work? Erricka Bridgeford stands in the second-storey window of the now-abandoned townhouse where she grew up and looks down on the street below, to the spot where Mike, a neighbourhood kid, fell over 30 years ago. That was the first time she'd ever seen someone shot. ""I actually heard him die, begging God he wouldn't die,"" she says. ""I was 12."" Since media outlets from across the country and globe started requesting interviews with her, asking her to explain her bold attempt to halt homicides for three days in a city where someone is murdered almost every day, Bridgeford started bringing them to her childhood neighbourhood in West Baltimore. After a local television crew packed up and left, the 44-year-old mediation trainer decided to push through the unlocked door of the townhouse and show her three children - aged 17 to 21 - around for the first time. Erricka Bridgeford, right centre, sits with her friend Ellen Gee, right, and her children outside of an abandoned rowhouse The family wanders the empty rooms in matching orange #BaltimoreCeasefire T-shirts. The air smells of urine, the walls are pocked with holes and smudged with the dirty outline of missing appliances. Upstairs, a used condom lies on the floor of what was once Bridgeford's parents' room. ""This is the house that made me,"" she tells her children. ""I feel sad that it looks like this. This looks like a light left out."" The empty townhouse is a reflection of some of the underlying causes of the violence in Baltimore. From that second-storey window, Bridgeford watched as drugs moved into her neighbourhood in the 1980s, and the families moved out. Her friends started dropping out of school and selling dope. The grass turned to dirt. Along with the poverty and drugs came the guns - Mike was the first of nearly 20 people Bridgeford knew who've died from violence. But on this particular morning, Bridgeford is in high spirits - it's Friday, 4 August, day one of the ""Baltimore Ceasefire"". Although the campaign is not affiliated with the Baltimore Police Department or any other arm of the city government, a trusted police contact has promised to text her if anyone is killed over the three days. Eleven hours in, the peace is holding. ""The air feels different,"" says Bridgeford. ""Even the sceptics are saying, 'I hope it works.'"" Erricka Bridgeford stands at the window of her childhood bedroom The naysayers have some reason to feel that way. The idea for the weekend was set in motion after Bridgeford had a conversation with her 19-year-old son about the city murder rate, which is on track to be the worst in its recorded history and could rise to the highest in the country. Per capita, it's already surpassed Chicago, Detroit and New Orleans. Bridgeford bristles at some of the comments that have been made online, mocking her and the city for even needing such an effort. ""We want to purposefully have a pause and a sacred space where everybody's intention is 'nobody gets killed'. A cultural shift, so that it dawns on people that they can make this choice,"" she says. ""I hate the idea that people think 'Oh, Baltimore is violent. Chicago is violent. Detroit is violent.' These places are a reflection of America."" Momentum built slowly, first on social media and word of mouth. The ceasefire has no single group or person as its leader. There is no celebrity headliner, no sponsorships or logos, save one: a stark black, white and red sign that reads ""Baltimore Ceasefire: Nobody Kill Anybody for 72 Hours"". The idea is to convince the residents of the city to take ownership. A large part of that involved canvassing the most violent parts of Baltimore, walking into the city's open-air drug markets and making a plea to people working the corners to commit to a weekend free of violence. Two brothers, same murder, but one goes free. Why? The view from Philando Castile's empty seat on the porch Chicago goes high-tech in search of answers to gun crime surge One of the first people Bridgeford called was PFK Boom, co-founder of 300 Gangstas, a group of former gang members and ex-offenders who came together after the death of Freddie Gray in 2015 to police and advocate for themselves. ""It was a no-brainer,"" Boom says of Bridgeford's request for help. ""I respect what she does. I seen her work, what she stands for, so that's why I will accept that call and put my men, my reputation, my brand and all that [behind it]."" Bridgeford and the other organisers forbade media from observing the canvassing effort, but she says the outreach was successful enough that people started calling her independently to pledge their commitment. ""There have been people who have called to say 'I am gang affiliated and I'm letting you know whoever I'm responsible for is chilling that weekend,'"" she says. ""If people get killed that weekend, even if we don't know who did it, we know who didn't do it."" Bridgeford is 5 ft 2. Her right arm ends just below the elbow due to a condition she developed while in the womb. Her small stature, glasses and bubbly personality may contribute to the reasons some people write her off as naive. It doesn't bother her. ""I grew up in West Baltimore. I've been raped twice. My brother got killed â¦ I've lost my stepson. I've lost cousins. Two weeks ago, I lost somebody. Some years I go to two funerals in one day,"" she says. ""It's not that I'm naÃ¯ve. It's just that my optimism is gangster."" When the people she talks to scoff at her idea of a violence-free weekend, she turns it around on them. ""Are you saying you can't keep your hood safe?"" she asks them. ""And the answer is always, 'Oh, don't worry about it, it's going to be safe around here.' â¦ I understand male ego."" After three months of canvassing, going on local radio shows weekly, meeting with organisations all over the city, plastering every telephone pole, every boarded-up door and window with Baltimore Ceasefire posters and stickers, the weekend has arrived. There are dozens of public and private events planned throughout the city - cookouts, block parties, peace walks, art shows, vigils. As one of the organisers flicks through her phone, she sees that dozens and dozens of her Facebook friends have changed their profile pictures to the Ceasefire logo. Organiser Ellen Gee's Facebook friends have all changed their profile pictures to the ceasefire logo And she's noticing other things, too, little symbols. Like, for the first time all summer, she's seeing dragonflies. As the afternoon turns into evening, people are getting off work, the bars are filling and the parties are starting - it's the real first test of the ceasefire. Bridgeford and her children head for a busy intersection in southwestern Baltimore where a group of people are waving ceasefire signs, and passing flyers out to motorists. A city bus driver throws open the doors, grabs a Baltimore Ceasefire poster from somebody, and sticks it prominently in the windshield. At some point a tall, thin man appears in their midst, dressed in papery green hospital scrubs - an ID bracelet on his tattooed wrist and EKG leads still stuck to his chest. He picks up a poster and holds it high in the air. ""I got shot last night,"" he says, pointing to a piece of gauze taped to his right cheek. ""I still got two bullets left in me."" His name is Devrone McKnight - the 23-year-old was driving himself home from the hospital when he saw the ceasefire volunteers by the side of the road. He says he's ashamed. He'd heard about the ceasefire effort but had made no plans to participate. ""Now I'm a victim,"" he says. ""From now on, I'm supporting this."" He charges recklessly into the street in his socks and sandals, passing fliers and posters to motorists stopped at the red light. He seems almost frantic. ""Take it,"" he pleads with drivers who won't roll down their windows. Some of the ceasefire events are more private, like on a quiet street called McCulloh across town. This video can not be played Markel Scott was about to graduate - then he became another Baltimore crime statistic Brittany Oliver gathers with her family in front of the stoop where her uncle David Lamont Hill was gunned down exactly one year ago after he stopped to visit friends after work. The family, dressed in matching T-shirts with Hill's picture, silently place tea lights near the spot in the street where he fell after being shot seven times. Despite a $5,000 reward for information, no one has been arrested in connection with his death. ""We haven't had a whole lot of information about who did it or what happened,"" says Oliver. In the last two years, not only have the number of homicides increased, but the number of cases closed by the Baltimore Police Department - either because they've been solved or the perpetrator is themselves killed or imprisoned on other charges - plummeted to one of the worst rates for large cities in the nation. Since a low point of about 33% in 2015 when 242 homicides went unsolved, the city says the closure rate has rebounded to a little less than half. But that still means that the city has a backlog of hundreds of open murder cases, as new ones continue relentlessly rolling in. When Oliver heard that the ceasefire weekend just happened to fall on the first anniversary of her uncle's death, she arranged a canvas of the streets all around McCulloh. Brittany Oliver stands near the spot where her uncle, David Lamont Hill, was shot to death a year ago ""I thought I was going to be crying a lot more today,"" she says. ""To be honest with you, that's the ceasefire. For a long time, I wasn't doing anything. This happened and I didn't know what to do. When the ceasefire came up, it gave me an opportunity to find my voice again."" Hours later, in a car park on the east side of Baltimore, the time is nearing midnight. Bridgeford, PFK Boom, and dozens of community members have gathered for an all-night barbecue. A team of lawyers is staying up all night to help anyone from the neighbourhood who stops by with criminal record expungements, child support issues, tenant and eviction situations - there's even therapists on hand. As the clock strikes midnight, a cheer rises up from the crowd. Rapper Kendrick Lamar's voice booms from the speakers, singing ""We gon' be alright"". ""We just had 24 hours of no murders in Baltimore, ladies and gentlemen,"" Bridgeford calls. ""Who said we couldn't do it? They said we couldn't do one day! C'mon y'all, we can do another 24!"" Baltimore police detectives on the scene of a homicide in the Pigtown neighbourhood on Saturday Forty-one hours into the Baltimore Ceasefire - after a day of peaceful marches, meat on the grill, basketball games - the spell is broken. It started with rumours, chatter over the police scanner about a possible shooting in a neighbourhood known as Pigtown. Then the rumours become fact - a 24-year-old man was shot and killed while walking down the street. His friends picked him up and rushed him to the hospital, but he died not long after. A woman with long dreads braided with purple cloth stands at her doorway just a few houses down from the crime scene, watching as the Baltimore police forensic team take pictures of the blood-stained sidewalk. She'd heard about the ceasefire, seen Bridgeford on television. She's dismayed that the weekend peace came to an end right at her front door. Neighbours say it's the third shooting on this block in the last year and a half. ""Seven of my girlfriends have lost seven sons [in the last two months],"" she says. ""Never seen it this bad, never."" ""Tell 'em to put a [recreation centre] here,"" calls a man in the street. ""Y'all saying, 'Ceasefire,' but how do you ceasefire? You take the kids out of the streets. The kids got something to do other than being in the streets."" A Baltimore firefighter washes blood off of the sidewalk Not long after the police remove the crime scene tape and begin opening the street back up, Erricka Bridgeford and her children arrive. She received the dreaded text message from her contact at the police department and rushed over, just as city firefighters are hosing the blood off the sidewalk. Staring at the place where the man fell, Bridgeford wears a shattered expression. A television reporter with a microphone asks her for comment, but Bridgeford recoils and refuses. ""This means a lot to her,"" her son Paul says quietly. ""This was very likely to happen. We were hoping for the best, but expecting the worst."" Slowly, more and more ceasefire participants begin arriving - a way to show the community support and to shake up the mundanity of these deaths. Bridgeford calls them over to join hands around the wet spot on the street. A few of the neighbours who'd already gone back to their normal Saturdays filter over, including the woman with the purple dreads. As an ice cream truck rolls slowly past playing a tinny, lachrymose version of Korobeiniki, Bridgeford makes a point to pray not only for the young man, but also for his killer. ""They were not born with a gun in their hand. Their mother didn't push them out saying, 'I can't wait 'til my baby grows up and shoots somebody on a ceasefire weekend,'"" she says. ""What has been done to us?"" she cries, her voice breaking. ""What has been done to us?"" Darkness settles on the city. At another cookout on the west side, lawyers again gather to help fill out expungement paperwork. Brittany Oliver and some friends burn sage. PFK Boom and bow-tied members of the Nation of Islam stand guard in stony silence. At 10pm, the police radios crackle to life again - there's been another homicide, a 37-year-old man found dead on an eerily quiet block of south Baltimore. In the car park, one of the ceasefire organisers who goes by Ogun ponders something a tough young man told him during their canvassing. Poster child of US drug wars to be freed Three days that shook America How Chicago violence feels like a war ""He said a lot of people have a beef with someone where there's no mediation. If they see this person somewhere, they're not going to think,"" he says. ""That's a problem that we can't fix."" There is no victory cry come midnight - the moment passes without comment. There are already articles posted online that the ceasefire has ""collapsed"" and Twitter trolls crow that the effort has failed. Around 1am, Bridgeford climbs into the backseat of her car and lets her kids drive her home. In the dark, she switches on Facebook Live. ""That first one - it just knocked the wind out of me. Like it was someone I grew up with got killed. I still don't know the people's names,"" she says. ""I am extremely blessed and extremely heartbroken."" One of the bullet holes from the attack on Devrone McKnight In 2001, a 27-year-old man named Antoin Lamont McKnight was shot to death on a desolate corner in the Sandtown neighbourhood of west Baltimore. He was transported to Maryland Shock Trauma Center, where he died of multiple gunshot wounds. His killer was never caught. Sixteen years later, Antoin McKnight's son Devrone was rushed to the same hospital with a gunshot wound to the face. Unlike his father, Devrone survived. On the final morning of the ceasefire weekend, he sits in his mother's living room, recalling the moment three days ago when a man charged him and his uncle as they sat on the porch. There's a picture of his father on a desk directly beneath a bullet hole punched through the wall from the attack. He was only seven years old when his father was murdered, but Devrone remembers carving pumpkins with him on Halloween, he remembers birthday parties. He doesn't know much about what his dad was involved in, but concedes that like many Baltimoreans, he may have been tangled up in some type of criminal activity. ""I didn't want to be like that so I did everything in my power to stay away from the street life,"" he says. Devrone McKnight stands on the porch where he was shot, the window behind him shattered by gunfire Devrone McKnight still has pieces of bullets embedded in his cheek and neck Devrone works at the same hospital where his father died and attends Morgan State University, studying construction management. Before this point, he'd figured if he just went to school, went to work, and minded his own business, he'd never end up like his father. But the bullet fragments embedded in his face and neck prove otherwise - the shock of that fact sent him running into the street on the first day of the ceasefire in his thin hospital garments, trying to convince strangers to care. In 2017, 404 people have been shot and survived according to figures from the Baltimore Police Department. McKnight feels extraordinarily lucky that, unlike the two men who died on Saturday, he has the opportunity to get involved. ""I just want to be the voice of the victims who can't talk right now. It's sad that two days into the ceasefire programme somebody else got killed,"" he says. ""I kinda feel sorry and bad because I didn't react sooner."" Devrone and his mother head for church, where he thanks God for sparing his life and prays for the hands of the surgeon who will eventually be tasked with removing the bullet still lodged in his neck, close to an artery. Then he heads to downtown Baltimore, where one of the final marches of the weekend is taking place. About 150 marchers gather at the foot of the 234-foot-tall Phoenix Shot Tower, a 19th-Century edifice where molten lead was dribbled from the top into a cold water bath at the bottom - an early technique for fashioning bullets. They march solemnly past Baltimore City Hall, and file into a television studio draped in black curtains where the organisers and marchers take turns reading the names of the more than 200 men and women who were murdered in 2017, beginning on the very first of the year. Sheamon Pearlie James Williams Davonte Jackson Jamal Washington Timothy Stephens Men with hand drums strike two beats after each name. Charles Frazier Tyrell Matthews Carlos Montgomery Channon Simpkins Tony Tingle Brittany Oliver burns sage as a symbol of healing As name after name after name is called in the stuffy room, people start to cry. There are sighs at the reading of ""unidentified man"". TimothyCampbell TyioneBrown Emmanuel Johnson Marco Stevenson Antonio Griffin Finally, Bridgeford leads the crowd in reading two final names, which are still only partially known, from Saturday: Trey Donte, also known as EA Kim Ford carries a picture of her son, Troy Biggus, who was murdered when he was 21 At midnight that evening, the official close of the ceasefire weekend, Bridgeford is home, exhausted, eating pizza. But she is back in high spirits. ""No murders happened in Sandtown. People who called and said my crew won't - their crew didn't,"" she says. ""What Baltimore was able to pull off was a 41-hour stretch of no murder, and then from 10 o'clock last night to 12 am now, that's another 26 hours with no murder. But that five hours in between is what I want you to remember."" The next day, a meeting called Baltimore Ceasefire 365 is planned. The organisers are adamant that their work does not end with the ceasefire - one of the first orders of business is to help pay for the burials of the two men who died. Although six people were shot over the course of the weekend, two fatally, Bridgeford still declares the ceasefire a success. For one single weekend, she says, some of the most beaten-down communities in Baltimore allowed themselves to hope. ""I was born with one hand â¦ I've had to experience what it's like to be Baltimore. To look broken and have to find wholeness,"" she says. ""Don't be numb ... We need to remember that feeling of how it was when we cared."" Early the next morning, the Baltimore Police Department finally releases the names of Saturday's victims: Lamontrey Tynes Donte Johnson They also report yet another murder, the city's 212th. .

"Much of the advice given 16 years ago has proven to be problematic The author of an influential guide to computer passwords says he now regrets several of the tips he gave. Bill Burr had advised users to change their password every 90 days and to muddle up words by adding capital letters, numbers and symbols - so, for example, ""protected"" might become ""pr0t3cT3d4!"". The problem, he believes, is that the theory came unstuck in practice. Mr Burr now acknowledges that his 2003 manual was ""barking up the wrong tree"". He disclosed his views in aninterview with the Wall Street Journal,external. Current guidelines no longer suggest passwords should be frequently changed, because people tend to respond by making only small alterations to their existing passwords - for example, changing ""monkey1"" into ""monkey2""- which are relatively easy to deduce. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that it takes longer for computers to crack a random mix of words - such as ""pig coffee wandered black"" - than it does for them to guess a word with easy-to-remember substitutions - such as ""br0k3n!"". Mr Burr's original advice was distributed by the US government's National Institute of Standards and Technology. It has since been amended several times, with the most recent editionbeing released in June,external. ""Anything published under the Nist banner tends to be influential, so these guidelines have had a long lasting impact,"" said Prof Alan Woodward, from the University of Surrey. ""But we've known for some considerable time that these guidelines actually had a rather unfortunate effect. ""For example, the more often you ask someone to change their password, the weaker the passwords they typically choose. ""And, as we have all now so many online accounts, the situation is compounded so it encourages behaviours such as password reuse across systems."" Britain's National Cyber Security Centre issued its own guidanceon the matter in 2015,external. It recommended that organisations abandoned a policy of pushing their users into regular password resets, and that they should support the use of password managers - programs that securely store hundreds of different logins, avoiding the need to memorise each one. ""It's good that password advice is now being updated to be based on evidence,"" said Dr Steven Murdoch, from University College London. ""But there is still traditional advice in other areas of computer security being perpetuated despite us knowing it won't work. ""We need research to tell us what security advice will actually improve the situation, and for the government and companies to pay attention to results.""

"Despite reported threat to Guam, Americans can ""sleep soundly"", says Rex Tillerson US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis has told North Korea to avoid actions that could usher in the ""end of its regime and the destruction of its people"". The Pentagon chief also said Pyongyang would be ""grossly overmatched"" in a war against the US and its allies. His stark warning comes a day after President Donald Trump threatened North Korea with ""fire and fury"". US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson sought to assure Americans there was no imminent threat. In Wednesday's strongly worded statement, Mr Mattis called on Pyongyang to halt its arms programme. Should you worry about war? The North Korea crisis in 300 words Analysis: Where do we go after 'fire and fury'? ""The DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) must choose to stop isolating itself and stand down its pursuit of nuclear weapons,"" the US Marine Corps general said.

Mr Trump - who has said he will not allow Pyongyang to develop a nuclear weapon capable of hitting the US - boasted earlier on Wednesday of America's atomic arsenal. In early morning tweets from New Jersey where he is on holiday, the president said the US nuclear stockpile was ""more powerful than ever before"".

The tweets come amid escalating rhetoric between the two sides. North Korea's state-run KCNA news agency said on Wednesday that Pyongyang was ""carefully examining"" a plan to strike the US territory of Guam. The Pacific island is home to US military bases, strategic bombers and about 163,000 people. Stopping in Guam to refuel after a trip to South East Asia, Mr Tillerson said he was hopeful a global ""pressure campaign"" involving Russia and China could lead to new dialogue with Pyongyang ""about a different future"". This video can not be played President Trump threatened a response 'like the world has never seen' America's top diplomat also defended President Trump's language. He said North Korean leader Kim Jong-un did not understand diplomatic language, and a strong message was needed that he could understand. Mr Tillerson added the situation had not dramatically changed over the last few days, and that Americans ""should sleep well at night"". China has urged calm, describing the situation as ""complex and sensitive"". Anthony Zurcher, BBC senior North America reporter As Donald Trump made his ""fire and fury"" threat against North Korea, the lone camera in the room zoomed in for a tight shot. It would have been telling to see the effect those words had on his advisers. Did they nod knowingly or look surprised? Was this part of the plan or an off-the-cuff presidential remark they'd have to clean up? A day later and thousands of miles away, Rex Tillerson had out his mop and broom. The secretary of state said Mr Trump was merely reasserting that the US would defend itself if attacked, using language North Korea would understand. That's not exactly what the president said, however. He warned of retribution if Kim Jong-un continued to make threats - punishing words with action. It could simply be unfortunate phrasing from a man who is sometimes loose with words. Mr Tillerson would not be the first presidential aide intent on framing Mr Trump's blunt statements in a softer light. With the president touting US nuclear might and test-firing an ICBM, however, the secretary of state - already considered to have little sway in this administration - may find his efforts at clarification buried in a torrent of bluster. The White House on Wednesday denied reports that Mr Trump's ""fire and fury"" statement a day earlier, unusually provocative for a US president, was an off-the-cuff remark that had caught his inner circle unawares. Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters: ""The tone and strength of the message were discussed beforehand."" What damage could N Korea do without nuclear weapons? Pyongyang releases Canadian pastor N Korea hides anti-US message in cartoon Despite rounds of UN sanctions, Pyongyang carried out two nuclear bomb tests last year and two intercontinental ballistic missile tests in July. On Tuesday,media reports in the US,externalclaimed the North had achieved its goal of making a nuclear warhead small enough to fit inside its missiles.

"This video can not be played Webcam footage captures killer Jason Marshall with his victim A ""fantasist"" posing as a police officer who killed a man he met on a gay dating website has been found guilty of murder and arson. Peter Fasoli, 58, wasterrorised and killedin his London home by Jason Marshall in January 2013. Marshall, 28, later set fire to the bungalow in Northolt to cover up the murder. Mr Fasoli's death was thought to be an accident until his nephew found CCTV of the murder stored on his hard drive. Peter Fasoli's death was filmed on a computer in his north London bungalow The harrowing footage found by Christopher Murgatroyd showed the victim bound and naked on his bed, begging for his life and complaining he could not breathe before Marshall wound cling film around his head. The trial had heard how former male escort Marshall stalked victims on gay dating website Badoo. He went to Mr Fasoli's flat in Northolt, west London, on the evening of 6 January 2013 on the pretext of bondage sex, dressed as a law enforcement agent complete with handcuffs, police utility belt, holster and latex gloves. He ""arrested"" Mr Fasoli ""for being a spy"" and during his fake interrogation he threatened to cut his tongue with a large hunting knife to extract his PIN numbers. It was originally believed Mr Fasoli died in a fire in his bungalow After setting the flat alight, Marshall used Mr Fasoli's bank cards to buy a flight to Rome, where he continued his violent spree, killing a second man and attempting to murder a third within weeks. He evaded justice for Mr Fasoli's death for nearly two years. Commenting on the attack, neighbour Layla Light said: ""We was all very shocked because he [Mr Fasoli] kept himself to himself, no-one really knew him, and we knew he had a lot of electrical equipment so we just assumed it was an electrical fire. ""It's quite scary because it's come out that the guy has killed other people and he died and was tortured to death while we were sleeping."" Marshall showed no reaction as the verdicts were delivered Marshall, from East Ham, east London, who is already serving 16 years for the attacks in Italy, showed no reaction as the verdicts were delivered on Wednesday. The case has raised questions about why the original investigation failed to spot that Mr Fasoli's bank cards were used after his death or that his murder was caught on CCTV. Human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell likened the case to that of gay serial killer Stephen Port and said he was ""shocked and surprised"" the Independent Police Complaints Commission was not investigating. Stephen Port was sentenced to life in prison after being found guilty of murdering four young men he met on dating websitesby poisoning them with lethal doses of a date rape drug. Mr Tatchell said: ""This case has echoes of the serial killings by Stephen Port. There appears to have been missed opportunities and serious failings of the police investigation."" After footage emerged of Mr Fasoli's killing, a pathologist found that asphyxiation also contributed to his death After the footage emerged of Mr Fasoli's killing, a pathologist found that asphyxiation also contributed to his death, although he was still alive but unconscious when the fire started. While on the run in Italy, Marshall strangled Vincenzo Iale, 67, with electrical flex in his flat and made off with his bank card and car on 26 January, 2013. Just over a week later, he posed as a British embassy official, armed with a holster, utility belt, pistol, pepper spray and truncheon, when he met Umberto Gismondi, 54, for sex. He bound and gagged Mr Gismondi as he demanded cash but fled after the victim managed to alert his neighbours. In July 2014, Marshall was found guilty of murder and attempted murder and was jailed for 16 years. Under cross-examination on Wednesday, he admitted he got pleasure from dominating naked men while pretending to be a policeman. Asked by Judge Nicholas Hilliard QC if he had been trying to ""terrify"" Mr Fasoli, he said: ""Yes, my lord, with the prospect of torture."" Marshall was remanded in custody on Wednesday to be sentenced on a later date. 7 January 2013: Mr Fasoli is found dead at his home in Rubens Road, Northolt 7/8 January: Â£780 is withdrawn from his bank account. Marshall books a return flight from Gatwick to Rome using Mr Fasoli's bank card 11 January: Marshall boards the flight, but does not get on the return flight on 17 January 3 February: Italian police find the body of Vincenzo Iale, 67, in his home in Torvaianica on the outskirts of Rome. He was naked lying on the floor with an electrical flex around his neck. The hard drive of his computer had been removed and his car stolen. It is established he died on the night of 26/27 January. Days afterwards his bank card is used to make cash withdrawals The same day: Marshall meets 54-year-old man Umberto Gismondi for sex. He arrives carrying a pistol, pepper spray can and telescopic truncheon and false identification suggesting he worked for the British embassy. He binds and gags Mr Gismondi, assaults him and demands money, bank cards and pin numbers. Mr Gismondi's shouting alerts neighbours and Marshall fled the scene, taking the victim's mobile phone with him 16 August: Inquest recorded verdict of accidental death into Mr Fasoli's death. Fire investigators conclude the fire had most likely been caused by a faulty LED falling from a ceiling fitting on to bedding which was highly flammable 9 July 2014: Marshall convicted by an Italian court of the murder of Mr Iale and attempted murder of Mr Gismondi. He is sentenced to 22 years 8 November: Mr Fasoli's nephew, Christopher Murgatroyd, finds the video of the murder on Mr Fasoli's laptop and contacts police 15 September 2015: Following an appeal, Marshall is sentenced to 16 years in prison in Italy 15 February 2017: Marshall is flown back to the UK and arrested on suspicion of murder Man 'murdered by fantasist in sex game' Minicab drives into Kilburn police crime scene where two teens stabbed Charges made in connection with death of Paralympian at Newham Leisure Centre Londonâs FTSE 250 slumps and pound weakens as UK gilt yields spike Recycle your empty Christmas chocolate tubs at Greene King Pubs in Ealing Trust faces more investigations as second baby 'dies from injury during birth' Elcella: London scientists develop 'all-natural' alternative to weight loss jabs like Ozempic At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Watch: Ferocious and explosive fire burns behind CBS reporter 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

"Women in India have been posting photographs of themselves enjoying a night out on social media in response to a politician who said a woman who was chased in her car by two men ""should not have gone out so late at night"". Varnika Kundu, who works as a DJ in the northern city of Chandigarh, was returning home on Friday night when she was allegedly chased by the men, one of whom was Vikas Barala, the son of a prominent politician from India's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). On Wednesday, Mr Barala was arrested - police say he stands accused of ""stalking, drink-driving and attempt to kidnap"". Ms Kundu said she was ""chased and almost kidnapped"" and that she was ""not lying raped and murdered in a ditch somewhere"" only because police quickly responded to her distress call and rescued her. After she wrote aFacebook post,externalabout her ordeal which went viral, senior BJP politician in Haryana state Ramveer Bhatti blamed Ms Kundu for what happened to her. ""The girl should not have gone out at 12 in the night,"" he told theCNN-News18,externaltelevision channel. ""Why was she driving so late in the night? The atmosphere is not right. We need to take care of ourselves."" Mr Bhatti then went on to tellThe Times of India,externalthat ""parents must take care of their children. They shouldn't allow them to roam at night. Children should come home on time, why stay out at night?"" This ""victim shaming"" didn't go down well, and soon women began posting photos of themselves out at night under the hashtag #AintNoCinderella. Claiming Delhi's streets to 'break the cage' for women Why are Indian women 'Happy to Bleed'? The campaign was launched by Divya Spandana, head of the opposition Congress party's social media cell who is a popular film actress from the southern state of Karnataka and often goes by her screen name Ramya. ""Why shouldn't women go out after midnight? I'm asking people like Mr Bhatti who are they to set curfew hours for us? I want to ask him who is he to question us? This is such a regressive mindset,"" Ms Spandana told the BBC. She started out by sending a message to some women on her WhatsApp group on Monday evening. ""Ladies, how often have you heard something regressive like this from the mouth of a 'leader' who doesn't know much better? I'll answer: too often,"" the message said. ""This time they're telling us when we can and cannot go out of the our houses. This has to STOP"" she added. Then, she posted an image of herself onTwitter,externaland invited other women to do the same. The campaign soon caught on and hundreds of women have since posted photographs on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram challenging patriarchal mindsets that always blame women. Among the first to post a midnight selfie was Sharmistha Mukherjee, Congress party leader and daughter of former Indian president Pranab Mukherjee: Many others followed up, often with defiant messages: When journalist Palak Sharma posted her image, sipping a drink and winking at the camera, she got loads of messages appreciating her ""bold stand"": ""But in the last two days, I've received lots of threats too. I've been called a whore, a slut,"" she told the BBC. ""Think about it - I'm a journalist, I work for the government-run media, I'm no pushover and I'm being threatened for my tweet,"" she said. ""But I'm not afraid,"" Ms Sharma added. ""Nothing is going to stop us, no amount of naysayers can frighten us. We aren't Cinderellas, we don't have to be home at midnight."" With more and more women joining the campaign, it seems many others are refusing to be intimidated too.

Thirteen students had taken the course, whichthe college redesignedafter none of the 22 who had signed up for the media exam passed itlast year. Roddy Henry, acting principal at Inverness College UHI, described the latest results as a ""real shock"". The college said it had put in place additional support for the students as part of the redesign. It is investigating the latest situation. Most of those who sat the exam were aged between 16 and 18. Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) said it provided ""significant levels of ongoing support"" to the college across all its subjects. It said across Scotland the grade A to C attainment rate for Higher Media was 59.8% and the assessment ""performed as intended"". Following last year's results, SQA also said the nationally-available 2016 Higher Media assessment had ""performed as intended"". Inverness College UHI, which is part of the University of the Highlands and Islands, said it will not offer Higher Media in 2017/18. It said this decision was taken before the latest results were known and as part of an ongoing review of courses the college offers. Mr Henry said: ""These results are a real shock and I am deeply disappointed that we are in this situation. ""The results are not in line with ongoing feedback and monitoring of the course, which was stringent this year given last year's results. ""They are by no means representative of the overall quality of provision at Inverness College UHI, where student success rates have improved year-on-year for the last four years. ""Overall, Higher results this year have been very good and in several cases well above the norm for Highers studied at colleges in Scotland."" He said overall pass rates in Maths was 71%, English 80%, Care 100%, Physics 83% and Biology 80%. A spokesman for SQA said that following last year's fails it provided ""extensive further support"" to the college, including a visit from its principal assessor, to help the staff in their understanding of standards. He added: ""SQA has continued to work with Inverness College and in May the college indicated it would no longer be offering this course.""

"This video can not be played Northumbria Police paid Â£10,000 to child rapist A police force paid a child rapist more than Â£10,000 for help during an investigation, it has emerged. The conviction of a Tyneside grooming gang is the culmination of Operation Shelter- itself part of Operation Sanctuary, a long-running Northumbria Police investigation into the abuse of vulnerable girls and young women. It has now emerged that during the course of the inquiry the force paid the convicted rapist - known as XY as he cannot be named for legal reasons - to act as an informant. XY fell out with his police handler, making a series of damning allegations, including claims he had been told to plant drugs and take vulnerable girls to parties. This led to a challenge to the court process, with the defence arguing his allegations fatally undermined the police case. The use of XY was condemned by Jim Gamble, who set up a government taskforce However, the use of the informant has been defended by the force. Chief Constable Steve Ashman said: ""We have to deal with people who themselves are guilty of some of the most vile offences imaginable. ""Quite often these people can't be trusted, but the potential prize is that you just might get a piece of information, intelligence possibly, even evidence, that might just lead you to a successful conviction and you put bad people behind bars."" BBC's Inside Out programmehas learned the informant was known to some of the defendants. Abuse survivor Sammy Woodhouse described the payment to XY as a ""kick in the teeth"" XY had a total of 53 convictions, and had previously been jailed for seven years for attacking a 15-year-old girl, whom he plied with drink and drugs and gang raped with two of his friends. While working for Operation Sanctuary, he was arrested for dishonesty, an assault in a mosque, and was questioned about making sexual advances to a 13-year-old girl. So what did XY's role as an informer involve? During a special court hearing in October, brought by the defence in a bid to have the cases dropped, XY said: ""I was told, 'This is an operation about Asian grooming gangs. This is what we are after. These are the people we are interested in'. ""I had to find out what was going onâ¦ where the parties were taking place. ""These parties I went to, one or two, I got information about parties, when they were happening, and I would ring it in."" While it is not unusual for informants to have criminal records, one senior ex-policeman has expressed concern over the use of XY. Jim Gamble, who set up the government's taskforce to fight child sexual exploitation, said: ""I think all police forces are under pressure to get things right. But there are ways and means to doing it... there need to be limits and there should be lines that shouldn't be crossed. ""In my opinion they have gone way over the line on this one. ""Personally, I can't envisage any circumstances where I would have authorised payment to someone convicted of rape. ""I can't imagine how you could have control mechanisms in place with an informant of that type... that would give you reassurance that they didn't still represent a risk to young and vulnerable women, given what I know about this person's history."" BBC Inside Out had exclusive access to a secret transcript of XY's interview XY's payment of Â£10,300 has attracted criticism. Sammy Woodhouse,who was 14 when she was abused by a grooming gang in Rotherham, now advises police forces on how to tackle grooming. She said: ""I think it's absolutely outrageous. If I were in [his rape victim's] situation I'd be absolutely disgusted by it. ""For me that would be a real kick in the teeth and I'd think 'this is a man that could have destroyed my life, that fetched me so much hurt and pain, and he's been rewarded for that'."" By the summer of 2015 police were ready to bring their case to court, dividing 20 defendants between four trials. The first - in September 2015 - led to six convictions, but by the following March, XY had fallen out with his police handler and was threatening to go to the press. BBC Inside Out had access to a secret transcript of XY's interview with the National Crime Agency, which was called in to investigate his allegations. In it, he claimed he was tasked by his handler to plant drugs at the homes of those eventually convicted, and was even told to take vulnerable girls to parties. XY said: ""He asked me at one point go pick one up and bring her to the house and bring some drugs with youâ¦ so I'd go and pick up these lasses, take them to the party, leave the drugs on the table."" With other trials about to take place, defence lawyers argued that XY's claims so discredited the police case it was fatally flawed, and these trials should be abandoned. This led to an Abuse of Process hearing, held in October 2016. The BBC successfully argued against a prosecution attempt to bar the media from the hearing, which was in front of the judge who had presided over the first trial, and who was due to preside over the next three. Defence lawyer David Comb said: ""This is a case where a rapist was put into the field, where he was with vulnerable young women when intoxicated... there were 30 occasions where it was disclosed by XY that he had been at parties. ""The police were happy for him to be going to parties, taking drugs, being out of control, because of the high value of information. That is an affront to the public conscience."" Chief Constable Steve Ashman defended the use of XY, saying he would do ""exactly the same thing again"" XY - who by now had been moved, along with his family, out of the area and was under round-the-clock police protection - was called to court and gave his evidence from behind a screen. He was questioned on what police had asked him to do, and blamed his many inconsistencies on the pressure of working as an informant. ""You have to remember that I've been through a lot. It's impossible to remember what's true and what's not. You've put me through this,"" he said. ""If I got shot or died it would have been easier for my wife."" At the Abuse of Process hearing, Judge Penny Moreland dismissed all of XY's allegations against the police, saying he was ""wholly unworthy of belief"" and rejected the defence's attempt to halt the trials. She also said it was not her job to rule on the police's decision to employ him. Judge Moreland said: ""In effect I'm being asked to substitute my judgment about the kind of person who should be used as an informant, for the judgment of the officers whose work this is. That I decline to do."" Mr Ashman said he was content that dangerous men had been put behind bars and that he would do ""exactly the same thing again"". ""In some cases we have actually saved lives on the back of information that we have gained, and am I going to take that risk again? You're damn right I'm going to. ""It's inside the law, inside accepted policy and practice. I get that people might be quite shocked by it, but actually this is the right thing to do."" The force's handling of XY has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission, and its investigations have now established no findings of misconduct.

"The Pacific island of Guam is home to the US Air Force's Andersen air base North Korea has said it is considering carrying out missile strikes on the US Pacific territory of Guam. The North's official news agency said on Tuesday the plan involved firing medium-to-long-range rockets at Guam, where US strategic bombers are based. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, flying into Guam, said there was no imminent threat from North Korea. He also defended President Donald Trump, who on Tuesday threatened Pyongyang with ""fire and fury"". Mr Tillerson said that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un did not understand diplomatic language, and a strong message was needed that he would understand. ""I think the president just wanted to be clear to the North Korean regime that the US... will defend itself and its allies,"" he said. On Wednesday, Mr Trump tweeted that the US nuclear arsenal was ""more powerful than ever before"",but added,externalhe was hopeful ""we will never have to use this power"". The recent exchanges mark a sharp rise in rhetoric between Washington and Pyongyang, but China has urged calm. The North Korea crisis in 300 words Analysis: Where do we go after 'fire and fury'? 'Caught in the cross fire' - What's the mood on Guam right now? A foreign ministry statement quoted by Reuters called on all sides to avoid words or actions which might escalate the situation and to make greater efforts to resolve the issue via talks. The UN recently approved further economic sanctions on North Korea, which Pyongyang said were a ""violent violation of our sovereignty"", warning the US would ""pay a price"". This video can not be played President Trump threatened a response 'like the world has never seen' On Wednesday, the official KCNA news agency said North Korea was ""carefully examining the operational plan for making an enveloping fire at the areas around Guam"" using its domestically made medium-to-long-range Hwasong-12 missiles. What damage could N Korea do without nuclear weapons? Pyongyang releases Canadian pastor The news agency reported a military statement issued on Tuesday, which probably came in response to US military drills in Guam. However, there has been no indication that any attack on Guam by North Korea is imminent. In a message to the public,external, the governor of Guam Eddie Baza Calvo said there was currently ""no threat"" to the island and the Marianas archipelago, but that Guam was ""prepared for any eventuality"". North Korea's statement is the latest stage in a heating up of rhetoric and tension. Pyongyang,which has tested nuclear devices five times, launched two intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) in July, claiming it now had the ability to hit mainland US. Will North Korea nuclear threat focus minds? Can the US defend itself? Possible ways forward for the outside world On Tuesday, media reports in the US claimed the North had achieved its goal of making a nuclear warhead small enough to fit inside its missiles. This video can not be played North Korea's second intercontinental missile launched last month was ""seen from Japan"" While not confirmed, this was seen as one of the last obstacles to North Korea being a fully nuclear-armed state. A report in theWashington Post,external, citing US intelligence officials, suggested North Korea was developing nuclear weapons capable of hitting the US at a much faster rate than expected. A Japanese government defence white paper also said the weapons programme had ""advanced considerably"" and that North Korea possibly now had nuclear weapons. North Korea's missile programme explained In response, President Trump warned North Korea to stop threatening the US, saying they would be ""met with fire and fury like the world has never seen"". However, veteran US Senator John McCain was sceptical about Mr Trump's statement, saying he was""not sure that President Trump is ready to act"",external. On the streets of Seoul, barely 50km (30 miles) from the border with North Korea, the latest developments have drawn mixed reactions. Kim Seong-su, 62, said he thought Pyongyang was bluffing to preserve its regime and justify its nuclear programme. But others are more concerned. Yeon Eui-sook says she finds the situation scary. ""I hope everyone can live in peace. Kim Jong-un keeps doing this and making us worry,"" she said. Analysts say the language from Pyongyang always gets more aggressive in August, when the US and South Korea conduct joint military exercises. But this time - with a US president who also uses strong words - the confrontation is getting even fiercer than usual. North Korea had reacted angrily after the fresh sanctions were announced on Saturday by the UN, in an attempt to pressure it into giving up its nuclear ambitions. The sanctions aim to reduce North Korea's export revenues by a third. KCNA said North Korea would retaliate and make ""the US pay a price"" for drafting the new measures. It called the sanctions a ""violent violation of our sovereignty"", the news agency said. Meanwhile on Wednesday the UK Foreign Office said it would ""continue to work with the US and our international partners to maintain pressure on North Korea"". ""We have been consistently clear and forthright in our condemnation of North Korea's destabilising and illegal behaviour, including through support for UN Security Council resolutions to bring in sanctions that will limit North Korea's ability to pursue its nuclear weapons programme,"" a spokesman said. A spokesman for Germany's foreign ministry, quoted by AFP, said it was watching the situation ""with the greatest concern"" and called on all sides to use restraint. The 541sq km (209 sq miles) volcanic and coral island in the Pacific between the Philippines and Hawaii. It is a ""non-incorporated"" US territory, with a population of about 163,000. That means people born in Guam are US citizens, have an elected governor and House Representative, but cannot vote for a president in US national elections. US military bases cover about a quarter of the island. About 6,000 personnel are based there and there are plans to move in thousands more. It was a key US base in World War Two, and remains a vital staging post for US operations, giving access to potential flashpoints like theSouth China Sea,the Koreasand theTaiwan Straits.

"Police shot and wounded the driver of the BMW Police in France have shot, wounded and arrested a man after a dramatic car chase along a motorway in the north of the country following an attack on soldiers in a suburb of Paris. A bullet-holed BMW could be seen where police brought it to a halt. Earlier, six soldiers were wounded after a car was driven at them near their base in Levallois-Perret. The Paris prosecutor described the attack as ""attempted killings... in relation to a terrorist undertaking"". Reports say one policeman was injured during the arrest operation on the A16 motorway at the town of Marquise  near the port of Boulogne. The BMW is said to have hit at least one other vehicle during the chase and the police opened fire several times. The suspect is in his 30s. Three of the soldiers are now known to have been seriously wounded in the Paris attack.  All were taken to hospital, though none is in a life-threatening condition, Defence Minister Florence Parly said. The motivation for the attack is as yet not known, but France, which is contributing to the fight against so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, has frequently been the target of attacks by Islamist militants. A state of emergency in force since November 2015 includes highly visible patrols under Operation Sentinel, numbering some 7,000 troops. On 13 November 2015, 130 people were killed in a night of attacks in Paris, and more than 100 have been killed in jihadist attacks since. They include a string of assaults on the heavily armed security forces who now dot the streets of the capital - the last only four days ago. Wednesday's attack at about 08:15 local time (06:15 GMT) took place in a pedestrian zone near the soldier's base on the Place de Verdun in Levallois-Perret. Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said the car had been driven deliberately at the troops and the attack had been carried out by a ""man on his own"". It was driven slowly until it came within 5m (16ft) of the patrol before accelerating towards them, he said. The alleged attacker is said to have been waiting in his BMW car outside the military barracks The local mayor, Patrick Balkany, told BFMTV a vehicle had been waiting in the road for the soldiers to emerge as they came on duty. ""It was a BMW which accelerated very quickly the moment they came out."" A resident in a nearby block of flats, Jean-Claude Veillant, told reporters he had seen the immediate aftermath of the attack. ""I heard a loud noise, the sound of scraping metal. Shortly after, I saw one of the badly wounded lying in front of the Vigipirate [army patrol] vehicle and another one behind it receiving treatment,"" he said. Last Saturday, a young mantried to force his way into the Eiffel Tower with a knife, shouting ""Allahu Akbar"" (""God is greatest"").

"The FBI has conducted a pre-dawn raid on the Virginia home of Donald Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, his spokesman confirmed. Federal agents are said to have seized files and other material on 26 July, a day after Mr Manafort voluntarily met the Senate Intelligence Committee. Mr Manafort left the Trump campaign over questions about his foreign ties. The FBI is leading one of several investigations into alleged Russian meddling in last year's US election. Special counsel Robert Mueller, who heads up the FBI investigation, left Mr Manafort's Alexandria home with ""various records"", the Washington Post first reported. A day before the raid, Mr Manafort voluntarily met a congressional panel that is also investigating Russia's alleged influence on the 2016 election. Analysts say the search warrant suggests investigators wanted to be sure Mr Manafort would hand over all records in response to a grand jury subpoena. Federal agents searched for tax documents and foreign bank records, US media reported. What is a grand jury? Trump: US-Russia relations are at 'dangerous low' The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Russia: The 'cloud' over the White House Mr Manafort's spokesman, Jason Maloni, confirmed the agents had ""executed a search warrant at one of Mr Manafort's residences"". ""Mr Manafort has consistently co-operated with law enforcement and other serious inquiries and did so on this occasion as well,"" he added. The special counsel's office has declined to comment. This video can not be played All you need to know about the Trump-Russia investigation President Trump has denied any collusion with Russia and has frequently referred to Mr Mueller's investigation as a ""witch-hunt"". Mr Manafort has handed over files to the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Senate and House Intelligence Committees for their respective Russia inquiries. The material reportedly includes notes that Mr Manafort took during a meeting with Donald Trump Jr, the president's son, and a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower in New York in June 2016. Emails from Mr Trump Jr show he took the meeting and invited Mr Manafort after being promised damaging material about his father's Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. Mr Mueller is reportedly seeking to determine whether Mr Trump knew of his son's meeting before it happened, or if he was briefed on it afterwards. Mr Manafort's financial dealings have reportedly been a focal point of Mr Mueller's investigations. In June, Mr Manafort retroactively registered as a foreign agent with the Justice Department in relation to his consulting work for a Russia-backed, Ukrainian political party. He resigned from the Trump campaign last August after he was accused of accepting millions of dollars in cash for representing Kremlin interests in the Ukraine and the US, including his dealings with an oligarch linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Mr Mueller has reportedly begun using a grand jury, which are used to issue subpoenas to compel people to testify. US media have also quoted sources close to the inquiry as saying Mr Mueller is investigating whether the president could have obstructed justice when he fired FBI chief James Comey, who was leading the previous investigation into Russian interference. After Mr Comey's sacking, Mr Mueller was appointed in May by the deputy attorney general of the Department of Justice to continue the inquiry.

"US bombers recently flew a mission over the Korean peninsula as a warning to Pyongyang In the escalating war of words between the United States and North Korea, one assumes that Kim Jong-un's propaganda machine is now working overtime. After threatening revenge ""a thousand fold"" in response to United Nations sanctions over its destabilising lurch towards a nuclear capability, how can Pyongyang top President Donald Trump's return volley, through which he pledged ""fire and fury like the world has never seen"" if North Korea continues to threaten the United States? First, let's put this latest exchange in context. How much of this have we experienced before? And to what extent are we beginning to break new and dangerous ground? Terminology surrounding North Korea has always seemed backwards. The end of the Korean War in 1953 technically represented a cessation of hostilities between the two sides. But in reality there has been open hostility ever since. This video can not be played President Trump threatened a response 'like the world has never seen' The US and North Korea came very close to armed conflict in 1994 after Pyongyang refused to allow international inspectors access to its nuclear facilities as required under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. That crisis was resolved diplomatically, but it set the stage for a two-decade cat and mouse game where North Korea paid lip service to its pledge to denuclearise but kept its options open to build an actual weapon and the means to deliver it. Over time, while the international community offered North Korea normal relations in return for denuclearisation, Pyongyang wanted normal relations and nuclear weapons. Without admitting it, the US policy became containment, preventing North Korea from exporting its nuclear know-how while hoping that its erratic regime would implode before it actually obtained a nuclear deterrent. In recent years, two key developments changed the basic contours of the North Korea problem. First, the removals of Saddam Hussein by the Bush administration and Muammar Gaddafi by the Obama administration - two leaders who contemplated nuclear weapons but didn't actually build them - led Pyongyang to a simple conclusion: an actual nuclear capability is the ultimate regime insurance policy. And second, Kim Jong-il passed away in late 2011. The elder Kim was sufficiently deferential to his primary benefactor, China, that he maintained plausible deniability as to North Korea's actual nuclear capability. Kim Jong-un, his son and successor, has abandoned all pretence and is openly racing to obtain a demonstrated nuclear deterrent. There is growing alarm in South Korea as tensions rise between Washington and Pyongyang The Trump administration must decide what it can and cannot live with, and what to do about a situation that is rapidly moving from bad to worse. To his credit, even as a candidate, President Trump placed the North Korea issue at or near the top of his list of national security concerns. And he has consistently called on China, North Korea's leading trading partner, to do more to rein in its client state. On the other hand, Mr Trump has underestimated the risk and complexity surrounding the North Korea problem. While he vowed early in his tenure that he would solve it one way or another, he ignored the reality that there are no good policy options available. At one level, President Trump's threat of fire and fury is not new. In many different forms, albeit not as colourful, the US has always said that if North Korea ever attacks, the regime will cease to exist. That said, Mr Trump's rhetoric seemed to suggest that he was prepared to take pre-emptive action if North Korea gets closer to an actual nuclear deterrent. But any use of force immediately places hundreds of thousands of South Koreans and Japanese citizens at risk. North Korea will almost certainly respond to a pre-emptive attack. Will North Korea nuclear threat focus minds? Can the US defend itself against North Korea? N Korea: The possible solutions What is different about this cycle is the lack of a diplomatic process that could serve as a firebreak. Secretary of State Rex Tillersonsaid in a recent media briefingthat the United States is open to dialogue with North Korea, provided talks are about ending missile tests and giving up nuclear weapons. Pyongyang, even as it confronts new sanctions, is unlikely to agree to those conditions. While China welcomed Mr Tillerson's gesture, North Korea's young leader doesn't seem to care what Beijing thinks. And the next move is his. The danger is that at some point, the over-heated rhetoric creates an action-reaction cycle without an obvious reverse gear. They fire a missile. We slap on more sanctions. They promise revenge. We declare these threats intolerable. They fire another missile. Then what? This is where rhetoric meets strategy. But it's unclear if there is one behind Trump's fire and fury.

"Left to right, row by row, starting top left: Eisa Mousavi, Mohammed Ali, Nashir Uddin, Monjur Choudhury, Taherul Alam, Habibur Rahim, Badrul Hussain, Carolann Gallon, Saiful Islam, AbdulHamid Minoyee, Prabhat Nelli, Abdul Sabe, Jahangir Zaman, Nadeem Aslam, Mohammed Azram, Yassar Hussain, Redwan Siddquee, Mohibur Rahman Eighteen people have been convicted of abusing girls in Newcastle who were plied with alcohol and drugs before being forced to have sex. The vulnerable victims, some as young as 14, were exploited by a ""cynical organisation"", a court heard. The 17 men and one woman were convicted of rape, supplying drugs and conspiracy to incite prostitution. Over the course of four trials, 20 young women gave evidence covering a period from 2011 to 2014. These trials involved 26 defendants facing a total of more than 100 charges and 22 victims. Those prosecuted were from the Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Indian, Iraqi, Iranian and Turkish communities and mainly British-born, with most living in the West End of Newcastle. Of the 26, four people have been jailed. The rest will be sentenced next month. It also emerged during the court process thatpolice paid a convicted child rapist Â£10,000 as an informant. Reaction after 18 people convicted over abuse ""Vile crimes committed by evil men"" The victims were at first flattered by the attention of the men who apparently befriended them, but were then lured to parties, known as ""sessions"", by the promise of alcohol and drugs - often mephedrone (or M-Kat), Newcastle Crown Court heard. Bags of M-Kat were left on coffee tables for the girls to help themselves. The parties took place at premises around the West End, including the top floor of tower block Todd's Nook, where one teenager said she was raped three times. The prosecution said they became the ""vulnerable victims of an organised, cynical, systematic organisation in which they were passed between their abusers."" This video can not be played Operation Sanctuary was the biggest investigation into sexual exploitation by Northumbria Police Some spoke of being ""too intoxicated"" to defend themselves, while others became addicted and had to commit sexual acts in return for drugs. One victim said she had attended about 60 parties and another told of going to an address where there were two older men and a woman, who seemed ""frightened and scared, like a slave"". She said: ""They told us what she would do for them for money and drugs or she'd get battered."" Another victim said: ""I knew that if we wanted drugs or alcohol we would have to do something. ""[He] had us too intoxicated to fight him off. One time, [he] locked the door. I was told I would only be allowed out if I had sex."" Northumbria Police set up Operation Sanctuary in December 2013 to investigate claims of sexual abuse against girls and young women. The investigation is ongoing and to date has resulted in 461 arrests. Police have spoken to 703 potential complainants and 278 victims have been identified. The victims were abused at addresses around the West End of Newcastle Due to its size, the investigation was split into a number of spin-off operations. Operation Shelter uncovered groups of men in the West End of Newcastle - many of whom were known to each other - who exploited vulnerable young women and girls over a period from 2010 to 2014. This eventually led to four separate trials, the first commencing in September 2015 and the final one which has just concluded, allowing previous reporting restrictions to be lifted. Chris Jackson, BBC Inside Out in the North East and Cumbria Sarah (not her real name) was 19, extremely vulnerable and unable to look after herself. Along with other at-risk teenagers she was regularly abused by older men. In the new year of 2014, Sarah told the police she had been raped by Abdul Minoyee. A police officer took Sarah on a tour of the West End to try identify Minoyee's house and car and other places where these ""parties"" had taken place. Sarah's information was a red flag - the abuse was on a much bigger scale. The detective in charge of Sarah's case told his bosses that what she had said signalled something much bigger. Days later the officer's hunch was given added weight when two girls in care reported that they had been repeatedly raped by a group of older Asian men. The girls were aged 14 and 15. They described being driven into Newcastle where they were plied with alcohol and cocaine before being raped and beaten by several men. They were given money before being returned home. One of the victims was in local authority care at the time. Newcastle City Council has launched a serious case review that is due to be published in December. Council leader Nick Forbes said: ""These were vile crimes committed by evil men. ""The victims ... have been brave beyond belief and undoubtedly have made our city safer."" Chief Constable Steve Ashman said: ""We have not and will not stop. ""There has been no political correctness here. These are criminals and there has been no hesitation in arresting them and targeting them using all the means at our disposal."" Now that reporting restrictions can be lifted, it can be revealed that a police officer was sacked for failing to investigate a sex offender's phone. It related to an earlier Operation Sanctuary investigation, which resulted in theconviction of Bahmani Ahmadi. Mr Ashman said the officer should have been much more diligent, and that his dismissal should provide reassurance that the police culture in Northumbria had changed.

"The FBI has conducted a pre-dawn raid on the Virginia home of Donald Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, his spokesman confirmed. Federal agents are said to have seized files and other material on 26 July, a day after Mr Manafort voluntarily met the Senate Intelligence Committee. Mr Manafort left the Trump campaign over questions about his foreign ties. The FBI is leading one of several investigations into alleged Russian meddling in last year's US election. Special counsel Robert Mueller, who heads up the FBI investigation, left Mr Manafort's Alexandria home with ""various records"", the Washington Post first reported. A day before the raid, Mr Manafort voluntarily met a congressional panel that is also investigating Russia's alleged influence on the 2016 election. Analysts say the search warrant suggests investigators wanted to be sure Mr Manafort would hand over all records in response to a grand jury subpoena. Federal agents searched for tax documents and foreign bank records, US media reported. What is a grand jury? Trump: US-Russia relations are at 'dangerous low' The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Russia: The 'cloud' over the White House Mr Manafort's spokesman, Jason Maloni, confirmed the agents had ""executed a search warrant at one of Mr Manafort's residences"". ""Mr Manafort has consistently co-operated with law enforcement and other serious inquiries and did so on this occasion as well,"" he added. The special counsel's office has declined to comment. This video can not be played All you need to know about the Trump-Russia investigation President Trump has denied any collusion with Russia and has frequently referred to Mr Mueller's investigation as a ""witch-hunt"". Mr Manafort has handed over files to the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Senate and House Intelligence Committees for their respective Russia inquiries. The material reportedly includes notes that Mr Manafort took during a meeting with Donald Trump Jr, the president's son, and a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower in New York in June 2016. Emails from Mr Trump Jr show he took the meeting and invited Mr Manafort after being promised damaging material about his father's Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. Mr Mueller is reportedly seeking to determine whether Mr Trump knew of his son's meeting before it happened, or if he was briefed on it afterwards. Mr Manafort's financial dealings have reportedly been a focal point of Mr Mueller's investigations. In June, Mr Manafort retroactively registered as a foreign agent with the Justice Department in relation to his consulting work for a Russia-backed, Ukrainian political party. He resigned from the Trump campaign last August after he was accused of accepting millions of dollars in cash for representing Kremlin interests in the Ukraine and the US, including his dealings with an oligarch linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Mr Mueller has reportedly begun using a grand jury, which are used to issue subpoenas to compel people to testify. US media have also quoted sources close to the inquiry as saying Mr Mueller is investigating whether the president could have obstructed justice when he fired FBI chief James Comey, who was leading the previous investigation into Russian interference. After Mr Comey's sacking, Mr Mueller was appointed in May by the deputy attorney general of the Department of Justice to continue the inquiry.

"The boy was found by officers in Georgia Road in Thornton Heath, Croydon A 15-year-old boy stabbed to death in south London has been named locally as Jermaine Goupall. He is the 15th teenager to be killed in a knife attack in the capital this year and the second in less than 24 hours. There were 12 fatal stabbings in 2016. Jermaine was found by police officers at about 23:00 BST on Tuesday in Georgia Road, Thornton Heath, Croydon. He was confirmed dead at the scene shortly before midnight. There have been no arrests. An elderly neighbour, who knew the boy, said: ""He was a nice lad, I would see him to speak to in the street and he would come over and stroke my dog, say hello. ""I know his dad, Stan, better. It seems desperately sad that this can happen to such an innocent boy."" Another neighbour said: ""I was in my house and I heard a police helicopter at around midnight. ""I've seen on the news that it was a 15-year-old boy; it's just so sad."" Jermaine has not yet been formally identified by police. Post-mortem tests will take place later this week. Officers remain at the scene and cordons are in place. Councillor Alison Butler, deputy leader of Croydon Council, said: ""I am devastated to hear another young man has lost his life to knife crime, and my thoughts are with the victim's family.

"Apart from during the last two weeks of Joe Orton's life, homosexual acts between men were still illegal Fifty years ago the playwright Joe Orton was bludgeoned to death by his boyfriend at the peak of his career. What is Orton's legacy, and what would he have made of the strides towards equality made since his death by gay people in the UK? Riding high on the success of his latest play, Loot, and waiting for a chauffeur to ferry him to talks about a film he had written for The Beatles, the 34-year-old playwright was attacked as he slept by Kenneth Halliwell at the flat they shared in Islington. Halliwell, who feared Orton had been planning to leave him, then took a fatal overdose. For Kenneth Cranham, the Olivier award-winning actor and friend of the couple, what happened on 9 August 1967 was hugely personal. ""I still had four grandparents then; I didn't know anyone who had died. So to have one person that I knew so well die and another commit suicide was a living nightmare,"" he said. ""Everything went into slow motion. In the play [Orton's Loot was being performed at the time of his murder] you were running around with a body in your arms, there were coffins everywhere, and it was [supposed to be] a comedy. ""It was so bizarre."" Joe Orton (left) and Kenneth Halliwell on holiday in Tangier, Morocco, pictured flanking the Carry On actor Kenneth Williams Born in 1933 as John Orton, he grew up with his three siblings on a Leicester estate typical of those built for workers in the 1920s. His sister Leonie Orton Barnett has described their home as ""drab, soulless and monotonous"", epitomising the ""worst aspects of Leicester's mottoSemper Eadem- always the same"". Orton, whose parents had an unhappy marriage, would leave his hometown at the earliest opportunity. He caught the acting bug in his teens and successfully auditioned for the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (Rada) in London, moving there to study on a scholarship in 1951. It was at Rada he encountered Halliwell, a troubled man seven years his senior. ""Meeting Halliwell was important because he found a collaborator with a shared sense of humour,"" said Emma Parker, associate professor in post-war and contemporary literature at the University of Leicester, which houses the Joe Orton Archive and is running a series of events to mark the anniversary of his murder. ""Joe was reading Shakespeare and other writers before he got to London and met Halliwell, so it's not fair to say he learned it all from him, [but] I think they were kindred spirits."" Orton wrote letters as pseudonymous characters, among them Mrs Edna Welthorpe, both to satirise criticism of his plays and to draw attention to them After leaving Rada, they formed a writing partnership but had little success. The pair often went to bed at sunset to save money on electricity. In 1962, a bizarre court case would land both men in prison - and ultimately provide the spark Orton needed to break though as a playwright. The pair had spent more than a yearaltering library books with garish collages and occasionally obscene text,external, the targets ranging from biographies and volumes of Shakespeare to novels they viewed as low quality. Their furtive campaign was eventually rumbled by zealous library staff and they were imprisoned for six months for theft and malicious damage, after a trial that attracted tabloid publicity. Orton believed the severity of the sentence was ""because we were queers"". Having gained a degree of separation from Halliwell, after his release Orton began to find success, with The Ruffian on the Stair broadcast on BBC radio in 1964. It is not entirely clear why Halliwell murdered Orton, but in a brief suicide note he wrote: ""If you read his diary all will be explained"" Entertaining Mr Sloane, a black comedy that touched on homosexuality and hypocrisy, was widely praised on its release, also in 1964, including by theatre heavyweights such as Terence Rattigan and Tennessee Williams. The actorDudley Sutton,external, who was part of the original cast, said he enjoyed being in a play ""that was having a go at the established view of things"", and praised Orton's sensitivity as a writer. ""He was so full of life, and I loved the dialogue,"" he saidin conversation with Dr Parker,externallast year. ""To fight the demon of homophobia with a West End comedy was brilliant - I'm very proud to have been a part of it."" Orton's hallmarks as a playwright were black humour, deliberate bad taste, surreal situations and attacks on hypocrisy. His subversive nature helped him to stand out from his peers, with The Times describing Entertaining Mr Sloane as making ""the blood boil more than any other British play in the last 10 years"". For Bernard Greaves, a Cambridge architecture student in the mid-60s, Orton's clear-eyed portrayal of aspects of contemporary gay life struck a chord. ""The impact of his plays was enormous,"" he said. ""I didn't have a large circle of gay friends at that time; I was in the closet living a double life - nearly everybody was, because it was still illegal - but Orton put on stage the reality of what it was like for us in an unvarnished way."" The playwright's sister Leonie Orton Barnett believes he helped other gay men to cope with their sexuality For the playwright's sister, Orton's work helped pave the way for other gay men to be more confident in their sexuality. ""I think people who really understood the writing know that this was somebody original and unique,""  Ms Orton Barnett said. ""He was so out there with his homosexuality, he was talking about it so frankly, and in such graphic detail, it brought a lot of people out. ""They'd say: 'Joe Orton said it's allowed, so I think it's allowed', and he was so right in being so direct about things. ""I think Joe liked the idea of it being unacceptable, he liked that idea of him being a rebel and being outside of society."" Just weeks before his death, the Sexual Offences Act, which decriminalised private homosexual acts between gay men over the age of 21, was granted royal assent. However, with the age limit higher than that for heterosexual sex, and with other restrictions still in place, Ms Orton-Barnett says her brother was not a supporter of the bill. ""I think he liked the mystique about homosexuality, he liked the closeted aspect,"" she said. ""He wouldn't have gone for the modern gay marriage at all."" Orton was one of the most celebrated British playwrights of the 1960s Dr Parker agrees, adding that Orton's love of subversion underpins his plays and personality. ""He was kind of queer rather than gay - he liked weirdness and deviance, because 'civilisation' persecuted homosexuals and he thought it was barbaric and didn't want any truck with it,"" she said. ""It rejected him, and so he rejected it. ""I think his sexuality is really important to his writing and his worldview,"" adds Dr Parker, who cites Orton as an influence on, among others, contemporary playwrights such as Martin McDonagh and Jez Butterworth, the novelists Jonathan Coe and Jake Arnott, and musicians including Morrissey and the Pet Shop Boys. ""He was a funny writer and full of life, but he was furious about society and sexual inequality; we know that from his diaries and his plays."" Olivier award-winning actor Kenneth Cranham featured in productions of Ruffian on the Stair and Entertaining Mr Sloane, as well as playing Hal in the 1966 London production of Loot Cranham - who said appearing in The Ruffian on the Stair aged only 19 ""completely changed everything for me"" - played Hal in the 1966 West End production of Loot, Orton's satire on the Catholic Church and attitudes to death. (Kenneth Williams had starred in the play's initial, unsuccessful, run in Cambridge the year before.) ""Paul McCartney said that to him theatre meant a sore arse, but he wanted Loot to go on for longer,"" the actor said. ""It shows Joe wrote plays for all people, and there was a connection between them and him. ""Joe always used to say he was from the gutter, but he just knew what real life was like."" What the Butler Saw, which was first staged in London two years after Orton died, has been performed in his hometown of Leicester to mark the 50th anniversary of his murder Orton's star continued to rise after his death, with his final play What the Butler Saw - a farce that turns its guns on power and a psychiatric profession that treated homosexuality as a mental illness - becoming a stage success (although Up Against It, a film written for The Beatles, never reached the screen). What the Butler Saw has beenperformed in Orton's hometown to mark 50 years since his murder, and several revivals over the years have helped to maintain his status as an iconic figure in British theatre. Ms Orton Barnett argues that her brother's plays and posthumously published diaries give him a similar standing to some of the giants of literature. ""I always say the equivalent of Shakespeare in the 1960s was Harold Pinter, and Joe was the Christopher Marlowe - he died a violent death, but he was really important culturally,"" she said. ""He didn't conform at all - he always said that he writes the truth."" For Cranham, who was among stars including Pinter and Donald Pleasence to attend Orton's atheist funeral service, the playwright's unerring brilliance as a writer of farcical satire remains a loss keenly felt by British theatre. ""I wish we could have known what would have happened to him as an older writer,"" he said. ""He was a great writer, and could have done so much.""

"Drivers are avoiding parking spots that require payment by phone as cash remains a more popular way to pay, according to the AA. The motoring organisation's survey of 16,000 members suggests seven out of 10 would look for parking elsewhere rather than use the ""pay by phone"" meters. The AA says people are put off by administration fees and voice-controlled phone payment systems. But councils said that paying by phone was a quick and convenient option. Nearly eight in 10 pensioners who responded to the AA survey said they would drive on rather than use them, the same proportion as drivers on low incomes. Jack Cousens, head of roads policy for the AA, said: ""Not only can it be a struggle to find a space but now, when you do find one, you may be required to talk to an automated system to pay the charge - not ideal if you have an appointment or just want to get in and get out quickly. ""All providers should make it easier to pay for parking. Not everyone has a smartphone to pay via an app and not everyone is keen to talk to a robot to pay for an hour's stay. For the elderly and low-income drivers, pay-by-phone feels almost discriminatory."" It argued that, while many drivers prefer to pay in cash, there was disgruntlement that some parking machines did not accept the new 12-sided Â£1 coin and others did not give change. A spokesman for the Local Government Association, which represents local authorities, said: ""Councils offer a variety of ways to pay for parking, and paying by phone can be a quick and convenient way to do so. ""As the AA's own research shows, 76% of councils in England have already converted the parking machines they are responsible for to accept the new Â£1 coin. Others are well on the way towards doing so. ""Having a range of options to pay for parking, for residents and visitors, is the best way for councils to serve the needs of their local communities."" The AA has also left itself open to accusations of mixed messages by criticising phone payment parking spaces on the same day as it unveils its own card payment system for small businesses. In the marketing for its new Card Pay project, it says that ""cash is a thing of the past for 62% of UK small businesses"".

"Police shot and wounded the driver of the BMW Police in France have shot, wounded and arrested a man after a dramatic car chase along a motorway in the north of the country following an attack on soldiers in a suburb of Paris. A bullet-holed BMW could be seen where police brought it to a halt. Earlier, six soldiers were wounded after a car was driven at them near their base in Levallois-Perret. The Paris prosecutor described the attack as ""attempted killings... in relation to a terrorist undertaking"". Reports say one policeman was injured during the arrest operation on the A16 motorway at the town of Marquise  near the port of Boulogne. The BMW is said to have hit at least one other vehicle during the chase and the police opened fire several times. The suspect is in his 30s. Three of the soldiers are now known to have been seriously wounded in the Paris attack.  All were taken to hospital, though none is in a life-threatening condition, Defence Minister Florence Parly said. The motivation for the attack is as yet not known, but France, which is contributing to the fight against so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, has frequently been the target of attacks by Islamist militants. A state of emergency in force since November 2015 includes highly visible patrols under Operation Sentinel, numbering some 7,000 troops. On 13 November 2015, 130 people were killed in a night of attacks in Paris, and more than 100 have been killed in jihadist attacks since. They include a string of assaults on the heavily armed security forces who now dot the streets of the capital - the last only four days ago. Wednesday's attack at about 08:15 local time (06:15 GMT) took place in a pedestrian zone near the soldier's base on the Place de Verdun in Levallois-Perret. Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said the car had been driven deliberately at the troops and the attack had been carried out by a ""man on his own"". It was driven slowly until it came within 5m (16ft) of the patrol before accelerating towards them, he said. The alleged attacker is said to have been waiting in his BMW car outside the military barracks The local mayor, Patrick Balkany, told BFMTV a vehicle had been waiting in the road for the soldiers to emerge as they came on duty. ""It was a BMW which accelerated very quickly the moment they came out."" A resident in a nearby block of flats, Jean-Claude Veillant, told reporters he had seen the immediate aftermath of the attack. ""I heard a loud noise, the sound of scraping metal. Shortly after, I saw one of the badly wounded lying in front of the Vigipirate [army patrol] vehicle and another one behind it receiving treatment,"" he said. Last Saturday, a young mantried to force his way into the Eiffel Tower with a knife, shouting ""Allahu Akbar"" (""God is greatest""). A source said he told investigators he wanted to kill a soldier In June, police shot a man whoattacked an officer with a hammer outside the Notre-Dame cathedralin Paris In April, an attackershot dead a policeman on the Champs-Elysees.

"This video can not be played Alistair Darling warns regulators to ""stay vigilant"" on Today Regulators must remain ""very very"" vigilant about the risks to the economy, former chancellor Lord Darling has told the BBC - 10 years on from the start of the financial crisis. He said a rising level of consumer debt in the economy was a growing concern. Lord Darling was speaking on the 10th anniversary of the 2007 crash, which led to the government spending billions of pounds rescuing major banks. He said the financial system was now safer but warned of ""complacency"". ""The lesson from 10 years ago is that something that can start as apparently a small ripple in the water can become mountainous seas very quickly,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The Labour peer said that over the last seven or eight years the economy had grown with ""the odd stutter"". RBS was 'haemorrhaging money' and close to total collapse, said Mr Darling However, he said he was concerned it was now starting to slow down again and that Brexit was causing ""massive uncertainty"". This, coupled with rising levels of consumer debt, should ""raise alarm bells"" for an economy so dependent on consumer spending, he said. ""When interest rates go up, and they will go up, if not this year then certainly next year, and suddenly people find they are going to be paying more in their monthly payments, that's when you need to watch out."" Lord Darling - or Alistair Darling as he was then known - became chancellor of the exchequer in June 2007, two months before French bank BNP Paribas famously shut down several investment funds citing problems in the US securities market. This is widely viewed as the start of the financial crisis, and the former chancellor recalled: ""As in every other treasury in the world, problems in the financial industry simply had not surfaced."" The government was forced to nationalise Northern Rock Over the next few years the government was forced to step in as global financial markets seized up and banks stopped lending to each other. It nationalised some lenders and provided tens of billions of taxpayers' money to prop up banks such as RBS that otherwise would have collapsed. The collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers saw workers take home their careers in boxes. Then there was the first run on a UK lender in 140 years, and the massive bailout of a British bank that had become the biggest in the world. It all started 10 years ago when a French bank admitted it didn't know what its investments in US property were worth - if anything. That BNP Paribas press release became a panic that turned into paranoia as trust between financial institutions evaporated. On 9 August 2007 we felt the first tremor of a full-blown financial earthquake, whose aftershocks we are still dealing with today - nationally, locally and personally. The crisis: 10 years in three charts Lew: Financial risks 'still substantial' Rogoff: China no longer biggest threat ""In the early stages it looked that there was just a problem with [the bank] Northern Rock,"" Lord Darling said. ""However, it became clear as we went through August of 2007 that more and more banks were becoming reluctant to lend to each other - which was extraordinary at that time - and that there was a more deep-seated problem."" ""Probably the most scary moment"" of the crisis, he said, was the run on RBS by its corporate customers in October 2008. ""I had to go to one of these meetings of European finance ministers, and I was asked to come out and take a call from the then chairman of RBS [Tom McKillop] who said the bank was haemorrhaging money,"" Mr Darling said. ""Remember this was not only the biggest bank in the world, it was about the same size as the entire UK economy. ""I said to him, how long can you last? And what he said to me shook me to the core. He said, 'well we're going to run out of money in the early afternoon'."" If the government hadn't intervened quickly, Lord Darling said, ""there would have been blind panic throughout the entire banking system, not just in the UK but around the world"". He said banks today were much better capitalised than in 2007 and regulators ""more sharp and ready to intervene"". But he warned the next crisis was likely to come from ""somewhere unexpected and from causes that haven't yet been identified"". ""The biggest danger is complacency. And of course in a few years' time when institutional memories start to fade, and the people around have all gone and retired, then that's where the risk occurs.""

"US bombers recently flew a mission over the Korean peninsula as a warning to Pyongyang In the escalating war of words between the United States and North Korea, one assumes that Kim Jong-un's propaganda machine is now working overtime. After threatening revenge ""a thousand fold"" in response to United Nations sanctions over its destabilising lurch towards a nuclear capability, how can Pyongyang top President Donald Trump's return volley, through which he pledged ""fire and fury like the world has never seen"" if North Korea continues to threaten the United States? First, let's put this latest exchange in context. How much of this have we experienced before? And to what extent are we beginning to break new and dangerous ground? Terminology surrounding North Korea has always seemed backwards. The end of the Korean War in 1953 technically represented a cessation of hostilities between the two sides. But in reality there has been open hostility ever since. This video can not be played President Trump threatened a response 'like the world has never seen' The US and North Korea came very close to armed conflict in 1994 after Pyongyang refused to allow international inspectors access to its nuclear facilities as required under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. That crisis was resolved diplomatically, but it set the stage for a two-decade cat and mouse game where North Korea paid lip service to its pledge to denuclearise but kept its options open to build an actual weapon and the means to deliver it. Over time, while the international community offered North Korea normal relations in return for denuclearisation, Pyongyang wanted normal relations and nuclear weapons. Without admitting it, the US policy became containment, preventing North Korea from exporting its nuclear know-how while hoping that its erratic regime would implode before it actually obtained a nuclear deterrent. In recent years, two key developments changed the basic contours of the North Korea problem. First, the removals of Saddam Hussein by the Bush administration and Muammar Gaddafi by the Obama administration - two leaders who contemplated nuclear weapons but didn't actually build them - led Pyongyang to a simple conclusion: an actual nuclear capability is the ultimate regime insurance policy. And second, Kim Jong-il passed away in late 2011. The elder Kim was sufficiently deferential to his primary benefactor, China, that he maintained plausible deniability as to North Korea's actual nuclear capability. Kim Jong-un, his son and successor, has abandoned all pretence and is openly racing to obtain a demonstrated nuclear deterrent. There is growing alarm in South Korea as tensions rise between Washington and Pyongyang The Trump administration must decide what it can and cannot live with, and what to do about a situation that is rapidly moving from bad to worse. To his credit, even as a candidate, President Trump placed the North Korea issue at or near the top of his list of national security concerns. And he has consistently called on China, North Korea's leading trading partner, to do more to rein in its client state. On the other hand, Mr Trump has underestimated the risk and complexity surrounding the North Korea problem. While he vowed early in his tenure that he would solve it one way or another, he ignored the reality that there are no good policy options available. At one level, President Trump's threat of fire and fury is not new. In many different forms, albeit not as colourful, the US has always said that if North Korea ever attacks, the regime will cease to exist. That said, Mr Trump's rhetoric seemed to suggest that he was prepared to take pre-emptive action if North Korea gets closer to an actual nuclear deterrent. But any use of force immediately places hundreds of thousands of South Koreans and Japanese citizens at risk. North Korea will almost certainly respond to a pre-emptive attack. Will North Korea nuclear threat focus minds? Can the US defend itself against North Korea? N Korea: The possible solutions What is different about this cycle is the lack of a diplomatic process that could serve as a firebreak. Secretary of State Rex Tillersonsaid in a recent media briefingthat the United States is open to dialogue with North Korea, provided talks are about ending missile tests and giving up nuclear weapons. Pyongyang, even as it confronts new sanctions, is unlikely to agree to those conditions. While China welcomed Mr Tillerson's gesture, North Korea's young leader doesn't seem to care what Beijing thinks. And the next move is his. The danger is that at some point, the over-heated rhetoric creates an action-reaction cycle without an obvious reverse gear. They fire a missile. We slap on more sanctions. They promise revenge. We declare these threats intolerable. They fire another missile. Then what? This is where rhetoric meets strategy. But it's unclear if there is one behind Trump's fire and fury.

"The Pacific island of Guam is home to the US Air Force's Andersen air base North Korea has said it is considering carrying out missile strikes on the US Pacific territory of Guam. The North's official news agency said on Tuesday the plan involved firing medium-to-long-range rockets at Guam, where US strategic bombers are based. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, flying into Guam, said there was no imminent threat from North Korea. He also defended President Donald Trump, who on Tuesday threatened Pyongyang with ""fire and fury"". Mr Tillerson said that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un did not understand diplomatic language, and a strong message was needed that he would understand. ""I think the president just wanted to be clear to the North Korean regime that the US... will defend itself and its allies,"" he said. On Wednesday, Mr Trump tweeted that the US nuclear arsenal was ""more powerful than ever before"",but added,externalhe was hopeful ""we will never have to use this power"". The recent exchanges mark a sharp rise in rhetoric between Washington and Pyongyang, but China has urged calm. The North Korea crisis in 300 words Analysis: Where do we go after 'fire and fury'? 'Caught in the cross fire' - What's the mood on Guam right now? A foreign ministry statement quoted by Reuters called on all sides to avoid words or actions which might escalate the situation and to make greater efforts to resolve the issue via talks. The UN recently approved further economic sanctions on North Korea, which Pyongyang said were a ""violent violation of our sovereignty"", warning the US would ""pay a price"". This video can not be played President Trump threatened a response 'like the world has never seen' On Wednesday, the official KCNA news agency said North Korea was ""carefully examining the operational plan for making an enveloping fire at the areas around Guam"" using its domestically made medium-to-long-range Hwasong-12 missiles. What damage could N Korea do without nuclear weapons? Pyongyang releases Canadian pastor The news agency reported a military statement issued on Tuesday, which probably came in response to US military drills in Guam. However, there has been no indication that any attack on Guam by North Korea is imminent. In a message to the public,external, the governor of Guam Eddie Baza Calvo said there was currently ""no threat"" to the island and the Marianas archipelago, but that Guam was ""prepared for any eventuality"". North Korea's statement is the latest stage in a heating up of rhetoric and tension. Pyongyang,which has tested nuclear devices five times, launched two intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) in July, claiming it now had the ability to hit mainland US. Will North Korea nuclear threat focus minds? Can the US defend itself? Possible ways forward for the outside world On Tuesday, media reports in the US claimed the North had achieved its goal of making a nuclear warhead small enough to fit inside its missiles. This video can not be played North Korea's second intercontinental missile launched last month was ""seen from Japan"" While not confirmed, this was seen as one of the last obstacles to North Korea being a fully nuclear-armed state. A report in theWashington Post,external, citing US intelligence officials, suggested North Korea was developing nuclear weapons capable of hitting the US at a much faster rate than expected. A Japanese government defence white paper also said the weapons programme had ""advanced considerably"" and that North Korea possibly now had nuclear weapons. North Korea's missile programme explained In response, President Trump warned North Korea to stop threatening the US, saying they would be ""met with fire and fury like the world has never seen"". However, veteran US Senator John McCain was sceptical about Mr Trump's statement, saying he was""not sure that President Trump is ready to act"",external. On the streets of Seoul, barely 50km (30 miles) from the border with North Korea, the latest developments have drawn mixed reactions. Kim Seong-su, 62, said he thought Pyongyang was bluffing to preserve its regime and justify its nuclear programme. But others are more concerned. Yeon Eui-sook says she finds the situation scary. ""I hope everyone can live in peace. Kim Jong-un keeps doing this and making us worry,"" she said. Analysts say the language from Pyongyang always gets more aggressive in August, when the US and South Korea conduct joint military exercises. But this time - with a US president who also uses strong words - the confrontation is getting even fiercer than usual. North Korea had reacted angrily after the fresh sanctions were announced on Saturday by the UN, in an attempt to pressure it into giving up its nuclear ambitions. The sanctions aim to reduce North Korea's export revenues by a third. KCNA said North Korea would retaliate and make ""the US pay a price"" for drafting the new measures. It called the sanctions a ""violent violation of our sovereignty"", the news agency said. Meanwhile on Wednesday the UK Foreign Office said it would ""continue to work with the US and our international partners to maintain pressure on North Korea"". ""We have been consistently clear and forthright in our condemnation of North Korea's destabilising and illegal behaviour, including through support for UN Security Council resolutions to bring in sanctions that will limit North Korea's ability to pursue its nuclear weapons programme,"" a spokesman said. A spokesman for Germany's foreign ministry, quoted by AFP, said it was watching the situation ""with the greatest concern"" and called on all sides to use restraint. The 541sq km (209 sq miles) volcanic and coral island in the Pacific between the Philippines and Hawaii. It is a ""non-incorporated"" US territory, with a population of about 163,000. That means people born in Guam are US citizens, have an elected governor and House Representative, but cannot vote for a president in US national elections. US military bases cover about a quarter of the island. About 6,000 personnel are based there and there are plans to move in thousands more. It was a key US base in World War Two, and remains a vital staging post for US operations, giving access to potential flashpoints like theSouth China Sea,the Koreasand theTaiwan Straits.

"Police shot and wounded the driver of the BMW Police in France have shot, wounded and arrested a man after a dramatic car chase along a motorway in the north of the country following an attack on soldiers in a suburb of Paris. A bullet-holed BMW could be seen where police brought it to a halt. Earlier, six soldiers were wounded after a car was driven at them near their base in Levallois-Perret. The Paris prosecutor described the attack as ""attempted killings... in relation to a terrorist undertaking"". Reports say one policeman was injured during the arrest operation on the A16 motorway at the town of Marquise  near the port of Boulogne. The BMW is said to have hit at least one other vehicle during the chase and the police opened fire several times. The suspect is in his 30s. Three of the soldiers are now known to have been seriously wounded in the Paris attack.  All were taken to hospital, though none is in a life-threatening condition, Defence Minister Florence Parly said. The motivation for the attack is as yet not known, but France, which is contributing to the fight against so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, has frequently been the target of attacks by Islamist militants. A state of emergency in force since November 2015 includes highly visible patrols under Operation Sentinel, numbering some 7,000 troops. On 13 November 2015, 130 people were killed in a night of attacks in Paris, and more than 100 have been killed in jihadist attacks since. They include a string of assaults on the heavily armed security forces who now dot the streets of the capital - the last only four days ago. Wednesday's attack at about 08:15 local time (06:15 GMT) took place in a pedestrian zone near the soldier's base on the Place de Verdun in Levallois-Perret. Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said the car had been driven deliberately at the troops and the attack had been carried out by a ""man on his own"". It was driven slowly until it came within 5m (16ft) of the patrol before accelerating towards them, he said. The alleged attacker is said to have been waiting in his BMW car outside the military barracks The local mayor, Patrick Balkany, told BFMTV a vehicle had been waiting in the road for the soldiers to emerge as they came on duty. ""It was a BMW which accelerated very quickly the moment they came out."" A resident in a nearby block of flats, Jean-Claude Veillant, told reporters he had seen the immediate aftermath of the attack. ""I heard a loud noise, the sound of scraping metal. Shortly after, I saw one of the badly wounded lying in front of the Vigipirate [army patrol] vehicle and another one behind it receiving treatment,"" he said. Last Saturday, a young mantried to force his way into the Eiffel Tower with a knife, shouting ""Allahu Akbar"" (""God is greatest""). A source said he told investigators he wanted to kill a soldier In June, police shot a man whoattacked an officer with a hammer outside the Notre-Dame cathedralin Paris In April, an attackershot dead a policeman on the Champs-Elysees.

"Home Secretary Amber Rudd and Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick have written articles for the Times declaring their support for an increase in stop-and-search checks by the police to tackle rising knife crime and acid attacks. Ms Rudd is walking a political tightrope,the paper says,external, as she cannot be seen to criticise reforms by her predecessor, Theresa May, under which the number of checks fell from more than one million to under 400,000. Mrs May had raised concerns that black youths were being singled out. In her article, Ms Rudd says officers who use the tactic appropriately will receive her backing. TheDaily Mirror,externalhas a double-page spread recalling the events of the credit crunch 10 years ago. A decade on, it says, millions of ordinary people are still paying the price as the crisis triggered a brutal wave of austerity which is still wreaking havoc. ""Yet in all that time,"" says the Mirror, ""no senior banker has been prosecuted for their wrongdoing. ""To see the disgraced figures who caused it all now living the high life as they count their vast pension pots will stick in the craw for millions of Brits whose wages have still not returned to their pre-crash levels."" A cabinet minister, who apparently wishes to remain anonymous, has told theDaily Telegraph that stamp duty must be reformed,externalas it is exacerbating the housing crisis, stopping older homeowners from downsizing. The paper says the intervention follows a report from academics suggesting the tax reduces the rate of house moves by a third, creating a mismatch in the market. Prof Christian Hilber, of the London School of Economics, tells the paper the key message from the research is that stamp duty hampers mobility significantly. ""End stamp duty and unleash the economy,""demands the Telegraph in an editorial,external. It is a problem not just for the elderly wanting to downsize, says the Telegraph, but for families looking for a larger home. Countless families are stuck in homes that no longer meet their needs, it adds. According to the Daily Mail,external, migrants have made 30,000 attempts to reach Britain from Calais this year, despite costly security measures.

"Google has fired an employee who wrote a controversial memo opposed to diversity programmes and hiring practices. The company's chief executive said the ""offensive"" text advanced ""harmful gender stereotypes"". Did Google do the right thing? A senior Google employee, named in US media as James Damore, argued in an internal memo that perhaps tech companies that try diversity programmes to get more women in to the industry are looking at things the wrong way. It's not just because of recruitment practices or education or discrimination that more men than women work in the tech industry, he argued, but because of biological differences. Women are ""on average more interested in people"" as opposed to things, he said, ""more co-operative"" and ""more prone to anxiety"" - all things that stop them going in to the tech industry or rising to the top of it. And he said this couldn't usually be said by people who worked for Google, because of an ""ideological echo chamber"" and a ""shaming culture and the possibility of being fired"". You can read the full memohere,external. After the memo received a few days of international attention,Mr Damore was fired. He is reported to be considering legal action. The memo and now his sacking have been much discussed on social media, with some agreeing with him, some offering him jobs, and others aghast at his views. ""I think it's wrong for a company to fire someone for simply expressing their opinion,"" said Jodie Ginsberg of the Index on Censorship pressure group. Asked whether Mr Damore being fired was censorship, she said yes. ""Yes, in that the message it's sending is that people are not free to express their beliefs and opinions. The message is we should just shut down the views with which we disagree. ""A much better way is to discuss those opinions openly."" Geoffrey Miller, an evolutionary psychologist at the University of New Mexico, said Google had gone down in his estimation when it fired Mr Damore. ""It was reasonable of this author to expect that his argument would be respected, that he would be able to air it with some safety,"" he said. ""It's just embarrassing for Google,"" he continued. ""I used to think Google was one of the coolest companies on earth. I use a lot of their software of all kinds and now I just feel like I'm supporting this ideological juggernaut. ""If the reaction to being told that you are an ideological echo chamber is that kind of defensiveness to me it's pretty strong evidence that it probably is biased."" On the other hand, says technology writer and broadcaster Kate Bevan, the memo created a hostile environment for female staff. ""I'm not very keen on the mob going for people to get the sack,"" she said. ""But in this case he was acting in a way that was detrimental to his colleagues. ""If you stand up and declare in public that you think a large number of your colleagues are unfit to do the job because of their chromosomes, you're telling your colleagues 'I don't think you're good enough'."" That echoes the argument made by Google's CEO Sundar Pichai in a letter to staff: ""To suggest a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited to that work is offensive and not OK."" Does Silicon Valley have a sexism problem? The women challenging sexism in e-sports Ms Bevan continued: ""The best engineers are not necessarily male. If you continue to restrict your hiring pool to one type of people you're going to get some mediocre people in there."" She argued that a more diverse workplace would be better for business, too, saying: ""If you've got a limited workforce you're going to limit the products you make."" Geoffrey Miller, the evolutionary psychologist, told the BBC that Mr Damore got ""most of the science right"" and showed ""pretty good judgment about what we know and what we don't know"". Hewrote,externalthat the memo ""would get at least an A- in any Masters psychology course"". But Gina Rippon, the chair of cognitive brain imaging at Aston University in Birmingham, England, disagreed. She told the BBC: ""The key thing for me is that he's got quite a lot of the science wrong. ""The basis of his argument is wrong. I don't know who he's been reading."" In fact the author of a study mentioned in the memohas responded,externalto the furore, saying that using someone's sex to work out what you think their personality will be like is ""like surgically operating with an axe"". Professor Rippon said: ""It's one of those areas where science moves on perhaps more quickly than the communication of it. ""He seems to be suggesting that because something is biological it can't be changed."" She said ability at spatial tasks - often cited as a way in which men and women's brains work differently - can be affected by how many videogames the people being studied have played. And playing more videogames or getting a different environment can influence an individual's brain. Is my brain male or female? Do men and women really have different personalities? She continued: ""But even if you accepted the idea that there are some biological differences, all researchers would assert that they're so tiny that there's no way that they can explain the kind of gender gap that's apparent at Google."" Just20% of Google's technical roles,externalare filled by women, according to the company's own figures. Nearly half of non-technical staff are female. Angela Saini, author of Inferior: How Science got Women Wrong, agreed: ""The differences aren't as big as we think they are and the gender gap as it exists in society is not explained by biological differences."" But the fact remains that there are many more men than women working in tech companies like Google. And a2016 study,externalof women in Silicon Valley found that half of the women asked had repeatedly been told they were too aggressive, and nearly half had been asked to do low-level jobs their male colleagues weren't asked to do, like taking notes or ordering food.

"An extra 500 medical school places in England have been confirmed for next year by the government. The Department of Healthannounced in October it planned to add up to 1,500 more places,externaleach year - a boost of 25% on current student doctor numbers - and says it will hit that target by 2020. It is part of a plan to use UK-trained doctors to ease NHS staffing pressures. But the British Medical Association says the plan will not address the immediate shortage of medics. Training to become a doctor takes at least five years and currently about 6,000 graduate each year. The government wants many of the new training places to go to students from disadvantaged backgrounds to improve diversity in the medical profession. Medical schools will be able to bid to run some of the extra course places. Those that can demonstrate they are targeting under-represented social groups, such as poorer students, will be favoured, as will those covering regions that struggle to attract trainee medics - rural areas and costal towns, for example. The extra training places in England will ultimately mean 7,500 home-grown doctors should graduate each year. Currently, about a quarter of doctors working in the NHS trained outside the UK. There are concerns that the impact of Brexit and a global shortage of doctors could make it harder to recruit as many in the future. Some UK-trained medics are also leaving the country to work elsewhere. Harrison Carter from the BMA said: ""The students who will benefit from these new placements will take at least 10 years to train and become senior doctors so we mustn't forget this promise won't tackle the immediate shortage of doctors in the NHS which could become more acute following Brexit. ""As such, we require equal focus on retaining existing doctors in high-quality jobs which will provide more immediate relief to an overstretched medical workforce."" Health Minister Philip Dunne said: ""We're committed to giving more talented students the chance to be part of our world-class NHS workforce. ""Not only is this the biggest ever expansion to the number of doctor training places, but it's also one of the most inclusive; ensuring everyone has the chance to study medicine regardless of their background, and ensuring the NHS is equipped for the future with doctors serving in the areas that need them the most."" Prof Wendy Reid, from Health Education England, said the extra places would help the NHS meet the diverse healthcare needs of patients ""up and down the country"". Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: ""Ministers have repeatedly announced plans to increase doctors' training levels and in many key medical specialities they are failing to fill the places already on offer. ""The government need to get a grip and put in place a long-term workforce plan backed up with significant new investment for the number of staff needed to deliver services safely.""

"Glen Campbell was one of the most successful country singers of his generation. In a career spanning six decades, he released more than 70 albums and amassed nine Grammy awards. His melodic songs found success in the pop charts with hits including Galveston, Rhinestone Cowboy and Wichita Lineman. And he also made a foray into acting, notably alongside John Wayne in the film True Grit. Glen Travis Campbell was born in Pike County, Arkansas, on 22 April 1936, the seventh of 12 children. His father was a sharecropper, a tenant who paid his rent with a proportion of the crops that he grew. His first guitar cost $7 from a Sears catalogue and he whiled away the time teaching himself to play. By the mid 1960s he'd established himself as a solo artist ""We didn't have power in the house, but we did have an old battery radio. And whenever I heard a new song, usually on a local country station, I'd learn it."" His proficiency led to an offer to join a band fronted by his uncle, Dick Bills and the Sandia Mountain Boys. There were appearances on local radio and a spot on a children's TV channel. Campbell moved to Los Angeles in 1960 and  became a member of a group of musicians named The Wrecking Crew, who backed artists such as Dean Martin, Nat King Cole and Frank Sinatra. His first solo chart entry, Turn Round and Look at Me, reached 62 in the Billboard Hot 100 in 1961. He also played a pivotal role in the producer Phil Spector's famous Wall of Sound technique. ""When I met Phil, he was knocked out by my playing,"" Campbell later recalled. ""He was like a child with a new toy."" For three months in 1965 he toured with the Beach Boys, filling in for singer Brian Wilson, who had experienced a breakdown. John Wayne invited him to star in True Grit His big break came in 1967 with the Jimmy Webb song By the Time I Get to Phoenix, which reached number two in the US Country charts. Campbell's partnership with Webb was to be a fruitful one, as hit followed hit. Wichita Lineman went to No 1 in the US and also broke him in Britain where it reached the Top 10 in 1968. ""Jimmy used to write in the studio as I was recording,"" said Campbell. ""When he sang me the parts of Wichita Lineman he'd written, I knew it was a hit."" The song collected a Grammy and became much requested by US soldiers fighting in Vietnam. He followed it up with Galveston a year later, which again charted on both sides of the Atlantic. In January 1969 he started hosting his own primetime TV show, The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour. The show, which ran for three years, made him a huge star and his fame encouraged a glittering roster of stars to appear with him. His primetime TV show attracted stars like Johnny Cash Johnny Cash, Roger Miller, Willie Nelson and the Monkees were among the artists who were guests on the show. He was also invited by John Wayne, a long time Campbell admirer, to appear in the Western True Grit. He won a Grammy for his performance of the film's title song. His biggest hit came in 1975 with Rhinestone Cowboy, which reached the Top 10 in a number of countries, including the UK. It coincided with a series of shows on BBC television There was another smash in 1977, - Southern Nights - but both his career and personal life began to slide. He divorced his second wife in 1975 but a subsequent marriage lasted just four years. While country aficionados continued to buy his records, his mainstream audience had begun to desert him. He turned to alcohol and drugs for solace. ""I was fine when I was doing session work. My schedule then would have killed a horse, so there was no time for drugs,"" he later said. ""But later on, I didn't have any stability. After a couple of failed marriages, it became a bit of a habit."" He had a huge fanbase in the UK His short but high profile relationship with 21-year-old country star Tanya Tucker, 25 years his junior, provided much fodder for the gossip magazines. His salvation came when he met and married Kim Woolen in 1982 and turned to God. ""I got down on my knees and prayed. And, eventually, I got rid of those demons."" Apart from a brief lapse in 2003, when he was jailed for drink-driving, he stayed off the booze and the drugs. In 2005 he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. Throughout this period, he continued to play and record and released covers of songs by artists as diverse as U2 and Green Day. In 2011 Campbell announced he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and set off on a farewell tour that included an emotional goodbye at the Grammy Awards in February 2012. ""I've accomplished everything I wanted to do,"" he said in a 2012 interview.  ""I've been blessed. When I think back to where I came from, I have been able to do some amazing things in my life. And music will always be part of my life.""

"Organisers behind a white nationalist rally in Virginia are outraged after home-sharing company Airbnb kicked off users affiliated with the event. Airbnb confirmed it was quietly cancelling accounts of those travelling to Charlottesville to attend the ""Unite the Right"" rally on Saturday. The company cited its discrimination policy, but users decried the move as a violation of free speech. The row marks the latest flashpoint in a debate over rights to free speech. Members of the so-called alt-right movement, which includes groups accused of racism and anti-Semitism, are expected to descend on Charlottesville on Saturday for the ""Unite the Right"" rally, to protest against the city's removal of a Confederate General Robert E Lee statue. The event was scheduled to take place at a park that was also the locale of a raucous Ku Klux Klan rally in May. The park, formerly Lee Park, was renamed as Emancipation Park in June. Speakers at the event include Richard Spencer, a leader of the alt-right movement, while members of the National Socialist Movement, the Traditionalist Workers Party and the neo-Nazi Daily Stormer website have said they will attend. The rise of the alt-right Trump's shock troops The Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors hate groups,said the event,externalcould be ""the largest hate-gathering of its kind in decades in the United States"". However, it is unclear how many people the event is expected to attract. NBC29 reported that the event permit to host the event was for 400 people, butthe Washington Post,externalreports police are preparing for as many as 4,000 attendees. This video can not be played White supremacist Richard Spencer: 'Donald Trump's arrow is pointing in our direction.' Airbnb said it began removing accounts affiliated with the event after a user reported a thread of comments suggesting company properties would be used for after-parties for the neo-Nazi website, Daily Stormer. The company issued a statement noting that it had established an Airbnb ""Community Commitment"" policy in 2016, which asked members to sign a pledge to ""accept people regardless of their race, religion, national origin, ethnicity, disability, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation or age"". The policy was created after the online accommodation sitefaced criticism over anecdotal evidencethat black users routinely found it more difficult to book a room than white individuals. AirBnB racism claim: African-Americans 'less likely to get rooms' The anti-discrimination agreement was directed at Airbnb hosts, but the latest move appeared to be the first time the company targeted guests. The move caused a social media uproar, in which Twitter and 4chan users began posting Airbnb messages to banned users, noting the decision was ""irreversible and will affect any duplicated or future accounts"". ""People shouldn't just #boycottairbnb they should sue @airbnb"",one user wrote.,external In a statement to the BBC, rally organiser Jason Kessler called the move ""outrageous"" and said it ""should be grounds for a lawsuit"". ""It is the racial targeting of white people for their ethnic advocacy. The Unite the Right rally is opposed to the historical and demographic displacement of white people. Would Airbnb cancel the service of black nationalists or Black Lives Matter activists for their social media activity? Of course not!"" Airbnb argues that while it respects the right to freedom of expression, people have a moral responsibility to take action when facing extreme hatred. The company cites its ""Community Commitment"", or pledge to treat all people equally, in terminating accounts ahead of Saturday's march. Mr Kessler argues the company's anti-discrimination policy was intended to keep renters from ""denying service to individuals based on race, religion or other identity characteristics"". ""They have now unjustly expanded that policy to imply that they will search through your social media accounts looking for controversial opinions and deny service based on that,"" he said. The debate recalls a case appearing before the US Supreme Court in October, in which a Colorado baker with religious objection to same-sex marriage lost a discrimination lawsuit for refusing to create a cake for a gay couple. The case is a touchstone for longstanding culture wars over same-sex marriage, religious freedom and the First Amendment right to free speech. Though anti-discrimination laws offer protections to the LGBTQ community in 21 states and the District of Columbia, no federal law requires bars private businesses from refusing to serve customers based on sexual orientation. As a private business, Airbnb may be entitled to those same freedoms. In aninterview with the BBC last year, Airbnb co-founder Brian Chesky said: ""We made a decision that this is not a service for everybody. We said 'take it somewhere else. Not Airbnb. ""We started this company with the belief people are fundamentally good. Mostly everyone is really good, but when you have 100 million people, there are some who don't believe in what you believe in."" While it is unclear how AirBnB screens its users for political beliefs, the company explicitly says it does conduct background checks on members by looking at public state and county criminal records as well as state and national sex offender registries on US-based users,according to its website,,external. It also checks the Office of Foreign Asset Control's list, which includes terrorist designations, and the company also uses approved background check providers. The company also said in a statement to the BBC it used ""background check processes"" and community input to identify users whose behaviour was ""antithetical to the Airbnb Community Commitment"". SomeTwitter users pointed out,externalthat many AirBnB accounts are linked to Facebook accounts, which could allow the company to track those who RSVPd to the rally or similar events.

"Home Secretary Amber Rudd and Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick have written articles for the Times declaring their support for an increase in stop-and-search checks by the police to tackle rising knife crime and acid attacks. Ms Rudd is walking a political tightrope,the paper says,external, as she cannot be seen to criticise reforms by her predecessor, Theresa May, under which the number of checks fell from more than one million to under 400,000. Mrs May had raised concerns that black youths were being singled out. In her article, Ms Rudd says officers who use the tactic appropriately will receive her backing. TheDaily Mirror,externalhas a double-page spread recalling the events of the credit crunch 10 years ago. A decade on, it says, millions of ordinary people are still paying the price as the crisis triggered a brutal wave of austerity which is still wreaking havoc. ""Yet in all that time,"" says the Mirror, ""no senior banker has been prosecuted for their wrongdoing. ""To see the disgraced figures who caused it all now living the high life as they count their vast pension pots will stick in the craw for millions of Brits whose wages have still not returned to their pre-crash levels."" A cabinet minister, who apparently wishes to remain anonymous, has told theDaily Telegraph that stamp duty must be reformed,externalas it is exacerbating the housing crisis, stopping older homeowners from downsizing. The paper says the intervention follows a report from academics suggesting the tax reduces the rate of house moves by a third, creating a mismatch in the market. Prof Christian Hilber, of the London School of Economics, tells the paper the key message from the research is that stamp duty hampers mobility significantly. ""End stamp duty and unleash the economy,""demands the Telegraph in an editorial,external. It is a problem not just for the elderly wanting to downsize, says the Telegraph, but for families looking for a larger home. Countless families are stuck in homes that no longer meet their needs, it adds. According to the Daily Mail,external, migrants have made 30,000 attempts to reach Britain from Calais this year, despite costly security measures. The French Interior Ministry logged more than 17,000 efforts to break into the fortified zone around the Channel tunnel, and asylum seekers also tried to stow away on UK-bound lorries more than 12,000 times. The Daily Express says its prediction,externalof a summer of migrant chaos has come true, with 115,000 people reaching the European mainland so far this year, Europe's strategies for dealing with the crisis are wrong, the paper believes, encouraging more people to risk the dangerous crossing from North Africa to southern Europe.

"Those who commit cruelty against animals ""are getting away with it"" due to the ""leniency"" of UK courts, according to a report. Of 13,862 people found guilty of animal cruelty in England and Wales from 2005 to 2015, more than 92% avoided prison, the Centre for Crime Prevention says. It has called for the maximum sentence for offenders to be increased from six months to five years. The government says it is reviewing the matter. Of those convicted or cautioned for animal cruelty during the period, 1,063 received a prison sentence. A third (34%) of them instead received a community service order, while a quarter (24%) were punished with a fine. Are we tough enough on animal cruelty? RSPCA reports rise in animal cruelty claims but fall in convictions Calls for Redcar brothers who abused dog to be jailed The report highlights the cases of a man from Lancashire,fined Â£270,externalfor putting his wife's cat in the tumble dryer, and a pair of brothers - Andrew and Daniel Frankish from Redcar, who were handed suspended sentences after filming themselvesattacking a bulldog. In another case, Jennifer Lampe from Shropshire was given a suspended sentence fordecapitating two pet snakesand trying to swallow their heads. These puppies were rescued from a farm in Solihull Puppy farmer Sean Kerr, from Solihull,was jailed for six months for causing unnecessary suffering to more than 30 dogs. Puppies lived on floors coated with faeces and their bedding was soaked with urine Peter Cuthbertson, director of the Centre for Crime Prevention, said: ""Animal lovers will be horrified to learn that animal cruelty is one of the many offences treated extremely leniently by our courts."" He called for ""serious, prolific criminals"" to be in prison. The current maximum sentence in England and Wales for animal cruelty is six months in prison - but this is the lowest in Europe, the report says. The recommendation that it should be increased to five years would bring it in line with Northern Ireland. The RSPCA has echoed this call. Its interim chief executive, Michael Ward, said: ""While the RSPCA is seeing unbelievably shocking and distressing cases go before the courts, only a tiny proportion of animal abusers actually receive an immediate custodial sentence."" The campaigners also called for the creation of a register of animal cruelty offenders - much like the sex offenders register - to better monitor repeat offenders. Responding to questions in the House of Commonson 20 July,external, the secretary of state for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Michael Gove, said: ""I am not someone who will automatically reach for stronger criminal sanctions as the only route to dealing with a problem. ""But there are particular cases of animal cruelty where we may well need to revisit the existing criminal sanctions in order to ensure that the very worst behaviour is dealt with using the full force of the law."" Ranil Jayawardena, MP for North East Hampshire, who contributed to the report, said: ""Deliberately causing pain, suffering or death to pets is wholly abhorrent.

"Oliver's heart condition causes his pulse to race dangerously fast The family of a baby boy who have been fundraising for him to have life-saving heart surgery in the US has been told the NHS will now fund his treatment. Doctors in Boston have agreed to operate on Oliver Cameron, who was born with a rare heart tumour, after his first birthday in January. Earlier,his parents warned time was running outto raise the Â£150,000 needed for his treatment. The NHS said it would pay because the procedure was not available in the UK. Lydia and Tim Cameron, from Wantage in Oxfordshire, have already raised Â£130,000 for the surgery to have Oliver's tumour removed. They have not indicated what they intend to do with the funds raised. Previously doctors advised that to maximise Oliver's ability to recover his parents should ideally wait until his first birthday but, if his condition worsened, he may require the operation immediately. A statement from NHS England said it had ""agreed to fund Oliver's treatment abroad"" because there was ""not currently a surgical service in the UK with experience of treating this exceptionally rare condition"". Oliver's condition - cardiac fibroma - is extremely rare and the number of patients with this type of tumour in England is estimated to be in single figures. He needs around-the-clock care to stabilise his heart rate and an implant under his skin sends readings back to specialists at Southampton General Hospital, where he has been receiving treatment since doctors in Oxford discovered the tumour. Specialists in Southampton said removing the tumour would be ""extremely high risk"" because there was limited experience in treating his condition in the UK so they had decided to support his parents' bid to find treatment elsewhere. The NHS said it was also discussing whether a UK surgeon might accompany Oliver to Boston to learn from the surgeons in the US so the innovative surgery could ""potentially be offered in the UK in future"".

"The proposed free trade deal between the EU and Japan has been described as a ""cars for cheese"" deal Ahead of its exit from the European Union, the UK is currently negotiating to secure free trade agreements with several countries, but what does this kind of deal actually mean? When two countries agree to a free trade agreement, that does not normally mean the complete free movement of goods and services between their economies, with no taxes, quotas or barriers of any kind. If you think about it that is pretty obvious, for instance in agriculture countries have subsidies for farmers, environmental rules, food standards and a dozen other policies. To ensure free trade of agricultural products all those policies would have to be coordinated, if not exactly the same. The issue of chlorinated chicken is currently proving a sticking point between the US and the UK This is why the issue ofchlorinated chicken is suddenly in the headlines; we don't allow it, the Americans do. It is a barrier to free trade and if we cannot agree on a compromise then any free trade deal between the US and UK will not fully cover trade in chickens. The same can be said about  genetically-modified (GM) crops, where America thinks the EU approvals process is far too complicated. Economic arguments over free trade date back to the 19th Century And what about agricultural subsidies for farmers? You can be pretty sure farmers on both sides of any free trade deal will argue about whether the other side subsidises its farmers unfairly, well, until the cows come home. It is not just agriculture that is affected, removing tariffs on manufactured goods is normally considered the easy part of any trade deal, but what about chemical regulations, car safety and drug testing, to name just three examples? The reason that free trade deals involve years of talks, dozens of expert negotiators, and endless meetings on technical details is because such issues are very complicated and involve a host of issues. In the end they tend to come down to a trade off. The proposed free trade deal between the EU and Japan has, for example, been described as a ""cars for cheese"" deal. It's an over simplification, but the fact is a major part of the deal is that the EU will allow cars made in Japan to be sold in the EU more easily, and the Japanese will reduce tariffs on European cheeses (and other dairy products). That doesn't sound like much but it is important. Many Japanese carmakers have plants in Europe precisely because it used to be difficult for them to sell Japanese built cars there, as they had to pay a 10% tariff. Meanwhile, the Japanese government has had some of the highest agricultural subsides, tariffs and other barriers, because it has long sought to protect its inefficient farmers. Both sides will win easier access to each others markets, but it is still not totally free trade. For instance some cheeses will be covered by quotas (a limit on how much can be exported to Japan), and car tariffs will take years to totally come down. Free trade has been a cornerstone of the post-war world More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: Is time up for plain vanilla flavour ice creams? What makes this Kate Spade bag unusual? Where's hot? This summer's most popular holiday spots Read more global trade series here. Also non-tariff barriers are still an important factor in limiting trade. So Japan and the UK, for instance, have different legal systems, educational qualifications, insurance rules, banking regulation and a thousand other differences. As you will have spotted, many of the differences are not to do with manufactured goods, which can be relatively easy to sell in other markets and changed if necessary to comply with local rules, but they do hinder free trade in services. Financial services such as share trading often take place across borders In the UK services make up 80% of the economy so agreeing a free trade deal on services is very important. It is however rather difficult for it to be total. British lawyers are just not going to be allowed to work in Brazilian courts if they haven't passed local exams and speak Portuguese, for example. Things such as insurance contracts have to abide by local laws and rules, while British plumbers may not get much work in China if their qualifications are not recognised. But on top of that there are nearly always politically important sectors which can lobby national governments to continue to protect them. India has protections in place to safeguard small retailers from overseas competitors India's army of small retailers are well protected by politicians from foreign competition, or governments can demand the politically impossible. As part of a future free trade deal, India would probably want the UK to open up immigration from India especially for students; something the government is unlikely to do as reducing immigration is one of its principle post Brexit policies. It all means that free trade agreements do not necessarily cover everything. Also although many economists believe such agreements encourage and increase trade between countries, improve efficiency and investment and help economies grow; others think they have serious downsides including driving out smaller local companies, reducing tax revenue and undercutting working conditions. Whoever is right free trade agreements do not do what they say on the tin. They do not make all trade free and frictionless; maybe they should be called ""freer trade agreements""?

"Denmark is not participating in the 2015 EU solidarity plan, which hopes to settle 160,000 Syrian and Eritrean refugees across the continent A new project in Denmark aims to help refugees start their own businesses, challenging the perspective, held by some, that they are a burden. But not everyone in the country is happy about the move. I got to visit Noura Bittar at her home only after I promised to ignore the mess. She is a proud woman, and, in fact, her small flat in Copenhagen seemed pretty tidy, given that she runs a catering business from here, while also looking after a new-born baby. And yet, it was easy to understand Noura's need to retain a sense of dignity. She fled to Denmark from the civil war in Syria, and is troubled by the way people often perceive those classed as ""refugees"". ""You have that stereotypingâ¦ that we came here to take their jobs and money. And I just want to say, 'No, that's not us.'"" Noura set out to dispel that image, despite still reeling from the fighting back in her home town of Homs, where friends were killed and close family members injured. Noura Bittar teaches cooking to Danish women who have been victims of domestic abuse She set up a catering business, hoping it would introduce more Danes to the cuisine of her homeland, while making her financially self-sufficient in the process. But even while she was building up the company, and not yet turning a profit, Noura began offering free cookery classes to Danish women who had been victims of rape or domestic abuse. ""Danish society gave us security. It gave us a place to stay. I wanted to say thank you."" Such gratitude is not always reciprocated. Opinion polls have shown a marked increase in the proportion of Danish people who want to stop refugees coming to their country. This antipathy has become particularly pronounced since 2015, when more than 20,000 people registered in Denmark as asylum seekers. Danish television screens were filled with images of bedraggled people dragging their worldly possessions along the motorway. Many had crossed the border from Germany, reckoning Scandinavia was a better bet for resettlement. Watching this development was a young academic researcher, Conor Clancy. Conor Clancy came up with the idea of the entrepreneurship project Mr Clancy is something of an ""immigrant"" to Denmark himself, born to an Irish father and an English mother. He was doing a master's thesis on management and entrepreneurship, and came up with an idea that was, to say the least, going against the grain. He thought the new refugee arrivals should be seen as a resource, not a burden. ""Our research showed that when they're in the camps, [refugees] show a lot of entrepreneurial attributes,"" he says. ""They come with passion and drive."" Mr Clancy formedRefugee Entrepreneurs Denmark,external, which helps new arrivals such as Noura to start their own business, supporting them with information, advice and general encouragement. He hopes this will enable refugees to become independent, no longer the ""burden"" some Danes seem to fear. And, more ambitiously, he believes these businesses will eventually create jobs that employ local Danes. ""This will put more tax into the system,"" he says, ""but also help break down the wall between refugees and their host nation."" Yet those walls are high, with many refugees struggling to fit into Danish society, according to another would-be entrepreneur I met, Khalid Jesri. He also fled here from Syria, and says at first, it was challenging to perform even the most basic tasks, let alone run a business. Khalid Jesri has produced a number of videos to show refugees basic tasks, in this case, how to ""touch in"" and ""touch out"" at a train station ""Refugees don't know how to take out the garbage, or how to pay bills,"" he says. Khalid's solution was to create his own start-up, producing online information for refugees. With text and videos, his website teaches them how to navigate the contours of Danish society, including lessons about language and social etiquette, as well as practicalities, such as how to buy a train ticket. Like Noura, his own traumas are still raw. Khalid took seven months to reach Denmark from Syria, seeing fellow asylum seekers drown at sea along the way. And once again, at the heart of his project is a hope that refugees can become self-sufficient, or, better still, net contributors to the Danish economy. ""In Syria, we are accustomed to hard work,"" he says. ""We are not used to asking for any kind of support."" Martin Henriksen believes refugees are already getting too much support. An MP for the nationalist Danish People's Party, he took me for a stroll round the Norrebro area of Copenhagen, where many refugees have settled. ""A lot of people here have a different cultural background, religious background - they speak another language,"" he says, pointing out the number of homes with drawn curtains. He takes this as symbolic of separate lives that some foreign-born residents lead. Danish MP Martin Henriksen is critical of the idea of using refugees as a resource The DPP came second in the last Danish election, on a platform of opposing immigration and the granting of asylum. Mr Henriksen rejects the idea that refugees can be a resource. ""The majority don't have the will,"" he says. Asked what he thinks of the Refugee Entrepreneur project, Mr Henriksen laughs and says he would not ban such ""voluntary work"". But he insists the refugees represent a problem, not a potential source of economic growth. The Danish parliament will re-convene this autumn, at which point the DPP will put forward a motion to stop any new refugees from coming to the country. But Noura and Khalid seem undeterred, with plans to expand their businesses. Khalid in particular hopes his website might one day have versions in other countries where refugees have settled, giving them their own online learning tools to help them become net contributors in their adopted host nations too.
