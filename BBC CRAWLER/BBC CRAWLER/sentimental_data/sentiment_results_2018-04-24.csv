"Lumley said 'it felt right to wear black... in support of MeToo' Joanna Lumley says she is ""terrified that all men are seen as bad"" in the wake of theHollywood sex scandal. The actress told Good Housekeeping magazine: ""This year I do feel the spirit of the suffragettes is with us and we're speaking out about women being treated badly around the world. ""That said, I am terrified that all men are seen as bad."" The Ab Fab actress added: ""We mustn't deride all men, as only the few are bad and we need to remember that, too."" Lumley (right) has enjoyed a long working relationship with Jennifer Saunders Lumley, 71, hosted the Bafta Film Awards earlier this year, which was dominated by the Time's Up and #MeToo movements. She said: ""I love and respect men. I am married to one, I work with some wonderful men and I have a son. But she added: ""Even though they [the stars] were dressed in black, they looked wonderful. ""It felt right to wear black at the time in support of MeToo. Anything that empowers women is to be supported."" Lumley, who was awarded the Bafta Fellowship last year, is best known for playing champagne-quaffing Patsy Stone in Absolutely Fabulous. She is also a well-known activist and charity campaigner. Lumley is going on a UK tour in the autumn She helped to secure the rights of Gurkhas who retired prior to 1997, to settle in the UK. She is also a patron of charities such as Trust in Children and Tree Aid, which fights poverty in Africa. Lumley told the magazine her mother was a ""very good role model"" for her campaigning work. ""She couldn't bear bullying and had an enormous sense of social justice. 'Do as you would be done by' was always her mantra...'Be reliable, don't be a thief or a snitch or a husband stealer', all those lessons were instilled into me as a child and to stand up to any form of wrongdoing and bullying."" The actress is embarking on her It's All About Me tour later this year, where she will be joined on stage by her friend and producer Clive Tulloh, who will put questions from the audience to her. ""Let's face it, I'm not getting any younger, so I want to do this before I lose my marbles and while I can still remember all the different parts of my life!""

"This video can not be played Albert Thompson: ""I was denied NHS cancer treatment"" Cancer patient Albert Thompson, the man who has been the focus of much of the Windrush row, has been given a date to start his treatment on the NHS. It comes after he was told last year he would have to pay Â£54,000 unless he could produce the right documentation. The Royal Marsden Hospital in London said the 63-year-old, who attended the hospital this week, would get his radiotherapy ""as an NHS patient"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had raised Mr Thompson's case in Parliament. Mr Corbyn brought up his situation at Prime Minister's Questions, first in March and again last week, when he accused Theresa May of declining to help him. The prime minister said the Home Office had been in contact with Mr Thompson's representatives, and said his NHS treatment should never have been withheld. Who are the Windrush generation? 'I'm an Englishman': Windrush stories Windrush citizenship fees and tests axed Some immigrants who came to the UK from the Commonwealth decades ago, the so-called Windrush generation, have been threatened with deportation or refused jobs or healthcare. Mr Thompson is not technically of the Windrush generation as he arrived in the UK from Jamaica in 1973 as a teenager. Buthis case was brought to light by the Guardian,externalafter he was told he would have to pay for prostate cancer treatment unless he could prove his right to remain in the UK. This video can not be played Theresa May says the Home Office has looked into his case and Albert Thompson will receive treatment for prostate cancer ""I was less than two weeks away from my treatment. That was really upsetting,"" Mr Thompson had told the BBC. ""I get to the Royal Marsden and they gave me this form to fill out where they want to see passport or visa, benefits letter and bank statement. ""At the end of the day, I don't have those things to show so I've got to pay Â£54,000, which I haven't got."" Laura Stahnke of Praxis, the immigration charity helping Mr Thompson, said it was delighted he was getting his treatment, but added ""it shouldn't have taken all this media attention, and his case being debated in Parliament for him to get there"". The Royal Marsden Hospital statement said: ""Mr Thompson has attended the Royal Marsden this week to plan the next stage of his treatment and has a date to start his radiotherapy. He is being treated as an NHS patient."" Home Secretary Amber Rudd, speaking in Parliament on Monday, said she would do all she could to ""right the wrongs"" that had been done to the Windrush generation and their families. She said UK citizenship fees and language tests will be waived and promised speedy compensation for anyone who had ""suffered loss"". Windrush row: I was denied cancer treatment.

"A new treatment for non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate, a very common condition in older men, has been recommended for use by the NHS. It's called prostate artery embolisation. And it blocks some of the blood supply to the prostate using tiny synthetic beads, causing the troublesome tissue to shrink and die. Officials say there is good evidence that the non-invasive treatment works. And it can spare men surgery and side-effects, such as impotence. More than a third of men over the age of 50 have an enlarged prostate, which can make if difficult for them to pass urine. Drugs or an operation can help, but the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence says men should now be offered another treatment option. PAE can be done under local anaesthetic as a day case, meaning patients can go home shortly afterwards without having to be admitted to hospital, unlike conventional prostate surgery. Doctors pass a small tube into an artery in the groin that can be guided into the small blood vessels of the prostate. This video can not be played John Scrafton says the treatment has changed his life ""completely"" About 20 centres in the UK have already been offering the treatment as part of a trial. Dr Nigel Hacking, consultant interventional radiologist at University Hospital Southampton, said: ""It is a particularly good option for men who are not yet ready to undergo more invasive prostate surgery. Maintaining sexual function and fertility is one of its main strengths. ""I hope with NICE's recommendations released today, that more centres will be able to introduce PAE services in the not too distant future."" The NICE advice is for England, but Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland can choose to implement it too. In 2016, NICE also recommendedanother prostate treatment- a laser therapy that can vaporise the overgrown tissue. The prostate gland is part of a man's reproductive system, and its job is to make the fluid to carry and nurture sperm. An enlarged prostate - known as BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia) - is very common, particularly as men get older, and will not always need treating. Left untreated, it can get in the way of emptying the bladder, meaning you have to go to the toilet more often or need to strain to pass urine. In the long term, this could potentially cause other problems such as urine infections or damage to the bladder or kidneys.

"Campaigner Gina Martin said she is ""really positive"" a change in the law could make upskirting easier to prosecute A victim of so-called ""upskirting"" is ""really positive"" that a change in the law could be imminent. Gina Martin started campaigning to make upskirting illegal after police said they would not be able to charge a man who took a photo of her in public. Upskirting - secretly photographing underneath a skirt - is not a specific offence in England and Wales. Justice Secretary David Gauke said he was reviewing the current law to ""make sure it is fit for purpose"". In February a Freedom of Information request by the Press Association found there had been 11 charges related to the practice since 2015. It also revealed only 15 out of 44 police forces contacted held records. I was a victim of 'upskirting' - but I'm fighting back Call to make 'upskirting' an offence Ms Martin became a victim of upskirting in July last year at a concert in Hyde Park, London. A man took an intimate picture of her, but after she spoke to police at the event they said the picture was not graphic enough because she was wearing underwear. She said: ""It's a spectrum of assault and I think it's completely right that these people can go on to do worse things, but this in itself is terrible."" This video can not be played Gina Martin and Professor of Law Clare McGlynn discuss upskirt photography on Woman's Hour Last month Liberal Democrat MP Wera Hobhouse tabled a parliamentary bill to make upskirting illegal. Labour MP Gill Furness, who was among members to raise questions to the justice secretary in the Commons on Tuesday, said: ""It's a very upsetting thing to happen - it's a huge infringement of your privacy. ""This happens to very young girls - there's evidence there was a 10-year-old that police have recorded. ""It's really close to my heart that we need to establish that this behaviour is completely wrong."" This video can not be played ""He was laughing"": Three women tell the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire about their experience of upskirting Voyeurism only applies to filming actions taking place in private Outraging public decency usually requires someone to have witnessed the action but upskirting is often unobserved It may be only discovered later because footage ends up on the internet It also has to take place in public - some spaces like schools might not count as public Unlike other sexual offences, people don't have automatic right to anonymity Upskirting has been an offence in Scotland since 2010 when it was listed under the broadened definition of voyeurism From BBC Reality Check Mr Gauke said that people had been successfully prosecuted for upskirting by police using current laws against outraging public decency, or voyeurism. But he added he ""shared the outrage"" of people who were victims of ""this intrusive behaviour"" and ""my officials are reviewing the current law to make sure it is fit for purpose"". Ms Martin, whose petition for a change in the law has nearly reached 100,000 signatures, has been helped in the campaign by her lawyer Ryan Whelan. Ms Martin said she and Mr Whelan had a positive meeting with the government on Friday. ""I knew the law had a massive grey area and it needed to change, that was immediately obvious,"" the freelance writer said. ""The reaction has been amazingly positive from the government, and the team of MPs that we've been talking to are really excited about [a change in the law].""

"Some 300,000 people are in debt to illegal money lenders in the UK The government is stepping up its crackdown on illegal money lenders who target vulnerable people. The Treasury has earmarked Â£5.5m, up 16% on last year, to pay for investigations and prosecutions of ""nasty lenders"" and ""lowlife crooks"" as well as support for their victims. More than Â£100,000 already seized from loan sharks will also be spent on helping victims. Some 300,000 people are in debt to illegal money lenders in the UK. John Glen, economic secretary to the Treasury said: ""These nasty lenders are nothing more than lowlife crooks taking hard-earned cash from the pockets of the most vulnerable."" He said the government has increased its funding to tackle unlawful lenders and support those most vulnerable to their dodgy tactics. Loan sharks 'hang around the school gates' The cash will be provided to official Illegal Money Lending Teams, which investigate and prosecute illegal money lenders. Funds will also be spent to encourage those at risk of being targeted by loan sharks to join a credit union, helping them to access a safer form of finance and get their lives back on track. And for the first time in Northern Ireland a new education project will be created to raise awareness of the dangers of loan sharks and to support vulnerable communities. Many people don't realise initially that they've borrowed from a loan shark, charities say Tony Quigley, head of theEngland Illegal Money Lending Team,external, said: ""Loan sharks are a blight on society and prey on vulnerable people who struggle to make ends meet. ""These criminals use callous methods to enforce repayment and victims are often subjected to threats, intimidation and violence. We will not tolerate this sort of criminal activity in our country and loan sharks who are caught flouting the law will be pursued and prosecuted."" Peter Tutton of StepChange Debt Charity, said cracking down on the ""unconscionable activities"" of loan sharks was a very welcome step. ""But it needs to be accompanied by a twin-track focus on the high cost credit market more generally, to reduce the harm being experienced by vast numbers of households who are forced to borrow to make ends meet,"" he said. ""Now is the time for the government to explore creative, sustainable alternatives to meet the needs of financially vulnerable households."" Matt Barlow, chief executive of Christians Against Poverty, said: ""Many who borrow from a 'loan shark' don't realise that's what they've done. Often, it will feel like borrowing from a friend of a friend until the reality of that arrangement begins to hit home. ""Therefore, the shame added to threats of violence, can be a significant hurdle to reporting it and getting help. Hopefully, this extra funding will result in greater awareness as well as increased prosecutions.""

"Plastic particles end up in sea ice floating in the Arctic Record levels of microplastics have been found trapped inside sea ice floating in the Arctic. Ice cores gathered across the Arctic Ocean reveal microplastics at concentrations two to three times higher than previously recorded. As sea ice melts with climate change, the plastic will be released back into the water, with unknown effects on wildlife, say German scientists. Traces of 17 different types of plastic were found in frozen seawater. Microplastics are tiny plastic pieces under five millimetres long. They can be eaten by filter-feeding animals and passed up the food chain. A considerable amount of microplastic is released directly into the ocean by the gradual breakdown of larger pieces of plastic. But microplastics can also enter the sea from health and beauty products, washing synthetic textiles or abrasion of car tyres. Their ""plastic fingerprint"" suggests they were carried on ocean currents from thehuge garbage patchin the Pacific Ocean or arose locally due to pollution from shipping and fishing. If you have a question about plastics, you can emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external More than half of the microplastic particles within the ice were so small that they could easily be ingested by sea life, said Ilka Peeken of the Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven, Germany, who led the study. ""No one can say for certain how harmful these tiny plastic particles are for marine life, or ultimately also for human beings,"" she said. The ice cores were gathered from five regions throughout the Arctic Ocean in the spring of 2014 and summer of 2015. They were taken back to the laboratory, where they were analysed for their unique plastic ""fingerprint"". ""Using this approach, we also discovered plastic particles that were only 11 micrometres across,"" said co-researcher Gunnar Gerdts, also from the Alfred Wegener Institute. ""That's roughly one-sixth the diameter of a human hair, and also explains why we found concentrations of over 12,000 particles per litre of sea ice - which is two to three times higher than what we'd found in past measurements."" The ice cores were gathered during expeditions of the German ship Polarstern The researchers found a total of 17 different types of plastic in the sea ice, including packaging materials like polyethylene and polypropylene, but also paints, nylon, polyester, and cellulose acetate (used to make cigarette filters). They say the plastic found its way to the Arctic Ocean from the huge garbage patch in the Pacific Ocean or from ship's paint and fishing nets. ""These findings suggest that both the expanding shipping and fishing activities in the Arctic are leaving their mark,"" said Dr Peeken. ""The high microplastic concentrations in the sea ice can thus not only be attributed to sources outside the Arctic Ocean. Instead, they also point to local pollution in the Arctic."" The study confirms that sea ice traps large amounts of microplastics and transports them across the Arctic Ocean. The plastic particles will be released back into the ocean when the sea ice melts. ""As climate change will accelerate sea ice melting, more microplastics will be released from the sea ice and will enter the marine environment,"" said Dr Pennie Lindeque, lead plastics scientist at Plymouth Marine Laboratory, who was not part of the research team. The ice cores were analysed for traces of plastic Dr Jeremy Wilkinson, a sea ice physicist at the British Antarctic Survey, said the work, published inNature Communications,external, was a ""benchmark study"". ""Microplastic particles were found throughout all cores sampled,"" he said. ""It suggests that microplastics are now ubiquitous within the surface waters of the world's ocean.  Nowhere is immune."" And Dr Jason Holt of the National Oceanography Centre said we might expect plastic waste from some European countries to eventually end up in the Arctic, due to ocean circulation patterns. ""It is therefore vital to understand the transport and fate of plastic waste in the Arctic and how it impacts on the marine environment there, and what can be done to reduce this impact,"" he said. Plastic waste 'building up' in Arctic Warmer Arctic is the 'new normal' Microplastics threat to ocean giants Estimates suggest about eight million tonnes of plastic move from the land into the ocean every year, with some finding its way into remote areas, such as the Polar Regions and the deep ocean floor.

"A ""Berlin Wears Kippah"" rally is planned in the German capital on Wednesday The leader of Germany's Jewish community has advised Jews to avoid wearing traditional skullcaps (kippahs) following anti-Semitic attacks. Josef Schuster, the president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, told Berlin public radio that Jews should exercise caution in big cities. His comments come ahead of a ""Berlin Wears Kippah"" solidarity march in the German capital on Wednesday. Last week, two young men wearing kippahs were assaulted in the city. The attacker was filmed shouting anti-Semitic abuse. Jewish organisations in Germany have expressed alarm over a number of recent anti-Semitic insults and threats in schools. At the weekend, Chancellor Angela Merkel condemned what she described as ""another form of anti-Semitism"". She told Israel's Channel 10 TV network that aside from anti-Semitism by right-wing groups, similar threats were coming from some Muslim refugees in the country. Conductor protests in anti-Semitism row German fury at Holocaust memorial remark Berlin anti-Semitic attack caught on video ""Defiantly showing your colours would in principle be the right way to go [to tackle anti-Semitism],"" he said. ""Nevertheless, I would advise individual people against openly wearing a kippah in big German cities,"" Mr Schuster added. But he also stressed that if Germans refused to stand up to anti-Semitism ""our democracy would be at risk"". ""This is not only about anti-Semitism - it goes along with racism, it goes along with xenophobia. You need a clear stop sign here."" Mr Schuster's comments apparently contradict the position taken on the kippah issue by the Berlin-based Jewish Forum for Democracy and Against Anti-Semitism -the organisation which shared video of last week's attack on Facebook.,external This video can not be played Footage of last week's attack in the Prenzlauer Berg area of Berlin ""I used to always advise my Jewish friends and acquaintances not to wear a kippah so as not to show their Jewish identity. I changed my opinion,"" a spokesman said last week. ""We must take up this fight and be visible again in public."" Separately, the head of Germany's Central Council of Muslims condemned recent anti-Semitic attacks. ""Anti-Semitism, racism and hatred are great sins in Islam, therefore we will also never tolerate that,"" Aiman Mazyek told Germany's Rheinische Post newspaper. Germany's Jewish population has grown rapidly since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Before 1989, the population was below 30,000 but an influx of Jews, mainly from the former Soviet Union, has raised the number to more than 200,000.

"Sean Cox suffered a head injury A man left in a critical condition after he was attacked before Liverpool's Champions League semi-final against Roma has been named. Sean Cox, 53, of Dunboyne, County Meath in the Irish Republic is in hospital with a head injury. Liverpool FC said it was ""shocked and appalled"" by the incident. Two men from Rome, aged 20 and 29, have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. Seven others are being held for various offences at Tuesday's match. The attack happened outside The Albert pub in Walton Breck Road, next to Anfield stadium, shortly before kick-off. Mr Cox has been described as a ""long-serving"" and ""popular"" member of the St Peter's Gaelic football club in Dunboyne. This video can not be played Rival Liverpool and Roma fans clashed just before the kick-off outside Anfield Club chairman Fergus McNulty said: ""We hope Sean is receiving all of the medical care he requires and that he makes a full and speedy recovery. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with Sean and his family, and we hope that they get the privacy and space they need."" Liverpool footballer Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, 24, also sent a message of support to Mr Cox and his family. Tweeting,externalabout the knee injury he sustained during Tuesday's match which rules him out of England's World Cup squad, the midfielder said: ""This all pales in comparison to how the family of the Liverpool fan badly hurt before last night's game must be feeling.

"This video can not be played Trump and Macron's touching moments US President Donald Trump and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron have suggested there could be a new agreement on Iran's nuclear programme. After talks in the US, Mr Trump, who is sceptical of an accord that was struck in 2015, spoke about ""doing a much bigger, maybe, deal"". Mr Macron said a new pact must cover Iran's ballistic missile programme and its role in the Middle East. Iran warned of ""severe consequences"" if the US withdraws from the deal. In 2015, Iran agreed to mothball its nuclear programme in return for an easing of economic sanctions on Iran. The US president has been threatening to reject an extension of the Obama-era nuclear pact reached between Tehran and world powers by a 12 May deadline. Mr Macron had been lobbying Mr Trump to stick with the deal, saying there was no better option. What is the Iran nuclear deal? Could the Iran nuclear deal collapse? Oil at $75 as Iran sanction fears mount Trump-Macron bromance in the making? Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel is due to visit the US on Friday to make a last-minute bid to dissuade Mr Trump from potentially torpedoing the agreement. Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif was quoted as saying that Tehran would ""most likely"" abandon the accord if the US pulled out. ""I think we will have a great shot at doing a much bigger, maybe, deal,"" the US president said, adding that any new agreement must be built on ""solid foundations"". ""They should have made a deal that covered Yemen, that covered Syria, that covered other parts of the Middle East,"" said Mr Trump, referring to the 2015 accord which he described as ""insane"". This video can not be played What French people think about Trump and Macron meeting Meanwhile, Mr Macron agreed that Tehran's influence in the region must be part of negotiations. He also stressed that - as well as controlling Iran's nuclear programme for the next decade as envisaged by the current agreement - a fresh deal would need to cover its nuclear activities longer-term, as well as its ballistic missile programme. And he talked about working with President Trump to build a ""new framework"" in the Middle East - and especially in Syria. Mr Macron said he did not know whether Mr Trump would extend the 12 May deadline, adding: ""I can say that we have had very frank discussions on that, just the two of us."" Mr Trump earlier warned Iran against resuming its nuclear programme. ""They're not going to be restarting anything. They restart it they're going to have big problems, bigger than they've ever had before."" Analysis by the BBC's Barbara Plett Usher The visit was a strange mix. On the one hand, a display of stark differences - Mr Macron almost channelling an anti-Trump in his opening admonition to resist ""aggressive nationalism"" and ""build a new multilateralism."" On the other hand, an overt display of deliberate chumminess punctuated with tussling handshakes and capped by the very odd dandruff episode, where Mr Trump seemed to hover between playfulness and aggression. But whether or not the French president felt humiliated by the bout of unexpected grooming, he did manage to get Mr Trump's attention on the Iran nuclear accord. He framed his appeal to preserve the deal with the promise of a ""bigger, better"" one. In other words, build on the existing agreement to address its flaws, rather than scrap it and start fresh. Whether or not this is possible is an open question. But the suggestion was enough to intrigue Mr Trump. His tone changed, moving from a blistering harangue of the deal before the meeting to something more considered - although still noncommittal - afterwards. And that shows the influence of personal engagement with the president, from someone who - like Mr Macron - knows how to talk to him. On Monday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani threatened ""severe consequences"" if the US withdrew from the deal. Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif: ""You cannot stop the process or not engage just because of a fear of failure"" Meanwhile, Mr Zarif said just hours before the Trump-Macron summit that a probable response would be to restart the enrichment of uranium - a key bomb-making ingredient. ""You cannot stop the process or not engage just because of a fear of failure. But at least you need to have some hope of success, some prospect for success, in order for this process to start,"" the Iranian foreign minister was quoted as saying by Reuters. ""And I do not believe that, under the present circumstances, with the present tone, and language and approach of the current administration in Washington, you would have much prospect."" Iran maintains its nuclear programme is solely for peaceful civilian purposes. The US president has long complained that the accord - signed by the US, Iran, Europe, Russia, China and Germany - does nothing to halt Iran's support for militant groups in the region such as Hezbollah. Mr Trump is also demanding that signatories to the pact agree permanent restrictions on Iran's uranium enrichment. Iran nuclear deal: Key details Under the current deal they are set to expire in 2025. Mr Macron, on a three-day visit to the US, is the first foreign leader to be treated to a state visit during the Trump presidency. The White House State Dinner is the first of Donald Trump's presidency President Macron and his wife, Brigitte, attended a state dinner in their honour at the White House on Tuesday. Guests included former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and Apple chief executive Tim Cook. ""May our friendship grow even deeper, may our kinship grow even stronger, and may our sacred liberty never die,"" Mr Trump said in his toast. In response, Mr Macron spoke of ""how deep, how strong, and how intense the relationship is between our two countries"". ""I got to know you, you got to know me. We both know that none of us easily changes our minds, but we will work together, and we have this ability to listen to one another,"" he said. President Trump rolled out the red carpet for the French leader The Iran deal is not the only potential source of discord between the two leaders. Also on the agenda is the Paris climate accord, the US decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and planned US tariffs on EU steel and aluminium.

"A ""Berlin Wears Kippah"" rally is planned in the German capital on Wednesday The leader of Germany's Jewish community has advised Jews to avoid wearing traditional skullcaps (kippahs) following anti-Semitic attacks. Josef Schuster, the president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, told Berlin public radio that Jews should exercise caution in big cities. His comments come ahead of a ""Berlin Wears Kippah"" solidarity march in the German capital on Wednesday. Last week, two young men wearing kippahs were assaulted in the city. The attacker was filmed shouting anti-Semitic abuse. Jewish organisations in Germany have expressed alarm over a number of recent anti-Semitic insults and threats in schools. At the weekend, Chancellor Angela Merkel condemned what she described as ""another form of anti-Semitism"". She told Israel's Channel 10 TV network that aside from anti-Semitism by right-wing groups, similar threats were coming from some Muslim refugees in the country. Conductor protests in anti-Semitism row German fury at Holocaust memorial remark Berlin anti-Semitic attack caught on video ""Defiantly showing your colours would in principle be the right way to go [to tackle anti-Semitism],"" he said. ""Nevertheless, I would advise individual people against openly wearing a kippah in big German cities,"" Mr Schuster added. But he also stressed that if Germans refused to stand up to anti-Semitism ""our democracy would be at risk"". ""This is not only about anti-Semitism - it goes along with racism, it goes along with xenophobia. You need a clear stop sign here."" Mr Schuster's comments apparently contradict the position taken on the kippah issue by the Berlin-based Jewish Forum for Democracy and Against Anti-Semitism -the organisation which shared video of last week's attack on Facebook.,external This video can not be played Footage of last week's attack in the Prenzlauer Berg area of Berlin ""I used to always advise my Jewish friends and acquaintances not to wear a kippah so as not to show their Jewish identity. I changed my opinion,"" a spokesman said last week. ""We must take up this fight and be visible again in public."" Separately, the head of Germany's Central Council of Muslims condemned recent anti-Semitic attacks. ""Anti-Semitism, racism and hatred are great sins in Islam, therefore we will also never tolerate that,"" Aiman Mazyek told Germany's Rheinische Post newspaper. Germany's Jewish population has grown rapidly since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Before 1989, the population was below 30,000 but an influx of Jews, mainly from the former Soviet Union, has raised the number to more than 200,000.

"The Drax power station in North Yorkshire has been switching some furnaces from coal to biomass Britain has not generated electricity from coal for more than three days - the longest streak since the 1880s. The new record comes just days after the last record of 55 hours was set, National Grid said. The coal-free period began on Saturday at 1000 BST and has continued into Tuesday afternoon. Power generated from wind and gas dominated the mix of energy for users in England, Scotland and Wales. Just last week the UK grid recorded its first two-day period without using any power from the fossil fuel, which the government has pledged tophase out by 2025. UK's greenest year yet Coal plants to close by 2025 Coal accounted for less than 7% of the power mix last year, according to official figures. In April, 2017 Britain went itsfirst full day without coalsince the 19th century. A wind farm in mid-Wales However, experts warned that power generated by coal was largely being replaced by gas, another fossil fuel, rather than renewable sources. Andrew Crossland, of the Durham Energy Institute, said gas generated 40% of the UK's electricity and fuelled the vast majority of domestic heating: ""As a country we consume nearly eight times more gas than coal."" The daily consumption of gas wasoutstripped by wind on just two dayslast year, while all sources of renewable energy - including wind, solar, biomass and hydropower - beat fossil fuels for just 23 days of 2017. A reliance on gas made the UK vulnerable to the whims of international markets and was ""nowhere near clean enough"" to meet the UK's legal targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions, Mr Crossland said. The 2008 Climate Change Act requires greenhouse gas emissions to be reduced by 80% compared with 1990 levels by 2050. Hannah Martin, from Greenpeace UK, called on the government to provide more support for onshore wind and solar power - the ""cleanest and cheapest energy sources"". ""Offshore wind has proven to be popular and able to provide affordable clean energy, as well as skilled jobs and fair bills,"" she said. ""As we have more and more days without coal, we need to make sure it is replaced with the renewable technologies of the future."" Mr Crossland also called for more investment in renewable technologies, such as solar panels and batteries, to store power for homes and businesses, along with better energy efficiency to reduce power use.

"Creative director Alessandro Michele has made Gucci's clothes quirkier Surging demand for Gucci clothes and handbags boosted sales at parent company Kering in the first three months of the year. It follows a major revamp at Gucci - Kering's biggest brand - under creative director Alessandro Michele. Kering, which owns other marques like Yves Saint Laurent (YSL), also benefited from a recovery in spending by wealthy Chinese shoppers. Sales at the French groupjumped 27% to â¬3.1bn,external(Â£2.7bn) in the quarter. Gucci's revenue rocketed 37%, while YSL was up 12%. Alessandro Michele replaced Frida Giannini as creative director at Gucci in 2015, after several years of falling sales at the Italian label. He introduced more quirky, gender-neutral designs aimed at younger consumers and revamped Gucci's stores. The 97-year-old label has since returned to growth. The Kering division that includes Balenciaga and Alexander McQueen also saw double-digit expansion in the quarter. However, analysts warned the European luxury sector was still grappling with headwinds, including a strong euro - which impacts profits made abroad when they are converted back into the currency. They also fear brewing US-China trade tensions could risk dampening the resurgent Chinese demand. FranÃ§ois-Henri Pinault, Kering's chairman and chief executive, said: ""We face... a tough currency environment, but we are confident in the ability of our houses to continue doing better than their peers.""

"Plastic particles end up in sea ice floating in the Arctic Record levels of microplastics have been found trapped inside sea ice floating in the Arctic. Ice cores gathered across the Arctic Ocean reveal microplastics at concentrations two to three times higher than previously recorded. As sea ice melts with climate change, the plastic will be released back into the water, with unknown effects on wildlife, say German scientists. Traces of 17 different types of plastic were found in frozen seawater. Microplastics are tiny plastic pieces under five millimetres long. They can be eaten by filter-feeding animals and passed up the food chain. A considerable amount of microplastic is released directly into the ocean by the gradual breakdown of larger pieces of plastic. But microplastics can also enter the sea from health and beauty products, washing synthetic textiles or abrasion of car tyres. Their ""plastic fingerprint"" suggests they were carried on ocean currents from thehuge garbage patchin the Pacific Ocean or arose locally due to pollution from shipping and fishing. If you have a question about plastics, you can emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external More than half of the microplastic particles within the ice were so small that they could easily be ingested by sea life, said Ilka Peeken of the Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven, Germany, who led the study. ""No one can say for certain how harmful these tiny plastic particles are for marine life, or ultimately also for human beings,"" she said. The ice cores were gathered from five regions throughout the Arctic Ocean in the spring of 2014 and summer of 2015. They were taken back to the laboratory, where they were analysed for their unique plastic ""fingerprint"". ""Using this approach, we also discovered plastic particles that were only 11 micrometres across,"" said co-researcher Gunnar Gerdts, also from the Alfred Wegener Institute. ""That's roughly one-sixth the diameter of a human hair, and also explains why we found concentrations of over 12,000 particles per litre of sea ice - which is two to three times higher than what we'd found in past measurements."" The ice cores were gathered during expeditions of the German ship Polarstern The researchers found a total of 17 different types of plastic in the sea ice, including packaging materials like polyethylene and polypropylene, but also paints, nylon, polyester, and cellulose acetate (used to make cigarette filters). They say the plastic found its way to the Arctic Ocean from the huge garbage patch in the Pacific Ocean or from ship's paint and fishing nets. ""These findings suggest that both the expanding shipping and fishing activities in the Arctic are leaving their mark,"" said Dr Peeken. ""The high microplastic concentrations in the sea ice can thus not only be attributed to sources outside the Arctic Ocean. Instead, they also point to local pollution in the Arctic."" The study confirms that sea ice traps large amounts of microplastics and transports them across the Arctic Ocean. The plastic particles will be released back into the ocean when the sea ice melts. ""As climate change will accelerate sea ice melting, more microplastics will be released from the sea ice and will enter the marine environment,"" said Dr Pennie Lindeque, lead plastics scientist at Plymouth Marine Laboratory, who was not part of the research team. The ice cores were analysed for traces of plastic Dr Jeremy Wilkinson, a sea ice physicist at the British Antarctic Survey, said the work, published inNature Communications,external, was a ""benchmark study"". ""Microplastic particles were found throughout all cores sampled,"" he said. ""It suggests that microplastics are now ubiquitous within the surface waters of the world's ocean.  Nowhere is immune."" And Dr Jason Holt of the National Oceanography Centre said we might expect plastic waste from some European countries to eventually end up in the Arctic, due to ocean circulation patterns. ""It is therefore vital to understand the transport and fate of plastic waste in the Arctic and how it impacts on the marine environment there, and what can be done to reduce this impact,"" he said. Plastic waste 'building up' in Arctic Warmer Arctic is the 'new normal' Microplastics threat to ocean giants Estimates suggest about eight million tonnes of plastic move from the land into the ocean every year, with some finding its way into remote areas, such as the Polar Regions and the deep ocean floor.

"Theresa May's plan for a ""customs partnership"" with the EU after Brexit has been described as ""completely cretinous"" by Jacob Rees-Mogg. The leading Tory Brexiteer said it would be the same as staying in a customs union. He also accused the prime minister of lacking ""enthusiasm"" for Brexit at a think-tank event in Parliament. Mrs May has ruled out joining a customs union but has come up with two options to avoid a hard border in Ireland. Reality Check: The two customs options UK will leave customs union, insists No 10 One of them is a ""customs partnership"" that would rely on new technology to track the final destination of goods flowing across the border, removing the need for physical customs checks. This has previously been dismissed as ""magical thinking"" in Brussels but UK officials arereported by the Financial Times,externalto believe the mood has changed and they plan to raise it again next month. Mr Rees-Mogg said the ""completely cretinous"" idea would see the UK collect tariffs on the EU's behalf for goods landing in Britain but intended for the bloc's market, something Mr Rees-Mogg said would be ""impractical, bureaucratic"" and ""a betrayal of common sense"". The other option being proposed by the government would be to minimise checks rather than getting rid of them altogether, by using new technologies and things like trusted trader schemes. Speaking at the Open Europe event, Mr Rees-Mogg said Mrs May's attitude to Brexit was ""enigmatic"". ""She is carrying out the will of the British people but it's hard to read what level of enthusiasm she has for it,"" he said. The Conservative MP, who heads the influential European Research Group of Conservatives, also accused the House of Lords of ""playing with fire"" by attempting to ""thwart"" the result of the 2016 EU referendum. He said it was now a case of the ""peers against the people"" after the government's Brexit legislation suffered a series of defeats in the upper chamber. He was speaking as a petition calling for a referendum on abolishing the House of Lords passed the 100,000 signature mark, which could trigger a debate in Parliament. Mr Rees-Mogg said an immigration policy after Brexit that gave preferential treatment to EU nationals would be ""racist"" and ""quite wrong"" because, by and large, EU nationals are white. Responding to Mr Rees-Mogg's comments, Theresa May's official spokesman said that it was part of the Upper House's role to scrutinise legislation. But he added: ""We have been clear that we are disappointed with the decisions which have been taken by the House of Lords. ""We believe that the Withdrawal Bill was passed by the House of Commons and was passed in a way which would allow us to deliver the smooth Brexit which the country wants."" The government had already set out its plans in relation to House of Lords reform, said the spokesman. Asked whether he would agree that Mrs May had been ""enigmatic"" about her views of Brexit, the spokesman said: ""The prime minister has made absolutely clear her determination to deliver on the will of the British people, and that she believes that we can deliver Brexit in such a way that provides for Britain a stronger, more prosperous and more secure future.""

"This video can not be played ""I have a gun in my pocket"" â the moment Alek Minassian was arrested. A van driver accused of killing 10 people in Toronto posted to Facebook minutes before the attack to praise a woman-hating mass shooter. Alek Minassian - charged on Tuesday with 10 counts of murder and 13 counts of attempted murder - also referred to the misogynistic ""incel"" Reddit group. Police say the 25-year-old intentionally drove a rental van into pedestrians on a busy pavement. The suspect was arrested several streets away after a tense standoff with police. The 10 dead and 14 wounded are ""predominantly"" women, ranging in age from their 20s to their 80s, police say. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said it was a ""senseless attack and a horrific tragedy"". The suspect's Facebook post, which the social network has confirmed as real, praised Elliott Rodger, a 22-year-old from California who killed six people in a 2014shooting rampage through Isla Vista, California, before turning the gun on himself. It read: ""The Incel Rebellion has already begun! We will overthrow all the Chads and Stacys! All hail the Supreme Gentleman Elliot Rodger!"" The term ""incel"" refers to a now-banned group on the message site Reddit, used by Rodger, where young men discussed their lack of sexual activity, blaming women for the problem. ""Chads and Stacys"" refers to attractive men and women who are perceived as better than or unavailable to ""incels"", which is short for ""involuntary celibate"". Toronto van attack: What's an incel? He was brought to court on Tuesday to hear the charges against him. His head shaved and wearing a white jumpsuit, he held his hands behind his back, showing little emotion throughout. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He will remain in custody and return to court on 10 May for a bail hearing. He was ordered to make no contact with surviving victims. A man believed to be his relative sat in the front row of the courtroom and wept. Asked by reporters if he had anything to say, the man replied, ""Sorry"". Yonge Street, where the attack took place, remained closed on Tuesday as police continued their investigation. While the authorities have not yet formally identified any of the dead, three have been named in the media. Anne Marie D'Amico was ""full of life"", her colleague said Anne-Marie D'Amicoworked for the US investment company Invesco, Canadian broadcaster CBC reports. The company's Canadian headquarters are on Yonge Street. Toronto van attack victim 'full of life' The Jordanian embassy in Ottawa has told the BBC that one of its citizens was among the victims. Jordanian media named him asMunir Abdo Habib al-Najjar.He was reportedly in Canada to visit his son. Toronto residentDorothy Sewell,80, has also been named by relatives as one of the victims. Dorothy Sewell was a fan of the Toronto Blue Jays baseball team Her grandson, Elwood Delaney, said she was the ""best grandma anyone could have asked for"". The South Korean embassy in Canada confirmed to the BBC that two of its citizens were among the dead and another was critically ill. Their names have not been disclosed. The 15 injured remain in hospitals throughout Toronto. This video can not be played People gather the day after the attack to remember the victims From the northern Toronto suburb of Richmond Hill, he was not previously known to the authorities. There ""would appear to be no national security connections"", public safety minister Ralph Goodale said. He attended a school for students with special needs in north Toronto, former classmates say. He would be seen walking around Thornlea Secondary School with his head down and hands clasped tightly together making meowing noises, Shereen Chami told Reuters news agency. But she added that he had not been violent: ""He wasn't a social person, but from what I remember he was absolutely harmless."" He went on to attend Seneca College in the North York area of Toronto, where the van incident took place, CBC reports. The Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) has also confirmed he was a member for two months in late 2017 before asking to be voluntarily released.

"TSB's IT fiasco is heading for a fifth day, with angry customers still locked out of their accounts and unable to make payments. The bank said it would take down its mobile app and online banking ""for a few hours"" on Tuesday and hoped to restore services by the afternoon. But it now looks unlikely the issues will be resolved until Wednesday. Chief executive Paul Pester said he was ""deeply sorry"" for the chaos and that no one would be left out of pocket. The bank's data breach on Sunday, which allowed some TSB customers to see other people's account details, has also attracted the attention of the Information Commissioner. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Pester said: ""This isn't the level of service that we pride ourselves on providing, and isn't what our customers have come to expect from TSB, and for that I'm deeply sorry."" 'TSB gave me someone else's Â£35,000' People are beginning to report a wide range of financial problems caused by being unable to access their account online. Colin Patterson of Manchester told the BBC: ""The lack of an official statement, other than generic Twitter replies, is outrageous."" He's been trying to pay for his passport renewal for three days and reports that ""it keeps being rejected"". ""I get paid tomorrow and don't know if I'll be able to pay my rent. It's a disgrace."" Trevor Brittain from Tonbridge said: ""I've been with the same branch for 42 years. It was Lloyds but transferred to TSB at the sell-off. I will be switching back to Lloyds as soon as I can get access to my account."" Jessica Callaghan from Newcastle said: ""I'm angry because they aren't communicating. They just keep saying, 'sorry, it'll be back up shortly'. I want them to give an official statement about what is happening, and compensation for each customer."" Photographer Paul Clarke is worried the TSB problems will hit his business London photographer Paul Clarke is worried that his business will be hit if the situation isn't resolved soon. ""I have no idea who's paid me recently and I can't pay suppliers,"" he told the BBC. ""If we get to the middle of the week and it's still not resolved then my reputation and business could suffer as I work on a quick turnaround. It's a fiasco."" Amanda Verbaan-Dunn, owner of the Wilton Hotel in Blackpool, said: ""I'm away from home and can't pay my staff. I'm going to have to go back three days early so I can sort my staff out. It's extremely frustrating and the lack of communication is inexcusable."" Former Grange Hill star Lee MacDonald said his business ""has literally stopped"" Lee MacDonald, who played Zammo in children's TV show Grange Hill in the 1980s, told the BBC he has had an ""absolute nightmare"" following TSB's IT glitches. Mr MacDonald, who now runs Mentor Lock and Safe Company in Wallington, Surrey, told BBC Radio 5 live: ""I'm having an absolute nightmare.  I've got two accounts with TSB, both business accounts.  My business has literally stopped.  I don't know what money's coming in, what's coming out. ""When you're running a small business, every job counts and it's just a nightmare."" Roger Harris, a TSB customer who has been locked out of his account, was recently sent these letters by the bank When TSB split from the Lloyds Banking Group, it continued to rent a banking platform from its former owner while it developed its own ""state-of-the-art"" platform. That was ready to go live last weekend and TSB moved its customers' data from the Lloyds' platform to its own. This was a long-planned disruption to the service and the bank said it informed customers of the change and that it would lead to them being unable to use online banking or payment systems at the weekend. It promised that systems would be back up and running by 6pm on Sunday but many of those who did get access to their online accounts were presented with details of other people's accounts too. Since that data breach many customers have reported being unable to log on, while those that have been able to log on say there have been problems with passwords or that they have been logged out. The Financial Conduct Authority, which has the power to fine banks for system failures, said it was in ""regular contact"" with TSB. ""We are working with the firm to ensure customers are properly communicated with and are not left out of pocket."" ""We will be talking to the firm to understand exactly what went wrong and the steps that they are taking to ensure something like this does not happen again,"" a spokesperson said. The Information Commissioner's Office also said it was ""making enquiries"" about a ""potential data breach"". Nicky Morgan MP, chair of the Treasury Committee, weighed into the crisis on Tuesday by writing to TSB boss Paul Pester to find out what has gone wrong, the extent of the failure, and how the bank intends to compensate customers who have suffered a breach of potentially highly-sensitive personal data. Mrs Morgan said: ""It simply isn't good enough to expose customers to IT failures, including delays in paying bills and an inability to access their own money. ""Warm words and platitudes will not suffice. TSB customers deserve to know what has happened, when normal services will resume, and how they can expect to be compensated.""

"A meeting with Jeremy Corbyn to discuss anti-Semitism in the Labour Party was a ""disappointing, missed opportunity"", Jewish leaders have said. The Jewish Leadership Council and Board of Deputies of British Jews said the Labour leader did not agree to any of the concrete actions they asked for. They want disciplinary cases speeded up and Mr Corbyn to use his ""personal authority"" to drive cultural change. ""I am absolutely committed to rooting out anti-Semitism,"" Mr Corbyn said. The party has been dogged by a series of incidents including criticism last month over Mr Corbyn's comments on an allegedly anti-Semitic mural in 2012 and the Labour Party suspension of former London Mayor Ken Livingstone over his claim that Adolf Hitler had supported Zionism in the 1930s. How widespread is anti-Semitism in the UK? Corbyn sorry over Labour anti-Semitism MPs applauded after anti-Semitism speeches The Labour leader had been accused of not taking the issue seriously enough by Jewish groups and some of his own MPs, who took part in a protest in Parliament Square last month. And on Thursday last week, MPsshared their own experiences of anti-Semitic threatsin the House of Commons. The Jewish Leadership Council and Board of Deputies had written to Mr Corbyn following last month's demonstration to suggest ""areas of action"". After a meeting with Mr Corbyn, which lasted more than two hours, the organisations said in a statement: ""We are disappointed that Mr Corbyn's proposals fell short of the minimum level of action which our letter suggested. ""Words in letters and newspaper articles will never be enough. We welcome the fact that Mr Corbyn's words have changed but it is action by which the Jewish community will judge him and the Labour Party."" They said the following suggested points of action were rejected: A fixed timetable to deal with anti-Semitism cases Expedite the long-standing cases involving Mr Livingstone and suspended party activist Jackie Walker No MP should share a platform with somebody expelled or suspended for anti-Semitism Adopt in full the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of anti-Semitism Transparent oversight of the disciplinary process The Jewish leaders also say the Labour leader has been slow to act on the recommendations of a2016 report by Labour peer Shami Chakrabarti,external, which called for action to address what it said was the ""occasionally toxic atmosphere"" in the party, but it has yet to be implemented in full. By Iain Watson, BBC political correspondent Accusations that anti-Semitism wasn't being taken seriously enough by Labour are proving politically toxic in two ways. First, they undermine Labour's ""brand"" - a party that stands for equal rights and anti-racism. And secondly, the effort to detoxify the issue has arguably diverted the party's leadership from the forthcoming local election contests. So it would have been helpful if the Jewish groups had suggested that progress had been made since their demonstration in Parliament Square, which some of Jeremy Corbyn's own MPs joined a month ago. While they did welcome Mr Corbyn's words on anti-Semitism - and his denunciation of those who said the problem had been invented or exaggerated - their verdict on action, or lack of it, means that the issue remains a potent force in the hands of the Labour leader's internal and external opponents. Perhaps the most positive interpretation is that there was a disagreement over detail and not a fundamental division in outlook. That's certainly how sources close to the Labour leadership would like it to be seen. Read more from Iain Mr Corbyn said it was a ""positive and constructive"" meeting and shadow communities secretary Andrew Gwynne said it was ""full, thorough and frank"". ""I am absolutely committed to rooting out anti-Semitism from our party and our society,"" Mr Corbyn said. ""When members of Jewish communities express genuine anxieties, we must recognise them as we would those of any other community. ""I have charged our new general secretary Jennie Formby with improving our disciplinary procedures as her top priority to ensure all complaints are dealt with swiftly and fairly."" He said further steps would be laid out in the coming weeks. Responding to the statement from Jewish leaders, which said none of their action points were agreed to, Mr Gwynne said: ""That's not my understanding of what was agreed. ""Whilst there was a number of issues raised, actually many of those issues we agreed to either implement or we were already implementing or we agreed to do something in more detail... I'm not sure how they've interpreted the meeting."" He said they made it ""very clear"" that nobody should share a platform with any member found guilty of anti-Semitism, or someone who had been suspended. And the ""vast majority"" of cases involving anti-Semitism allegations will be dealt with by July, he added. In an article for the Evening Standard published ahead of the meeting, Mr Corbynsaid Labour was taking action,external, with more than 20 members suspended in the past fortnight, adding: ""But we have not done enough to get to grips with the problem, and the Jewish community and our Jewish members deserve an apology. ""My party and I are sorry for the hurt and distress caused."" A separate round table event organised by Mr Corbyn on Wednesday has been postponed. Jewish groups had said they would boycott it amid concerns about the inclusion of the pro-Corbyn group Jewish Voice for Labour. The organisation has accused opponents of using the anti-Semitism claims to damage the Labour leader.

So it would have been helpful if the Jewish groups had suggested that progress had been made since their demonstration in Parliament Square, which some of Jeremy Corbyn's own MPs joined a month ago. While they did welcome Mr Corbyn's words on anti-Semitism - and his denunciation of those who said the problem had been invented or exaggerated - their verdict on action, or lack of it, means that the issue remains a potent force in the hands of the Labour leader's internal and external opponents. Perhaps the most positive interpretation is that there was a disagreement over detail and not a fundamental division in outlook. That's certainly how sources close to the Labour leadership would like it to be seen. Read more from Iain Mr Corbyn said it was a ""positive and constructive"" meeting and shadow communities secretary Andrew Gwynne said it was ""full, thorough and frank"". ""I am absolutely committed to rooting out anti-Semitism from our party and our society,"" Mr Corbyn said. ""When members of Jewish communities express genuine anxieties, we must recognise them as we would those of any other community. ""I have charged our new general secretary Jennie Formby with improving our disciplinary procedures as her top priority to ensure all complaints are dealt with swiftly and fairly."" He said further steps would be laid out in the coming weeks. Responding to the statement from Jewish leaders, which said none of their action points were agreed to, Mr Gwynne said: ""That's not my understanding of what was agreed. ""Whilst there was a number of issues raised, actually many of those issues we agreed to either implement or we were already implementing or we agreed to do something in more detail... I'm not sure how they've interpreted the meeting."" He said they made it ""very clear"" that nobody should share a platform with any member found guilty of anti-Semitism, or someone who had been suspended. And the ""vast majority"" of cases involving anti-Semitism allegations will be dealt with by July, he added. In an article for the Evening Standard published ahead of the meeting, Mr Corbynsaid Labour was taking action,external, with more than 20 members suspended in the past fortnight, adding: ""But we have not done enough to get to grips with the problem, and the Jewish community and our Jewish members deserve an apology. ""My party and I are sorry for the hurt and distress caused."" A separate round table event organised by Mr Corbyn on Wednesday has been postponed. Jewish groups had said they would boycott it amid concerns about the inclusion of the pro-Corbyn group Jewish Voice for Labour. The organisation has accused opponents of using the anti-Semitism claims to damage the Labour leader.

"Theresa May's plan for a ""customs partnership"" with the EU after Brexit has been described as ""completely cretinous"" by Jacob Rees-Mogg. The leading Tory Brexiteer said it would be the same as staying in a customs union. He also accused the prime minister of lacking ""enthusiasm"" for Brexit at a think-tank event in Parliament. Mrs May has ruled out joining a customs union but has come up with two options to avoid a hard border in Ireland. Reality Check: The two customs options UK will leave customs union, insists No 10 One of them is a ""customs partnership"" that would rely on new technology to track the final destination of goods flowing across the border, removing the need for physical customs checks. This has previously been dismissed as ""magical thinking"" in Brussels but UK officials arereported by the Financial Times,externalto believe the mood has changed and they plan to raise it again next month. Mr Rees-Mogg said the ""completely cretinous"" idea would see the UK collect tariffs on the EU's behalf for goods landing in Britain but intended for the bloc's market, something Mr Rees-Mogg said would be ""impractical, bureaucratic"" and ""a betrayal of common sense"". The other option being proposed by the government would be to minimise checks rather than getting rid of them altogether, by using new technologies and things like trusted trader schemes. Speaking at the Open Europe event, Mr Rees-Mogg said Mrs May's attitude to Brexit was ""enigmatic"". ""She is carrying out the will of the British people but it's hard to read what level of enthusiasm she has for it,"" he said. The Conservative MP, who heads the influential European Research Group of Conservatives, also accused the House of Lords of ""playing with fire"" by attempting to ""thwart"" the result of the 2016 EU referendum. He said it was now a case of the ""peers against the people"" after the government's Brexit legislation suffered a series of defeats in the upper chamber. He was speaking as a petition calling for a referendum on abolishing the House of Lords passed the 100,000 signature mark, which could trigger a debate in Parliament. Mr Rees-Mogg said an immigration policy after Brexit that gave preferential treatment to EU nationals would be ""racist"" and ""quite wrong"" because, by and large, EU nationals are white. Responding to Mr Rees-Mogg's comments, Theresa May's official spokesman said that it was part of the Upper House's role to scrutinise legislation. But he added: ""We have been clear that we are disappointed with the decisions which have been taken by the House of Lords. ""We believe that the Withdrawal Bill was passed by the House of Commons and was passed in a way which would allow us to deliver the smooth Brexit which the country wants."" The government had already set out its plans in relation to House of Lords reform, said the spokesman. Asked whether he would agree that Mrs May had been ""enigmatic"" about her views of Brexit, the spokesman said: ""The prime minister has made absolutely clear her determination to deliver on the will of the British people, and that she believes that we can deliver Brexit in such a way that provides for Britain a stronger, more prosperous and more secure future.""

His arrival was celebrated with traditional gun salutes from the Tower of London and Hyde Park, which are used to mark every birth of a prince or princess.

"An independent coffee chain is believed to be the first in the UK to ban the sale of hot drinks in disposable cups. From 1 June, Boston Tea Party, which has 21 branches around England, will only sell hot drinks in reusable cups. Customers must either bring their own mug, buy one in store or pay a deposit on one they can return to any branch. Supermarket giant Waitrose has made a similar pledge to stop using disposable cups by autumn while Costa Coffee has vowed to improve on recycling. Boston Tea Party owner Sam Roberts said that to carry on handing out 300,000 disposable cups a year was ""senseless"". It is estimated that more than two billion disposable coffee cups are used each year in the UK, with fewer than 1% being recycled. The new plan for takeaway hot drinks, which account for Â£1m of the company's annual Â£19.8m turnover, is the chain's second attempt to reduce waste. Customers were previously offered a 25p discount on drinks if they brought their own cup, but only 2.8% of people took up the offer. Under the new scheme, customers who forget their reusable cup can buy one in store for between Â£4.25 and Â£4.75. Alternatively, they can pay a deposit on a loan cup and return it when finished. Children's authors back plastics ban Reality Check: Why are 99.75% of coffee cups not recycled? Costa vows 'cup recycling revolution' Waitrose to ban disposable coffee cups While paper cups can be recycled at specialist plants, they are not suitable for recycling with other paper and cardboard products because they contain a plastic lining. Other UK coffee chains have also announced plans to cut waste. Costa, for example, has vowed to recycle as many cups as it puts into the market by 2020 - but Mr Roberts does not believe such plans are effective. ""Lots of coffee chains are making pledges about how they plan to tackle cup waste in the future,"" he said, ""but theirs is a future which is too far away. ""We want to demonstrate to other operators that to make a difference, big change is needed. ""We will make this work and we'll share details of how we've done it with anyone who wants our help to do the same."" Costa Coffeehas promised to recycle as many cups as it puts into the market by 2020 and also offers customers a 25p discount on hot beverages if they bring their own reusable cup. Pret A Mangeroffers customers a 50p discount on hot beverages if they bring their own reusable cup. Starbucksoffers customers a 25p discount on hot beverages if they bring their own reusable cup. It is also trialling a 5p levy on disposable cups at 35 of its London stores. Caffe Nerosays that, along with its competitors, it is ""working to increase the number of [coffee cup] recycling points"" in the UK. Pauloffers customers a 25p discount on hot beverages if they bring their own reusable cup. Environmental charity Friends of the Earth, which campaigns on the issue, said it was encouraged that retailers were taking steps to reduce waste, but argued the government needed to do more to help solve the problem. ""We welcome steps being taken by coffee shops to decrease the amount of plastic pollution they produce,"" a spokesman said. ""However, it's the UK government which looks like it could use a caffeine kick for its plastic strategy."" The charity insists that the only long-term solution to the plastic pollution is ""a complete phase-out of all but the most essential plastics"".

"Alfie Evans' condition in Alder Hey Children's Hospital has been described as ""semi-vegetative"" The life support of seriously ill toddler Alfie Evans has been withdrawn, his father has said. Tom Evans said the 23-month-old's life support was turned off on Monday but Alfie was breathing on his own and had been given oxygen. It comes after his parents lost legal challenges against a High Court ruling in February that Alder Hey Children's Hospital could withdraw ventilation. A further hearingtook place on Tuesday afternoon. The hospital said it would ""not be issuing any updates on his condition"". This video can not be played Tom Evans: 'He's been doing this for nine hours, totally unexpected"" Speaking outside the hospital earlier, Mr Evans said: ""[Alfie] is now on oxygen. It's not changing his breathing but it's oxygenating his body. ""He is still working, he's doing as good as he can but we do need him to be supported in the next hour. It's going to be hard."" A candle-lit vigil was held by supporters of Alfie outside the hospital overnight, where earlier in the day protesters had tried to storm the entrance. In a statement on Twitter Alder Hey bosses said ""out of respect for the privacy of Alfie and his family"" it would not be commenting on the toddler's condition, in line with ""normal and agreed practice with all our patients"".

Mr Justice Hayden, who ruled doctors could stop treating Alfie against the wishes of his parents, is hearing further discussion at the High Court in Manchester. Barrister Paul Diamond, who represents Alfie's parents, will argue it cannot be in the toddler's best interests to be left to die in Alder Hey Children's Hospital and he should be allowed to travel to Italy where doctors are ready to care for him. The latest hearing comes after Mr Justice Hayden dismissed submissions heard in private from lawyers representing Mr Evans and Alfie's mother Kate James on Monday evening.

"Alfie Evans was taken off life support on Monday evening The parents of seriously ill toddler Alfie Evans have launched a further appeal in a bid to take him abroad for treatment. A High Court judge said the 23-month-old may be allowed home from Alder Hey Children's Hospital, where his life support was withdrawn. But Mr Justice Hayden refused to allow Tom Evans and Kate James to move their son to a hospital in Rome. The Court of Appeal judges have retired to consider their decision. At the start of the hearing, three senior judges heard Alfie, whose life support was removed on Monday, was ""struggling"". Jason Coppel QC, representing Ms James, said she had told him her son needed ""immediate intervention"". Paul Diamond, acting for Mr Evans, told judges he had spoken to his client before the hearing, who had told him to ""save my boy"". ""He would leave no stone unturned... He is clutching at straws,"" he said. Mr Diamond argued that there had been a ""significant change of circumstances"" because Alfie was still breathing after life support treatment stopped on Monday evening. He said an ""alternative"" was available, and a military air ambulance was on standby ""at the request of the Pope"". Who is Alfie Evans and what is the row over his treatment? When are parents denied the final say? World's reaction to Alfie Evans case ""We submit there is a likelihood of Alfie having some pleasure in life,"" Mr Diamond said. But appeal judge Lady Justice King disagreed. She said evidence showed that, while Alfie was unlikely to feel pain, ""tragically everything that would allow him to have some appreciation of life, or even the mere touch of his mother, has been destroyed irrevocably"". Michael Mylonas QC, for Alder Hey Children's Hospital, said Mr Diamond had accepted ""categorically"" before the appeal court and before Mr Justice Hayden that ""there is no new medical evidence to contradict the evidence"" that was before the High Court in February. ""It was never suggested that death would be instantaneous."" He said Alfie has previously survived six to 10 days without a ventilator and it has ""never been said to [his] family that Alfie would die immediately or before sundown"". Mr Mylonas said the ""tragedy"" for the parents was that Alfie looked like a normal child. Outside court, two people believed to be German air ambulance staff were escorted from Alder Hey by police. They were seen speaking to members of the Evans family. This video can not be played Tom Evans plans to lodge an appeal as Alfie ""is not struggling, he is fighting"". On Tuesday, his parents, backed by the Christian Legal Centre, brought a fresh application for Alfie to be moved from Liverpool to the Vatican-linked Bambino Gesu Hospital in Rome. At a further hearing in Manchester, Mr Evans claimed his son had fared ""significantly better"" than expected after life support was withdrawn, suggesting his health had improved. But Mr Justice Hayden rejected this, saying: ""The sad truth is that it is not."" Instead, the judge said, Alfie's continued life was a ""shaft of light"" and a ""special opportunity"" for his parents to spend time with him - not the time for more legal manoeuvres. He also criticised the ""malign hand"" of one of the family's advisers, law student Pavel Stroilov, who had, the court heard, been party to Mr Evans lodging a private prosecution of Alder Hey Hospital doctors, allegedly for murder. This video can not be played BBC News went to meet the people calling themselves 'Alfie's Army' He said the hospital had provided ""world class"" care for the child. The best Alfie's parents could hope for, Mr Justice Hayden said, was to ""explore"" the options of removing him from intensive care either to a ward, a hospice or his home. Roger Kiska, from the Christian Legal Centre, told the Victoria Derbyshire programme the judge's comments were ""highly inappropriate"". Mr Kiska said the judge was speaking of ""a private prosecution of anyone who delivered medicine, drugs, which would hasten Alfie's death, which is de facto euthanasia and a crime in this country"". A doctor, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said for Alfie to be allowed home would require a ""sea change"" in attitude from the child's family. He told the court they feared that in the ""worst case"" they would try to take Alfie abroad. This video can not be played Tom Evans says Alfie has been breathing without support The toddler has been in Alder Hey since December 2016 with a rare undiagnosed degenerative neurological condition. Medics have said Alfie's brain has been destroyed by his illness, and it is in his best interests to withdraw life support. In a statement released after the hearing, Alder Hey Children's Hospital said its ""top priority remains in ensuring Alfie receives the care he deserves to ensure his comfort, dignity and privacy are maintained throughout. ""This includes working closely with Kate and Tom as they spend this precious time together with him."" Mr Evans and Ms James had hoped Alfie could be taken to the Bambino Gesu Hospital in Rome, which has links to the Vatican, where his care could continue. They have lost a series of legal challenges against a High Court ruling in February that Alder Hey could withdraw ventilation.

"A ""Berlin Wears Kippah"" rally is planned in the German capital on Wednesday The leader of Germany's Jewish community has advised Jews to avoid wearing traditional skullcaps (kippahs) following anti-Semitic attacks. Josef Schuster, the president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, told Berlin public radio that Jews should exercise caution in big cities. His comments come ahead of a ""Berlin Wears Kippah"" solidarity march in the German capital on Wednesday. Last week, two young men wearing kippahs were assaulted in the city. The attacker was filmed shouting anti-Semitic abuse. Jewish organisations in Germany have expressed alarm over a number of recent anti-Semitic insults and threats in schools. At the weekend, Chancellor Angela Merkel condemned what she described as ""another form of anti-Semitism"". She told Israel's Channel 10 TV network that aside from anti-Semitism by right-wing groups, similar threats were coming from some Muslim refugees in the country. Conductor protests in anti-Semitism row German fury at Holocaust memorial remark Berlin anti-Semitic attack caught on video ""Defiantly showing your colours would in principle be the right way to go [to tackle anti-Semitism],"" he said. ""Nevertheless, I would advise individual people against openly wearing a kippah in big German cities,"" Mr Schuster added. But he also stressed that if Germans refused to stand up to anti-Semitism ""our democracy would be at risk"". ""This is not only about anti-Semitism - it goes along with racism, it goes along with xenophobia. You need a clear stop sign here."" Mr Schuster's comments apparently contradict the position taken on the kippah issue by the Berlin-based Jewish Forum for Democracy and Against Anti-Semitism -the organisation which shared video of last week's attack on Facebook.,external This video can not be played Footage of last week's attack in the Prenzlauer Berg area of Berlin ""I used to always advise my Jewish friends and acquaintances not to wear a kippah so as not to show their Jewish identity. I changed my opinion,"" a spokesman said last week. ""We must take up this fight and be visible again in public."" Separately, the head of Germany's Central Council of Muslims condemned recent anti-Semitic attacks. ""Anti-Semitism, racism and hatred are great sins in Islam, therefore we will also never tolerate that,"" Aiman Mazyek told Germany's Rheinische Post newspaper. Germany's Jewish population has grown rapidly since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Before 1989, the population was below 30,000 but an influx of Jews, mainly from the former Soviet Union, has raised the number to more than 200,000.

Roger Harris, a TSB customer who has been locked out of his account, was recently sent these letters by the bank When TSB split from the Lloyds Banking Group, it continued to rent a banking platform from its former owner while it developed its own ""state-of-the-art"" platform. That was ready to go live last weekend and TSB moved its customers' data from the Lloyds' platform to its own. This was a long-planned disruption to the service and the bank said it informed customers of the change and that it would lead to them being unable to use online banking or payment systems at the weekend. It promised that systems would be back up and running by 6pm on Sunday but many of those who did get access to their online accounts were presented with details of other people's accounts too. Since that data breach many customers have reported being unable to log on, while those that have been able to log on say there have been problems with passwords or that they have been logged out. The Financial Conduct Authority, which has the power to fine banks for system failures, said it was in ""regular contact"" with TSB.

"A BBC editor has told the High Court he has no concerns about the airing of helicopter images of Sir Cliff Richard's flat during a police search. Jonathan Munro said the footage had not been referred to him before it aired on the day of the search in August 2014. Sir Cliff is suing the BBC for naming him and broadcasting the footage of his flat in Berkshire during a sexual assault inquiry into the singer. He says broadcasting the images was a ""very serious invasion"" of privacy. Sir Cliff, who denied the allegation, was not arrested or charged. Mr Munro, the BBC's head of newsgathering, told Mr Justice Mann: ""No referrals were made to me about any helicopter images."" He added that he had watched the helicopter images while writing a witness statement and said: ""I do not have any concerns about the broadcasting of these images."" The BBC's head of newsgathering Jonathan Munro said he believed there was a public interest in broadcasting the police search of Sir Cliff's flat Sir Cliff's barrister, Justin Rushbrooke QC, asked Mr Munro if he thought it had been acceptable to fly a helicopter over a private estate to ""spy"" on the singer's home. Mr Munro said he would not use the word ""spy"", and added he thought it was acceptable to film police searching the home of someone under investigation. Mr Rushbrooke said: ""If that is your genuine belief I suggest to you that you are unfit for your job."" Mr Munro said he believed there was a public interest in seeing the police search in the wake of several high-profile allegations of sexual abuse. ""For the public it is important to be able to see what is happening on a given event,"" he said. He added he did not believe the helicopter was trespassing. BBC editor Gary Smith said South Yorkshire Police's search of Sir Cliff's property was a ""very important"" part of choosing to cover the story Earlier the court heard from Gary Smith, the BBC's UK news editor at the time. He said the corporation would not have run a story about Sir Cliff being investigated by police if it had not been for the search of his home. ""I think the search element was very important to us,"" he said. ""For us to have published a story before [police] had done anything could easily have affected their investigation."" When asked if the BBC would have run the story without the police search, he said: ""No. ""I would have wanted to wait for something actually happening, whether it was a search, or questioning or an arrest if it had come to that, rather than publishing a story just on the strength of knowing there was an investigation going on."" Sir Cliff claims he suffered ""profound and long-lasting damage"" from the coverage. He is suing the BBC over the misuse of private information and breaking data protection rules. The BBC disputes his allegations. It says the BBC report on the police inquiry was in the public interest. In 2014 South Yorkshire Police searched Sir Cliff's flat in Sunningdale, Berkshire, while investigating an allegation the singer sexually assaulted a boy under the age of 16 in Sheffield in 1985. In June 2016 it was announced he would not face any charges. South Yorkshire Police has settled its own case with Sir Cliff by paying him Â£400,000 and argues that the BBC should pay a share of this because its actions were ""far more causative of the damage suffered"".

"Police arrested Alek Minassian within half an hour of the attack A picture is slowly building of Toronto van attack suspect Alek Minassian - a young man who had spent time in special needs programmes as a child and was something of a loner at college, but who had never drawn the attention of police. Police have not said anything about Mr Minassian's motive, but just minutes before Monday's attack he posted on Facebook to praiseElliot Rodger, who killed six people in a 2014 rampage. Mr Minassian, a 25-year-old from the Richmond Hill suburb in northern Toronto, has now been charged with 10 counts of premeditated murder and 13 counts of attempted murder. He was arrested several blocks from where a white rental van struck pedestrians on Yonge Street, following a tense standoff with a police officer. Mr Minassian's Facebook post read: ""The Incel Rebellion has already begun! We will overthrow all the Chads and Stacys! All hail the Supreme Gentleman Elliot Rodger!"" Rodger, who was 22 at the time, killed six people ina car and gun rampage through Isla Vista, Californiain 2014 before turning the gun on himself. The term ""incel"" refers to a now-banned group on the discussion site Reddit, used by Rodger, where young men discussed their lack of sexual activity and attractiveness to women - often blaming women for the problem and advocating misogyny and violence. ""Chads and Stacys"" refers to attractive men and women who are perceived as better than or unavailable to ""incels"", which is short for ""involuntary celibate"". Mr Minassian was a member of the Canadian Armed Forces for two months between August and October 2017, a spokesman confirmed to the BBC. He did not complete training and requested to be released. A current LinkedIn profile lists him as a student at Seneca College, near where the attack happened. Canada's Globe and Mail spoke toa fellow student at the college, who said Mr Minassian was good with computers,external, in particular with special image processing chips. The student, who wished to remain anonymous, said Mr Minassian was socially awkward, but never showed any sign that he followed an extreme belief or ideology. Toronto police quiz van attack suspect Calm actions of Toronto police stun US Former classmates say Mr Minassian was in a special needs programme at Thornlea Secondary School, and ""wasn't a social person"". Shereen Chami told Reuters he would walk around the school, head down, hands clasped, making meowing noises. He was not, however, violent. ""From what I remember he was absolutely harmless,"" Ms Chami said. ""I'm not sure if he had any very, very close friends, at least publicly,"" Ari Bluff told Canadian broadcaster CBC, describing him as ""sort of in the background"". ""I remember seeing him probably just walking down the halls, usually by himself, or in the cafeteria by himself."" This video can not be played ""Anybody in his way, he would hit"": Witnesses recall Toronto van incident Authorities ruled out any wider threat, with Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale saying there were ""no national security connections"" apparent. Government officials said Mr Minassian was not associated with any known terror groups, according to CBC. Police said they were investigating Mr Minassian's Facebook post and interest in Rodger. My friend the student killer In a 107,000-word manifesto entitled My Twisted World: The Story of Elliot Rodger, Rodger complained of rejection by women. ""I've been forced to endure an existence of loneliness, rejection and unfulfilled desires all because girls have never been attracted to me,"" he said in his final YouTube video, titled Elliot Rodger's Retribution. Rodger attempted to enter a sorority house on his rampage, before shooting three women in the street outside.

"This video can not be played The ups and downs of Trump and Macron France's President Emmanuel Macron is in Washington this week, the first foreign leader to make a state visit under Donald Trump. The two men - both seen as outsiders before their presidential campaigns - have developed an unlikely personal rapport, but what's behind the connection, and what does it mean for French interests and influence? Emmanuel Macron's relationships have raised eyebrows more than once. Weeks after taking office,he passed over France's key allies and chose the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, as his first foreign guest- a man he's due to visit in Moscow next month, despite recently ordering airstrikes against Russia's Syrian ally. His ecumenical approach has sometimes caused diplomatic tiffs, most recently with Ankara, incensed by the suggestion that it might like France to mediate between Turkey and the Kurds. But nothing has drawn the same attention as his ""bromance"" with Donald Trump. This video can not be played The US president attended France's Bastille Day celebrations in 2017 There is the unlikely age difference between the two men, their difference in political vision and values, in their style and personality, their backgrounds, their interests, their use of the media. And yet, the ElysÃ©e describes their relationship as ""very close"", and the two men really do, by all accounts, speak often and frankly by telephone, and seem to have a genuine rapport. This rapport has pushed France ahead of Germany and the UK, to become America's primary European contact. Britain's retreat from Europe and Germany's trade and immigration policies helped open the way for Mr Macron, and it has not escaped notice here that it's he, and not Mrs May or Mrs Merkel, who is making the first state visit of the Trump presidency, when he will be a guest at a formal banquet and  address the Congress. An unlikely (and calculated) friendship is born Long read: Macron's meteoric rise And there are personal reasons for the new Franco-American bond. Both Mr Macron and Mr Trump were seen as shaking up the political systems in their countries; both are - in their own ways - outspoken; and both like to project an image of strength. It doesn't hurt either, say some on the American side, that Mr Macron is male, and seen as handsome. But France may also have an easier time adjusting to the disruptive Trump presidency precisely because it didn't have the kind of close, shared vision that both Germany and the UK have had with recent American presidents. France is pragmatic in its approach to Washington - an alliance based on mutual interests rather than a shared moral vision of the world. This video can not be played Donald Trump's handshakes with world leaders have been closely watched Those mutual interests are still dominated by security and counter-terrorism. France needs the US for its international fight against terrorism, and as analysts here will tell you, Paris has come to be seen as Washington's best bet for military support, in the wake of British caution following the Iraq War. Syria: What can Macron and Trump do? Macron on Brexit, Frexit and Trump Mr Trump's approach to security has sometimes helped President Macron's own agenda in Europe. The American leader has been robust in asking EU states to take a greater role in their own security, and raise their defence spending to 2% of GDP. Mr Macron, who has promised France will meet that target by 2025, is keen for Europe to have more autonomy in security and defence matters, and is pushing his proposal of a European Intervention Initiative, with the common resources and strategic goals that would allow it to carry out its own missions, as France does now. But in a country where too close a proximity to the US can be politically dangerous for a president, Mr Macron will need to have something more to have show for it. Mr Macron's close relationship with Mr Trump makes France America's primary European contact He recently claimed to have convinced his American counterpart to stay engaged in Syria, but that was quickly denied by the White House. And so far, despite raising expectations, there's little evidence of the French leader's influence over President Trump on key issues like climate change, the Iran nuclear deal, or the status of Jerusalem. This visit will be a chance to discuss those policy differences with the US, with France hoping to agree ""a document of recommendations"" with Washington ahead of Mr Trump's planned withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement next month. President Macron will also talk to Donald Trump about his planned tariffs on EU steel and aluminium, the conflict in Syria, and Washington's controversial decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. But, even without any concrete influence over these issues, there's intrinsic value for Mr Macron in his relationship with Donald Trump. This video can not be played Toned-down Trump: What happened to the tough talk on Paris? Mr Macron began his presidency with a commitment to restore French status abroad and a sense of its mission in the world.Lofty aims, which he believes are key to France regaining a sense of national identity and optimism. His close relationship to Donald Trump, even without much policy influence, raises France's global profile and boosts its influence and leverage elsewhere. Emmanuel Macron's diplomatic trademark is strong personal connections combined with robust policy differences - a delicate juggling act, on occasion. President Trump's relationships can be unpredictable - analysts point out that Macron has been careful not to criticise him personally. And if Mr Trump's decisions directly harm French interests, Emmanuel Macron could find himself on the receiving end of far more damaging criticism - from French voters. In which case, the relationship that boosts the French president's status abroad could end up scuppering it at home. Macron 'convinced Trump to stay in Syria' Syria: What can Macron and Trump do?

"Matt Campbell, on the right, was running his second marathon in two weeks Thousands of people have pledged to ""finish"" the London Marathon in honour of MasterChef contestant Matt Campbell who died 3.7 miles short of the finish. More than Â£116,000 has so far been donated to the charity the 29-year-old from Kendal was running for. The MasterChef semi-finalist collapsed at the 22.5 mile mark of Sunday's race. More than 2,000 people have now signed up to a ""Finish for Matt,external"" Facebook page, pledging to run the miles he was unable to. Mr Campbell was running in memory of his late father and hoped to raise Â£2,500 for the Cumbria-based Brathay Trust. A total of Â£116,217 has been raised from more than 8,372 separate donations. Matt Campbell was described as one of Britain's most exciting young chefs Mr Campbell appeared on the BBC's MasterChef: The Professionals in December 2017 and reached the semi-finals. Hundreds of social media tributes have been paid to the chef, described as ""lovely and kind-hearted"" by family and friends. Writing on the Facebook group, runner Matt Dorber said: ""This has been mainly set up as part of the London Marathon training group. ""Four thousand of us have given each other advice and support over the last few months, and a small gesture of solidarity would be to 'finish' the run for Matt. ""It may be in London, Somerset, Manchester, where ever you are, but if as many people can do a 3.7m run and give Â£5 to Matt's Justgiving page, I think that'd be a nice gesture from us as a group."" Promises of support quickly appeared on social media, with many making additional donations. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Campbell began his career working in Michelin-starred restaurants having finished second in the BBC's Young Chef of the Year in 2009. A spokesman for the Brathay Trust, which works with vulnerable young people, said: ""He was a real creative chef and one of the things he was very keen on doing was sharing that knowledge with young chefs who wanted to get involved in the industry. ""He was such a great athlete and also a wonderful supporter of Brathay."" London Marathon hottest on record Broken leg runner thanks 'heroes' Watch: London Marathon helps struggling rival to finish This year's marathon, which had 40,000 runners, was officially the hottest on record, with temperatures reaching 24.1C (73.3F) according to the Met Office. Runners were warned it could be even hotter on the course because of the heat absorbed by the roads and from other competitors. Event director Hugh Brasher said organisers distributed four and a half litres of water per person - more than any other mass participation event in the world. However, he confirmed water did run out at miles eight, nine and 10. Provisional figures indicate 110 runners required hospital treatment, compared with 2011 when temperatures reached 22C and 104 were taken to hospital, he said. Extra water was provided for runners because of the hot weather Mr Brasher added the event was ""planned thoroughly"" and organisers would see what lessons could be learnt for next year. But he said it was too early to speculate on the exact cause of Mr Campbell's death. He said: ""We really don't want to speculate what was the cause of his death. We don't know. ""An autopsy will be carried out and, as a result of that autopsy, we will find out. ""Our thoughts are just with his family and friends at the moment and giving them the support that they need.""

"This video can not be played John Crilly had his murder conviction quashed after a landmark challenge. A man has been released from prison after becoming the first person since 2016 to have a joint enterprise murder conviction quashed. Joint enterprise is used to convict defendants in gang-related cases even if they did not strike the fatal blow, but could have foreseen violent acts by their associates. But in 2016,Supreme Court judges said the law had been wrongly interpreted. John Crilly has been released after serving 13 years in prison. He was given a life sentence for murder and robbery in 2005 after he and his associate David Flynn broke into the home of 71-year-old Augustine Maduemezia in Manchester. Mr Maduemezia died after being punched in the face by Flynn. The joint enterprise law has also been used in a number of high profile cases - including to convict members of the gang who murdered Stephen Lawrence. But judges ruled it was wrong to treat ""foresight"" as a sufficient test. During his time in prison, Crilly started a law degree. When he heard about the overturning of the joint enterprise law in 2016, he believed it would apply to his case. He toldBBC Radio 5 livehe believes he should never have been convicted of murder in the first place. ""I wasn't a violent drug addict. I was lost. I was lost in drugs. I had a bad life, I've changed it, but I wasn't guilty of murder. I totally accept what I did and it was wrong. That's important to me. I'm not a murderer."" After appeal, Crilly pleaded guilty to manslaughter. After the ruling there were fears a slew of appeals from criminals challenging their convictions would come forward - but that has not yet materialised. Crilly pleaded guilty to manslaughter after his murder conviction was overturned Crilly said: ""If you take the foresight burden of proof away, and go on intent, which you're supposed to do, it's impossible to convict me of murder. So it's that simple really."" The family of Mr Maduemezia told the BBC they wanted to put the events behind them. Crilly said: ""If they ever want to meet me, I know it's going to be difficult but I'm prepared to do anything I can, I'm prepared to help them in any way, I am just sorry."" The BBC is aware of at least two other cases which are set to challenge a conviction for murder under joint enterprise. Mr Maduemezia's family said in a statement to the BBC: ""This incident had a devastating effect on the family who took a number of years to come to terms with their father's death. Augustine Maduemezia was murdered at his home in Manchester ""You can then imagine their anger and disappointment when they were informed by the police that Mr Crilly had launched a second appeal against his conviction (his first in 2007 failed). His appeal was granted at the High Court. ""It was sickening to hear that he was walking away without completing his sentence for his part in the murder of our father. ""These High Court rulings which lean too favourably towards the offenders and virtually casting aside the opinions, consideration and feelings of victims and their families, help to corrode and undermine public confidence in the justice system. ""We are led to understand that Crilly has turned his life around whilst in prison and has even acquired a law degree. At least he is alive. We wish him well but also wish that our father were alive and free to live his life. ""Despite these disappointments, the family has decided to move on. We are thankful to be public and fully appreciate their support throughout this ordeal.""

"The Drax power station in North Yorkshire has been switching some furnaces from coal to biomass Britain has not generated electricity from coal for more than three days - the longest streak since the 1880s. The new record comes just days after the last record of 55 hours was set, National Grid said. The coal-free period began on Saturday at 1000 BST and has continued into Tuesday afternoon. Power generated from wind and gas dominated the mix of energy for users in England, Scotland and Wales. Just last week the UK grid recorded its first two-day period without using any power from the fossil fuel, which the government has pledged tophase out by 2025. UK's greenest year yet Coal plants to close by 2025 Coal accounted for less than 7% of the power mix last year, according to official figures. In April, 2017 Britain went itsfirst full day without coalsince the 19th century. A wind farm in mid-Wales However, experts warned that power generated by coal was largely being replaced by gas, another fossil fuel, rather than renewable sources. Andrew Crossland, of the Durham Energy Institute, said gas generated 40% of the UK's electricity and fuelled the vast majority of domestic heating: ""As a country we consume nearly eight times more gas than coal."" The daily consumption of gas wasoutstripped by wind on just two dayslast year, while all sources of renewable energy - including wind, solar, biomass and hydropower - beat fossil fuels for just 23 days of 2017. A reliance on gas made the UK vulnerable to the whims of international markets and was ""nowhere near clean enough"" to meet the UK's legal targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions, Mr Crossland said. The 2008 Climate Change Act requires greenhouse gas emissions to be reduced by 80% compared with 1990 levels by 2050. Hannah Martin, from Greenpeace UK, called on the government to provide more support for onshore wind and solar power - the ""cleanest and cheapest energy sources"". ""Offshore wind has proven to be popular and able to provide affordable clean energy, as well as skilled jobs and fair bills,"" she said. ""As we have more and more days without coal, we need to make sure it is replaced with the renewable technologies of the future."" Mr Crossland also called for more investment in renewable technologies, such as solar panels and batteries, to store power for homes and businesses, along with better energy efficiency to reduce power use.

"This video can not be played ""I have a gun in my pocket"" â the moment Alek Minassian was arrested. The calm actions of a police officer who arrested the Toronto van suspect without firing a shot have prompted praise and, in some quarters, astonishment. Video from the scene shows suspect Alek Minassian pointing an object at the officer and shouting: ""Kill me!"" The officer tells the man to ""get down"" and when the suspect says he has a gun, the officer repeats: ""I don't care. Get down."" Videos on social media show,externalMr Minassian lying down as the officer arrests him. Many in North America are asking how the suspect did not end up dead in a hail of police gunfire. It contrasts with incidents in the US where police have shot and killed unarmed people. ""Research has shown that Canadian police are reluctant users of deadly force,"" says Rick Parent, a criminologist at Simon Fraser University in Canada's British Columbia. ""An analysis of police shooting data over many years revealed, that in comparison to their American counterparts, Canadian police officers discharge their firearms far less, per capita than US police.  However, like American police officers they take many risks in protecting the public."" One US-based academic told the BBC that the officer would have had a ""duty"" to kill the suspect, if the object he was pointing was a gun. Toronto police quiz van attack suspect Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders told journalists the officer had done a ""fantastic job"" to understand the ""circumstance and environment"" and get to a ""peaceful resolution"". He said police in the city were ""taught to use as little force as possible in any given situation"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mike McCormack, president of the Toronto Police Association, told the Globe and Mail newspaper thatthe officer was a ""hero"" and could have justified opening fire,external. ""This officer looked at what was going on and determined he could handle it the way that he did,"" he said. He said he had spoken to the officer, who had told him: ""I just did my job. What I did was no big deal. But look at these poor people."" This video can not be played ""Anybody in his way, he would hit"": Witnesses recall Toronto van incident Canada's Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale praised the ""brave and professional"" police response. Some on social media have praised the officer's ""restraint"" - while others such as author Viet Thanh Nguyen highlighted the apparent contrast with the behaviour of some US police. However, Michael Lyman, professor of Criminal Justice Administration at Columbia College of Missouri, told the BBC that the officer may have had a ""duty"" to kill the suspect. ""Assuming the suspect is holding a gun and pointing it toward officers, it is concerning that the officer is not engaging the suspect with deadly force,"" he said. How often are US police killed on duty? Are US police too quick to shoot knife-wielding suspects? Professor Lyman said that the officer might not have opened fire out of fear of public criticism after the event. ""People died as a result of the suspect's actions. Can we assume that the officer knew this? If so, this changes things a bit in that the level of public threat is higher. Under this circumstance, it would seem that the officer had a 'duty' to respond with deadly force - assuming what he was holding was a firearm,"" he said. US cop kills unarmed man with pants down US police video shows unarmed man shot dead Professor William Terrill from the Arizona State University School of Criminology & Criminal Justice said the officer may have judged that the object held by the suspect did not pose a threat. ""It's possible the officer thought the object in the person's hand was not a gun, or not a real gun. The fact that the officer left the cover of his car and exposed himself out in the open would further support such a supposition,"" he said. ""It's also possible the officer recognised a potential suicide-by-cop incident and chose not to engage with deadly force. The only remaining option I can posit is the officer simply froze."" David Klinger, Professor of Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of Missouri-St Louis said the video did not show enough detail for an informed assessment of the officer's actions. ""If the cop could clearly see what was in the suspect's hand, and that it wasn't a gun, then it's a simple matter of a cop doing his job correctly,"" he said.

"TSB's IT fiasco is heading for a fifth day, with angry customers still locked out of their accounts and unable to make payments. The bank said it would take down its mobile app and online banking ""for a few hours"" on Tuesday and hoped to restore services by the afternoon. But it now looks unlikely the issues will be resolved until Wednesday. Chief executive Paul Pester said he was ""deeply sorry"" for the chaos and that no one would be left out of pocket. The bank's data breach on Sunday, which allowed some TSB customers to see other people's account details, has also attracted the attention of the Information Commissioner. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Pester said: ""This isn't the level of service that we pride ourselves on providing, and isn't what our customers have come to expect from TSB, and for that I'm deeply sorry."" 'TSB gave me someone else's Â£35,000' People are beginning to report a wide range of financial problems caused by being unable to access their account online. Colin Patterson of Manchester told the BBC: ""The lack of an official statement, other than generic Twitter replies, is outrageous."" He's been trying to pay for his passport renewal for three days and reports that ""it keeps being rejected"". ""I get paid tomorrow and don't know if I'll be able to pay my rent. It's a disgrace."" Trevor Brittain from Tonbridge said: ""I've been with the same branch for 42 years. It was Lloyds but transferred to TSB at the sell-off. I will be switching back to Lloyds as soon as I can get access to my account."" Jessica Callaghan from Newcastle said: ""I'm angry because they aren't communicating. They just keep saying, 'sorry, it'll be back up shortly'. I want them to give an official statement about what is happening, and compensation for each customer."" Photographer Paul Clarke is worried the TSB problems will hit his business London photographer Paul Clarke is worried that his business will be hit if the situation isn't resolved soon. ""I have no idea who's paid me recently and I can't pay suppliers,"" he told the BBC. ""If we get to the middle of the week and it's still not resolved then my reputation and business could suffer as I work on a quick turnaround. It's a fiasco."" Amanda Verbaan-Dunn, owner of the Wilton Hotel in Blackpool, said: ""I'm away from home and can't pay my staff. I'm going to have to go back three days early so I can sort my staff out. It's extremely frustrating and the lack of communication is inexcusable."" Former Grange Hill star Lee MacDonald said his business ""has literally stopped"" Lee MacDonald, who played Zammo in children's TV show Grange Hill in the 1980s, told the BBC he has had an ""absolute nightmare"" following TSB's IT glitches. Mr MacDonald, who now runs Mentor Lock and Safe Company in Wallington, Surrey, told BBC Radio 5 live: ""I'm having an absolute nightmare.  I've got two accounts with TSB, both business accounts.  My business has literally stopped.  I don't know what money's coming in, what's coming out. ""When you're running a small business, every job counts and it's just a nightmare."" Roger Harris, a TSB customer who has been locked out of his account, was recently sent these letters by the bank When TSB split from the Lloyds Banking Group, it continued to rent a banking platform from its former owner while it developed its own ""state-of-the-art"" platform. That was ready to go live last weekend and TSB moved its customers' data from the Lloyds' platform to its own. This was a long-planned disruption to the service and the bank said it informed customers of the change and that it would lead to them being unable to use online banking or payment systems at the weekend. It promised that systems would be back up and running by 6pm on Sunday but many of those who did get access to their online accounts were presented with details of other people's accounts too. Since that data breach many customers have reported being unable to log on, while those that have been able to log on say there have been problems with passwords or that they have been logged out. The Financial Conduct Authority, which has the power to fine banks for system failures, said it was in ""regular contact"" with TSB. ""We are working with the firm to ensure customers are properly communicated with and are not left out of pocket."" ""We will be talking to the firm to understand exactly what went wrong and the steps that they are taking to ensure something like this does not happen again,"" a spokesperson said. The Information Commissioner's Office also said it was ""making enquiries"" about a ""potential data breach"". Nicky Morgan MP, chair of the Treasury Committee, weighed into the crisis on Tuesday by writing to TSB boss Paul Pester to find out what has gone wrong, the extent of the failure, and how the bank intends to compensate customers who have suffered a breach of potentially highly-sensitive personal data. Mrs Morgan said: ""It simply isn't good enough to expose customers to IT failures, including delays in paying bills and an inability to access their own money. ""Warm words and platitudes will not suffice. TSB customers deserve to know what has happened, when normal services will resume, and how they can expect to be compensated.""

"Dr Kogan has said Facebook is using him as a scapegoat in the crisis The academic at the centre of the Facebook data scandal has said the social network is in full-on ""PR crisis mode"". Aleksandr Kogan's remarks came as he faced a grilling over his role from MPs. The social network was fully aware that its platform ""was being mined by thousands of others"", he said. He also rubbished Cambridge Analytica boss Alexander Nix's initial claims that it had not received data from him. ""That is a fabrication,"" he said. In a later clarification, Cambridge Analytica did admit that it had licensed data from the firm set up by Dr Kogan, although denied that the information was used in the US elections. At a press conference held after Dr Kogan's appearance before the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, Cambridge Analytica spokesman Clarence Mitchell said the company was ""no Bond villain"". Facebook explored unpicking users' personalities Facebook cuts off billions from privacy law Will technology destroy our democracy? ""Data analysis is commonly used for better targeting and is perfectly legitimate. It is not some Bond-like brainwashing as has been portrayed by some."" Dr Kogan was questioned by MPs about his role in the data harvesting row. He revealed that he had signed a non-disclosure agreement with Facebook, which prevented him from revealing some details about his relationship with the tech giant to the MPs. The Cambridge academic has become a central figure in the debate over whether the personal information of millions of Facebook users was used in US elections without their consent. During the committee hearing, he explained that he was approached by SCL - the parent firm of Cambridge Analytica - in spring 2014 about monetising an app he had developed at the University of Cambridge's Psychology Department. He set up a commercial entity - Global Science Research - and later developed the personality quiz My Digital Life for SCL, using a market research firm to recruit 200,000 people to take part. At the time, the social network's terms and conditions - which have since been changed - allowed developers to cull the details of all of these people's friends as well. ""Initially the conversations with SCL were about consulting services, survey designs and the interest in Facebook data grew out of that,"" he said. MPs grilled him on the relationship with business partner Joseph Chancellor, with whom he set up GSR and who is now employed by Facebook. ""Facebook has called your company a scam and a fraud. Is it not odd that they employ someone who by their admission has violated the platform's policies?"" asked committee chairman Damian Collins. ""I don't believe that they actually believe this. They know that their platform is being mined left and right by thousands of others,"" Dr Kogan replied. ""It is convenient to point the finger at my firm and call it a rogue agency,"" he added. He was asked whether the firm had been set up as a money-making exercise and replied that it had only received Â£230,000 in total. Initial payments of between Â£600,000 and Â£800,000 from SCL were used to pay those who agreed to take the quiz, he said. In written evidence presented ahead of the committee, Dr Kogan pointed out that the personality scores provided to Cambridge Analytica's parent firm SCL were ""highly inaccurate"". ""We estimate that we were right about all five traits for about 1% of the people."" He added that the data would not have been useful for micro-targeting ads on Facebook. Cambridge Analytica's suspended chief executive Alexander Nix has postponed another appearance before the DCMS committee Following his appearance, Cambridge Analytica broke its silence on the row with a press conference held in London. Spokesman Clarence Mitchell agreed that the data Dr Kogan had provided to the company had been ""virtually useless"". ""It was only just above random guessing in statistical terms,"" he said. He reiterated that the data had not been used in the US presidential campaign and that while Cambridge Analytica had pitched for work to both Vote Leave and Remain, it had undertaken no work for either side in the EU referendum campaign. He said the results of an independent inquiry into the company were due imminently. When questioned about the notable absence of currently suspended Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix, Mr Mitchell said he was ""not here to speak for him"". But he defended Mr Nix's decision to ""postpone"" an appearance in front of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee. ""He is keen and willing to speak to the DCMS committee but has been advised that he should not do so while an independent inquiry is ongoing."" On Thursday, Facebook's chief technology officer, Mike Schroepfer, will be questioned by the committee.

"Matt Campbell, on the right, was running his second marathon in two weeks Thousands of people have pledged to ""finish"" the London Marathon in honour of MasterChef contestant Matt Campbell who died 3.7 miles short of the finish. More than Â£116,000 has so far been donated to the charity the 29-year-old from Kendal was running for. The MasterChef semi-finalist collapsed at the 22.5 mile mark of Sunday's race. More than 2,000 people have now signed up to a ""Finish for Matt,external"" Facebook page, pledging to run the miles he was unable to. Mr Campbell was running in memory of his late father and hoped to raise Â£2,500 for the Cumbria-based Brathay Trust. A total of Â£116,217 has been raised from more than 8,372 separate donations. Matt Campbell was described as one of Britain's most exciting young chefs Mr Campbell appeared on the BBC's MasterChef: The Professionals in December 2017 and reached the semi-finals. Hundreds of social media tributes have been paid to the chef, described as ""lovely and kind-hearted"" by family and friends. Writing on the Facebook group, runner Matt Dorber said: ""This has been mainly set up as part of the London Marathon training group. ""Four thousand of us have given each other advice and support over the last few months, and a small gesture of solidarity would be to 'finish' the run for Matt. ""It may be in London, Somerset, Manchester, where ever you are, but if as many people can do a 3.7m run and give Â£5 to Matt's Justgiving page, I think that'd be a nice gesture from us as a group."" Promises of support quickly appeared on social media, with many making additional donations. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Campbell began his career working in Michelin-starred restaurants having finished second in the BBC's Young Chef of the Year in 2009. A spokesman for the Brathay Trust, which works with vulnerable young people, said: ""He was a real creative chef and one of the things he was very keen on doing was sharing that knowledge with young chefs who wanted to get involved in the industry. ""He was such a great athlete and also a wonderful supporter of Brathay."" London Marathon hottest on record Broken leg runner thanks 'heroes' Watch: London Marathon helps struggling rival to finish This year's marathon, which had 40,000 runners, was officially the hottest on record, with temperatures reaching 24.1C (73.3F) according to the Met Office. Runners were warned it could be even hotter on the course because of the heat absorbed by the roads and from other competitors. Event director Hugh Brasher said organisers distributed four and a half litres of water per person - more than any other mass participation event in the world. However, he confirmed water did run out at miles eight, nine and 10. Provisional figures indicate 110 runners required hospital treatment, compared with 2011 when temperatures reached 22C and 104 were taken to hospital, he said. Extra water was provided for runners because of the hot weather Mr Brasher added the event was ""planned thoroughly"" and organisers would see what lessons could be learnt for next year. But he said it was too early to speculate on the exact cause of Mr Campbell's death. He said: ""We really don't want to speculate what was the cause of his death. We don't know. ""An autopsy will be carried out and, as a result of that autopsy, we will find out. ""Our thoughts are just with his family and friends at the moment and giving them the support that they need.""

"This video can not be played John Crilly had his murder conviction quashed after a landmark challenge. A man has been released from prison after becoming the first person since 2016 to have a joint enterprise murder conviction quashed. Joint enterprise is used to convict defendants in gang-related cases even if they did not strike the fatal blow, but could have foreseen violent acts by their associates. But in 2016,Supreme Court judges said the law had been wrongly interpreted. John Crilly has been released after serving 13 years in prison. He was given a life sentence for murder and robbery in 2005 after he and his associate David Flynn broke into the home of 71-year-old Augustine Maduemezia in Manchester. Mr Maduemezia died after being punched in the face by Flynn. The joint enterprise law has also been used in a number of high profile cases - including to convict members of the gang who murdered Stephen Lawrence. But judges ruled it was wrong to treat ""foresight"" as a sufficient test. During his time in prison, Crilly started a law degree. When he heard about the overturning of the joint enterprise law in 2016, he believed it would apply to his case. He toldBBC Radio 5 livehe believes he should never have been convicted of murder in the first place. ""I wasn't a violent drug addict. I was lost. I was lost in drugs. I had a bad life, I've changed it, but I wasn't guilty of murder. I totally accept what I did and it was wrong. That's important to me. I'm not a murderer."" After appeal, Crilly pleaded guilty to manslaughter. After the ruling there were fears a slew of appeals from criminals challenging their convictions would come forward - but that has not yet materialised. Crilly pleaded guilty to manslaughter after his murder conviction was overturned Crilly said: ""If you take the foresight burden of proof away, and go on intent, which you're supposed to do, it's impossible to convict me of murder. So it's that simple really."" The family of Mr Maduemezia told the BBC they wanted to put the events behind them. Crilly said: ""If they ever want to meet me, I know it's going to be difficult but I'm prepared to do anything I can, I'm prepared to help them in any way, I am just sorry."" The BBC is aware of at least two other cases which are set to challenge a conviction for murder under joint enterprise. Mr Maduemezia's family said in a statement to the BBC: ""This incident had a devastating effect on the family who took a number of years to come to terms with their father's death. Augustine Maduemezia was murdered at his home in Manchester ""You can then imagine their anger and disappointment when they were informed by the police that Mr Crilly had launched a second appeal against his conviction (his first in 2007 failed). His appeal was granted at the High Court. ""It was sickening to hear that he was walking away without completing his sentence for his part in the murder of our father. ""These High Court rulings which lean too favourably towards the offenders and virtually casting aside the opinions, consideration and feelings of victims and their families, help to corrode and undermine public confidence in the justice system. ""We are led to understand that Crilly has turned his life around whilst in prison and has even acquired a law degree. At least he is alive. We wish him well but also wish that our father were alive and free to live his life. ""Despite these disappointments, the family has decided to move on. We are thankful to be public and fully appreciate their support throughout this ordeal.""

"Dr Kogan has said Facebook is using him as a scapegoat in the crisis The academic at the centre of the Facebook data scandal has said the social network is in full-on ""PR crisis mode"". Aleksandr Kogan's remarks came as he faced a grilling over his role from MPs. The social network was fully aware that its platform ""was being mined by thousands of others"", he said. He also rubbished Cambridge Analytica boss Alexander Nix's initial claims that it had not received data from him. ""That is a fabrication,"" he said. In a later clarification, Cambridge Analytica did admit that it had licensed data from the firm set up by Dr Kogan, although denied that the information was used in the US elections. At a press conference held after Dr Kogan's appearance before the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, Cambridge Analytica spokesman Clarence Mitchell said the company was ""no Bond villain"". Facebook explored unpicking users' personalities Facebook cuts off billions from privacy law Will technology destroy our democracy? ""Data analysis is commonly used for better targeting and is perfectly legitimate. It is not some Bond-like brainwashing as has been portrayed by some."" Dr Kogan was questioned by MPs about his role in the data harvesting row. He revealed that he had signed a non-disclosure agreement with Facebook, which prevented him from revealing some details about his relationship with the tech giant to the MPs. The Cambridge academic has become a central figure in the debate over whether the personal information of millions of Facebook users was used in US elections without their consent. During the committee hearing, he explained that he was approached by SCL - the parent firm of Cambridge Analytica - in spring 2014 about monetising an app he had developed at the University of Cambridge's Psychology Department. He set up a commercial entity - Global Science Research - and later developed the personality quiz My Digital Life for SCL, using a market research firm to recruit 200,000 people to take part. At the time, the social network's terms and conditions - which have since been changed - allowed developers to cull the details of all of these people's friends as well. ""Initially the conversations with SCL were about consulting services, survey designs and the interest in Facebook data grew out of that,"" he said. MPs grilled him on the relationship with business partner Joseph Chancellor, with whom he set up GSR and who is now employed by Facebook. ""Facebook has called your company a scam and a fraud. Is it not odd that they employ someone who by their admission has violated the platform's policies?"" asked committee chairman Damian Collins. ""I don't believe that they actually believe this. They know that their platform is being mined left and right by thousands of others,"" Dr Kogan replied. ""It is convenient to point the finger at my firm and call it a rogue agency,"" he added. He was asked whether the firm had been set up as a money-making exercise and replied that it had only received Â£230,000 in total. Initial payments of between Â£600,000 and Â£800,000 from SCL were used to pay those who agreed to take the quiz, he said. In written evidence presented ahead of the committee, Dr Kogan pointed out that the personality scores provided to Cambridge Analytica's parent firm SCL were ""highly inaccurate"". ""We estimate that we were right about all five traits for about 1% of the people."" He added that the data would not have been useful for micro-targeting ads on Facebook. Cambridge Analytica's suspended chief executive Alexander Nix has postponed another appearance before the DCMS committee Following his appearance, Cambridge Analytica broke its silence on the row with a press conference held in London. Spokesman Clarence Mitchell agreed that the data Dr Kogan had provided to the company had been ""virtually useless"". ""It was only just above random guessing in statistical terms,"" he said. He reiterated that the data had not been used in the US presidential campaign and that while Cambridge Analytica had pitched for work to both Vote Leave and Remain, it had undertaken no work for either side in the EU referendum campaign. He said the results of an independent inquiry into the company were due imminently. When questioned about the notable absence of currently suspended Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix, Mr Mitchell said he was ""not here to speak for him"". But he defended Mr Nix's decision to ""postpone"" an appearance in front of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee. ""He is keen and willing to speak to the DCMS committee but has been advised that he should not do so while an independent inquiry is ongoing."" On Thursday, Facebook's chief technology officer, Mike Schroepfer, will be questioned by the committee.

"Some of the biggest-selling artists of last year Streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music have become the biggest contributor to the music industry's coffers for the first time ever. In total, streaming generated $7.1bn (Â£5bn) in 2017, more than sales of CDs and vinyl. The number of people subscribing to a streaming service topped 176 million, up from 112 million a year before. The boom helped record labels chalk up a third consecutive year of growth, after 15 years of decline. According to the IFPI, which represents the global music industry, the music market was worth $17.3bn (Â£12.4bn) last year, up from $15.7bn the year before. However, it noted, this is only two-thirds of what the industry made at the peak of the CD era in 1999. British artists accounted for four of the Top 10 best-selling albums of 2017, with Ed Sheeran's Ã· topping the chart. The star's third album sold 6.1 million copies worldwide, more than twice as many as 2016's biggest-seller - Beyonce's Lemonade. And Bruno Mars's 90s throwback album 24k Magic made the Top 10 for a second year in a row, with sales of 1 million. ""We fought hard to get here,"" said Stu Bergen of Warner Music, ""but we are not getting complacent"". The chief challenge, said the IFPI, is getting fair compensation from websites like YouTube and Facebook, which currently argue they can't be held liable for any videos uploaded by their users which infringe on copyrighted material. ""There is a structural fault in the system,"" said Frances Moore, the organistion's chief executive. ""There's a mismatch between what platforms are making from [music] and what they're returning."" The IFPI is working to introduce legislation in Europe which would require these websites to offer greater compensation for musicians. ""We're definitely hopeful that, before Brexit, this legislation will be in place in Europe but also in place in the UK,"" Ms Moore told the BBC. However, Europe recorded the lowest growth of any major music market last year - up 4.3% compared to 17.5% in Latin America and 12.8% in the US. Ms Moore put this down to a slower uptake of streaming services in France and Germany, where fans have been reluctant to give up physical formats. ""In Germany, for example, it's an older population and they're very, very attached to their physical CDs,"" she said. ""It is happening, it's just happening at a slower rate."" Lagos-born star Wizkid is one of the biggest stars to emerge from Africa in recent years One of the fastest-growing territories is China - which saw revenues grow by 35% last year, making it the tenth-biggest music market last year. The industry is hopeful that tapping into previously-underserved markets like China, India, Africa and the Middle East will help sustain its recovery. ""Africa is particularly exciting,"" said Adam Granite of Universal Music. ""The potential for African repertoire to travel to other continents is enormous. ""We expect breakout superstar African talent to impact the world stage, and soon."" While artists like Fela Kuti, Miriam Makeba and Nigerian hip-hop star Wizkid have scored success outside Africa, Universal's recent acquisition of Kenyan label AI Records could produce a crossover hit in the vein of Luis Fonsi's Despacito. The industry's other great hope is voice-activated technology. Research shows that smart speakers are predominantly used to play music, while the technology could soon transform the way we play music in our cars. Mr Bergen said record labels were working with the likes of Amazon and Google to make voice commands more responsive and accurate. ""They are trying to accommodate local, colloquial speech as well as accents,"" he said.

"This video can not be played ""Anybody in his way, he would hit"": Witnesses recall Toronto van incident Canadian police are questioning a man suspected of driving a rented van into pedestrians in northern Toronto on Monday, killing 10 and injuring 15. Alek Minassian, 25, was not previously known to authorities, police said, adding that the incident appeared deliberate but no motive was clear. Mr Minassian was arrested after a tense standoff with a police officer. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the incident a ""senseless attack and a horrific tragedy"". The officer who arrested Mr Minassian was praised for not opening fire during a standoff with the suspect, who claimed to be armed and pointed an object at the officer. Video broadcast on CBC News showed the suspect shouting ""kill me"", while the officer instructs him to get down. When he said he had a gun, the officer said: ""I don't care. Get down."" He was then arrested without any shots being fired. He is due in court at 10:00 local time (14:00 GMT) on Tuesday. Speaking at a news conference on Tuesday, Mr Trudeau praised the police officers involved, who he said ""faced danger without a moment of hesitation"". How is Toronto attack suspect not dead? What we know about Alek Minassian Police said the suspect in the van mounted the kerb on Yonge Street between Finch Avenue and Sheppard Avenue at about 13:30 local time (17:30 GMT) on Monday and drove into pedestrians along a 1km (0.6-mile) stretch. Reza Hashemi, who owns a video shop on Yonge Street, told the BBC he heard screaming on the other side of the road. He said the van was repeatedly mounting the pavement and running into people. 'It was awful': What eyewitnesses saw One witness told City News that the driver was ""hitting anything that comes in the way"". ""People, fire hydrants, there's mail boxes being run over,"" said the unnamed man, who said he was driving behind the van during the incident. As the van continued, the man said he sounded his horn to try to warn pedestrians. ""I witnessed at least six, seven people being hit and flying in the air, like killed, on the street,"" he said. Suspect Alek Minassian is due to appear in court on Tuesday morning Pictures from the scene showed bodies covered in orange sheets along the van's route. Debris and items of clothing were scattered across the pavements and road. The van was brought to a halt by police several streets away and was quickly surrounded. The suspect was arrested 26 minutes after the first emergency call was made to the police. Police said Mr Minassian was from the northern Toronto suburb of Richmond Hill and was not previously known to authorities. ""The actions definitely looked deliberate,"" said Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders. Public safety minister Ralph Goodale said there ""would appear to be no national security connections"" and Canadian broadcaster CBC cited government officials as saying he was not associated with any known terror groups.

He would be seen walking around Thornlea Secondary School with his head down and hands clasped tightly together making meowing noises, Shereen Chami told Reuters. But she said Mr Minassian had not been violent. ""He wasn't a social person, but from what I remember he was absolutely harmless,"" she told Reuters. Emergency services flooded the area along Yonge Street Another former student,Ari Bluff, told CBC that Minassian did not seem to have many friends.,external""I remember seeing him probably just walking down the halls, usually by himself, or in the cafeteria by himself,"" he said. Mr Minassian went on to attend Seneca College in the North York area of Toronto, where the van incident took place, CBC reported. Reporter James Moore, with Newtalk 1010, told the BBC he had heard reports that Mr Minassian was regarded as being ""quite brilliant"". Canada's Globe and Mail quotes a fellow student as sayingMinassian was good at working with specialised computer chips used to process images.,external So far, the name of only one of those who died has emerged. She has been identified as Anne-Marie D'Amico, who worked for the US investment company, Invesco, CBC reports. The company's Canadian headquarters are on Yonge Street. A South Korean foreign ministry official told AFP news agency that two of its citizens were among the dead. The 15 injured remain in hospitals throughout Toronto. Van rental company Ryder System Inc confirmed that one of its vehicles was involved and said it was co-operating with authorities. The incident happened while foreign ministers of the G7 leading industrialised nations - Canada, the US, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan - were holding talks in Toronto. Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said the G7 meetings would continue on Tuesday as planned. ""The work of the ministers obviously goes on. This is a very sad day for the people of Toronto and the people of Canada,"" she said. City Mayor John Tory urged residents to remain calm.

"The Drax power station in North Yorkshire has been switching some furnaces from coal to biomass Britain has not generated electricity from coal for more than three days - the longest streak since the 1880s. The new record comes just days after the last record of 55 hours was set, National Grid said. The coal-free period began on Saturday at 1000 BST and has continued into Tuesday afternoon. Power generated from wind and gas dominated the mix of energy for users in England, Scotland and Wales. Just last week the UK grid recorded its first two-day period without using any power from the fossil fuel, which the government has pledged tophase out by 2025. UK's greenest year yet Coal plants to close by 2025 Coal accounted for less than 7% of the power mix last year, according to official figures. In April, 2017 Britain went itsfirst full day without coalsince the 19th century. A wind farm in mid-Wales However, experts warned that power generated by coal was largely being replaced by gas, another fossil fuel, rather than renewable sources. Andrew Crossland, of the Durham Energy Institute, said gas generated 40% of the UK's electricity and fuelled the vast majority of domestic heating: ""As a country we consume nearly eight times more gas than coal."" The daily consumption of gas wasoutstripped by wind on just two dayslast year, while all sources of renewable energy - including wind, solar, biomass and hydropower - beat fossil fuels for just 23 days of 2017. A reliance on gas made the UK vulnerable to the whims of international markets and was ""nowhere near clean enough"" to meet the UK's legal targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions, Mr Crossland said. The 2008 Climate Change Act requires greenhouse gas emissions to be reduced by 80% compared with 1990 levels by 2050. Hannah Martin, from Greenpeace UK, called on the government to provide more support for onshore wind and solar power - the ""cleanest and cheapest energy sources"". ""Offshore wind has proven to be popular and able to provide affordable clean energy, as well as skilled jobs and fair bills,"" she said. ""As we have more and more days without coal, we need to make sure it is replaced with the renewable technologies of the future."" Mr Crossland also called for more investment in renewable technologies, such as solar panels and batteries, to store power for homes and businesses, along with better energy efficiency to reduce power use.

"Sam Gyimah faced questions from MPs on support for disadvantaged students The universities minister says he could have been ""thrown out of university"" as a student at Oxford because he was unable to pay his rent. But Sam Gyimah says his college converted the rent into a loan, which he paid back after he left. The minister was speaking to MPs on the Education Select Committee who pressed him on why maintenance grants were not being re-introduced. Mr Gyimah told them how financial support had helped him to graduate. The minister was replying to a question from Thelma Walker, an MP on the committee, who said she would not have been able to stay at university and go on to be a teacher, without having a maintenance grant to support her. Mr Gyimah, a comprehensive school pupil who studied at Somerville College, Oxford, gave an example of how he had depended on a financial bailout. ""I would have been thrown out of university because I couldn't afford my rent. ""The only way I managed to survive and carry on was because the college converted my rent into a loan, which I paid when I left. ""Now, a personal anecdote is never the best foundation for policy - but I can describe my own experience as the first kind of maintenance loan which got me through university,"" he told MPs. 10 charts showing the impact of tuition fees Theresa May announces major review of cost of university Justine Greening calls for return of maintenance grants The degrees that make you rich... and the ones that don't Maintenance grants for disadvantaged students were scrapped by the government and replaced with loans, with interest rates that are set to rise to 6.3% from the autumn. It was a decision that was subsequently criticised by several former education secretaries, both Labour and Conservative. Mr Gyimah said that decisions on student funding would depend on the outcome of the government's review, which would report back ""early next year"". A review of the cost of university is due to report back early next year The minister was questioned by MPs on whether universities were really teaching more disadvantaged students than before tuition fees were increased in 2012. Committee chairman Robert Halfon called for a more ""honest"" debate about this - with MPs arguing that figures on recruiting disadvantaged students needed to include the collapse in part-time numbers. In the past decade, part-time student numbers have fallen by 61% - and MPs asked the minister how this might be tackled. Mr Halfon warned that there was still a ""major social injustice"" in access to university. Mr Gyimah said there had been ""deep-seated inequalities"" but that there were efforts to achieve a more ""level playing field"". But he warned that there was ""no silver bullet"". Despite concerns over fees, Mr Gyimah told MPs that graduates continued to have significantly higher earnings. The universities minister also complained that despite universities spending Â£860m per year on outreach and widening participation, there was no clear evidence of what was the most successful use of this investment. Mr Gyimah also told the committee that he wanted universities to be more transparent with students, giving the a detailed breakdown of how their tuition fees were being spent. ""Students are entitled to know,"" said the minister.

"Vodafone has been rated the worst mobile phone provider for the seventh year running in an annual customer survey by consumer lobby group Which?. The other leading providers, EE, O2 and Three, also scored badly, with service judged ""average"" and ""disappointing"". Of the small providers, Utility Warehouse ranked highest for value for money, incentives and customer service. Vodafone said improving services for customers was a top priority and it had been working hard to address the issue. It said in a statement: ""These findings published by Which? really don't match up with what our customers are telling us, with our own, independently verified customer satisfaction scores jumping 13 points from last year to their best ever level."" The survey by Which? asked 3,600 consumers,externalabout their service provider. The smaller networks that use the big four's infrastructure, known as mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), beat the big four on customer satisfaction and the likelihood that users would recommend the service to a friend. Vodafone had the worst customer score (49%) with one in six customers telling Which? they would not recommend it to a friend, compared with nine in 10 Utility Warehouse subscribers who said they would recommend their service. One in seven Vodafone customers also said they had received an unexpectedly expensive or incorrect bill, Which? said. The network was also rated worst for customer service. EE finished second from bottom. One in seven of the EE customers surveyed pay more than Â£50 a month for their contract, and Which? said it was not surprised that the service received a low score for value for money. Alex Neill, from Which?, said: ""Customers who are fed up should look to switch provider as soon as they can."" She pointed out that new reforms would soon mean that mobile customers would be able to switch provider by text message. Ms Neill said: ""We hope [this] will make it quicker and easier for customers to seek a better deal.""

"A statue commemorating the life of the suffragist, Millicent Fawcett, has been unveiled opposite Parliament. She campaigned for women's right to vote during the early 20th Century and is seen as one of the most influential feminists of the past 100 years. Prime Minister Theresa May paid tribute to the ""truly great"" campaigner's ""lasting impact"" after it was unveiled. The bronze casting, by the artist Gillian Wearing, is the first statue of a woman erected in Parliament Square. This video can not be played The moment the Fawcett statue was unveiled It features her holding a banner reading ""courage calls to courage everywhere"" and was commissioned as part of this year's centenary of the 1918 Representation of the People Act - which gave some women over the age of 30 the vote. After the statue was unveiled by local schoolchildren, Mrs May said: ""I would not be standing here today as prime minister, no female MPs would have taken their seats in Parliament, none of us would have had the rights and protections we now enjoy, were it not for one truly great woman - Dame Millicent Garrett Fawcett."" Plaque unveiled for suffragist Fawcett Suffragists or suffragettes - who won women the vote? Suffragette tributes shared online Reality Check: Where are all the statues of women? It followed a campaign by the feminist writer and activist Caroline Criado Perez, who also led last year's successful effort to get Jane Austen to appear on the Â£10 note. She said she came up with the idea for the statue when she was out running on International Women's Day in 2016 and realised the only historical figures commemorated there were men. Theresa May, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan and Caroline Criado Perez watch the unveiling Labour's leader and deputy leader were among politicians at the official unveiling Members of the public also attended the ceremony The 11 existing statues in Parliament Square are of Nelson Mandela, Abraham Lincoln, Mahatma Gandhi, former prime minister of South Africa Jan Smuts and former British prime ministers Sir Winston Churchill, Sir Robert Peel, David Lloyd George, Viscount Palmerston, Earl of Derby Edward Stanley, Earl of Beaconsfield Benjamin Disraeli and George Canning. Ms Criado Perez launched the campaign for a Fawcett statue from her phone, as she sat on a bench outside Buckingham Palace at the end of her run. Asked how it felt to see the statue being unveiled just two years after launching the petition, she said: ""I can't really take the whole thing in. It's too big really to contemplate that it's finally happening."" By Brian Wheeler in Parliament Square Some of the hundreds of women and men who gathered to watch the unveiling ceremony were simply there to witness a moment in history. ""It is very important to me to see a woman in Parliament Square. It has taken a long time,"" said student Poppy Sharpe, who was there with her friend Macushla Savvides (pictured above). Boys grow up seeing that they can become someone immortalised as a statue, said Emma Camp, but girls don't: ""It's about role models."" But for others it was a chance to stress that the battle for equality fought by Millicent Fawcett and the other suffragists is far from over. The 50:50 campaign, which calls for equal representation in Parliament, was out in force. ""We need more statues of women, but we also need more women writing statutes,"" said the group's Frances Scott. Tsitsi Matekaire, of the Equality Now campaign, said she hoped it would highlight to global struggle for rights for women and girls. Jeanne Rathbone, wearing her Votes For Women sash, wanted to highlight her campaign for a statue of Anglo-Irish suffragist Charlotte Despord in South London. How much had she known about Fawcett before the campaign for a statue? ""She was one of my heroines - not the Pankhursts. She stayed with the fight the whole way through and it is about time she was honoured."" Discussing how Gillian Wearing was selected to create the statue, Ms Criado Perez said: ""Other designers and artists just didn't get it like Gillian did. For me, it was very important (Millicent) was middle aged. ""I wanted her to be standing there not at all sexualised, but statesmanlike. We wanted the statue to be her at a meaningful age, so we chose when she was awarded a brooch from the NUWSS (National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies) at 50 years old. ""She's directly facing Parliament with her placard, so the MPs can see her everyday and think, 'I should probably go and sort that problem out'."" Ms Criado Perez said she would ""like to see more statues overall and more representations of women in public art, specifically women who have existed in the past"". ""The more that I read about the amazing women that have come before me, the more angry I am about why I didn't know about them - why aren't there statues of these people?"" she added. This video can not be played Caroline Criado-Perez: 'If she were a man she'd have hundreds of statues' Born in 1847, she was a pioneering feminist, intellectual and union leader who campaigned for women's right to vote She was a suffragist - not a suffragette She shared the same aims as the suffragettes - the more radical group led by Emmeline Pankhurst - but favoured non-violent protest In 1897 she formed the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies She also played a key role in the founding of Newnham College, the second Cambridge university college to admit women In 1902, she led an all-female investigation into the appalling conditions in British concentration camps in South Africa, during the Boer War Dame Millicent died in 1929, a year after women were granted the vote on equal terms to men Speaking before the unveiling of the statue, at a private viewing, London Mayor Sadiq Khan said: ""When you think of the great people in Parliament Square and when you realise that not one of them is a woman, it sort of begs the question, are we saying there haven't been incredible women in the past? That our country hasn't been built on the back of great women?"" ""The whole process - from petition to project manager - has been made up of solely women. That should make us all incredibly proud."" He added:  ""Londoners are going to love it. They will be blown away.""

"Palma has long been a key destination for tourists but residents say they want better regulation The Spanish resort city of Palma, on the island of Majorca, is to ban flat owners from renting their apartments to travellers, becoming the first place in Spain to introduce such a measure. The restrictions follow complaints from residents of rising rents due to short holiday lets through websites and apps. Palma's mayor says the ban, to be introduced in July, will be a model for cities suffering with mass tourism. But business associations say many families will be financially impacted. It was not immediately clear if the ban was restricted only to private flats advertised by their owners on apps or websites. Houses and chalets will be exempt from the restrictions unless they are located inside protected areas, next to the airport or in industrial zones. Palma, like many other cities around the world, has seen an increase in visitor numbers driven, in part, by private rental accommodation offered through websites and apps. Officials from the local left-wing governing coalition cited a study suggesting that the number of non-licensed apartments on offer to tourists increased by 50% between 2015 and 2017. According to Spanish newspaper El PaÃ­s, only 645 of 11,000 holiday rentals being offered to tourists on Palma have the licence required to do so.,external 'Tourists go home': Leftists resist Spain's influx Five places tackling too many visitors Locally, there is resentment over tourism pushing up prices - rents in Palma have reportedly increased 40% since 2013 - but also about deteriorating conditions in neighbourhoods popular with travellers due to noise and bad behaviour. ""Palma is a determined and courageous city,"" Mayor Antoni Noguera said. ""We agreed on this [ban] based on the general interest [of the city] and we believe it will set the trend for other cities when they see that finding a balance is key."" Some groups warn that the restrictions could result in job losses JosÃ© Hila, Palma's chief of urban planning, said: ""There is a parallel between the evolution of vacation rentals and the rise in rental prices. ""All European cities are being transformed overnight by this type of offer. We need some order. There will be vacation rental in Palma, but only where there needs to be."" Last year, Palma banned the advertisement of non-licensed flats, including hefty fines for owners and apps flouting the rules. Barcelona has taken similar action. A record 82 million foreign tourists visited Spain last year, with Catalonia and the Balearic Islands - which include Majorca, Menorca, Ibiza and Formentera - being the top destinations. Joan Forteza, president of Palma's federation of neighbourhood associations, welcomed the announcement, which followed a petition with more than 6,000 signatures,the Diario de Mallorca newspaper reports (in Spanish).,external But Pimeco, a local organisation representing small businesses, said the holiday rentals had ""boosted consumption"" and were an ""important source of income"" to many flat owners.

"Jeremy Corbyn is in a crunch meeting with Jewish leaders to discuss what steps he has taken to address anti-Semitism in the Labour Party. The Jewish Leadership Council and Board of Deputies of British Jews say the Labour leader has been slow to act on the recommendations ofa 2016 report,external. They want disciplinary cases speeded up and Mr Corbyn to use his ""personal authority"" to drive cultural change. Mr Corbyn has repeatedly promised to take action against anti-Semitism. Ahead of the meeting, he said it was an ""uncomfortable fact"" that a small number of Labour members held anti-Semitic views, and repeated his apology for the ""hurt and distress caused"". Writing in the London Evening Standardhe said Labour was,externaltaking action, with more than 20 members suspended in the past fortnight, adding: ""But we have not done enough to get to grips with the problem, and the Jewish community and our Jewish members deserve an apology. ""My party and I are sorry for the hurt and distress caused."" How widespread is anti-Semitism in the UK? Corbyn sorry over Labour anti-Semitism MPs applauded after anti-Semitism speeches Mr Corbyn has been accused by Jewish groups, and some of his own MPs, who took part in a protest in Parliament Square last month, of not taking the issue seriously enough. The Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Jewish Leadership Council accepted Mr Corbyn's request for a meeting on the condition that he would discuss their demands for action. These include: Mr Corbyn to take ""personal responsibility"" for the work being undertaken by the party to tackle anti-Semitism and to resolve cases to a ""fixed timescale"" A ban on Labour members and MPs sharing platforms ""with people who have been suspended or expelled for anti-Semitism"" Improved education about anti-Semitism, including a ""clear list of unacceptable language"" An independent ombudsman to oversee efforts to tackle anti-Semitism in Labour, with regular updates to be given to the party and to Jewish community leaders A commitment from Mr Corbyn to publicly back MPs who were criticised for attending a protest rally against Labour anti-Semitism Labour's shadow international development secretary Andrew Gwynne said: ""I think what we have now got to do - and we have got an issue in the Labour Party - we have got to acknowledge that that problem exists and, for some, that is a challenge. ""For me, the Labour Party was created to fight injustice, to fight against prejudice, to fight against hatred, and that we are where we are really hurts me, so we have got to act."" He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme Mr Corbyn's job as leader of the Labour Party was to help ""rebuild confidence in the Jewish community"". Mr Gwynne acknowledged that the party's disciplinary process had taken ""far, far too long"" in deciding cases such as former London mayor Ken Livingstone. Mr Livingstone has been suspended since 2016 for claiming Adolf Hitler supported a Jewish homeland in the 1930s. A succession of Labour MPs demanded action from Mr Corbyn in a Commons debate last week, speaking about the abuse they had suffered and warning anti-Semitism had become much more marked in recent years. A2016 report by Labour peer Shami Chakrabarti,externalcalled for action to address what it said was the ""occasionally toxic atmosphere"" in the party, but it has yet to be implemented in full. Holocaust survivor Susan Pollack called for Mr Corbyn to show leadership in tackling anti-Semitism. ""He has to act and he has to show his leadership, and then I think that's the only way we will have respect,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today. Some supporters of Mr Corbyn have warned the issue is being used by his critics to attack him for political reasons. Jenny Manson, co-chair of the Corbyn-supporting Jewish Voice for Labour, said ""none of us in my group have ever experienced any anti-Semitism in the Labour Party"" and warned against a ""witch hunt"". She acknowledged there was ""some anti-Semitism"" in Labour, as it was in ""all parties""  - but there was ""no evidence"" it had got worse under Mr Corbyn's leadership. She called for the Chakrabarti report to be implemented but added that the Jewish Leadership Council and the Board of Deputies were not Labour Party organisations and did not represent all Jewish people. A separate round table event organised by Mr Corbyn on Wednesday has been postponed. Jewish groups had said they would boycott it amid concerns about the inclusion of the pro-Corbyn group Jewish Voice for Labour. The organisation has accused opponents of using the anti-Semitism claims to damage the Labour leader.

"An epilepsy drug that can damage unborn babies must no longer be prescribed to girls and women of childbearing age in the UK unless they sign a form to say that they understand the risks. Drug regulator the MHRA says the new measures it's introducing will keep future generations of children safe. Those already on valproate medication should see their GP to have their treatment reviewed. No woman or girl should stop taking it without medical advice though. It is thought about 20,000 children in the UK have been left with disabilities caused by valproate since the drug was introduced in the 1970s. Affected families havecalled for a public inquiry and compensation. Epilepsy charitiessay one in five women on sodium valproate are unaware that taking it during pregnancy can harm the development and physical health of an unborn baby. This warning has been on the outside of valproate pill packets since 2016 in Britain And more than one in four have not been given information about risks for their unborn child. The MHRA has changed the licence for valproate, which means any doctor prescribing it will have to ensure female patients are put on a Pregnancy Prevention Programme, which means: The patient can see her doctor every year to discuss the risks of this drug to an unborn baby She signs an acknowledgement form at least every year She is told about the importance of using contraception throughout treatment and having a pregnancy test if she thinks she could be pregnant If valproate is taken during pregnancy, up to four in 10 babies are at risk of developmental disorders, and approximately one in 10 are at risk of birth defects. Dr June Raine, from the MHRA, said: ""Patient safety is our highest priority. We are committed to making sure women and girls are aware of the very real risks of taking valproate during pregnancy. However, we also know it is vitally important women don't stop taking valproate without first discussing it with their doctor. ""I would like to particularly thank the families involved in the Valproate Stakeholder Network who have shared their experiences and expertise with us. Their support will help keep future generations of children safe."" Simon Wigglesworth, deputy chief executive of Epilepsy Action, said: ""We know there are still far too many women who haven't been made aware of the potential risks of taking sodium valproate in pregnancy.

"Adie the horse being rescued Horses are regularly being ""fly-tipped"" and left to die by irresponsible owners, the RSPCA has told the Victoria Derbyshire programme. One mare had been dumped by the side of the road while trying to give birth, it said. The mother and foal both died. The charity said the problem was partly that horses were cheap to buy but expensive to maintain, especially if they needed veterinary care. It said prosecution cases involving horses had risen by 25% since 2015. RSPCA chief inspector Sam Garvey said it had taken care of horses that had been ""literally dumped down dirt tracks along with the rubbish"". ""[The owners had] taken their rubbish out to fly-tip and at the same time taken a sick and injured horse along with it,"" she explained. ""And we've gone out to calls and not been able to see the horse until we've literally rifled through the rubbish."" This horse survived after being rescued from a lake Almost 1,000 horses were rescued by the RSPCA in England and Wales last year, the highest number for four years. The animal welfare charity described it as a ""horse crisis"" and said some owners felt it was not worth paying a vet to treat an ill horse, or put the animal to sleep and dispose of the body. Ms Garvey said she had also rescued a Shetland pony from a 19th floor flat in London, whose owner had taken it there via the lift. A report published in 2015 estimated that there were nearly 800,000 horses in the UK.,external The RSPCA runs private stables which nurses rescued horses back to health. It is currently caring for more than 850. One of those currently being treated is Adie, who was found collapsed and covered in mud on a footpath on New Year's Eve. It is thought he had become ill, so his owner had dumped him there to die. ""It took five people to try and get him up. ""It was very touch and go - often when a horse goes down it's the end, so you have to put a lot of hard work and time and effort to get them back on their feet,"" said Ms Garvey. Adie has now been nursed back to health Ms Garvey said she had seen horses being sold online ""cheaper than a kitten"". ""There were horses for as cheap as Â£25, horses for free, 'buy the mare, get the foal for free'. [It's] horrifying."" She compared this with the cost of treating a horse with colic, which can be as much as Â£4,000 to Â£5,000. Prosecutions involving horses have risen by 25% in the last two years, to 225 in 2017. The charity said people who were finding their animals too expensive to look after should seek professional advice, from either local instructors or charities.

"Government borrowing has fallen to its lowest annual level in 11 years, according to the latest official figures. Borrowing fell by Â£3.5bn to Â£42.6bn in the 2017-18 financial year, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. That was below the estimate of Â£45.2bn produced by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility last month. Borrowing narrowed to 2.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) last year, down from 10% in 2010. However, total public debt as a percentage of GDP edged up to 86.3%, up from 85.3% the year before. In cash terms it stands at Â£1.798 trillion. The figures are the first provisional estimates of the last financial year. The ONS stressed they would be revised as more data becomes available. March's deficit was Â£1.3bn, well below a forecast for a gap of Â£3.25bn. The borrowing figure does not include the amount spent on supporting the state-owned banks. Mr Hammond has kept the broad aim of the previous chancellor, George Osborne, of reducing the gap between spending and borrowing, although he has eased off on the pace of cut-backs. Mr Hammond said: ""Thanks to the hard work of the British people, borrowing is the lowest in over a decade. Our economy is at a turning point with debt starting to fall and people's wages rising, as we build an economy that truly works for everyone."" Philip Hammond welcomed the news - his target is to eliminate the deficit by the middle of the next decade. But the chancellor also knows that a lower deficit creates its own challenges. And a test for the type of politician he is. The figures will increase calls for the Treasury to signal a significant increase in public spending at the Autumn Budget - with the NHS in England and Wales the priority. That is something Mr Hammond signalled he would do at the Spring Statement last month, if the deficit was below target. Which it now is. But many in the Treasury believe that now is not the time to turn on the spending taps and that the focus should remain on reducing the deficit. Particularly while the economic headwinds of a sluggish economy and possible Brexit risk remain. Read more here: But Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the figures did not necessarily indicate an improving economy: ""Rapidly falling public borrowing continues to reflect sharp falls in spending, rather than a reviving economy. ""Lower borrowing in March than last year primarily reflected a Â£1.0bn decline in interest payments and a Â£1.4bn reduction in Local Authority borrowing. Both these expenditure components are volatile and tell us little about the underlying health of the economy."" John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, said: ""The key challenge facing the chancellor in his Budget in November will be how to trade-off growing political pressures to ease austerity against his desire to get the debt ratio down as far as possible. ""The undershoot in the deficit this year has given the chancellor a little more wriggle room, but it does not alter the fundamental strategic choice he will need to make in November.""

"An epilepsy drug that can damage unborn babies must no longer be prescribed to girls and women of childbearing age in the UK unless they sign a form to say that they understand the risks. Drug regulator the MHRA says the new measures it's introducing will keep future generations of children safe. Those already on valproate medication should see their GP to have their treatment reviewed. No woman or girl should stop taking it without medical advice though. It is thought about 20,000 children in the UK have been left with disabilities caused by valproate since the drug was introduced in the 1970s. Affected families havecalled for a public inquiry and compensation. Epilepsy charitiessay one in five women on sodium valproate are unaware that taking it during pregnancy can harm the development and physical health of an unborn baby. This warning has been on the outside of valproate pill packets since 2016 in Britain And more than one in four have not been given information about risks for their unborn child. The MHRA has changed the licence for valproate, which means any doctor prescribing it will have to ensure female patients are put on a Pregnancy Prevention Programme, which means: The patient can see her doctor every year to discuss the risks of this drug to an unborn baby She signs an acknowledgement form at least every year She is told about the importance of using contraception throughout treatment and having a pregnancy test if she thinks she could be pregnant If valproate is taken during pregnancy, up to four in 10 babies are at risk of developmental disorders, and approximately one in 10 are at risk of birth defects. Dr June Raine, from the MHRA, said: ""Patient safety is our highest priority. We are committed to making sure women and girls are aware of the very real risks of taking valproate during pregnancy. However, we also know it is vitally important women don't stop taking valproate without first discussing it with their doctor. ""I would like to particularly thank the families involved in the Valproate Stakeholder Network who have shared their experiences and expertise with us. Their support will help keep future generations of children safe."" Simon Wigglesworth, deputy chief executive of Epilepsy Action, said: ""We know there are still far too many women who haven't been made aware of the potential risks of taking sodium valproate in pregnancy. ""It is vitally important that healthcare professionals ensure that all women with epilepsy taking sodium valproate are reviewed in line with the new guidelines.""

"This video can not be played John Crilly had his murder conviction quashed after a landmark challenge. A man has been released from prison after becoming the first person since 2016 to have a joint enterprise murder conviction quashed. Joint enterprise is used to convict defendants in gang-related cases even if they did not strike the fatal blow, but could have foreseen violent acts by their associates. But in 2016,Supreme Court judges said the law had been wrongly interpreted. John Crilly has been released after serving 13 years in prison. He was given a life sentence for murder and robbery in 2005 after he and his associate David Flynn broke into the home of 71-year-old Augustine Maduemezia in Manchester. Mr Maduemezia died after being punched in the face by Flynn. The joint enterprise law has also been used in a number of high profile cases - including to convict members of the gang who murdered Stephen Lawrence. But judges ruled it was wrong to treat ""foresight"" as a sufficient test. During his time in prison, Crilly started a law degree. When he heard about the overturning of the joint enterprise law in 2016, he believed it would apply to his case. He toldBBC Radio 5 livehe believes he should never have been convicted of murder in the first place. ""I wasn't a violent drug addict. I was lost. I was lost in drugs. I had a bad life, I've changed it, but I wasn't guilty of murder. I totally accept what I did and it was wrong. That's important to me. I'm not a murderer."" After appeal, Crilly pleaded guilty to manslaughter. After the ruling there were fears a slew of appeals from criminals challenging their convictions would come forward - but that has not yet materialised. Crilly pleaded guilty to manslaughter after his murder conviction was overturned Crilly said: ""If you take the foresight burden of proof away, and go on intent, which you're supposed to do, it's impossible to convict me of murder. So it's that simple really."" The family of Mr Maduemezia told the BBC they wanted to put the events behind them. Crilly said: ""If they ever want to meet me, I know it's going to be difficult but I'm prepared to do anything I can, I'm prepared to help them in any way, I am just sorry."" The BBC is aware of at least two other cases which are set to challenge a conviction for murder under joint enterprise. Mr Maduemezia's family said in a statement to the BBC: ""This incident had a devastating effect on the family who took a number of years to come to terms with their father's death. Augustine Maduemezia was murdered at his home in Manchester ""You can then imagine their anger and disappointment when they were informed by the police that Mr Crilly had launched a second appeal against his conviction (his first in 2007 failed). His appeal was granted at the High Court. ""It was sickening to hear that he was walking away without completing his sentence for his part in the murder of our father. ""These High Court rulings which lean too favourably towards the offenders and virtually casting aside the opinions, consideration and feelings of victims and their families, help to corrode and undermine public confidence in the justice system. ""We are led to understand that Crilly has turned his life around whilst in prison and has even acquired a law degree. At least he is alive. We wish him well but also wish that our father were alive and free to live his life. ""Despite these disappointments, the family has decided to move on.

"Matt Campbell, on the right, was running his second marathon in two weeks Thousands of people have pledged to ""finish"" the London Marathon in honour of MasterChef contestant Matt Campbell who died 3.7 miles short of the finish. More than Â£116,000 has so far been donated to the charity the 29-year-old from Kendal was running for. The MasterChef semi-finalist collapsed at the 22.5 mile mark of Sunday's race. More than 2,000 people have now signed up to a ""Finish for Matt,external"" Facebook page, pledging to run the miles he was unable to. Mr Campbell was running in memory of his late father and hoped to raise Â£2,500 for the Cumbria-based Brathay Trust. A total of Â£116,217 has been raised from more than 8,372 separate donations. Matt Campbell was described as one of Britain's most exciting young chefs Mr Campbell appeared on the BBC's MasterChef: The Professionals in December 2017 and reached the semi-finals. Hundreds of social media tributes have been paid to the chef, described as ""lovely and kind-hearted"" by family and friends. Writing on the Facebook group, runner Matt Dorber said: ""This has been mainly set up as part of the London Marathon training group. ""Four thousand of us have given each other advice and support over the last few months, and a small gesture of solidarity would be to 'finish' the run for Matt. ""It may be in London, Somerset, Manchester, where ever you are, but if as many people can do a 3.7m run and give Â£5 to Matt's Justgiving page, I think that'd be a nice gesture from us as a group."" Promises of support quickly appeared on social media, with many making additional donations. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Campbell began his career working in Michelin-starred restaurants having finished second in the BBC's Young Chef of the Year in 2009. A spokesman for the Brathay Trust, which works with vulnerable young people, said: ""He was a real creative chef and one of the things he was very keen on doing was sharing that knowledge with young chefs who wanted to get involved in the industry. ""He was such a great athlete and also a wonderful supporter of Brathay."" London Marathon hottest on record Broken leg runner thanks 'heroes' Watch: London Marathon helps struggling rival to finish This year's marathon, which had 40,000 runners, was officially the hottest on record, with temperatures reaching 24.1C (73.3F) according to the Met Office. Runners were warned it could be even hotter on the course because of the heat absorbed by the roads and from other competitors. Event director Hugh Brasher said organisers distributed four and a half litres of water per person - more than any other mass participation event in the world. However, he confirmed water did run out at miles eight, nine and 10. Provisional figures indicate 110 runners required hospital treatment, compared with 2011 when temperatures reached 22C and 104 were taken to hospital, he said. Extra water was provided for runners because of the hot weather Mr Brasher added the event was ""planned thoroughly"" and organisers would see what lessons could be learnt for next year. But he said it was too early to speculate on the exact cause of Mr Campbell's death. He said: ""We really don't want to speculate what was the cause of his death. We don't know. ""An autopsy will be carried out and, as a result of that autopsy, we will find out. ""Our thoughts are just with his family and friends at the moment and giving them the support that they need.""

Gun salutes across London have marked the arrival of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's third child. The couple's second son was born on Mondayat the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital, London, weighing 8lb 7oz. The new prince, whose name has yet to be revealed, has been receiving his first visitors at Kensington Palace. What might the new prince be called? Royal fanatics celebrate outside hospital What happens when you grow up third? His arrival was celebrated with traditional gun salutes from the Tower of London and Hyde Park, which are used to mark every birth of a prince or princess. Westminster Abbey also marked the occasion with bell ringing - a tradition for significant royal occasions. Catherine's sister Pippa was among the first visitors to Kensington Palace, where she met her nephew for the first time. Pippa Middleton was among the first to visit the new prince The Honourable Artillery Company fire a 62-gun salute at the Tower of London The King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery fire a 41-gun salute from Hyde Park In a statement released by Clarence House, Prince Charles said: ""We are both [the Duchess of Cornwall and I] so pleased at the news.

Royal Family tree and line of succession The babies born same day as royal baby The palace said a name would be revealed in due course but for the time being a formal notice of the birth of the child has been placed on the forecourt of Buckingham Palace. Arthur, James, Philip and Albert are among the bookies' favourites. The prince's siblings, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, visited their younger brother in hospital on Monday. This video can not be played Royal births past and present The duchess was admitted to the Lindo Wing at about 06:00 BST on Monday with the birth being announced shortly after 13:00 BST. Crowds had gathered outside the hospital in Paddington, with some well-wishers having camped out for more than two weeks. As Prince William left with his new son, he said the couple were very happy and joked he would have ""thrice the worry now"". While the new prince settled into life as a royal Prince William brought Charlotte and George to meet their younger brother Shortly after the couple were greeted by a smiling and cheering crowd as they left hospital In 2013, the law changed which allows Princess Charlotte to keep her place as fourth in line to the throne. Before, younger royal males would have overtaken their older sisters. To become King or Queen as the third-born royal child is rare - and has yet to happen within the current House of Windsor. But the third child of George III and Queen Charlotte, William IV, took on the task and ruled from 1830 to 1837. The Hanoverian king acceded to the throne aged 64 when his older brother, George IV, died without an heir. He became next in line when he was 62 and his other older brother, Frederick, Duke of York, died. Royal births past and present.

"TSB's IT fiasco is heading for a fifth day, with angry customers still locked out of their accounts and unable to make payments. The bank said it would take down its mobile app and online banking ""for a few hours"" on Tuesday and hoped to restore services by the afternoon. But it now looks unlikely the issues will be resolved until Wednesday. Chief executive Paul Pester said he was ""deeply sorry"" for the chaos and that no one would be left out of pocket. The bank's data breach on Sunday, which allowed some TSB customers to see other people's account details, has also attracted the attention of the Information Commissioner. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Pester said: ""This isn't the level of service that we pride ourselves on providing, and isn't what our customers have come to expect from TSB, and for that I'm deeply sorry."" 'TSB gave me someone else's Â£35,000' People are beginning to report a wide range of financial problems caused by being unable to access their account online. Colin Patterson of Manchester told the BBC: ""The lack of an official statement, other than generic Twitter replies, is outrageous."" He's been trying to pay for his passport renewal for three days and reports that ""it keeps being rejected"". ""I get paid tomorrow and don't know if I'll be able to pay my rent. It's a disgrace."" Trevor Brittain from Tonbridge said: ""I've been with the same branch for 42 years. It was Lloyds but transferred to TSB at the sell-off. I will be switching back to Lloyds as soon as I can get access to my account."" Jessica Callaghan from Newcastle said: ""I'm angry because they aren't communicating. They just keep saying, 'sorry, it'll be back up shortly'. I want them to give an official statement about what is happening, and compensation for each customer."" Photographer Paul Clarke is worried the TSB problems will hit his business London photographer Paul Clarke is worried that his business will be hit if the situation isn't resolved soon. ""I have no idea who's paid me recently and I can't pay suppliers,"" he told the BBC. ""If we get to the middle of the week and it's still not resolved then my reputation and business could suffer as I work on a quick turnaround. It's a fiasco."" Amanda Verbaan-Dunn, owner of the Wilton Hotel in Blackpool, said: ""I'm away from home and can't pay my staff. I'm going to have to go back three days early so I can sort my staff out. It's extremely frustrating and the lack of communication is inexcusable."" Former Grange Hill star Lee MacDonald said his business ""has literally stopped"" Lee MacDonald, who played Zammo in children's TV show Grange Hill in the 1980s, told the BBC he has had an ""absolute nightmare"" following TSB's IT glitches. Mr MacDonald, who now runs Mentor Lock and Safe Company in Wallington, Surrey, told BBC Radio 5 live: ""I'm having an absolute nightmare.  I've got two accounts with TSB, both business accounts.  My business has literally stopped.  I don't know what money's coming in, what's coming out. ""When you're running a small business, every job counts and it's just a nightmare."" Roger Harris, a TSB customer who has been locked out of his account, was recently sent these letters by the bank When TSB split from the Lloyds Banking Group, it continued to rent a banking platform from its former owner while it developed its own ""state-of-the-art"" platform. That was ready to go live last weekend and TSB moved its customers' data from the Lloyds' platform to its own. This was a long-planned disruption to the service and the bank said it informed customers of the change and that it would lead to them being unable to use online banking or payment systems at the weekend. It promised that systems would be back up and running by 6pm on Sunday but many of those who did get access to their online accounts were presented with details of other people's accounts too. Since that data breach many customers have reported being unable to log on, while those that have been able to log on say there have been problems with passwords or that they have been logged out. The Financial Conduct Authority, which has the power to fine banks for system failures, said it was in ""regular contact"" with TSB. ""We are working with the firm to ensure customers are properly communicated with and are not left out of pocket."" ""We will be talking to the firm to understand exactly what went wrong and the steps that they are taking to ensure something like this does not happen again,"" a spokesperson said. The Information Commissioner's Office also said it was ""making enquiries"" about a ""potential data breach"". Nicky Morgan MP, chair of the Treasury Committee, weighed into the crisis on Tuesday by writing to TSB boss Paul Pester to find out what has gone wrong, the extent of the failure, and how the bank intends to compensate customers who have suffered a breach of potentially highly-sensitive personal data. Mrs Morgan said: ""It simply isn't good enough to expose customers to IT failures, including delays in paying bills and an inability to access their own money. ""Warm words and platitudes will not suffice. TSB customers deserve to know what has happened, when normal services will resume, and how they can expect to be compensated.""

"This video can not be played John Crilly had his murder conviction quashed after a landmark challenge. A man has been released from prison after becoming the first person since 2016 to have a joint enterprise murder conviction quashed. Joint enterprise is used to convict defendants in gang-related cases even if they did not strike the fatal blow, but could have foreseen violent acts by their associates. But in 2016,Supreme Court judges said the law had been wrongly interpreted. John Crilly has been released after serving 13 years in prison. He was given a life sentence for murder and robbery in 2005 after he and his associate David Flynn broke into the home of 71-year-old Augustine Maduemezia in Manchester. Mr Maduemezia died after being punched in the face by Flynn. The joint enterprise law has also been used in a number of high profile cases - including to convict members of the gang who murdered Stephen Lawrence. But judges ruled it was wrong to treat ""foresight"" as a sufficient test. During his time in prison, Crilly started a law degree. When he heard about the overturning of the joint enterprise law in 2016, he believed it would apply to his case. He toldBBC Radio 5 livehe believes he should never have been convicted of murder in the first place. ""I wasn't a violent drug addict. I was lost. I was lost in drugs. I had a bad life, I've changed it, but I wasn't guilty of murder. I totally accept what I did and it was wrong. That's important to me. I'm not a murderer."" After appeal, Crilly pleaded guilty to manslaughter. After the ruling there were fears a slew of appeals from criminals challenging their convictions would come forward - but that has not yet materialised. Crilly pleaded guilty to manslaughter after his murder conviction was overturned Crilly said: ""If you take the foresight burden of proof away, and go on intent, which you're supposed to do, it's impossible to convict me of murder. So it's that simple really."" The family of Mr Maduemezia told the BBC they wanted to put the events behind them. Crilly said: ""If they ever want to meet me, I know it's going to be difficult but I'm prepared to do anything I can, I'm prepared to help them in any way, I am just sorry."" The BBC is aware of at least two other cases which are set to challenge a conviction for murder under joint enterprise. Mr Maduemezia's family said in a statement to the BBC: ""This incident had a devastating effect on the family who took a number of years to come to terms with their father's death. Augustine Maduemezia was murdered at his home in Manchester ""You can then imagine their anger and disappointment when they were informed by the police that Mr Crilly had launched a second appeal against his conviction (his first in 2007 failed). His appeal was granted at the High Court. ""It was sickening to hear that he was walking away without completing his sentence for his part in the murder of our father. ""These High Court rulings which lean too favourably towards the offenders and virtually casting aside the opinions, consideration and feelings of victims and their families, help to corrode and undermine public confidence in the justice system. ""We are led to understand that Crilly has turned his life around whilst in prison and has even acquired a law degree. At least he is alive. We wish him well but also wish that our father were alive and free to live his life. ""Despite these disappointments, the family has decided to move on. We are thankful to be public and fully appreciate their support throughout this ordeal.""

"A statue commemorating the life of the suffragist, Millicent Fawcett, has been unveiled opposite Parliament. She campaigned for women's right to vote during the early 20th Century and is seen as one of the most influential feminists of the past 100 years. Prime Minister Theresa May paid tribute to the ""truly great"" campaigner's ""lasting impact"" after it was unveiled. The bronze casting, by the artist Gillian Wearing, is the first statue of a woman erected in Parliament Square. This video can not be played The moment the Fawcett statue was unveiled It features her holding a banner reading ""courage calls to courage everywhere"" and was commissioned as part of this year's centenary of the 1918 Representation of the People Act - which gave some women over the age of 30 the vote. After the statue was unveiled by local schoolchildren, Mrs May said: ""I would not be standing here today as prime minister, no female MPs would have taken their seats in Parliament, none of us would have had the rights and protections we now enjoy, were it not for one truly great woman - Dame Millicent Garrett Fawcett."" Plaque unveiled for suffragist Fawcett Suffragists or suffragettes - who won women the vote? Suffragette tributes shared online Reality Check: Where are all the statues of women? It followed a campaign by the feminist writer and activist Caroline Criado Perez, who also led last year's successful effort to get Jane Austen to appear on the Â£10 note. She said she came up with the idea for the statue when she was out running on International Women's Day in 2016 and realised the only historical figures commemorated there were men. Theresa May, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan and Caroline Criado Perez watch the unveiling Labour's leader and deputy leader were among politicians at the official unveiling Members of the public also attended the ceremony The 11 existing statues in Parliament Square are of Nelson Mandela, Abraham Lincoln, Mahatma Gandhi, former prime minister of South Africa Jan Smuts and former British prime ministers Sir Winston Churchill, Sir Robert Peel, David Lloyd George, Viscount Palmerston, Earl of Derby Edward Stanley, Earl of Beaconsfield Benjamin Disraeli and George Canning. Ms Criado Perez launched the campaign for a Fawcett statue from her phone, as she sat on a bench outside Buckingham Palace at the end of her run. Asked how it felt to see the statue being unveiled just two years after launching the petition, she said: ""I can't really take the whole thing in. It's too big really to contemplate that it's finally happening."" By Brian Wheeler in Parliament Square Some of the hundreds of women and men who gathered to watch the unveiling ceremony were simply there to witness a moment in history. ""It is very important to me to see a woman in Parliament Square. It has taken a long time,"" said student Poppy Sharpe, who was there with her friend Macushla Savvides (pictured above). Boys grow up seeing that they can become someone immortalised as a statue, said Emma Camp, but girls don't: ""It's about role models."" But for others it was a chance to stress that the battle for equality fought by Millicent Fawcett and the other suffragists is far from over. The 50:50 campaign, which calls for equal representation in Parliament, was out in force. ""We need more statues of women, but we also need more women writing statutes,"" said the group's Frances Scott. Tsitsi Matekaire, of the Equality Now campaign, said she hoped it would highlight to global struggle for rights for women and girls. Jeanne Rathbone, wearing her Votes For Women sash, wanted to highlight her campaign for a statue of Anglo-Irish suffragist Charlotte Despord in South London. How much had she known about Fawcett before the campaign for a statue? ""She was one of my heroines - not the Pankhursts. She stayed with the fight the whole way through and it is about time she was honoured."" Discussing how Gillian Wearing was selected to create the statue, Ms Criado Perez said: ""Other designers and artists just didn't get it like Gillian did. For me, it was very important (Millicent) was middle aged. ""I wanted her to be standing there not at all sexualised, but statesmanlike. We wanted the statue to be her at a meaningful age, so we chose when she was awarded a brooch from the NUWSS (National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies) at 50 years old. ""She's directly facing Parliament with her placard, so the MPs can see her everyday and think, 'I should probably go and sort that problem out'."" Ms Criado Perez said she would ""like to see more statues overall and more representations of women in public art, specifically women who have existed in the past"". ""The more that I read about the amazing women that have come before me, the more angry I am about why I didn't know about them - why aren't there statues of these people?"" she added. This video can not be played Caroline Criado-Perez: 'If she were a man she'd have hundreds of statues' Born in 1847, she was a pioneering feminist, intellectual and union leader who campaigned for women's right to vote She was a suffragist - not a suffragette She shared the same aims as the suffragettes - the more radical group led by Emmeline Pankhurst - but favoured non-violent protest In 1897 she formed the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies She also played a key role in the founding of Newnham College, the second Cambridge university college to admit women In 1902, she led an all-female investigation into the appalling conditions in British concentration camps in South Africa, during the Boer War Dame Millicent died in 1929, a year after women were granted the vote on equal terms to men Speaking before the unveiling of the statue, at a private viewing, London Mayor Sadiq Khan said: ""When you think of the great people in Parliament Square and when you realise that not one of them is a woman, it sort of begs the question, are we saying there haven't been incredible women in the past? That our country hasn't been built on the back of great women?"" ""The whole process - from petition to project manager - has been made up of solely women. That should make us all incredibly proud."" He added:  ""Londoners are going to love it. They will be blown away.""

Westminster Council has not ruled out a statue of Ms Pankhurst in the square at some stage - provided campaigners move an existing statue of the suffragette leader that stands in nearby Victoria Gardens first.

The Jewish Leadership Council and Board of Deputies of British Jews say the Labour leader has been slow to act on the recommendations ofa 2016 report,external. They want disciplinary cases speeded up and Mr Corbyn to use his ""personal authority"" to drive cultural change. Mr Corbyn has repeatedly promised to take action against anti-Semitism. Ahead of the meeting, he said it was an ""uncomfortable fact"" that a small number of Labour members held anti-Semitic views, and repeated his apology for the ""hurt and distress caused"". Writing in the London Evening Standardhe said Labour was,externaltaking action, with more than 20 members suspended in the past fortnight, adding: ""But we have not done enough to get to grips with the problem, and the Jewish community and our Jewish members deserve an apology. ""My party and I are sorry for the hurt and distress caused."" How widespread is anti-Semitism in the UK? Corbyn sorry over Labour anti-Semitism MPs applauded after anti-Semitism speeches Mr Corbyn has been accused by Jewish groups, and some of his own MPs, who took part in a protest in Parliament Square last month, of not taking the issue seriously enough. The Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Jewish Leadership Council accepted Mr Corbyn's request for a meeting on the condition that he would discuss their demands for action. These include: Mr Corbyn to take ""personal responsibility"" for the work being undertaken by the party to tackle anti-Semitism and to resolve cases to a ""fixed timescale"" A ban on Labour members and MPs sharing platforms ""with people who have been suspended or expelled for anti-Semitism"" Improved education about anti-Semitism, including a ""clear list of unacceptable language"" An independent ombudsman to oversee efforts to tackle anti-Semitism in Labour, with regular updates to be given to the party and to Jewish community leaders A commitment from Mr Corbyn to publicly back MPs who were criticised for attending a protest rally against Labour anti-Semitism Labour's shadow international development secretary Andrew Gwynne said: ""I think what we have now got to do - and we have got an issue in the Labour Party - we have got to acknowledge that that problem exists and, for some, that is a challenge. ""For me, the Labour Party was created to fight injustice, to fight against prejudice, to fight against hatred, and that we are where we are really hurts me, so we have got to act."" He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme Mr Corbyn's job as leader of the Labour Party was to help ""rebuild confidence in the Jewish community"". Mr Gwynne acknowledged that the party's disciplinary process had taken ""far, far too long"" in deciding cases such as former London mayor Ken Livingstone. Mr Livingstone has been suspended since 2016 for claiming Adolf Hitler supported a Jewish homeland in the 1930s. A succession of Labour MPs demanded action from Mr Corbyn in a Commons debate last week, speaking about the abuse they had suffered and warning anti-Semitism had become much more marked in recent years. A2016 report by Labour peer Shami Chakrabarti,externalcalled for action to address what it said was the ""occasionally toxic atmosphere"" in the party, but it has yet to be implemented in full. Holocaust survivor Susan Pollack called for Mr Corbyn to show leadership in tackling anti-Semitism. ""He has to act and he has to show his leadership, and then I think that's the only way we will have respect,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today. Some supporters of Mr Corbyn have warned the issue is being used by his critics to attack him for political reasons. Jenny Manson, co-chair of the Corbyn-supporting Jewish Voice for Labour, said ""none of us in my group have ever experienced any anti-Semitism in the Labour Party"" and warned against a ""witch hunt"". She acknowledged there was ""some anti-Semitism"" in Labour, as it was in ""all parties""  - but there was ""no evidence"" it had got worse under Mr Corbyn's leadership. She called for the Chakrabarti report to be implemented but added that the Jewish Leadership Council and the Board of Deputies were not Labour Party organisations and did not represent all Jewish people. A separate round table event organised by Mr Corbyn on Wednesday has been postponed. Jewish groups had said they would boycott it amid concerns about the inclusion of the pro-Corbyn group Jewish Voice for Labour. The organisation has accused opponents of using the anti-Semitism claims to damage the Labour leader.

"An epilepsy drug that can damage unborn babies must no longer be prescribed to girls and women of childbearing age in the UK unless they sign a form to say that they understand the risks. Drug regulator the MHRA says the new measures it's introducing will keep future generations of children safe. Those already on valproate medication should see their GP to have their treatment reviewed. No woman or girl should stop taking it without medical advice though. It is thought about 20,000 children in the UK have been left with disabilities caused by valproate since the drug was introduced in the 1970s. Affected families havecalled for a public inquiry and compensation. Epilepsy charitiessay one in five women on sodium valproate are unaware that taking it during pregnancy can harm the development and physical health of an unborn baby. This warning has been on the outside of valproate pill packets since 2016 in Britain And more than one in four have not been given information about risks for their unborn child. The MHRA has changed the licence for valproate, which means any doctor prescribing it will have to ensure female patients are put on a Pregnancy Prevention Programme, which means: The patient can see her doctor every year to discuss the risks of this drug to an unborn baby She signs an acknowledgement form at least every year She is told about the importance of using contraception throughout treatment and having a pregnancy test if she thinks she could be pregnant If valproate is taken during pregnancy, up to four in 10 babies are at risk of developmental disorders, and approximately one in 10 are at risk of birth defects. Dr June Raine, from the MHRA, said: ""Patient safety is our highest priority. We are committed to making sure women and girls are aware of the very real risks of taking valproate during pregnancy. However, we also know it is vitally important women don't stop taking valproate without first discussing it with their doctor. ""I would like to particularly thank the families involved in the Valproate Stakeholder Network who have shared their experiences and expertise with us. Their support will help keep future generations of children safe."" Simon Wigglesworth, deputy chief executive of Epilepsy Action, said: ""We know there are still far too many women who haven't been made aware of the potential risks of taking sodium valproate in pregnancy. ""It is vitally important that healthcare professionals ensure that all women with epilepsy taking sodium valproate are reviewed in line with the new guidelines.""

"Government borrowing has fallen to its lowest annual level in 11 years, according to the latest official figures. Borrowing fell by Â£3.5bn to Â£42.6bn in the 2017-18 financial year, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. That was below the estimate of Â£45.2bn produced by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility last month. Borrowing narrowed to 2.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) last year, down from 10% in 2010. However, total public debt as a percentage of GDP edged up to 86.3%, up from 85.3% the year before. In cash terms it stands at Â£1.798 trillion. The figures are the first provisional estimates of the last financial year. The ONS stressed they would be revised as more data becomes available. March's deficit was Â£1.3bn, well below a forecast for a gap of Â£3.25bn. The borrowing figure does not include the amount spent on supporting the state-owned banks. Mr Hammond has kept the broad aim of the previous chancellor, George Osborne, of reducing the gap between spending and borrowing, although he has eased off on the pace of cut-backs. Mr Hammond said: ""Thanks to the hard work of the British people, borrowing is the lowest in over a decade. Our economy is at a turning point with debt starting to fall and people's wages rising, as we build an economy that truly works for everyone."" Philip Hammond welcomed the news - his target is to eliminate the deficit by the middle of the next decade. But the chancellor also knows that a lower deficit creates its own challenges. And a test for the type of politician he is. The figures will increase calls for the Treasury to signal a significant increase in public spending at the Autumn Budget - with the NHS in England and Wales the priority. That is something Mr Hammond signalled he would do at the Spring Statement last month, if the deficit was below target. Which it now is. But many in the Treasury believe that now is not the time to turn on the spending taps and that the focus should remain on reducing the deficit. Particularly while the economic headwinds of a sluggish economy and possible Brexit risk remain. Read more here: But Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the figures did not necessarily indicate an improving economy: ""Rapidly falling public borrowing continues to reflect sharp falls in spending, rather than a reviving economy. ""Lower borrowing in March than last year primarily reflected a Â£1.0bn decline in interest payments and a Â£1.4bn reduction in Local Authority borrowing. Both these expenditure components are volatile and tell us little about the underlying health of the economy."" John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, said: ""The key challenge facing the chancellor in his Budget in November will be how to trade-off growing political pressures to ease austerity against his desire to get the debt ratio down as far as possible. ""The undershoot in the deficit this year has given the chancellor a little more wriggle room, but it does not alter the fundamental strategic choice he will need to make in November.""

"Matt Campbell, on the right, was running his second marathon in two weeks Thousands of people have pledged to ""finish"" the London Marathon in honour of MasterChef contestant Matt Campbell who died 3.7 miles short of the finish. More than Â£116,000 has so far been donated to the charity the 29-year-old from Kendal was running for. The MasterChef semi-finalist collapsed at the 22.5 mile mark of Sunday's race. More than 2,000 people have now signed up to a ""Finish for Matt,external"" Facebook page, pledging to run the miles he was unable to. Mr Campbell was running in memory of his late father and hoped to raise Â£2,500 for the Cumbria-based Brathay Trust. A total of Â£116,217 has been raised from more than 8,372 separate donations. Matt Campbell was described as one of Britain's most exciting young chefs Mr Campbell appeared on the BBC's MasterChef: The Professionals in December 2017 and reached the semi-finals. Hundreds of social media tributes have been paid to the chef, described as ""lovely and kind-hearted"" by family and friends. Writing on the Facebook group, runner Matt Dorber said: ""This has been mainly set up as part of the London Marathon training group. ""Four thousand of us have given each other advice and support over the last few months, and a small gesture of solidarity would be to 'finish' the run for Matt. ""It may be in London, Somerset, Manchester, where ever you are, but if as many people can do a 3.7m run and give Â£5 to Matt's Justgiving page, I think that'd be a nice gesture from us as a group."" Promises of support quickly appeared on social media, with many making additional donations. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Campbell began his career working in Michelin-starred restaurants having finished second in the BBC's Young Chef of the Year in 2009. A spokesman for the Brathay Trust, which works with vulnerable young people, said: ""He was a real creative chef and one of the things he was very keen on doing was sharing that knowledge with young chefs who wanted to get involved in the industry. ""He was such a great athlete and also a wonderful supporter of Brathay."" London Marathon hottest on record Broken leg runner thanks 'heroes' Watch: London Marathon helps struggling rival to finish This year's marathon, which had 40,000 runners, was officially the hottest on record, with temperatures reaching 24.1C (73.3F) according to the Met Office. Runners were warned it could be even hotter on the course because of the heat absorbed by the roads and from other competitors. Event director Hugh Brasher said organisers distributed four and a half litres of water per person - more than any other mass participation event in the world. However, he confirmed water did run out at miles eight, nine and 10. Provisional figures indicate 110 runners required hospital treatment, compared with 2011 when temperatures reached 22C and 104 were taken to hospital, he said. Extra water was provided for runners because of the hot weather Mr Brasher added the event was ""planned thoroughly"" and organisers would see what lessons could be learnt for next year. But he said it was too early to speculate on the exact cause of Mr Campbell's death. He said: ""We really don't want to speculate what was the cause of his death. We don't know. ""An autopsy will be carried out and, as a result of that autopsy, we will find out. ""Our thoughts are just with his family and friends at the moment and giving them the support that they need.""

"Facebook has considered profiling its users' personalities and using the information to target adverts. A patent filed by the social networkdescribes how personality characteristics,,externalincluding emotional stability, could be determined from people's messages and status updates. The firm is currently embroiled in a privacy scandal over the use of its data by a political consultancy. Facebook says it has never used the personality test in its products. The patent, first filed in 2012, is in the names of Michael Nowak and Dean Eckles. Mr Nowak has worked for Facebook for 10 years, while Prof Eckles now teaches at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The patent has been updated twice, most recently in 2016. The BBC has seen emails from Mr Eckles and other Facebook staff to University of Cambridge psychologists in which they discuss analysis of data to infer personality traits, and talk of using such research to improve the product for users and advertisers. The political consultancy Cambridge Analytica claimed that it used a similar technique, known as psychographics, in its work, though it has denied usingdata sourced from a Facebook personality quiz,externalin the 2016 US presidential election. Facebook's patent says potential sources of data could include ""status updates, notes, messages, posts, comments, or any other communications from which linguistic data may be extracted"". It says the personality characteristics could then be stored in a user's profile and used ""to select news stories, advertisements, or recommendations of actions presented to the user"". Prof Eckles told the BBC that his research had involved asking Facebook users to complete surveys that posed personality questions, adding that it had been made clear that the social network was behind the questionnaires. Facebook cuts off billions from privacy law Facebook seeks to extend face scans Will technology destroy our democracy? He acknowledged that ""psychographic [advertising] targeting raises some distinctive ethical concerns"" but said he was doubtful it would ever have been effective. Facebook has raised concerns about the work of University of Cambridge academics involved in similar research. University of Cambridge researchers have done their own studies into profiling Facebook users The Cambridge Psychometrics Centre has been banned from the platform while Facebook investigates allegations that it misused data. The centre denies the allegation that it handed data gathered from a personality quiz for academic research to the commercial company Cubeyou. ""We have had several conversations and meetings with Facebook researchers going back as far as 2011,"" said a spokesman for the Psychometrics Centre. ""However, Facebook has chosen not to publish its research, and therefore users will be unaware how their data may be being used."" This is a separate case from the one in which another academic, Dr Aleksandr Kogan, is accused of breaking rules by passing data to Cambridge Analytica. During congressional hearings earlier this month, Facebook's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg appeared to link the two cases, saying ""we do need to know whether there was something bad going on at Cambridge University overall"". Academics at the Cambridge Psychometrics Centre published an influential paper in 2013 about predicting personality from Facebook likes, the result of research which had been under way for some years. Facebook's founder cast doubt over Cambridge University's behaviour during testimony in Washington The BBC has seen a 2011 email from Prof Eckles, then a researcher at Facebook, to the Cambridge academics expressing interest in their work. He describes undertaking similar research. ""We have been using analysis of linguistic data to infer personality traits,"" he wrote. ""We have a manuscript that is going through some revisions now."" Two years later in 2013, another Facebook employee wrote to the Cambridge academics, apparently unaware of the previous contact. Srikant Ayyar wrote that he had read their recent paper with interest and continued: ""Our group does similar work with the goal of improving our product for people who use it and advertisers. â¦..we are growing to keep pace with Facebook growth and growth in the data we collect."" This was followed by a conference call, but plans for collaboration came to nothing. In a statement, Facebook said: ""Like many companies we apply for a wide variety of patents to protect our intellectual property. The patent we applied for in this area was never used in any Facebook products or further developed.""

"Australian authorities say the boy was found in Bali on 17 March Australian police say they will review how a 12-year-old boy travelled alone to Bali after he had a row with his parents and used their credit card. The boy, from Sydney, booked flights and accommodation online after his parents decided to cancel a holiday to the Indonesian island,the family told the local Nine Network.,external He flew to Bali via Perth, presenting only his passport and school ID. Australian authorities said the boy was found in Bali on 17 March. The Australian Federal Police confirmed he had been reported missing nine days earlier after leaving home and failing to turn up to school. They did not say how many days he was in Bali. He had used a self-service check-in terminal in Sydney to board a flight to Perth and then a connection to Bali, the Nine Network reported. The boy, identified only by a pseudonym, said he was questioned once by airline officials in Perth. ""They just asked for my student ID and passport to prove that I am over 12 and that I am in secondary school,"" he said on the A Current Affair programme. ""It was great because I wanted to go on an adventure."" He said he had checked into his hotel room in Bali by telling staff that he was waiting for his sister to arrive. Australian police said they were alerted to his presence in Bali on 17 March. He was taken into protective custody before being reunited with his parents.

"Almost one in five shops in Doncaster is empty Nearly 650 shops and restaurants, run by a handful of major chains, have shut since the start of 2018 or are at risk of closure. Maplin and Toys R Us sites account for half that total, according to analysis by BBC 5 live's Wake Up to Money. Both chains fell into administration on the same day in February. The remaining Toys R Us stores will close on Tuesday, when the American chain finally disappears from the UK's retail parks and high streets. Administrators for Maplin are keeping its 217 shops open, but they are ""under review"" while a buyer is sought. The BBC's analysis shows that cities have borne the brunt of these retail insolvencies, but towns across the UK have also been affected. Many already have a high shop vacancy rate. Five things to do with empty retail space Six shops defying the High Street downturn Doncaster is one of 14 towns where four shops have been affected: two Toys R Us outlets are closing down, while New Look store and a Maplin shop are at risk. It still has many major national chains, but according to research from PwC and the Local Data Company the town had a net loss of 13 shops last year - nearly 5% of the total. Almost one in five shops in Doncaster are vacant, although the council says only 11% lack tenants. Abs Chaudhry, who runs the X-ited clothes shop on Printing Office Street, said business rates were a big issue. ""Shopkeepers cannot afford the rates. There's that many shops empty that the landlords will even say 'take that shop on for free',"" he said. ""But how can you take a shop on when your rates are Â£20,000? The council's not bothered because they just collect for central government."" Mr Chaudhry claimed a decision to move a bus station to the Frenchgate shopping centre significantly reduced footfall on his side of town. Fran Bishop's shop in Doncaster is bucking the trend But a short walk away Fran Bishop said she was doing well after moving from a prime unit to the Waterdale, a 1960s precinct being revamped by the developer St Modwen. ""We've doubled turnover year-on-year so we are bucking the trend. We're doing things to push customers into the store. We do Facebook Live videos... we're pulling people in and we have customers all over the country,"" she said. ""We used to be opposite McDonald's but that was Â£17,000 a year for half the size. We moved up here because it was a regeneration area so we got a three-month rent period which has allowed us to build up the footfall. It's a bigger retail space and has no business rates."" Doncaster Council is hoping to make the town more of a leisure destination with a new cinema, more events and a revamped Wool Market that could be home to bars and restaurants. Peter Dale, the council's regeneration and environment director, said: ""Doncaster is adapting to the challenges of online shopping and trying to offer something that digital retailers cannot."" Bryan Roberts, a retail analyst at TCC Global, said some retail failures had been self-inflicted as firms failed to adapt to changing consumer behaviour. ""There are lots of nimble retailers out there. There've also been cost pressures like the minimum wage, and business rates - particularly those on the High Street."" A brace of other businesses have sought to ease their financial pressures through a company voluntary arrangement, another form of insolvency. Carpetright and New Look are planning to close stores in this way, and the restaurant chains Jamie's Italian, Prezzo and Byron Burger are also using the process to shut sites. Separately, Marks and Spencer is in the middle of a store closure plan and will shut six by the end of April, while a further seven will close later this year.

"Chelsea's son was taken off her for a year, until his bruising was found to be the result of a medical condition Parents are being investigated for possible child abuse because of the misinterpretation of guidelines on bruising in babies, it's claimed. Official guidelines from health watchdog NICE for hospital workers suggest such bruising is very uncommon. University of Central Lancashire research suggested the guidelines mean social services are investigating parents too often. Its research said more than a quarter of babies are bruised accidentally. One mother had her baby removed from her care for a year by social services, until its bruising was found to have been caused by a medical condition. Lead researcher Prof Andy Bilson told theBBC's Victoria Derbyshire programmethat ""social workers are in danger of having to take decisions based on really misleading interpretations of research"". TheNICE guidelines,externalare used by local authorities to draw up their own policies. Some 91 of the 152 councils in England have specific guidance on how staff should respond to possible abuse. Prof Andy Bilson worries parents may not go to the GP if their child has bruising, for fear of being investigated More than three-quarters (77%) of these do not give front-line staff such as nurses, health visitors and GPs the freedom to make judgements about the causes of a bruise, the university's researchers said. In five local authorities, a formal child protection investigation must be undertaken when a single bruise in a pre-mobile child - who cannot crawl or walk - is discovered. This is despite research from 2015 showing accidental bruising occurred in 27% of pre-mobile babies - those that cannot crawl or walk - monitored over a seven to eight-week period, researchers said. Chelsea Kirtley had her baby Theo removed from her and the father's care for more than a year. She initially took him to the GP worried that the bruising was a sign of meningitis. But when further marks appeared, Stockton Council social services accused them of harming their child. ""It felt they were out to get us,"" Chelsea explained. ""We got escorted by police off the hospital ward, with all the [other] parents looking at us."" Her son was placed into the care of his aunt, and then his grandmother. Theo was taken from his parents' care The case was only dropped after Ms Kirtley had Theo examined by a geneticist, who diagnosed him with hypermobility syndrome - a condition that causes people to bruise easily. But she says the stress caused her to split from the father and leave her job. She was made homeless and now lives with Theo and her mother in a hostel. The council said it ""relied heavily on medical views throughout"" its assessment of Theo, and that the safety of a child always has to be its number one consideration. The tragedies of children such as Victoria Climbie and Baby P, in which warning signs were missed by social workers, are thought to have changed how local authorities deal with cases of bruising. Labour MP Emma Lewell-Buck used to be a social worker in Sunderland, which has some of the strictest guidance. ""I never came across a case where a [pre-mobile] baby had a bruise, and that bruise was purely accidental,"" she said. Emma Lewell-Buck believes the safety of the children should be the priority ""I think you should always err on the side of caution."" She said the public would want social services to ""do the right thing and make sure they had a full medical assessment to find out whether or not this was deliberate"". Prof Bilson acknowledges social workers have a duty to look into incidents of bruising, but said some parents would be put off from taking their children to see a GP for fear of being investigated - stopping the child from getting the medical care it needs. ""If this puts into people's minds even a hesitation of taking their child to a doctors, there's a real chance sooner or later some child will die due to this policy,"" he said. NICE did not comment on the claim its guidelines could be misleading. It said its original advice was aimed at medical professionals working in hospitals. New guidance has been issued by NICE aimed more at social workers and teachers. Watch the BBC'sVictoria Derbyshire programmeon weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News Channel.

"The biggest network of food banks in the UK says it provided record levels of ""emergency food supplies"" last year. The annual figures from the Trussell Trust charity show a 13% increase, providing 1.3 million three-day food packages for ""people in crisis"". It warns the increase has been driven by those on benefits not being able to afford basic essentials. The Department for Work and Pensions says: ""The reasons why people use food banks are complex."" But Emma Revie, chief executive of the Trussell Trust, said the rising numbers relying on food banks showed that ""for too many people staying above water is a daily struggle"". The Trussell Trust food banks provided 1.3 million packages of three-day supplies of food last year The latest figures show that the level of food supplies provided by the trust has almost quadrupled in the past five years. In this year's total of 1.3 million emergency food supplies being delivered, 484,000 were requested for children, says the Trussell Trust, which represents about two-thirds of the food bank provision across the UK. Who are the people who use food banks? Food banks helping those working but still not having enough The charity says the biggest rise has been among those on benefits, whose income has not kept pace with rising costs. Food banks have warned that people's incomes have not kept up with the rising cost of essentials Delays in the payment of benefits, including Universal Credit, was another ""significant factor"". The charity says debt is an increasing cause of demand for food banks, with people's incomes struggling to keep up with the cost of housing and utility bills. ""As a nation we expect no-one should be left hungry or destitute - illness, disability, family breakdown or the loss of a job could happen to any of us, and we owe it to each other to make sure sufficient financial support is in place when we need it most,"" said Ms Revie. Research from University of Oxford last year examined who was most likely to use food banks The Trussell Trust chief executive said that it was vital that Universal Credit and the benefits system ""keep pace with the rising cost of essentials"". A spokeswoman for the Department for Work and Pensions said the rising number of food supplies given by the Trussell Trust was not driven by its introduction of Universal Credit. The DWP spokeswoman said the link to Universal Credit was ""based on anecdotal evidence from a small, self-selecting sample"" of Universal Credit claimants, ""whereas Universal Credit is working for the vast majority who claim it"".

"Almost one in five shops in Doncaster is empty Nearly 650 shops and restaurants, run by a handful of major chains, have shut since the start of 2018 or are at risk of closure. Maplin and Toys R Us sites account for half that total, according to analysis by BBC 5 live's Wake Up to Money. Both chains fell into administration on the same day in February. The remaining Toys R Us stores will close on Tuesday, when the American chain finally disappears from the UK's retail parks and high streets. Administrators for Maplin are keeping its 217 shops open, but they are ""under review"" while a buyer is sought. The BBC's analysis shows that cities have borne the brunt of these retail insolvencies, but towns across the UK have also been affected. Many already have a high shop vacancy rate. Five things to do with empty retail space Six shops defying the High Street downturn Doncaster is one of 14 towns where four shops have been affected: two Toys R Us outlets are closing down, while New Look store and a Maplin shop are at risk. It still has many major national chains, but according to research from PwC and the Local Data Company the town had a net loss of 13 shops last year - nearly 5% of the total. Almost one in five shops in Doncaster are vacant, although the council says only 11% lack tenants. Abs Chaudhry, who runs the X-ited clothes shop on Printing Office Street, said business rates were a big issue. ""Shopkeepers cannot afford the rates. There's that many shops empty that the landlords will even say 'take that shop on for free',"" he said. ""But how can you take a shop on when your rates are Â£20,000? The council's not bothered because they just collect for central government."" Mr Chaudhry claimed a decision to move a bus station to the Frenchgate shopping centre significantly reduced footfall on his side of town. Fran Bishop's shop in Doncaster is bucking the trend But a short walk away Fran Bishop said she was doing well after moving from a prime unit to the Waterdale, a 1960s precinct being revamped by the developer St Modwen. ""We've doubled turnover year-on-year so we are bucking the trend. We're doing things to push customers into the store. We do Facebook Live videos... we're pulling people in and we have customers all over the country,"" she said. ""We used to be opposite McDonald's but that was Â£17,000 a year for half the size. We moved up here because it was a regeneration area so we got a three-month rent period which has allowed us to build up the footfall. It's a bigger retail space and has no business rates."" Doncaster Council is hoping to make the town more of a leisure destination with a new cinema, more events and a revamped Wool Market that could be home to bars and restaurants. Peter Dale, the council's regeneration and environment director, said: ""Doncaster is adapting to the challenges of online shopping and trying to offer something that digital retailers cannot."" Bryan Roberts, a retail analyst at TCC Global, said some retail failures had been self-inflicted as firms failed to adapt to changing consumer behaviour. ""There are lots of nimble retailers out there. There've also been cost pressures like the minimum wage, and business rates - particularly those on the High Street."" A brace of other businesses have sought to ease their financial pressures through a company voluntary arrangement, another form of insolvency. Carpetright and New Look are planning to close stores in this way, and the restaurant chains Jamie's Italian, Prezzo and Byron Burger are also using the process to shut sites. Separately, Marks and Spencer is in the middle of a store closure plan and will shut six by the end of April, while a further seven will close later this year.

"Police have appealed for witnesses to the attack to come forward A rented van has been driven into pedestrians on a busy street in the Canadian city of Toronto, leaving 10 people dead and 15 injured. Here, eyewitnesses describe seeing the vehicle mount the pavement in busy Yonge Street and travel at speed for nearly 2km (1.24 mile), mowing down pedestrians. The suspected driver was arrested and is being questioned. ""I heard screaming, yelling. I turned back and saw this truck,"" Rocco Cignielli, 42, told AFP news agency. ""He was going in and out, back and forth, zigzagging. He just kept on going. ""I saw there were people lying on the ground. I saw they were doing heart compression, and I saw two people dying right here in front of me."" Taxi driver Nana Agyeman Badu said the van had been heading south towards the city centre and then suddenly swerved on to the pavement. ""I thought maybe he was making a delivery. But I was thinking, 'Why would he drive in the pedestrian walkway like that?' Very fast. Then I saw he had already run over some people. ""A lady was walking towards the car close to a bus shelter.

"This video can not be played ""Anybody in his way, he would hit"": Witnesses recall Toronto van incident Ten people have been killed and 15 injured after a man drove a van into pedestrians in Toronto, police said. The suspect has been named by police as Alek Minassian, 25. A man was arrested several streets away following a tense standoff with officers on the street. Bystander videos appeared to show the driver pointing an object at the officers, who could be heard shouting at him to get down. The man was then detained without any shots being fired. Toronto deputy police chief Peter Yuen asked for witnesses to come forward and said there would be ""a long investigation"". He said separate hotlines had been set up for victims' families and for witnesses. City police chief Mark Saunders told a news conference that the incident appeared to be deliberate but the motive was still unknown. He said Alek Minassian, from the Toronto suburb of Richmond Hill, was not previously known to them.

The incident occurred at Yonge Street and Finch Avenue at 13:30 local time (17:30 GMT) on Monday. The crime scene encompassed a  an over 1km (0.6 mile) stretch of Yonge Street. About 18 miles (30km) away in the city centre, foreign ministers of the G7 leading industrialised nations - Canada, the US, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan - were holding meetings. Pictures apparently taken at the scene showed armed police and paramedics treating the injured. One orange bag, which appeared to contain a body, was loaded on to an ambulance. Toronto police spokeswoman Jenifferjit Sidhu told CBC News that the vehicle was stopped by police. Jessica Murphy, BBC News, Toronto A long stretch of Yonge Street in Toronto's North York is cordoned off with yellow police tape for what police say will be a complex investigation. There are multiple sites where people were hit. At one intersection, debris and a lone shoe mark the spot of one fatality. In the aftermath, people who would usually be running errands or heading back to surrounding office towers and condominiums reacted with shock at what happened, sharing what they had seen or heard, even though reasons behind the incident remain unclear. Hours after the event there is mainly just quiet, as police begin the painstaking work of piecing together what happened on a wide stretch of road on Monday lunch hour. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted from Ottawa: ""Our thoughts are with all those affected by the terrible incident at Yonge and Finch in Toronto."" ""Thank you to the first responders working at the scene - we're monitoring the situation closely."" One witness told City News that the driver was ""hitting anything that comes in the way"". ""People, fire hydrants, there's mail boxes being run over,"" said the unnamed man, who said he was driving behind the van during the incident. As the van continued, the man said he sounded his horn to try to warn pedestrians. ""I witnessed at least six, seven people being hit and flying in the air, like killed, on the street,"" he said. Bystanders tried to help emergency responders treat the injured victims Toronto Mayor John Tory called it ""a very tragic incident"" that was ""not representative of how we live or who we are"". He said he had ""offered any and all assistance that the city can provide to the police to help this investigation"". The US and Europe have seen an increase in driving attacks in recent years. In October 2017, a man in New York drove a van down a bicycle path, killing eight people.

"YouTube's first three-monthly ""enforcement report"" reveals the website deleted 8.3 million videos between October and December 2017 for breaching its community guidelines. The figure does not include videos removed for copyright or legal reasons. Sexually explicit videos attracted 9.1 million reports from the website's users, while 4.7 million were reported for hateful or abusive content. Most complaints came from India, the US or Brazil. YouTube said its algorithms had flagged 6.7 million videos that had then been sent to human moderators and deleted. Of those, 76% had not been watched on YouTube, other than by the moderators. The company told the BBC it stored a data ""fingerprint"" of deleted videos so that it could immediately spot if somebody uploaded the same video again. In March, YouTube was criticised for its failure to remove four propaganda videos posted by the banned UK neo-Nazi group National Action. Giving evidence to the UK's Home Affairs Committee, the company's counter-terrorism chief, William McCants, blamed human error for the delay in removing the videos. But Yvette Cooper MP said the evidence given was ""disappointing"", ""weak"" and looked like ""a failure to even do the basics"".

"YouTube's first three-monthly ""enforcement report"" reveals the website deleted 8.3 million videos between October and December 2017 for breaching its community guidelines. The figure does not include videos removed for copyright or legal reasons. Sexually explicit videos attracted 9.1 million reports from the website's users, while 4.7 million were reported for hateful or abusive content. Most complaints came from India, the US or Brazil. YouTube said its algorithms had flagged 6.7 million videos that had then been sent to human moderators and deleted. Of those, 76% had not been watched on YouTube, other than by the moderators. The company told the BBC it stored a data ""fingerprint"" of deleted videos so that it could immediately spot if somebody uploaded the same video again. In March, YouTube was criticised for its failure to remove four propaganda videos posted by the banned UK neo-Nazi group National Action. Giving evidence to the UK's Home Affairs Committee, the company's counter-terrorism chief, William McCants, blamed human error for the delay in removing the videos. But Yvette Cooper MP said the evidence given was ""disappointing"", ""weak"" and looked like ""a failure to even do the basics"".

"This video can not be played Casey and Waj have forged a rare and deep friendship that cuts across Rotherham's ethnic divides The virtue of tolerance is regarded as fundamental to the British character. We are taught that our respect for the values, ideas and beliefs of others is somehow written into our national DNA. Indeed, the government has passed a law requiring teachers and other public servants to promote just this idea as a way to deal with the threat from terrorism. Ask the British if they think they really are a tolerant people, as an Ipsos Mori poll for the BBC'sCrossing Dividesseason did, and a majority (53%) agree. That may not sound emphatic, but the equivalent figure for France, Italy and Spain is around a third. In Hungary it is just 16%. Among the countries that have the strongest sense of national tolerance, though, are Canada (74%), China (65%) and India (63%). If tolerance is an essential part of the British temperament, then other nationalities feel it even more strongly these days. Scratch away at what is happening and our survey finds half of people fear Britain is less tolerant than a decade ago, close to double the proportion that think we have become more so. About the Crossing Divides season Three-quarters of those surveyed thought British society was also becoming more divided, with half saying that tensions were greatest between immigrants and those born in the UK. The poll also identified significant concern about ethnic tensions. Of the countries polled, only South Africa emerged with greater anxiety about race relations than Britain. Official encouragement of tolerance is not enough to counter the sense of unease. More than 25% of people in Britain think the country is ""very divided"", according to the poll. Unsurprisingly but unhappily, the proportion that thinks the country is not divided at all is zero. The Yorkshire town is deeply troubled by its divisions. The numerous bridges over the River Don disguise the racial tensions scored across the borough, divides that have deepened substantially since the discovery that gangs of men of predominantly Pakistani origin hadsexually abused hundreds of young girls,externalin the town over decades. Rotherham child sex abuse: Inquiry finds 100 more potential victims High levels of hate crime have subsequently been identified; Muslims are reporting attacks, mostly assaults, once every three weeks. Rotherham's schools appear to be becoming increasingly divided on ethnic lines. Some neighbourhoods are almost exclusively white, while in others the majority of households trace their family heritage to Pakistan. With the far-right regularly marching through the town and attempting to stir up racial conflict, one shudders to remember the race riots that swept through northern English towns back in 2001.  A government-commissioned inquiry into the disturbances blamed segregated communities living ""parallel lives"". The report's author, Ted Cantle, warned of further violence unless the polarisation could be broken and cross-cultural contact encouraged. His recommendations are being dusted off in Rotherham. Schemes such as the National Citizen Service have brought young people together ""It is not just about people living separate lives,"" says Shokat Lal, Rotherham Council's assistant chief executive. ""Some of those tensions have been deliberately created by people outside the borough coming in."" ""We have had to deal with that, and the whole purpose of theBuilding Stronger Communities,externalwork that we do is to create some really simple mechanisms for people to come and meet each other."" The council has made improving community relations a key part of its plan for Rotherham. A number of schemes have been introduced, including Let's Drink Tea Together which employed an age-old Yorkshire remedy for calming strife. ""We have a responsibility for being an enabler, a facilitator to bring people together,"" Mr Lal explains, ""not in an engineered way, not in an enforced way, but creating the space where people can quite simply just talk to each other."" It sounds trivial but the evidence is that - if people from different backgrounds meet and mix - tensions can be reduced. And vital new friendships forged. ""Where I am from it's mainly white British,"" 17-year-old Casey Holmes from Rotherham's Maltby district tells me. ""I tend to stick with people who are like myself, so I never had any interaction with people from different backgrounds."" Across town in the Eastwood area I met Waj Malik, also 17. ""I wouldn't be comfortable going around in a predominately white area because I would be scared, especially with things in the news, that there would be some sort of hate there,"" she says. The stories of the two girls are typical of the ""parallel lives"" phenomenon identified by the Cantle Report, published when they were still in nappies. But Casey and Waj have now forged a rare and deep friendship that cuts across Rotherham's ethnic divides. They met while completing their National Citizen Service (NCS), the government scheme for 16- and 17-year-olds designed to strengthen social cohesion. ""It was the first day when we had team-building games and Casey was on my side. We were helping each other and we thought we make a really good team,"" Waj recalls. ""Where I come from there are not many people from different ethnic minorities, so with Waj it is something new and something I have not experienced it before, so our friendship is special,"" Casey agrees. A welcoming sign: Will Rotherham be able to heal its divisions? Without NCS, it is unlikely the two girls would ever have spoken to each other, even though they are the same age and live in the same town. Having found each other, the two girls think there are lessons for wider society. ""NCS brings young people together, but I think there needs to be something that brings older and younger people together from different communities and backgrounds as it is just so important,"" Casey says. ""It's been such a learning curve for me so it needs to done in other places in my opinion."" ""We are bonding over our differences,"" Waj believes. ""People think difference tears things apart but it doesn't.  Sometimes it just brings people closer together and that's a bit powerful."" Their story suggests it takes more than legislation to foster tolerance. The state cannot force people to become friends. But what can be done is to create environments in which relationships can grow and blossom, an aim that seems urgent in a country so pessimistic about its divisions.

"Ian Durrant admits the flags in his garden sometimes give off the wrong impression It's hard to miss Ian Durrant's house in Lincoln. A Union flag and the cross of St George flutter 20ft (6.1m) high in his front garden. Ian says they're there ""because I'm a veteran and I'm proud to be English"". But he admits the flags sometimes give off the wrong impression. ""Someone came to talk to me, and he said, 'Congratulations on flying the flag, what are you going to do about those bloody Muslims?' I said, 'Are you National Front?' 'Yes I am, brother,' he said. So I advised him - using army language - to get out of my garden."" With its towering facade, jade green dome and glistening gold crescent, Lincoln's first purpose-built mosque is already settling into the city's skyline. The new mosque can hold more than 500 worshippers In a few weeks the Â£2m ($2.9m) building will officially open - more than a decade after its first planning application was submitted to the council. Ian was one of the mosque's most vociferous opponents. The former soldier - who served for 25 years in the army - set up a group trying to stop the application. But he says his reservations were about traffic. ""There was no parking, there would have been nearly 90 cars, and the building only provided 12 parking spaces."" However, things then got nasty. The site where the mosque was planned to be built burned down in unexplained circumstances. On three separate occasions, groups including the English Defence League (EDL) and East Anglian Patriots marched through the city centre. Participants shouted chants like ""Burn the poppy, and we'll burn the mosque"". This is my country, too: Life as a black British Muslim Worried that his campaign against the mosque was being hijacked by anti-Islamic groups, Ian felt compelled to act. ""We had a letter campaign in the press against the EDL, asking people, 'If you see them, turn your back on them and walk away.' And they did,"" he says. Lincoln's Muslim population is small compared with cities such as Leicester or Birmingham, but it's long outgrown its current mosque. On Friday - the most important day of the week in Islam - it has to rent a larger community hall to accommodate about 250 worshippers. Ian Durrant and Tanweer Ahmed at the door of the new mosque After the mosque's initial planning bid failed, a subsequent application at a former dairy site was approved. This placated people like Ian who had been unhappy about the original location, but others were still sceptical about the mosque's intentions. Tanweer Ahmed, chairman of the Lincoln Islamic Association, says there were rumours flying around that the new mosque would have ""loudspeakers doing the call to prayer five times a day - and some thought we would try and get rid of the local war memorial"". In reality, he says, local Muslims simply wanted ""to feel comfortable"". So he decided to act - by knocking on every door in the area. ""A lot of people welcomed us - but a few people were not happy. We were giving them leaflets, and they were throwing them straightaway into the bin,"" Tanweer says. Even Muslim people questioned his moves. ""My wife was saying, 'Why are you doing that?', and my children were worried that someone could harm me. Some of my colleagues were also worried about safety. And there were some that just didn't want to do it."" Tanweer said he had been trying to find a new site for a mosque for years Tanweer also needed to show locals that the presence of Islam in their area wouldn't threaten their way of life. So he reached out to Ian. ""I knew nothing about Islam, and someone sent me an email saying, 'We're running a series of talks - would you like to come?' So I did. I sat in the front on my own and it was fascinating,"" Ian says. Can you be an independent woman and a good Muslim? The Berlin mosque breaking Islamic taboos WATCH: Breaking taboos with tattoos He's attended so many events - including Eid celebrations and mosque open days - that many worshippers recognise him on the street. But he's raised eyebrows within his own community. ""I took pride in being friends with, and talking to, Muslim people. Other people would say, 'Why the hell are you doing that?' And I said, 'They're people.'"" ""If I look out of the window to the left, I can see the cathedral in its glory,"" says Ian, as he draws a net curtain. ""If I look right I see the mosque. East has met West in Lincoln."" Lincoln is best known for its beautiful 1,000-year-old cathedral. But it also has links with the armed forces - it was the birthplace of the military tank, and produced the renowned Royal Lincolnshire Regiment. Ian (1st right) served in the army for 25 years. This photo was taken in Borneo in 1965 So Remembrance Day is a big deal for local residents. Ian and other veterans parade at their local war memorial, just 100 metres from the new mosque. In 2012, he got a pleasant surprise when Tanweer and other Muslims turned up, carrying wreaths and wearing poppies. ""People who I knew have said, 'It's good to see them joining in the community.' I said, 'Tanweer Ahmed is here - not out of invite, but by right!'"" Tanweer says some Muslims were sceptical about attending the memorial. ""People were saying, 'Why are you going there? Why do we need to go there?' I said to them, 'We live in this country, and these people have given their lives to save this country.'"" He also wanted to highlight both the English and Muslim communities' shared history. In World War One, 400,000 Indian Muslim soldiers fought for Britain, and in World War Two, 600,000 soldiers took part. Tanweer has attended Lincoln's Remembrance Day for the last 6 years Tanweer says it was important for him and Ian to step into each other's sacred spaces and embrace each other's cultures, without sacrificing their own identities. ""Locals feel much more comfortable if we go to their space, they can ask us questions - but if they come to mosques, they might not feel comfortable asking questions,"" says Tanweer. ""So it's important that we visit them. But at the same time, they're coming to us"". Tanweer will be relieved once the mosque opens. But he knows his job isn't over. Last year's terrorist attacks have created a sense of unease among Muslims in the city. Tanweer himself has been verbally abused, and the old mosque has been pelted with stones. He thinks the Muslim community needs to continue engaging with locals to prevent any more trouble. He hopes the new mosque can help by offering space within the building for non-Muslims to run activities, such as children's clubs or exercise classes. ""A lot of people don't know what happens in the mosque, so if they're using the mosque on a regular basis, they will feel much more comfortable building a relationship with us,"" Tanweer says. Ian and Tanweer have become good friends Ian's excited about the mosque's opening ceremony, and hopes to bring his friends along. He admits that their opinions about Islam have changed over the years - largely thanks to him. ""My guys - apart from one - don't mention Muslims any more to me. I'd like to think they're accepting my way of thinking. I don't like prejudice. ""I served in Kuwait with Muslims. I served in Borneo with Muslims. It makes me feel very proud that I have been accepted."" Crossing Divides: a week of stories about people creating connections in a polarised world.

"Dr Andrew Lee (second from left) and his team at Johns Hopkins University A team of US doctors has successfully carried out the world's first total transplant of a penis and scrotum. Surgeons at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, performed the operation on a soldier who had been wounded by a bomb in Afghanistan. They used a penis, scrotum and partial abdominal wall transplanted from a deceased donor. They say the soldier should be able to regain sexual function, which is impossible with penis reconstructions. The team of 11 surgeons performed the transplant over 14 hours on 26 March. It is the first surgery on a combat veteran injured on duty and the first to transplant a complete section of tissue including the scrotum and surrounding abdominal area. Doctors said the donor testicles were not transplanted, due to ethical considerations. ""While extremity amputations are visible and resultant disability obvious,"" said Dr WP Andrew Lee, head of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at Johns Hopkins University, during a telebriefing on Monday, ""some war injuries are hidden and their impact not widely appreciated by others."" Dr Lee called genitalia wounds an ""unspoken injury of war"". ""In a 2014 symposium co-sponsored by Johns Hopkins titled 'Intimacy After Injury', we heard from the spouses, families, and caregivers of these wounded warriors about the devastating impact of genitourinary injuries on their identity, self-esteem and intimate relationships,"" he said. The soldier, who wishes to remain anonymous, said in a statement released by the university: ""When I first woke up, I felt finally more normal like finally I'm okay now."" His injury was the result of stepping on a hidden bomb in Afghanistan. In medical terms, the surgery is called a vascularised composite allotransplantation - which is all to say that the process involves transplanting skin, bone, muscles, tendons and blood vessels. The Johns Hopkins Genital Transplant Program, which funded the surgery, has initially focused on post-traumatic cases, particularly injured soldiers, as their wounds generally make conventional options impossible. Experts from the surgical team,externalexpect the soldier will be fully recovered in six to 12 months. Dr Rick Redett, clinical director of the genitourinary transplant programme, said that the soldier is recovering well and is expected to be discharged from hospital this week. ""It is our hope that such a life enhancing transplant will allow him to regain urinary and sexual function and lead a more normal life,"" Dr Redett said. ""It is also our goal to offer the procedure in the future to other suitable patients."" The transplant team also said that the university has approved 60 genital transplant surgeries as a part of the programme. Thefirst penis transplant in the USwas in 2016 at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. In 2014,South African surgeonsperformed the world's first successful penis transplant.
