"This video can not be played Donald Trump: âItâs a get-to-know-you situationâ Donald Trump's summit with Kim Jong-un in Singapore on 12 June is back on, the US president says, a week after it was scrapped. Mr Trump made the announcement after talks with a senior North Korean envoy at the White House. The envoy, General Kim Yong-chol, hand-delivered a letter from the North Korean leader to President Trump. Mr Trump at first said the letter was ""very interesting"" but later said he had not yet opened it. He also said the issue of formally ending the Korean War would be on the table in Singapore. The 1950-53 conflict only ended with a truce, not a final peace treaty. Kim Jong-un's right hand man What does Kim Jong-un really want? The political gamble of the 21st Century ""We'll be meeting on June 12th in Singapore. It went very well,"" President Trump told reporters on the White House lawn. ""We've got to know their people very well,"" he added. Mr Trump cautioned that the summit might not achieve a final deal on the North's controversial nuclear programme. This video can not be played US-North Korea: Trump gets an unusually large letter ""I never said it goes in one meeting. I think it's going to be a process, but the relationships are building and that's very positive,"" he said. The historic meeting between Mr Trump and Kim Jong-un would be the first between sitting US and North Korean leaders. President Trump has offered to help rebuild the North's economy if it scraps its nuclear weapons. Kim Jong-un says he is committed to ""denuclearisation"" in some form but his precise demands are unclear. 16 May:North Korea says it may pull out of the summit, accusing the US of reckless statements and sinister intentions 24 May:Donald Trump cancels the summit, blaming ""tremendous anger and open hostility"" from the North 26 May:Kim Jong-un and South Korea's Moon Jae-in meet for surprise talksat the demilitarised border between the two countries 1 June:Senior North Korean envoy General Kim Yong-chol delivers a letter from Mr Kim in person at the White House. Mr Trump says the summit on 12 June is back on This video can not be played Singapore has been getting ready for the US-North Korea summit Gen Kim Yong-chol's visit to Washington came a day after he met US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in New York. Mr Pompeo described their talks about denuclearisation ""substantive"". ""President Trump and I believe Chairman Kim is the kind of leader who can make those kinds of decisions. And that in the coming weeks and months, we will have the opportunity to test whether or not this is the case,"" he said. Mr Kim's letter reportedly expresses his interest in meeting without making any significant concessions or threats in regards to denuclearisation,the Wall Street Journal reports,external, citing a foreign government official who was briefed on the contents. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington This is Trump diplomacy, unfolding in real time. If it's not what the world expects, if it's statecraft as we've never seen it before, that's because this is a president unlike any the American people have elected before. From ""fire and fury"" to a relationship ""as good as it's been in a long time"". The summit is on, then it's off, now it's on again. The president, as witnessed by his impromptu 16 minute question-and-answer session with gathered reporters, is basking in the world's spotlight as he conducts these historic negotiations. Passing legislation is hard. Coping with the Russia investigation is infuriating. Welcoming to the White House the ""second most powerful man in North Korea"", as Mr Trump called Kim Yong-chol, is comparatively easy. Even as Mr Trump heralded the progress being made, he was downplaying expectations for the upcoming summit, which he said was never planned to end in some grand signing ceremony. For the moment, it appears the Singapore meeting will be only a first step - a chance for a historic photo-op and a hope for breakthroughs to come. For a president who many thought last year was barrelling toward war, however, that appears more than enough. North Korea has carried out six nuclear tests and numerous tests of ballistic missiles, all the while maintaining a barrage of belligerent rhetoric against its enemies, particularly the US. This video can not be played The nuclear word Trump and Kim can't agree on It claims to have developed anuclear weapon small enough to be carried by a long-range missile, although this remains unverified. Previous attempts to negotiate with North Korea have failed, but earlier this year Pyongyang held direct talks with Seoul andthe two Korean leaders held a historic summit in April. With relations thawing, the US has pledged to help rebuild North Korea's economy if it agrees to give up its nuclear weapons. But the US wants denuclearisation first and it is unclear whether Mr Kim will agree to fully abandon his nuclear arsenal. Please upgrade your browser to view this content.

"South Korean President Moon Jae-in - dupe or genius? South Korean leader Moon Jae-in is either a diplomatic genius or a communist set on destroying his country and US President Donald Trump is either a master of brinkmanship or a pawn in a more devious game - depending on who you speak to. But it is the other actor in this saga, Kim Jong-un, the only one who has yet to make a direct statement, who may just be the most significant player in this most extraordinary of political gambles. From the moment he extended an apparent olive branch to the South in his new year message to the cordial delegations to Pyeongchang for the Winter Olympics, it became clear that Kim Jong-un had mastered the most sophisticated crafts of propaganda. Some will viewhis personal invitation to Mr Trump to hold talks with him- as well as the commitment to freeze further nuclear tests - as the real diplomatic masterstroke after a year that was unprecedented for the level of naked hostility the US and the North bared toward one another. But the risk here belongs to both Moon Jae-in and Donald Trump. In a situation where neither can claim sole mastery of the narrative, without a clear exit strategy, and when there are so many definitions for both success and failure, a lot is at stake. Mr Moon is viewed by his supportersas the negotiator-in-chief who has now skilfully managed to get Mr Kim to at least talk about getting rid of nuclear weapons. He is the one who spotted the opportunity duringthe North Korean leader's speech in January- which offered a glimmer of hope that the reclusive state was willing to engage with the South - and grabbed it with both hands. This video can not be played The unlikely triangle: Trump, Rodman and Kim Jong-un The dizzying level of diplomacy and a frenzy of visits between North and South has now delivered - it seems. ""People are calling this the North Korean charm offensive, I actually think this is a South Korean charm offensive. This is something President Moon Jae-in clearly wanted,"" John Delury from Yonsei University said to me even before the talks were announced. Mr Moon knew his envoys would have to extract the word ""denuclearisation"" from Mr Kim when they visited Pyongyang. He also knew having two of his top level government ministers looking cosy with the North Korean leader would not go down well in Washington or Tokyo. But it was worth the risk. The US would not have considered talking to the communist state without that meeting. His chosen delegates got what they needed. The South Korean leader is also attempting the role of honest broker, handling Mr Trump and Mr Kim at the same time. He is choosing his words carefully and keeping his cards close to his chest while flattering those who respond to the spotlight. Is North Korea just playing the US? US ties any N Korea talks to nuclear arms In his New Year's address he said Mr Trump deserved ""huge credit"" for talks between the two Koreas, knowing it would please him. He is also using language that will reassure a concerned Republican administration.The language of the South Korean statement announcing the talkswas also fulsome in its admiration for Trump's handling of the situation leading up to this moment. Sanctions will stay in place, Mr Moon had said earlier, and Mr Trump has now confirmed that. But everybody knows it wasn't always like that. Just six months ago Mr Trump waspromising to rain down ""fire and fury like the world has never seen""on North Korea if it dare threaten the US. Prof Haksoon Paik, lead researcher at the Sejong Institute, said that threat level felt ""totally unprecedented"". ""President Moon was very much concerned about nuclear threat of war. Kim Jong-un was in the same situation. We were hearing from the likes of the US Senator Lindsay Graham that lives will be lost over here. Donald Trump's unorthodox and unstable leadership had both Korean leaders worried about the potential of military options."" The US has always maintained that the permanent denuclearisation of North Korea is the endgame. Even with all the surprises up to this point, few believe Mr Kim would agree to that so if they don't achieve that what options does Trump have? South Korean officials held a landmark meeting with Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang this week So is Moon Jae-in - and indeed Donald Trump - being manipulated by a North Korea which has fooled the world before? ""By dangling before the US once again 'denuclearization of the Korean peninsula' and 'moratorium on nuclear and missile tests', Kim seeks to weaken sanctions, pre-empt US military pre-emption, and condition the world into accepting North Korea as a legitimate nuclear state,"" says Prof Lee Sung-yoon from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts University. For Mr Trump this could be about one of the boldest and most historic moves a US leader has made in foreign relations. If this gamble works out, Mr Trump could credit himself as the president who sorted out North Korea. His administration has had very few victories, despite promising his voters there would ""so much winning."" He believes his ""maximum pressure"" strategy and his work to get China on side and help squeeze Pyongyang economically is working. Protesters in Seoul called for peace talks between the US and North Korea in November Reporters say he casually mentioned in the White House briefing room that he hoped they would give him credit for Kim Jong-un's offer. His voters certainly will. But meeting Mr Kim risks treating the communist leader as an equal. It could be a PR disaster. The date set is also only a few months away - a short time frame to achieve diplomatic goals with a leaderhe mocked as ""little rocket man"" just a few months ago. Prof Robert E Kelly at Busan University in South Korea tweeted: ""Trump doesn't study or even read. He tends to fly wildly off script. And May means there's almost no time for all the staff prep necessary."" Pyongyang has been playing this game for decades. Mr Trump is new to it. He may see a big win on the horizon, but his Art of the Deal book will not be the guide he needs to deal with Kim Jong-un. For Mr Moon this is about history and it is also personal. He played a part in previous attempts to negotiate with North Korea as chief of staff to President Roh Moo-hyun when he met Mr Kim's father, Kim Jong-il, in 2007. That was the last time the leaders of the two Koreas held a summit. A satellite launch by Pyongyang ended the talks. By then around $4.5bn of aid had been sent North during the policy of engagement. Critics believe that money helped to accelerate the weapons programme. North Korea crisis in 300 words Have the Winter Olympics repaired North-South Korea relations? The politics behind the 'peace Olympics' Having failed once before, Mr Moon is trying to complete the work he started, says Duyeon Kim, a senior fellow at the Korean Peninsula Forum. ""He's basically following the same playbook as his two liberal predecessors. It's exactly the kind of thing he would want to pick up and continue."" The border between the North and South is demarcated at the truce village of Panmunjom As a son of refugees from the North, Mr Moon is also aware of the effects of conflict on the peninsula. His parents fled North Korea aboard a UN supply ship in 1950 at the start of the Korean War alongside thousands of other refugees. He told reporters during his election campaign: ""My father fled from the North, hating communism. I myself hate the communist North Korean system. That doesn't mean I should let the people in the North suffer under an oppressive regime."" North Korea's missile and nuclear programme Meet North Korea's first family President Moon has acknowledged there are obstacles ahead. He is managing expectations and so much can go wrong. Duyeon Kim believes there is a high probability that at the end of this negotiating process, all parties will fail, and North Korea will decide it wants to keep its nuclear weapons. And yet... ""You just don't know. I don't think it's ever a lost cause, in spite of all the doubts and scepticism all parties should go in with clear eyes, but negotiate hard."" North Korea says its long-range missiles protect all of Korea from ""US aggressors"" President Moon's approval ratings took a hit during the Winter Olympics after he integrated the women's hockey team with players from the North and met a general from Pyongyang who had been accused of masterminding deadly attacks on South Koreans, though they have since rebounded. He may suffer politically if this fails but maybe for him, this is not about scoring political points. This is what he told Time magazine last year when he was presidential candidate: ""My mother is the only one [of her family] who fled to the South. [She] is 90 years old. Her younger sister is still in the North alive. My mother's last wish is to see her again."" These talks are a huge gamble with a communist state which is hard to read. But if, just if, he helps pull it off it may reduce the threat of nuclear war and he could win himself a Nobel peace prize. If all fails, it is back to brinkmanship.

"Frustrated rail users let their feelings be known at Manchester Piccadilly Northern has cancelled 165 daily train services until the end of July following major disruption since new timetables were introduced last month. The ""interim timetable"", to be introduced on Monday, removes 6% of the train operator's total services. Areas affected include Manchester, Liverpool, Blackpool and the Lakes Line between Oxenholme and Windermere. Northern has aborted 2,200 services in the last fortnight, with more than 200 cancelled or heavily delayed on Friday. The company - which hasfaced calls for it to be stripped of its franchise- insisted it will still run more trains than it did before the timetable change on 20 May, and expects to ""get back to a full timetable service"" by the end of next month. It follows a warning by the mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, that an ""emergency"" timetable was being considered to deal with the scale of train cancellations and delays. This video can not be played Passengers react to Northern Rail ""carnage"" Mr Burnham said the introduction of an emergency timetable was ""unacceptable"". ""The travelling public are having their lives turned upside down."" Northern managing director David Brown said: ""We have been experiencing some significant disruption to train services, especially around north Manchester, Bolton, Liverpool, Blackpool and up to the Lake District."" He apologised for the ""unacceptable situation"" and ""unacceptable service many customers have been subject to"". Mr Brown added: ""We are absolutely committed to resolving the service issues and the interim plan will help ensure we start to get back on track and start to give customers more certainty around the services we operate."" Commuters across the north of England have faced overcrowding on trains and platforms The Transport Secretary Chris Grayling cited government-owned Network Rail - which manages the rail infrastructure - for the problems. He said it was ""too late in finalising planned timetable changes"" which have caused widespread problems since they were introduced. The RMT's general secretary Mick Cash said the minister should ""get out"" and described the situation as ""carnage"". Mr Cash said his members are facing public anger ""without a shred of support"" from Mr Grayling or Northern's management. He said it was ""disgusting"" that Mr Grayling and bosses of rail companies have ""dived for cover"" and not faced passengers. ""Not only is Chris Grayling incompetent and not fit to run a railway but he is a coward as well, leaving RMT members to take the flack for failed policies that are his responsibility,"" he said. Rail industry 'has failed passengers' 'Meltdown Monday' after rail changes Mayor demands Northern trains inquiry In response, the transport secretary issued a statement which said: ""I am in regular discussions with Network Rail, Northern and Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), and have reiterated that disruption suffered by passengers is wholly unacceptable. ""I have been very clear with Network Rail that it was far too late in finalising planned timetable changes and this must not happen again. ""Train companies are working to keep passengers moving and disruption minimised. ""While this is currently a huge inconvenience to passengers as the changes bed in, we are investing in the biggest modernisation of the railway since Victorian times and this new timetable will deliver hundreds more services up and down the country."" Transport Secretary Chris Grayling ""needs to come out of hiding"", said Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham Earlier this week,Mr Grayling wrote to MPsover the ""wholly unsatisfactory"" service on GTR in the south of England and Northern. He also criticised Network Rail, saying it ""cannot cope"" with the workload, and its performance was ""simply unacceptable"". Wigan MP Lisa Nandy said Mr Grayling would meet with MPs on Monday when the Transport Select Committee will review the Northern and GTR franchises. Allow Twitter content?

"Paul Massey (left) and John Kinsella were both fatally shot A man has been charged with the murders of gangland figures Paul Massey and John Kinsella. Paul Massey, 55, was shot dead at his home address on Manchester Road in Clifton on 26 July 2015. John Kinsella, 53, died after being shot on the St Helens Linkway near the M62 in Merseyside on 5 May.

He had been described as a mob fixer who once stopped a gangster terrorising former Liverpool FC footballer Steven Gerrard. Paul Massey was dubbed ""Mr Big"" at a meeting to discuss civil disturbances in 1992 Massey, a security boss and businessman, was a convicted criminal once branded ""Mr Big"". He was shot dead as he got of a car outside his Salford home. The arrest was part of a joint operation between Greater Manchester Police and Merseyside Police.

"This video can not be played The BBC's Gavin Lee said Mariano Rajoy's departure followed a ""political earthquake"" Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has been forced out of office by a no-confidence vote in parliament. Socialist leader Pedro SÃ¡nchez, who filed the motion after Mr Rajoy's party was implicated in a corruption scandal, will become prime minister. ""We're going to sign a new page in the history of democracy in our country,"" Mr SÃ¡nchez said ahead of Friday's vote. Mr Rajoy is the first prime minister in modern Spanish history to be defeated in a no-confidence motion. Uncharted territory for Spain The patient man of Spanish politics The leader of the conservative Popular Party (PP) has been prime minister since 2011. During the second day of debate on Friday, Mr Rajoy admitted facing defeat and told MPs that it has been ""an honour to leave a better Spain than I found"". Mr SÃ¡nchez secured a majority in the vote after gaining support from various smaller parties, including the Basque Nationalist Party - 180 MPs backed the motion, 169 voted against, with one abstention. Mr SÃ¡nchez says Mr Rajoy, 63, had failed to take responsibility for his party's involvement in the scandal, which hit the headlines again last week afterone of its former treasurers was given a 33-year jail sentence. The High Court in Madrid convicted Luis BÃ¡rcenas of receiving bribes, money laundering and tax crimes. The case centred on a secret campaign fund which the PP ran from 1999 until 2005. Many Spanish voters, exasperated by corruption scandals involving the traditional centre-right PP and centre-left Socialist parties, have abandoned them for newcomers like the left-wing Podemos (We Can) and pro-market Ciudadanos (Citizens), as well as regional parties. Analysis by Gavin Lee, BBC Europe reporter Mariano Rajoy walked out of Congress and out of a job this afternoon. With a fixed smile, he hugged his staff who cheered and lined the way to the last ride in his parliamentary car. Cheers turned to boos outside the parliament's gates, with hundreds of protesters screaming ""Good riddance"", and placards which read ""PP - Corrupting Spain since 1990"". The party was explicitly linked to what the judge called ""institutionalised corruption"" and questioned the court testimony of the now-former PM. Mr Rajoy, the seemingly bulletproof leader who had long resisted calls for his resignation and who survived a previous no-confidence vote, has gone. His successor, Pedro SÃ¡nchez, nicknamed ""Mr Handsome"", now has several expectant parties with conflicting interests to see to, for agreeing to oust Mr Rajoy. It's been dubbed the ""Frankenstein coalition"" because while many are optimistic for a new kind of politics without corruption, some critics say he may instead have created a political monster. Profile by Guy Hedgecoe, BBC News, Madrid Pedro SÃ¡nchez emerged as a virtual unknown to win the Spanish Socialist party premiership in 2014. The photogenic economist and former basketball player won members over with a promise to unite a divided party and put the Socialists back in power. Yet he subsequently suffered two humbling election defeats, in 2015 and 2016. He was eventually forced to resign after his refusal to back Mariano Rajoy in an investiture vote plunged the country into a prolonged political stalemate and his party into bitter infighting. Months later he confounded his many critics by returning to win the Socialist primary. Spain's constitution states that the party presenting a no-confidence motion must be prepared to govern and replace the deposed prime minister if a parliamentary majority backs it. Therefore this moderate but ambitious 46-year-old from Madrid is set to be Spain's new prime minister, despite the fact that his party commands less than a quarter of seats in Congress. Mr Rajoy's departure casts the EU's fifth-largest economy into political uncertainty. Mr SÃ¡nchez is expected to be sworn in at the weekend and to name a cabinet next week. Although he leads the Socialist PSOE party, he is not a member of parliament. Correspondents say that with only 84 lower house seats, the party will struggle to find allies to get legislation enacted. Mr SÃ¡nchez is expected to get support from Podemos. Smaller groups - including Basque and Catalan nationalists - supported the no-confidence motion, but it is unclear whether they will back the new government. The Ciudadanos party, which had been doing well in opinion polls, supported Mr Rajoy. What happens next?

"Cosmetics company Lush has been heavily criticised on social media for a campaign aimed at drawing attention to the so-called UK ""spy cops"" scandal.

The firm said UK police forces were doing a difficult job with less funding, and it wanted instead to highlight a ""secretive subset of undercover policing"" that undermined democracy.

"Prime Minister Theresa May has said she is disappointed by the US's ""unjustified decision"" to slap tariffs on EU steel and aluminium. The tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium, which affect the EU, Canada and Mexico, came into effect on Friday. All three are planning retaliatory moves. Mrs May said the EU and UK should be exempted and would work together to ""protect and safeguard our workers and industries"". UK Steel said the tariffs, which apply to a wide range of steel and aluminium products such as sheets, plates, bars, pipes and ""semi-finished"" products, will damage not only the UK steel sector but also the US economy. Bikes, bourbon and T-shirts on EU tax list UK labels US metal tariffs 'absurd' US tariffs: The unusual ways nations have retaliated Criticism of Trump trade tariffs intensifies It comes just as the sector is recovering from the 2016 steel crisis caused by oversupply and slack demand. About 31,000 people across the UK work in steel production and many more in the supply chain. There are steel mills in the North East, East Midlands, Yorkshire, and Wales. In a statement on Friday, Mrs May said: ""I am deeply disappointed at the unjustified decision by the US to apply tariffs to EU steel and aluminium imports. ""The US, EU and UK are close allies and have always promoted values of open and fair trade across the world. ""Our steel and aluminium industries are hugely important to the UK, but they also contribute to US industry including in defence projects which bolster US national security. ""The EU and UK should be permanently exempted from tariffs and we will continue to work together to protect and safeguard our workers and industries."" This video can not be played Shadow Trade Secretary Barry Gardiner told Today the UK risks high tariffs outside the EU UK International Trade Secretary Liam Fox, who is hoping to strike a post-Brexit trade deal with the US, said it was ""very unfortunate if we get into this tit-for-tat position, especially with one of our closest allies"" adding: ""Nobody wins in a trade war, there are only casualties."" President Trump justified the move on national security grounds by arguing that global oversupply of steel and aluminium, driven by China, threatened American steel and aluminium producers. Earlier Labour's shadow international trade secretary said the decision had been ""based on a lie"" and was simply an act of economic protectionism. Barry Gardiner said Europe needed to show it would not be ""cowed"" and should pursue ""proportionate"" action through the World Trade Organisation. ""We believe in a multilateral rules-based system,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""President Trump does not. He wants to break up that system. ""We have to see this as part of a pattern of behaviour and respond strongly to it and make clear to him we are not susceptible to the intimidation, threats and bullying that he is putting in place."" Leaders from other affected nations reacted furiously,setting out tariffs on the US, ranging from steel to sleeping bags and ballpoint pens. According to UK Steel - the body which represents steel producers across the country -7% of steel exports, worth Â£360m, go to the US.,external Tata Steel, which employs 8,500 people across the UK, including 7,000 in Wales,has called for ""swift and robust action"" in response to the steel tariffs.

""They have been seriously injured going about their duties and both they and their colleagues who subsequently attended to assist demonstrated courage and the utmost professionalism both during and after the incident. ""They receive the thanks and the support of everyone within Police Scotland."" The two police officers are in a serious condition after being stabbed while on duty He said the incident was not being treated as terrorist-related and was contained without any further risk to the public. Extra patrols will be in place over the course of the weekend. Both officers were taken to Inverclyde Royal Hospital and one was transferred to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow for exploratory treatment. The assistant chief constable said their injuries were not life-threatening but ""significant and serious"" and said he had been to see both officers who were in ""remarkable good spirits"". ""I am blown away by the courage of them,"" he said. ""They said we are in the police and we accept that comes with a degree of risk. I was very moved and proud to speak with them."" He also said he had visited Greenock police office and met with the rest of the officers' team. He revealed: ""They are really emotional. They are hurting, they are upset angry and distressed. They have seen their colleagues badly injured. ""At the end of the day, police officers are humans."" The incident came at the timethe force is about to deploy newly-trained Taser-armed officers. The training of 500 officers in the use of the device began in May in a bid to improve the safety of the public and police officers. Assistant Chief Constable Higgins said if Taser-armed officers had been sent to Friday's incident, it could have meant a different outcome. He said: ""Potentially, a Taser could have made a difference. ""Greenock is going to be one of the areas during the rollout period which will see trained officers deployed."" He said Police Scotland would do all it could to support the two involved, adding: ""They will have physical scars, they will have emotional scars but I will guarantee that everybody in Police Scotland will do everything we can to help these officers."" DCC Iain Livingstone, the interim chief constable of Police Scotland, praised the ""incredible bravery"" of the officers. On Twitter, he wrote: ""All of @policescotland officers and staff thinking of them and their families. Courage, protecting their fellow citizens."" Andrea MacDonald, chairwoman of the Scottish Police Federation, said: ""Our thoughts are with the injured officers and their families. Once again we see how difficult and dangerous a job it is. ""Police officers put themselves between other professionals and the public and dangerous individuals sometimes with life changing consequences for themselves and their families. ""We wish our colleagues a speedy and full recovery.""

"Populists poised to govern: Five Star Movement's Luigi Di Maio (L) and League's Matteo Salvini Italy's new populist government has been sworn in, ending months of political uncertainty. The anti-establishment Five Star Movement and right-wing League have gone into coalition, preparing to set the eurozone's third biggest economy on a path of tax cuts, a guaranteed basic income for the poor and deportations of 500,000 migrants. They reject years of EU austerity and want to renegotiate Italy's debt. So what will this government, led by law professor Giuseppe Conte, mean for Italy and the rest of Europe? Neither Five Star nor The League are fans of the single currency. League leader Matteo Salvini said not long ago that the euro was ""a mistake"" for Italy's economy, while Five Star had wanted a referendum on Italy's future membership. But they have dropped their initial ambition of exit from the euro and now talk of trying to reform it from within. Not everyone is convinced by their change of heart. France's Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire earned a rebuke from the leader of The League by warning the populist parties to respect Italy's budget commitments. The markets are wary, too. Italy's borrowing costs have touched levels not seen since 2016. Italy was ravaged by the 2008 financial crisis that left the economy some 6% smaller and three million more people in poverty. The answer for The League and Five Star is to move Italians out of poverty. But their policies will cost tens of billions of euros, for a country with the second biggest public debt in the EU after Greece. It stands at 132% of national output. Poor families will get a â¬780 (Â£682; $919) basic monthly income, provided recipients actively seek work, the parties say. It is a popular idea but one that will cost an estimated â¬17bn to implement. Its most expensive policy is the idea of two ""flat tax"" rates set at 15% and 20%. Families would receive a â¬3,000 annual tax deduction based on household income. Sales and excise tax increases next year, worth â¬12.5bn, will be scrapped. The 58-page joint pact, or ""contract"", does not explain how all the extra spending will be financed,external. But economists estimate it could cost some â¬50bn in lost revenue. The minimum monthly pension is to be set at â¬780. The plan abolishes the current pension reform that raises the retirement age in phases. Instead, a new points system would combine people's total years of social security contributions with their age. The total must be at least 100, meaning that someone who has paid into the system for 41 years, for example, could retire at 59. Italy's new Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte is a political novice The populist parties say they want revisions to the EU's Stability and Growth Pact, which sets a tough budget deficit limit of 3% of GDP. The plan aims to reduce debt through ""the revival of internal demand"", not by continuing austerity. Italy's populists are not just aiming to reset the economy and revisit the EU's rules on debt. The League is strongly anti-immigration and their joint plan reflects that. It demands more EU help for Italy - the main destination for migrants arriving from North Africa - and it insists that the estimated 500,000 undocumented migrants in Italy must be deported ""as a priority"". Italian election: Its economy in charts What exactly is populism? That would require the creation of ""temporary stay facilities"" throughout Italy for migrants earmarked for expulsion, the parties say. Italy's capacity to house migrants has been stretched to the limits The plan calls for effective relocation of asylum-seekers EU-wide - a scheme already rejected by some EU states. And it demands stronger co-operation to fight people-smuggling gangs. The populist leaders disagree with the EU sanctions on Russia and want them lifted. They do not see Russia as a military threat, but as ""a potential partner for the EU and Nato"". They want to work with Russia against the smuggling of migrants across the Mediterranean and the continuing influence of violent Islamists. They also see Russia as a key player in ending the wars in the Middle East. The EU and US accuse Russia of hostile anti-Western activities and relations became icy after Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.

"Adam and Raquel Gonzales had been together for five years when he woke up one morning with no idea who she was - he had lost all memory of marrying her. But Raquel was determined to win him over again. One early morning in September 2016 Raquel walked into the living room in her pyjamas to find her husband looking at her with a puzzled expression. He spoke to her as if she were a stranger, without a trace of affection. He seemed to have no idea who she was. ""I asked him: 'Do you know where you are?  Do you know what year this is? Do you know what my name is?' And he said 'No' to all these things,"" Raquel says. ""I could tell that the more I asked, the more upset he was becoming."" Raquel reassured him that this was their home, she was his wife and they had three children together. Adam started to cry. ""I need you to get me my ID, where is my phone and my ID?"" he said. Raquel told Adam to get dressed and that she was going to take him to hospital immediately. She was worried that something might have gone dangerously wrong with the blood vessels in his brain. When Adam opened his cupboard, he asked: ""Where are my suits?"" Raquel explained that he didn't have any suits, that he was a personal trainer. Adam got dressed and reluctantly followed this woman who he did not know to the hospital. They clung to each other. Raquel was being gentle with Adam - she knew that his memory had failed once before, after a woman tried to kill him. In 2011, at the age of 35, Adam had been a branch manager for telecoms giant AT&T and a devoted church leader in Lubbock, Texas. After the break-up of his first marriage, he started a new relationship but it ended in disaster. His new girlfriend hit him on the back of the head with a metal object and, once he fell, hung him from the garage rafters - leaving him for dead. His heart stopped three times on the way to hospital, but he was resuscitated by paramedics each time. Adam ended up in a coma for four months. This video can not be played Adam Gonzales tells Outlook, on the BBC World Service, about his recovery from a life-changing brain injury ""When I woke up I didn't know who I was - I didn't know that I had been married and divorced and had two children,"" says Adam. He spent a year in hospital, learning how to walk and talk again. But the memories of his past life didn't return. Months went by before Adam was reintroduced to his son and daughter. He found it very challenging to look at them for the first time. ""How could a father, a dad, forget his biological children?"" he says. When he finally came home, the house was full of photographs he could not connect with and awards he had no memory of winning. His past was no longer there. ""I was trying to understand who this man Adam was. Can I live up to this person?"" He couldn't go back to his old job and feared he wouldn't be able to afford his previous lifestyle. ""I don't even remember what I went to school [university] for,"" he says. ""It's evident that I was there, but how I got there, how I sustained it, was unimaginable."" He decided to leave the town he was in and start again. He moved to Phoenix, Arizona to work as a cable technician. It was there that he began online dating and in 2012 he began messaging Raquel, a 30-year-old marketing manager with a young daughter. They agreed to meet in a small hipster bar and grill in downtown Phoenix. Raquel sat at the first booth waiting for him to come in, but 30 minutes later he still hadn't shown up. Eventually he called her - from the wrong restaurant. ""He was so apologetic and humble and I thought: 'OK everybody makes mistakes,'"" says Raquel. Besides, she liked his Texan accent. Adam finally walked in, wearing a leather jacket and jeans. ""He wasn't trying but somehow he looked so cool, he was so handsome,"" says Raquel. ""I couldn't keep my eyes off her - she had these beautiful dimples and she had this really sweet smile,"" says Adam. They clicked and began to see each other more. After a few months of dating, they moved in together with their children, and in July 2015 they married in a little chapel outside Phoenix. But all memory of Adam and Raquel's four years together had been wiped out that morning in September 2016. While Adam was in hospital undergoing tests, he called the one person he knew he could trust - his mother. She reassured him that he had been in love with and married to Raquel. ""She loves you. You have my blessing,"" his mum told him. ""So I began to put a little more trust into her and started asking questions here and there,"" Adam says. ""There was some excitement about it and there was a little bit of mystery about who this really nice woman is, and was."" They started dating and getting to know each other again in hospital, meeting in secluded corners and chatting over grilled-cheese sandwiches at the cafeteria. ""We'd get stir-crazy at night and end up walking downstairs in search for midnight snacks in the vending machines,"" Raquel says. ""She would show me pictures on her cell phone on what back in the day I would have called MySpace but it was Facebook - so that was interesting,"" Adam says. ""Silly things would happen - like he said, 'Do you have our marriage certificate?' and of course I did,"" says Raquel. She was still in the process of changing her name to Adam's so she had it in her handbag. She grabbed it and he laughed. ""I think he began to see glimpses of the woman he married for better or for worse,"" she says. But it was not all positive. At one point Adam decided it would be better if they split up, and even told her: ""I am not attracted to you, and you do not turn me on at all."" When she heard that, Raquel prayed. ""It's hard to love someone when they have no idea who you are and they cannot love you,"" she says. Adam and Raquel Gonzales spoke toOutlook on the BBC World Service Download the podcast for more extraordinary stories But she pulled out all the stops. When he came home from hospital Raquel wooed him by learning how to cook - he had done most of the cooking. He saw how Raquel was as a good mother and wife and how well their children got on. And she took comfort from the fact that Adam's underlying character had not changed. ""In the hospital, Adam would turn to me saying: 'If you're my wife, I think we can kiss,'"" she says. ""This is still the husband I married - he is always trying to get a free kiss. Adam's always been a flirt and continues to be a flirt. ""Those were little rays of hope saying: 'This is still the man that you married - he just can't remember what year,'"" she says. The children also found ways of coping with the sudden change in their life. Abby was 12, Lulu was 15 and Elijah was 17 when Adam's second memory loss occurred in 2016. ""They watched out for each other and I think they were more attentive and they clung together,"" says Raquel. ""Sometimes you don't like your sister when you are a teenager but, boy, when something is happening you cling to your sister, you cling to your blood,"" she says. The girls tried to help their father's recovery  by showing him gym routines he had taught them. ""Look dad, this is what we did! You taught us all these exercises,""  they told Adam. ""I guess I spent quality time with each of them in the gym,"" he says. Then suddenly, one day in December 2016 - three months after his attack of amnesia - Adam woke up and spoke to Raquel with that familiar loving tone in his voice. He apologised for something that had happened three years earlier, when they were still dating. Raquel looked at Adam and asked if he knew who she was. He said: ""How could I ever forget you? You are my Raquel."" ""Oh honey, there is so much I have to tell you about,"" she said. But it was a work day and Raquel was the only breadwinner at this point, so had to leave. She asked Adam to take their daughters to school. Adam went to see if his daughter was ready. She was much older than he remembered, and of course he had no idea what school she went to. After the girls had directed him to their respective schools, Adam asked Lulu to put their home address into the GPS so he wouldn't get lost. Memory problems are very common after any form of brain injury, including traumatic brain injury. This is because there are several parts of the brain involved in storing and retrieving information. Research suggests up two-thirds of people with moderate to severe brain injury have persistent memory problems. Memory problems can last for weeks, months or years. It's impossible to predict whether or not people will get their old memories back. While some memories may return in time, memory loss may last forever and may result in significant milestones, such as wedding and anniversaries, being forgotten. There is no ""cure"" for memory problems after brain injury but there are coping strategies to compensate. These include the use of external memory aids and set routines. Source:Headway - the brain injury association,external Adam has now recovered many memories but three years are still missing, including some important milestones, such as his wedding to Raquel. He has also forgotten taking the family on a cherished holiday to Disneyland in 2013. ""I had always wanted to go to Disneyland but I was so busy working,"" he says. ""All that has never come back to me."" Raquel carefully documents the family's milestones, in the hope this will strengthen Adam's memory. She says she would happily repeat everything the couple has been through - but no-one knows whether that is likely or not. The doctors gave Adam every test they could - MRIs, CAT scans, echocardiograms - but they could not figure out what caused this second memory loss. The couple are now looking to the future. One of their children has left for college, and they're planning to renew their vows next year. Adam has returned to working with the church and has become a pastor. ""I really learned how to truly surrender to God and have faith and believe that you can overcome the hardest of struggles,"" he says. ""There is a new level of sweetness in our marriage that I don't think was there before,"" Raquel says. ""Our marriage had to withstand the rain and the storm of change and overcome all that - what better way to test a relationship than making it all collapse? ""My whole life completely changed and it was a beautiful disaster.""

"White House chief of staff John Kelly (C) escorted North Korean General Kim Yong-chol The highest-ranking North Korean official to visit the US in nearly 20 years has arrived at the White House to meet US President Donald Trump. Gen Kim Yong-chol is expected to deliver a letter from North Korean leader Kim Jong-un to Mr Trump. His visit comes a day after he met the US secretary of state in New York to discuss a historic summit between the two nations' leaders. Mr Trump cancelled the 12 June summit, but both sides agreed to move forward. Scheduled to happen in Singapore, the historic meeting between Mr Trump and Kim Jong-un would be the first between sitting US and North Korean leaders. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday called his meeting about denuclearisation with Gen Kim ""substantive"". ""President Trump and I believe Chairman Kim is the kind of leader who can make those kinds of decisions. And that in the coming weeks and months, we will have the opportunity to test whether or not this is the case,"" he said. Mr Kim's letter reportedly expresses his interest in meeting without making any significant concessions or threats in regards to denuclearisation,the Wall Street Journal reports,external, citing a foreign government official who was briefed on the contents. Kim Jong-un's right hand man What does Kim Jong-un really want? The political gamble of the 21st Century Gen Kim, often described as Mr Kim's right-hand man, is the most senior North Korean figure to hold talks at the White House since a senior envoy met President Bill Clinton in 2000. He was greeted at the White House by chief of staff John Kelly before he was escorted to the Oval Office. Tara McKelvey, BBC News White House reporter The opening of a letter from North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, which is being hand-delivered by his top aide, Kim Yong-chol, to the president, is vintage Trump. The letter itself is an old-fashioned gesture. But it captures the drama of a reality TV show and, in this case, reflects a high-stakes diplomatic one. President Trump has spoken of the possibility of winning a Nobel Peace Prize for his negotiations with the North Koreans, and the delivery of the letter moves him closer to the summit and the talks. Regardless of what happens with the letter or the summit, though, he's captured the world's attention again today - not to mention high ratings. Thursday's talks in New York concluded early due to progress being made, a US state department official said. On Wednesday evening, Mr Pompeo and Gen Kim arrived separately at a building close to the UN headquarters. Emerging later,Mr Pompeo tweeted:,external""Good working dinner with Kim Yong Chol in New York tonight. Steak, corn, and cheese on the menu.""

North Korea has strongly objected to statements by Trump administration members comparing North Korean denuclearisation to Libya's. Former Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi gave up his nuclear programme only for him to be killed by Western-backed rebels a few years later. Gen Kim has previously served as chief of Pyongyang's top military intelligence agency, and was sanctioned twice by US and South Korea for his role in supporting North Korea's nuclear and missile programme in 2010 and 2016. His travel restrictions were lifted this week so he could fly to New York and Washington, DC to meet US officials, the Department of State said.

"Frustrated rail users let their feelings be known at Manchester Piccadilly Northern has cancelled 165 daily train services until the end of July following major disruption since new timetables were introduced last month. The ""interim timetable"", to be introduced on Monday, removes 6% of the train operator's total services. Areas affected include Manchester, Liverpool, Blackpool and the Lakes Line between Oxenholme and Windermere. Northern has aborted 2,200 services in the last fortnight, with more than 200 cancelled or heavily delayed on Friday. The company - which hasfaced calls for it to be stripped of its franchise- insisted it will still run more trains than it did before the timetable change on 20 May, and expects to ""get back to a full timetable service"" by the end of next month. It follows a warning by the mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, that an ""emergency"" timetable was being considered to deal with the scale of train cancellations and delays. This video can not be played Passengers react to Northern Rail ""carnage"" Mr Burnham said the introduction of an emergency timetable was ""unacceptable"". ""The travelling public are having their lives turned upside down."" Northern managing director David Brown said: ""We have been experiencing some significant disruption to train services, especially around north Manchester, Bolton, Liverpool, Blackpool and up to the Lake District."" He apologised for the ""unacceptable situation"" and ""unacceptable service many customers have been subject to"". Mr Brown added: ""We are absolutely committed to resolving the service issues and the interim plan will help ensure we start to get back on track and start to give customers more certainty around the services we operate."" Commuters across the north of England have faced overcrowding on trains and platforms The Transport Secretary Chris Grayling cited government-owned Network Rail - which manages the rail infrastructure - for the problems. He said it was ""too late in finalising planned timetable changes"" which have caused widespread problems since they were introduced. The RMT's general secretary Mick Cash said the minister should ""get out"" and described the situation as ""carnage"". Mr Cash said his members are facing public anger ""without a shred of support"" from Mr Grayling or Northern's management. He said it was ""disgusting"" that Mr Grayling and bosses of rail companies have ""dived for cover"" and not faced passengers. ""Not only is Chris Grayling incompetent and not fit to run a railway but he is a coward as well, leaving RMT members to take the flack for failed policies that are his responsibility,"" he said. Rail industry 'has failed passengers' 'Meltdown Monday' after rail changes Mayor demands Northern trains inquiry In response, the transport secretary issued a statement which said: ""I am in regular discussions with Network Rail, Northern and Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), and have reiterated that disruption suffered by passengers is wholly unacceptable. ""I have been very clear with Network Rail that it was far too late in finalising planned timetable changes and this must not happen again.

"Isabella Morrison-Shand was sent the details of another customer Some TSB customers receiving letters acknowledging a complaint over the recent IT meltdown have also been sent other customers' details. Letters from the bank showed the name, address and reference number of somebody else. The bank has apologised for the errors, but one MP has suggested that the error could breach new data protection rules. Treasury Committee member John Mann said: ""There is a danger action could be taken against the bank."" TSB has been battling to resolve issues with various services since an IT switchover at the end of April. It has had teams ""working around the clock"" to fix the issues, which began after the migration of data on TSB's five million customers from former owner Lloyds' IT system to a new one managed by current  owner Sabadell. Problems remain for some - particularly business account holders - who are trying to make payments or access online information. The bank's chief executive, Paul Pester, will appear before MPs on the Treasury Committee for a second time on Wednesday. TSB crisis: No end in sight for customers TSB left man on hold as his wedding savings were stolen Customer choice under threat at Britain's banks Letters acknowledging complaints about the technological meltdown at the bank have been sent out to customers, but within a number of those mail-outs a further letter had been included. Isabella Morrison-Shand, of Inverness, received one and told BBC 5 live's Wake Up To Money programme: ""When I looked at the second page I discovered that it had a reference number, name and address of somebody that wasn't me. ""If I was in any way shady, I could contact them and say that I was from TSB and perhaps trick them into discussing things. I have no confidence in TSB at all of controlling their usage of my data and keeping it safe and secure."" A spokesperson for the bank said: ""We are aware that there has been issue with a recent acknowledgement mailing. We are working with our third party supplier to understand the root cause of the error and we'd like to apologise to anyone that may be impacted."" The Information Commissioner's Office, which polices data protection rules, said it was ""continuing to make enquiries in relation to TSB and we are aware of ongoing issues. Customers who are concerned about their personal data can contact us"". Mr Mann, a member of the Treasury Committee, which is investigating the TSB saga, told 5 live: ""They have broken the law. Even a small or minor breach of the law when it comes to data protection, is very, very important."" He added banks needed to adhere to the highest standards on GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). ""The Information Commissioner is not going to be impressed and will want to know exactly what's been going on. There is a danger action could be taken against the bank,"" he said. Data protection expert Ardi Kolah said it was worrying that the bank was not ready for the new legislation. Mr Kolah, the director of the GDPR Programme at Henley Business School and author of the GDPR Handbook, added it was ""interesting"" that the banking watchdog had not commented on the situation. ""One of the things the FCA has been doing is ringing round and checking and making sure the market works. This is quite clearly not how it should be working"". Mr Kolah also added the bank's problems could potentially cause a lot of damage. ""If a bank is seen to be a bit wobbly, all the criminals out there go 'this is an opportunity to go in there and steal people's data'."" Meanwhile, fraudsters appear to be taking advantage of the disruption at TSB. Warnings have been issued about phishing scams where customers have been contacted by text in an attempt to get them to divulge their account details. Elsewhere, ""sim swapping"" - in which fraudsters take over someone's mobile phone so they can get an authorisation code from a bank - has been used. Ronnie, a merchant seaman from Scotland, told BBC Radio 4's Money Box programme he had Â£13,000 taken from his account in this way.

"Two men have been arrested in connection with the crash A 19-year-old woman who was among seven pedestrians struck in a hit-and-run crash has died, police have said. They were hit at about 21:50 BST on Thursday during what Greater Manchester Police described as a ""cruise meet"" on Europa Way, Trafford Park - an area reported to attract ""boy racers"". One witness described seeing people being ""launched into the air"". Five victims are being treated for serious injuries while one has been discharged. Two men have been arrested. The men, aged 21 and 26, are being held on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving. The 21-year-old was also detained on suspicion of failing to stop after a collision. A blue BMW 330D understood to have been involved in the crash was later found in Salford. There were 60 vehicles present at the time of the crash, police said. Ch Supt Wayne Miller said: ""We are appealing for anyone with any information, no matter how small or insignificant it may seem, to get in touch as a matter of urgency."" One witness described seeing ""people flying"" after they were hit by the car Ryan Currie, 23, said he saw three people and a dog get ""launched into the air"". He said: ""The car then drove through them and carried on without stopping. ""Loads of people ran over to attend to the injured."" Trainers could be seen lying on the road and pavement, with purple medical gloves left strewn around. Parts of the Trafford Park area have stretches of long, straight roads and have become known locally as a place for car enthusiasts. One man who lives nearby said ""boy racers"" were taking part in a car meet, adding: ""Little kids in big cars are always racing around the roundabout so something like this is bound to happen."" Jamie Brown, who knows some of the injured, said he saw ""people flying"" and said he placed a girl in the recovery position. ""It was horrible to see. There were bodies lying on the road and people were screaming,"" he said.

"Constables Kenny MacKenzie and Laura Sayer are in a serious condition in hospital Two police officers stabbed during an incident in Inverclyde have been named. They are PC Laura Sayer, 39, and 43-year-old PC Kenny MacKenzie. Both officers remain in a serious condition in hospital following the incident in Greenock. They had been called to an address in Gateside Gardens at about 08:45. Constable Sayer has six months' service with Police Scotland and is still on her probationary period PC MacKenzie has nine years' service. A 43-year-old man has been arrested and is currently undergoing assessment in hospital. Forensics officers examine a knife at the scene Assistant Chief Constable Bernard Higgins attended the scene and said a major investigation had begun. He said: ""I would like to take this opportunity to publicly praise the incredible bravery shown by these two officers during the extremely difficult and challenging situation they faced this morning. ""They have been seriously injured going about their duties and both they and their colleagues who subsequently attended to assist demonstrated courage and the utmost professionalism both during and after the incident. ""They receive the thanks and the support of everyone within Police Scotland."" The two police officers are in a serious condition after being stabbed while on duty He said the incident was not being treated as terrorist-related and was contained without any further risk to the public. Extra patrols will be in place over the course of the weekend. Both officers were taken to Inverclyde Royal Hospital and one was transferred to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow for exploratory treatment. The assistant chief constable said their injuries were not life-threatening but ""significant and serious"" and said he had been to see both officers who were in ""remarkable good spirits"". ""I am blown away by the courage of them,"" he said. ""They said we are in the police and we accept that comes with a degree of risk. I was very moved and proud to speak with them."" He also said he had visited Greenock police office and met with the rest of the officers' team. He revealed: ""They are really emotional. They are hurting, they are upset angry and distressed. They have seen their colleagues badly injured. ""At the end of the day, police officers are humans."" The incident came at the timethe force is about to deploy newly-trained Taser-armed officers. The training of 500 officers in the use of the device began in May in a bid to improve the safety of the public and police officers. Assistant Chief Constable Higgins said if Taser-armed officers had been sent to Friday's incident, it could have meant a different outcome. He said: ""Potentially, a Taser could have made a difference. ""Greenock is going to be one of the areas during the rollout period which will see trained officers deployed."" He said Police Scotland would do all it could to support the two involved, adding: ""They will have physical scars, they will have emotional scars but I will guarantee that everybody in Police Scotland will do everything we can to help these officers."" DCC Iain Livingstone, the interim chief constable of Police Scotland, praised the ""incredible bravery"" of the officers. On Twitter, he wrote: ""All of @policescotland officers and staff thinking of them and their families. Courage, protecting their fellow citizens."" Andrea MacDonald, chairwoman of the Scottish Police Federation, said: ""Our thoughts are with the injured officers and their families. Once again we see how difficult and dangerous a job it is. ""Police officers put themselves between other professionals and the public and dangerous individuals sometimes with life changing consequences for themselves and their families.

"Cecilia Malmstrom said the tariffs had created a ""very difficult situation"" The US is playing a ""dangerous game"" by slapping tariffs on European steel and aluminium, the European Union's trade commissioner has said. Cecilia Malmstrom warned the move by US President Donald Trump would have consequences for the economic recovery of the EU, as well as US consumers. The EU has issued a 10-page list of tariffs on US goods ranging from Harley-Davidson motorcycles to bourbon. Canada and Mexico are also planning retaliatory moves against the tariffs. Ms Malmstrom said the EU would challenge the move at the World Trade Organization (WTO) but that tariffs on US imports were necessary as ""we cannot just take these tariffs and stay silent"". The commissioner said that despite the EU's ""rebalancing"" action, the two sides were not in a trade war. ""What we are in is a very difficult situation,"" Ms Malmstrom said. This situation could only be defused by the US withdrawing its measures against the EU, she added. UK labels US metal tariffs 'absurd' 'Stand up to bully Trump', says Labour US tariffs: Tata Steel calls for 'protection measures' Five reasons why trade wars aren't easy to win Mr Trump claimed the tariffs would protect US steelmakers, which were vital to national security. He has also complained about barriers US firms face in Europe and elsewhere. Following Ms Malmstroms's speech, he repeated his call for ""fair trade"". ""We're going to have it for our workers and for our companies and you know what? The other side understands this,"" he said. Mr Trump said the US economy is strong enough to handle the consequences of the tariffs and retaliation and dismissed concerns about alienating diplomatic allies. ""They're our allies but they take advantage of us economically,"" he said. French President Emmanuel Macron called Mr Trump to tell him the tariffs were ""illegal"". Mr Trump told Mr Macron there was a need for the US to ""rebalance trade"" with the EU. UK International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said the 25% levy on steel was ""patently absurd"", adding: ""It would be a great pity if we ended up in a tit-for-tat trade dispute with our closest allies."" Gareth Stace, head of trade body UK Steel, said the tariffs were ""no way to treat your friend"" and called on the government to safeguard the industry's 31,000 jobs. Justin Trudeau, the Canadian Prime Minister, said the US move was ""totally unacceptable"" and rejected the claim that his country posed a national security threat to America. Canada plans to impose tariffs of up to 25% on about $13bn worth of US exports from 1 July. Goods affected will include some American steel, as well as consumer products such as yoghurt, whiskey and coffee. Opposition to the US tariffs was also voiced by prominent Republicans. House Speaker Paul Ryan, the most influential Republican in Congress, said the move ""targets America's allies when we should be working with them to address the unfair trading practices of countries like China"". Mr Trump first announced plans for the tariffs in March, but granted some exemptions while countries negotiated. On Thursday, US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said talks with the EU, Canada and Mexico had not made enough progress to warrant a further reprieve, meaning tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium have now come into effect. They apply to items such as plated steel, slabs, coil, rolls of aluminium and tubes - raw materials that are used extensively across US manufacturing, construction and the oil industry. Allies retaliate with levies on jam, lamps and sleeping bags Four reasons Trump is hanging tough on trade Mr Ross said the president could lift the tariffs or alter them at any time: ""We continue to be quite willing and indeed eager to have discussions with all those parties."" On 18 May, the EU told the WTO it planned to impose counter measures affecting goods worth almost â¬3bn. If approved by the 28 member states, the sanctions will come into effect in mid-June. Canada, Mexico and the EU together exported $23bn (Â£17bn) worth of steel and aluminium to the US in 2017 - nearly half of the $48bn of total steel and aluminium imports last year. European firms have said they fear lower US demand for foreign steel will divert shipments to Europe. Analysts at IHS Markit expect the effects to be distributed across a wide range of markets, limiting the effect on steel prices outside the US. That leaves America to bear the brunt of the economic impact, which economists say will appear in the form of higher prices and job losses - as many as 470,000 byone estimate,external. Steel prices in the US have already risen due to the uncertainty and may increase as the tariffs hit imports. Consumers outside the US could see prices of some goods fall, while those in America may end up paying more.

"Frustrated rail users let their feelings be known at Manchester Piccadilly Northern has cancelled 165 daily train services until the end of July following major disruption since new timetables were introduced last month. The ""interim timetable"", to be introduced on Monday, removes 6% of the train operator's total services. Areas affected include Manchester, Liverpool, Blackpool and the Lakes Line between Oxenholme and Windermere. Northern has aborted 2,200 services in the last fortnight, with more than 200 cancelled or heavily delayed on Friday. The company - which hasfaced calls for it to be stripped of its franchise- insisted it will still run more trains than it did before the timetable change on 20 May, and expects to ""get back to a full timetable service"" by the end of next month. It follows a warning by the mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, that an ""emergency"" timetable was being considered to deal with the scale of train cancellations and delays. This video can not be played Passengers react to Northern Rail ""carnage"" Mr Burnham said the introduction of an emergency timetable was ""unacceptable"". ""The travelling public are having their lives turned upside down."" Northern managing director David Brown said: ""We have been experiencing some significant disruption to train services, especially around north Manchester, Bolton, Liverpool, Blackpool and up to the Lake District."" He apologised for the ""unacceptable situation"" and ""unacceptable service many customers have been subject to"". Mr Brown added: ""We are absolutely committed to resolving the service issues and the interim plan will help ensure we start to get back on track and start to give customers more certainty around the services we operate."" Commuters across the north of England have faced overcrowding on trains and platforms The Transport Secretary Chris Grayling cited government-owned Network Rail - which manages the rail infrastructure - for the problems. He said it was ""too late in finalising planned timetable changes"" which have caused widespread problems since they were introduced. The RMT's general secretary Mick Cash said the minister should ""get out"" and described the situation as ""carnage"". Mr Cash said his members are facing public anger ""without a shred of support"" from Mr Grayling or Northern's management. He said it was ""disgusting"" that Mr Grayling and bosses of rail companies have ""dived for cover"" and not faced passengers. ""Not only is Chris Grayling incompetent and not fit to run a railway but he is a coward as well, leaving RMT members to take the flack for failed policies that are his responsibility,"" he said. Rail industry 'has failed passengers' 'Meltdown Monday' after rail changes Mayor demands Northern trains inquiry In response, the transport secretary issued a statement which said: ""I am in regular discussions with Network Rail, Northern and Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), and have reiterated that disruption suffered by passengers is wholly unacceptable. ""I have been very clear with Network Rail that it was far too late in finalising planned timetable changes and this must not happen again. ""Train companies are working to keep passengers moving and disruption minimised. ""While this is currently a huge inconvenience to passengers as the changes bed in, we are investing in the biggest modernisation of the railway since Victorian times and this new timetable will deliver hundreds more services up and down the country."" Transport Secretary Chris Grayling ""needs to come out of hiding"", said Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham Earlier this week,Mr Grayling wrote to MPsover the ""wholly unsatisfactory"" service on GTR in the south of England and Northern. He also criticised Network Rail, saying it ""cannot cope"" with the workload, and its performance was ""simply unacceptable"". Wigan MP Lisa Nandy said Mr Grayling would meet with MPs on Monday when the Transport Select Committee will review the Northern and GTR franchises. Allow Twitter content?

"Isabella Morrison-Shand was sent the details of another customer Some TSB customers receiving letters acknowledging a complaint over the recent IT meltdown have also been sent other customers' details. Letters from the bank showed the name, address and reference number of somebody else. The bank has apologised for the errors, but one MP has suggested that the error could breach new data protection rules. Treasury Committee member John Mann said: ""There is a danger action could be taken against the bank."" TSB has been battling to resolve issues with various services since an IT switchover at the end of April. It has had teams ""working around the clock"" to fix the issues, which began after the migration of data on TSB's five million customers from former owner Lloyds' IT system to a new one managed by current  owner Sabadell. Problems remain for some - particularly business account holders - who are trying to make payments or access online information. The bank's chief executive, Paul Pester, will appear before MPs on the Treasury Committee for a second time on Wednesday. TSB crisis: No end in sight for customers TSB left man on hold as his wedding savings were stolen Customer choice under threat at Britain's banks Letters acknowledging complaints about the technological meltdown at the bank have been sent out to customers, but within a number of those mail-outs a further letter had been included. Isabella Morrison-Shand, of Inverness, received one and told BBC 5 live's Wake Up To Money programme: ""When I looked at the second page I discovered that it had a reference number, name and address of somebody that wasn't me. ""If I was in any way shady, I could contact them and say that I was from TSB and perhaps trick them into discussing things. I have no confidence in TSB at all of controlling their usage of my data and keeping it safe and secure."" A spokesperson for the bank said: ""We are aware that there has been issue with a recent acknowledgement mailing. We are working with our third party supplier to understand the root cause of the error and we'd like to apologise to anyone that may be impacted."" The Information Commissioner's Office, which polices data protection rules, said it was ""continuing to make enquiries in relation to TSB and we are aware of ongoing issues. Customers who are concerned about their personal data can contact us"". Mr Mann, a member of the Treasury Committee, which is investigating the TSB saga, told 5 live: ""They have broken the law. Even a small or minor breach of the law when it comes to data protection, is very, very important."" He added banks needed to adhere to the highest standards on GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). ""The Information Commissioner is not going to be impressed and will want to know exactly what's been going on. There is a danger action could be taken against the bank,"" he said. Data protection expert Ardi Kolah said it was worrying that the bank was not ready for the new legislation. Mr Kolah, the director of the GDPR Programme at Henley Business School and author of the GDPR Handbook, added it was ""interesting"" that the banking watchdog had not commented on the situation. ""One of the things the FCA has been doing is ringing round and checking and making sure the market works. This is quite clearly not how it should be working"". Mr Kolah also added the bank's problems could potentially cause a lot of damage. ""If a bank is seen to be a bit wobbly, all the criminals out there go 'this is an opportunity to go in there and steal people's data'."" Meanwhile, fraudsters appear to be taking advantage of the disruption at TSB. Warnings have been issued about phishing scams where customers have been contacted by text in an attempt to get them to divulge their account details. Elsewhere, ""sim swapping"" - in which fraudsters take over someone's mobile phone so they can get an authorisation code from a bank - has been used. Ronnie, a merchant seaman from Scotland, told BBC Radio 4's Money Box programme he had Â£13,000 taken from his account in this way.

"Mr SÃ¡nchez won after a long feud with conservative Mariano Rajoy Spanish Socialist Pedro SÃ¡nchez has ousted conservative leader Mariano Rajoy in a no-confidence vote and will be the next prime minister. It is the first time since the Franco dictatorship and Spain's transition to democracy in 1975 that a Spanish prime minister has lost a no-confidence vote. The vote by MPs in the Congress of Deputies - the lower house- ends seven years of rule by Mr Rajoy and his Popular Party (PP). It is a dramatic turn of events, as the Socialists (PSOE) have just 84 seats in the 350-seat Congress. Mr SÃ¡nchez managed to hammer together an odd mixture of parties to defeat Mr Rajoy,whose party was discredited by a massive corruption scandal.The parties do not appear to be very comfortable bedfellows. Senior Popular Party officials were jailed over bribes and money-laundering As a minority government, it could prove to be unstable. Mr SÃ¡nchez is expected to be sworn in at the weekend and to name a cabinet next week. He suffered two humbling election defeats, in 2015 and 2016, but bounced back months later, winning a PSOE leadership race. In the June 2016 election the PSOE's support was eroded by radical leftist newcomers Podemos. In return for having backed Mr SÃ¡nchez in the parliament vote, Podemos is likely to demand significant policy concessions from the PSOE, and perhaps some key cabinet posts. Mr SÃ¡nchez is likely to be challenged strongly over his plan to stick to the Rajoy budget. It is not yet clear how soon - if at all - Mr SÃ¡nchez will call an early election. Mr Rajoy's opponents have been vociferous in denouncing the PP's spending cuts, and now they will want to see a major change of direction under Mr SÃ¡nchez. Podemos condemned the bitter austerity medicine prescribed by the EU - and implemented by the PP - to address Spain's economic crisis after the 2008 financial crash. Spain now has a trade surplus, but very high levels of debt and its unemployment rate is among the highest in the EU, at 17.4%. The youth unemployment rate is running at 35% - the highest after Greece. Public debt is close to 100% of total economic output (GDP) - uncomfortably high, though lower than the debts of Greece and Italy. On the plus side, the European Commission has forecast GDP growth in Spain to reach 2.6% this year. For key players in the EU, the SÃ¡nchez government will be less of a worry than the unprecedented new populist government in Italy. Prof Xavier Torrens, a politics lecturer at the University of Barcelona, says the new Spanish government ""will probably focus its efforts on economic redistribution, given its social-democratic tendencies, rather than solely on economic growth, as the Rajoy government did"". The pressure for Catalan independence remains strong Mr SÃ¡nchez is firmly against Catalan independence and opposed the Catalan separatists' controversial referendum last October. This could be a thorny issue for his government, after Catalan parties backed his no-confidence motion on Friday. They said it was more a case of ""rejecting the PP"" than of backing Mr SÃ¡nchez. But before the vote, Mr Rajoy's government formally accepted a list of cabinet ministers proposed by the separatist politician who will head Catalonia's regional administration, Quim Torra. The cabinet is expected to be sworn in on Saturday. Mr Torra replaced four jailed and self-exiled candidates whom Madrid had refused to accept. Mr SÃ¡nchez could now speed up the return of Catalan autonomy, which was suspended by Madrid after the separatists declared independence last October. Catalonia's quarrel with Spain explained Catalans elect new separatist leader Mr SÃ¡nchez has recognised Catalonia and the Basque Country to be nations within Spain, not just regions. Prof Torrens told the BBC that ""this is symbolically important, because Mr Rajoy never did so"". There remains much bitterness between the Madrid political establishment and the separatists. Spanish prosecutors want to put the separatist leaders on trial, including Carles Puigdemont and others who fled abroad. Basque nationalists also backed Mr SÃ¡nchez, and they too could now push their own agenda. The decision of the separatists Eta last month to disband,after decades of violence, was a victory for Madrid. But there is Basque pressure to get Eta militants, currently in Spanish jails, moved closer to their Basque Country families.

"Spain's location at the crossroads of the Atlantic and the Mediterranean, Europe and Africa, has made it a key political and cultural bridge across five continents. Through exploration and conquest, Spain became a world power in the 16th Century, and maintained a vast overseas empire until the 19th Century. Its modern history was marked by the bitter civil war of 1936-39, and the ensuing decades-long dictatorship of Francisco Franco. Since General Franco's death in 1975, Spain has made the transition to democracy, and built a modern economy. The country's 17 regions have their own directly-elected authorities, but separatism remains a live issue in wealthyCataloniain the north-east.

Prime Minister: Pedro SÃ¡nchez Mr SÃ¡nchez has struggled with a lack of parliamentary support Socialist leader Pedro SÃ¡nchez took over as prime minister in June 2018, after his conservative predecessor Mariano Rajoy lost a parliamentary vote of confidence. This was triggered by a long-running corruption trial involving members of Mr Rajoy's Popular Party. Snap elections in April and November 2019 boosted the Socialists, but they fell short of a majority, while Vox became first far-right party to win seats since the death of Francisco Franco in 1975.

"The high cost of funerals is to come under scrutiny, with two separate reviews being launched. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is reviewing funeral costs, ""to ensure that people are not getting a bad deal"". Meanwhile, the Treasury is focusing on concerns over pre-paid funeral plans. Consumer groups have complained that people who pay for their funerals in advance could find their relatives face extra costs after they die. The Treasury is considering a move that would mean tougher regulation of pre-paid funerals and is opening a consultation process. The CMA said that because of the Treasury's separate action, it would not examine the pre-paid funerals sector. Instead, it will look into the cost of funerals in general. It wants to ensure that people have clear information on prices and services and get a fair deal on cremation fees. The average cost of a funeral in 2017 was nearly Â£3,800, the CMA said. Many plans do not cover costs such as embalming, limousines, a funeral service, a wake, burial plots or memorial stones. In some cases, families are left having to find an extra Â£2,000, even though they expect such items to be included. Were you to buy the parts of a funeral separately, rather than as a plan, these would be the typical costs - although they can vary significantly in different parts of the UK: Moving deceased to Chapel of Rest Â£99; hearse and chauffeur Â£315; coffin Â£275 to Â£1,500 or more; minister or officiant fee Â£148; funeral director's professional fees Â£1,000 to Â£1,500 Cremation costs: Cremation fee Â£660; cremation urn Â£200; ash plot Â£450; doctor's fees (not payable in Scotland) Â£164 Burial costs: Interment fee (grave-digging and backfilling for a single depth grave) Â£150 to Â£1,734; burial plot cost Â£280 to Â£5,000 or more; stone memorial Â£800 to Â£1,200 or more Optional costs: Embalming Â£136 to Â£165; limousine and chauffeur Â£305; flowers Â£151; order of service sheets Â£72; church service Â£98 to Â£149; catering Â£397 Source: Fairer Finance Daniel Gordon, senior director of markets at the CMA, said: ""People can understandably be very emotionally vulnerable when planning a funeral. ""We therefore think it is important that - at what can be a particularly challenging time - the process is made as easy as possible."" The CMA intends to publish an interim report in six months' time, with a final report coming six months after that. The Treasury is considering a suggestion from consumer group Fairer Finance that the Financial Conduct Authority should play a role in regulating pre-paid funeral plans. ""This announcement is only the start of the process, but it sends a clear message to those companies who are not acting responsibly that now is the time to clean up or exit the market,"" said James Daley, managing director of Fairer Finance. ""People who buy funeral plans are not around to measure delivery against their expectations, which is why it is so important there are clear rules around how companies must behave."" At present, regulation largely comes under the Funeral Planning Authority (FPA), which has limited powers to punish abuses. The FPA said that it was confident the review would prove the effectiveness of its work. Regulation by others would lead to less choice, higher costs and ""a less dedicated oversight of the market"", it argued. ""We continue to raise awareness among customers about how important it is to buy a funeral plan from an FPA registered provider. Only these providers will have undergone stringent checks and will be operating to an agreed set of standards, designed to protect the customer,"" it said. In April, one funeral services firm, Dignity, saidmore of its customers were opting for budget funerals, with a standard-issue coffin and no frills. But the company said ""simple"" funerals represented only 15% of its services, less than it had expected after it slashed prices earlier this year. In January, the firm announced it was cutting the cost of its ""simple funeral"" option from Â£2,700 to Â£1,995 in England and Wales (Â£1,695 in Scotland) in the face of increased competition. Dignity's head of insight, Simon Cox, welcomed the Treasury's consultation, saying: ""It is excellent news that the government has decided to do something about mis-selling in the funeral plan sector. ""Our research has shown that bad practices like persistent and pushy cold-calling are rife among firms that have no oversight from a regulatory body."" However,Dignity's share pricefell 14% following the Treasury and CMA announcements.

"These lions, Malor and Lira (front), were pictured at the Eifel zoo in 2016 Two lions, two tigers and a jaguar reported to have escaped from a storm-hit zoo in western Germany never left their enclosures, it has emerged. A search was launched and residents told to stay indoors after floods swept through the zoo in LÃ¼nebach, leaving the animals unaccounted for. The big cats were found after waters receded - still in their enclosures. A bear that did escape from its enclosure in the privately owned Eifel zoo was shot dead, officials confirmed. Andreas Kruppert, mayor of the municipality of Arzfeld, said zookeepers lost track of the big cats during the storm but later located them, still in their enclosures, with the help of a drone. ""We are very happy that the scenario we had initially feared didn't turn out to be the case,""  he told a news conference. The zoo was deluged when a nearby river burst its banks during the storm Mr Kruppert said the decision to shoot the bear was made to protect the public. What animals do when they escape the zoo Lions on run from South Africa park Wolf escaped 'after gate left open' ""As a result of serious flooding the high water pressure on the gate [of the bear enclosure] meant that it gave way,"" he said. ""As a result, and also in an effort to save itself from the rising water, the bear fled the enclosure on to the path. Emergency responders were already there and because the bear posed a serious threat to the people in the vicinity the bear sadly had to be shot."" He added that flood damage to the zoo was being assessed and animals would be transferred to another zoo if necessary. Roads around the zoo were closed while the search for the animals was carried out The 30-hectare (74-acre) zoo, owned by the Wallpott family, is home to nearly 400 animals of 60 species, including Siberian tigers and lions. It was first established in 1965 with only dogs, donkeys and a wild boar, according to the zoo's website, and is visited by 70,000 people a year. In 2016 two lions broke out of their cages at a zoo in Leipzig in eastern Germany.One was shot dead and the other recaptured.

"Roman Abramovich bought Chelsea football club in 2003 Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich has ""withdrawn"" his application for a UK visa, the BBC understands. A source close to the Russian tycoon said hisapplication to extend his investor visahad not been refused or denied, as reported in the press. Mr Abramovich, 51, has put plans tobuild the club a new stadium on holdamid the delay to renew his visa, which expired some weeks ago. Israel has said thebillionaire is eligiblefor an Israeli visa. Reality Check: What's an investor visa? In pictures: Chelsea's first 10 years under Abramovich The delay in renewing Mr Abramovich's investor visa came to light at a time of increased diplomatic tensions between London and Moscow, in the wake of the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal in Salisbury. Reports suggest it expired three weeks ago. Changes to the visa process, which came into force in 2015, mean applicants may be required to prove the origins of their wealth. Mr Abramovich, who made his fortune in oil and gas in the 1990s, became owner of the companies that control Chelsea in 2003. According to the Sunday Times Rich List, he is Britain's 13th-richest man, with a net worth of Â£9.3bn. He is reportedly close to Russian president Vladimir Putin. On Thursday, Chelsea issued a statement saying the club had delayed work on the new stadium at Stamford Bridge because of ""the current unfavourable investment climate"". The estimated cost for the new 60,000 seat stadium has increased to Â£1bn after delays, whichincluded a dispute with a local family. Mr Abramovich (right) has often been spotted at Chelsea's Stamford Bridge ground The 51-year-old is one of Russia's richest people He reportedly sold dolls before making his fortune in oil in the 1990s after the collapse of the former Soviet Union Mr Abramovich was a one-time business partner of the late tycoon Boris Berezovky, an associate of former Russian President Boris Yeltsin Critics say the two businessmen used their Kremlin ""family"" ties to acquire key state companies for below market value Abramovich served as governor of Russia's Chukotka region He is believed to be close to current Russian President Vladimir Putin Abramovich 'eligible to become Israeli' Chelsea put stadium plans on hold Reality Check: Who's allowed an investor visa?

"Rosemary Powell is thought to be Britain's longest serving, and oldest, poppy seller A former World War Two nurse is to retire from selling poppies after 97 years of collecting for the appeal. Rosemary Powell, 103, first helped her mother sell poppies on Richmond Bridge at the age of six for the first Poppy Appeal in 1921. The great-grandmother, from London, said collecting had ""kept me going all these years"" but she was ""getting old"". The Royal British Legion said Mrs Powell's efforts had been ""nothing short of phenomenal"". She is thought to be Britain's longest serving, and oldest, poppy seller. Mrs Powell lived close to where poppies were made in 1921 and sold them on Richmond Bridge For the 1921 Poppy Appeal, Mrs Powell said her mother Evelyn had to buy red crepe paper to make her own poppies after they quickly sold out of the originals. ""She made these very simple little poppies and we soon sold out again. It was the very first one so it really caught the public's attention,"" she said.

"Giuseppe Conte (L) presented a new list of ministers to President Sergio Mattarella A coalition government has been agreed in Italy, ending months of uncertainty in the EU's fourth-biggest economy. Prime Minister-designate Giuseppe Conte presented his list of ministers to President Sergio Mattarella for the second time in a week and the new government will be sworn in on Friday. Ministers are drawn from both the anti-establishment Five Star (M5S) and the right-wing League. Attempts to form a technocratic government had failed. Mr Mattarella rejected Mr Conte's original choice for economy minister but a different candidate was agreed on Thursday. Italy populists: What you should know Country profile Analysis by BBC's James Reynolds in Rome Four days of political and constitutional crisis are over. And a new populist government - led by law professor Giuseppe Conte - will now be sworn in. Aiming to rule: The Five Star Movement's Luigi Di Maio (left) and the League's Matteo Salvini In the end, the populist parties decided to back down and accept the president's veto of their original choice of a eurosceptic economy minister. Their newly chosen minister, Giovanni Tria, is in favour of Italy's continued membership of the single currency. But the populists' conflict with the EU is not entirely over. The M5S and the League have promised both new welfare spending and also tax cuts - which may run into conflict with the EU's spending rules. League leader Matteo Salvini will be the interior minister. He has promised a tough new policy on migration, which may provoke arguments within Europe. After meeting President Mattarella, Mr Conte confirmed reports that the new candidate for the key economy minister post would be economics professor Giovanni Tria. M5S leader Luigi Di Maio and Mr Salvini said in a brief joint statement: ""All the conditions have been met for a M5S-League government."" Paolo Savona will enter government after all - but not as economy minister Other notable appointments to the new cabinet include: Interior and Deputy Prime Minister: Matteo Salvini (League) Industry and Deputy Prime Minister: Luigi Di Maio (M5S) Foreign: Enzo Moavero Milanesi (independent, ex-European Affairs minister) Defence: Elisabetta Trenta (M5S) European affairs: Paolo Savona (independent), the controversial original choice for finance ""We will work intensely to realise our political objectives which we have already put together in our government contract,"" Mr Conte was quoted as saying by the Reuters news agency. The new government is expected to be sworn in later on Friday. After the ceremony, it will face confidence votes in both chambers of parliament, where the M5S and the League have a majority. Italy is no stranger to political turmoil - it has had 64 governments since World War Two. Mr Conte is taking over from Paolo Gentiloni, who led a coalition cabinet for two years. 4 March:5-Star wins 32% of the vote in the general election, with the League taking 18%. The two populist parties eventually attempt to form a coalition, putting forward Mr Conte, a political novice, as prime minister. 28 May:Mr Conte presents his cabinet list to President Mattarella who vetoes the choice of Mr Savona as finance minister on the grounds that he is a eurosceptic. Mr Conte bows out. Both parties are furious and Mr Di Maio calls on parliament to impeach Mr Mattarella. The president asks ex-IMF economist Carlo Cottarelli to form a technocratic government until fresh elections can be held. Carlo Cottarelli (left) was President Sergio Mattarella's choice for interim PM 30 May:Mr Cottarelli appears to suspend his own efforts to form an interim administration as Five Star and the League engage in new talks. 31 May:Mr Conte returns to the president with a new cabinet list, which is accepted.

"Roman Abramovich bought Chelsea football club in 2003 Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich has ""withdrawn"" his application for a UK visa, the BBC understands. A source close to the Russian tycoon said hisapplication to extend his investor visahad not been refused or denied, as reported in the press. Mr Abramovich, 51, has put plans tobuild the club a new stadium on holdamid the delay to renew his visa, which expired some weeks ago. Israel has said thebillionaire is eligiblefor an Israeli visa. Reality Check: What's an investor visa? In pictures: Chelsea's first 10 years under Abramovich The delay in renewing Mr Abramovich's investor visa came to light at a time of increased diplomatic tensions between London and Moscow, in the wake of the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal in Salisbury. Reports suggest it expired three weeks ago. Changes to the visa process, which came into force in 2015, mean applicants may be required to prove the origins of their wealth. Mr Abramovich, who made his fortune in oil and gas in the 1990s, became owner of the companies that control Chelsea in 2003. According to the Sunday Times Rich List, he is Britain's 13th-richest man, with a net worth of Â£9.3bn. He is reportedly close to Russian president Vladimir Putin. On Thursday, Chelsea issued a statement saying the club had delayed work on the new stadium at Stamford Bridge because of ""the current unfavourable investment climate"". The estimated cost for the new 60,000 seat stadium has increased to Â£1bn after delays, whichincluded a dispute with a local family. Mr Abramovich (right) has often been spotted at Chelsea's Stamford Bridge ground The 51-year-old is one of Russia's richest people He reportedly sold dolls before making his fortune in oil in the 1990s after the collapse of the former Soviet Union Mr Abramovich was a one-time business partner of the late tycoon Boris Berezovky, an associate of former Russian President Boris Yeltsin Critics say the two businessmen used their Kremlin ""family"" ties to acquire key state companies for below market value Abramovich served as governor of Russia's Chukotka region He is believed to be close to current Russian President Vladimir Putin Abramovich 'eligible to become Israeli' Chelsea put stadium plans on hold Reality Check: Who's allowed an investor visa?

"These lions, Malor and Lira (front), were pictured at the Eifel zoo in 2016 Two lions, two tigers and a jaguar reported to have escaped from a storm-hit zoo in western Germany never left their enclosures, it has emerged. A search was launched and residents told to stay indoors after floods swept through the zoo in LÃ¼nebach, leaving the animals unaccounted for. The big cats were found after waters receded - still in their enclosures. A bear that did escape from its enclosure in the privately owned Eifel zoo was shot dead, officials confirmed. Andreas Kruppert, mayor of the municipality of Arzfeld, said zookeepers lost track of the big cats during the storm but later located them, still in their enclosures, with the help of a drone. ""We are very happy that the scenario we had initially feared didn't turn out to be the case,""  he told a news conference. The zoo was deluged when a nearby river burst its banks during the storm Mr Kruppert said the decision to shoot the bear was made to protect the public. What animals do when they escape the zoo Lions on run from South Africa park Wolf escaped 'after gate left open' ""As a result of serious flooding the high water pressure on the gate [of the bear enclosure] meant that it gave way,"" he said. ""As a result, and also in an effort to save itself from the rising water, the bear fled the enclosure on to the path. Emergency responders were already there and because the bear posed a serious threat to the people in the vicinity the bear sadly had to be shot."" He added that flood damage to the zoo was being assessed and animals would be transferred to another zoo if necessary. Roads around the zoo were closed while the search for the animals was carried out The 30-hectare (74-acre) zoo, owned by the Wallpott family, is home to nearly 400 animals of 60 species, including Siberian tigers and lions. It was first established in 1965 with only dogs, donkeys and a wild boar, according to the zoo's website, and is visited by 70,000 people a year. In 2016 two lions broke out of their cages at a zoo in Leipzig in eastern Germany.One was shot dead and the other recaptured.

"Rosemary Powell is thought to be Britain's longest serving, and oldest, poppy seller A former World War Two nurse is to retire from selling poppies after 97 years of collecting for the appeal. Rosemary Powell, 103, first helped her mother sell poppies on Richmond Bridge at the age of six for the first Poppy Appeal in 1921. The great-grandmother, from London, said collecting had ""kept me going all these years"" but she was ""getting old"". The Royal British Legion said Mrs Powell's efforts had been ""nothing short of phenomenal"". She is thought to be Britain's longest serving, and oldest, poppy seller. Mrs Powell lived close to where poppies were made in 1921 and sold them on Richmond Bridge For the 1921 Poppy Appeal, Mrs Powell said her mother Evelyn had to buy red crepe paper to make her own poppies after they quickly sold out of the originals. ""She made these very simple little poppies and we soon sold out again. It was the very first one so it really caught the public's attention,"" she said.

"Increasing numbers of people are being readmitted to hospital in England with preventable conditions such as pneumonia and pressure sores, according to Nuffield Trust research. Better care in hospital and at home afterwards could have made a difference, it said. Emergency readmissions, within 30 days of discharge, have risen by a fifth over the past seven years. The government said no-one should endure unnecessary trips to hospital. It has committed to a long-term funding plan for the NHS to help it manage growing patient demand. An analysis by the health think tank, the Nuffield Trust, found that a small and growing proportion of emergency readmissions - around 1% - were  preventable, affecting 185,000 people last year. Between 2010-11 and 2016-17, patients readmitted to hospital in an emergency with pneumonia rose from 41,003 to 70,731. Emergency readmissions for pressure sores almost trebled to 22,448 while patients readmitted with blood clots in a vein (venous thromboembolism) increased by a third to 23,006. These were conditions that were not diagnosed during their first hospital visit and could have been prevented, the analysis found. Pneumonia is one condition which is behind rising emergency readmissions It said the findings should raise questions about the quality of care during a patient's initial hospital stay, how they were discharged from hospital and also the quality of community and social care services. A growing older population with more complex conditions is one factor in emergency readmissions rising to 1.38 million over the last seven years in England. This is in line with overall admissions. Emergency readmissions account for 8% of total patient hospital stays, up from 7.5% seven years ago. Prof John Appleby, director of research at the Nuffield Trust, said: ""Unnecessary trips and overnight stays in hospital put a strain on elderly patients and their families. ""That is why it's concerning that our research shows the number of people being readmitted to hospital within 30 days with potentially preventable conditions is greater than it was seven years ago."" Jessica Morris, research author and analyst at the Nuffield Trust, said emergency readmissions to hospital are ""potentially a warning sign that a patient's quality of care may have been compromised"". She said local health providers should now focus their attention on the three conditions which had seen the most significant rise in readmissions. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: ""We expect the NHS to work closely with local authorities to ensure people are treated in the most suitable setting and when they are discharged from hospital they have a care plan in place."" Linda Thomas, from the Local Government Association, said adult social care needed to be put on an equal footing to the health service. ""Councils are keen to continue to liaise with their NHS partners locally but need urgent funding to invest in effective prevention work to reduce the need for people to be admitted to hospital in the first place,"" she said.

"Cecilia Malmstrom said the tariffs had created a ""very difficult situation"" The US is playing a ""dangerous game"" by slapping tariffs on European steel and aluminium, the European Union's trade commissioner has said. Cecilia Malmstrom warned the move by US President Donald Trump would have consequences for the economic recovery of the EU, as well as US consumers. The EU has issued a 10-page list of tariffs on US goods ranging from Harley-Davidson motorcycles to bourbon. Canada and Mexico are also planning retaliatory moves against the tariffs. Ms Malmstrom said the EU would challenge the move at the World Trade Organization (WTO) but that tariffs on US imports were necessary as ""we cannot just take these tariffs and stay silent"". The commissioner said that despite the EU's ""rebalancing"" action, the two sides were not in a trade war. ""What we are in is a very difficult situation,"" Ms Malmstrom said. This situation could only be defused by the US withdrawing its measures against the EU, she added. UK labels US metal tariffs 'absurd' 'Stand up to bully Trump', says Labour US tariffs: Tata Steel calls for 'protection measures' Five reasons why trade wars aren't easy to win Mr Trump claimed the tariffs would protect US steelmakers, which were vital to national security. He has also complained about barriers US firms face in Europe and elsewhere. Following Ms Malmstroms's speech, he repeated his call for ""fair trade"". ""We're going to have it for our workers and for our companies and you know what? The other side understands this,"" he said. Mr Trump said the US economy is strong enough to handle the consequences of the tariffs and retaliation and dismissed concerns about alienating diplomatic allies. ""They're our allies but they take advantage of us economically,"" he said. French President Emmanuel Macron called Mr Trump to tell him the tariffs were ""illegal"". Mr Trump told Mr Macron there was a need for the US to ""rebalance trade"" with the EU. UK International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said the 25% levy on steel was ""patently absurd"", adding: ""It would be a great pity if we ended up in a tit-for-tat trade dispute with our closest allies."" Gareth Stace, head of trade body UK Steel, said the tariffs were ""no way to treat your friend"" and called on the government to safeguard the industry's 31,000 jobs. Justin Trudeau, the Canadian Prime Minister, said the US move was ""totally unacceptable"" and rejected the claim that his country posed a national security threat to America. Canada plans to impose tariffs of up to 25% on about $13bn worth of US exports from 1 July. Goods affected will include some American steel, as well as consumer products such as yoghurt, whiskey and coffee. Opposition to the US tariffs was also voiced by prominent Republicans. House Speaker Paul Ryan, the most influential Republican in Congress, said the move ""targets America's allies when we should be working with them to address the unfair trading practices of countries like China"". Mr Trump first announced plans for the tariffs in March, but granted some exemptions while countries negotiated. On Thursday, US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said talks with the EU, Canada and Mexico had not made enough progress to warrant a further reprieve, meaning tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium have now come into effect. They apply to items such as plated steel, slabs, coil, rolls of aluminium and tubes - raw materials that are used extensively across US manufacturing, construction and the oil industry. Allies retaliate with levies on jam, lamps and sleeping bags Four reasons Trump is hanging tough on trade Mr Ross said the president could lift the tariffs or alter them at any time: ""We continue to be quite willing and indeed eager to have discussions with all those parties."" On 18 May, the EU told the WTO it planned to impose counter measures affecting goods worth almost â¬3bn. If approved by the 28 member states, the sanctions will come into effect in mid-June. Canada, Mexico and the EU together exported $23bn (Â£17bn) worth of steel and aluminium to the US in 2017 - nearly half of the $48bn of total steel and aluminium imports last year. European firms have said they fear lower US demand for foreign steel will divert shipments to Europe. Analysts at IHS Markit expect the effects to be distributed across a wide range of markets, limiting the effect on steel prices outside the US. That leaves America to bear the brunt of the economic impact, which economists say will appear in the form of higher prices and job losses - as many as 470,000 byone estimate,external. Steel prices in the US have already risen due to the uncertainty and may increase as the tariffs hit imports. Consumers outside the US could see prices of some goods fall, while those in America may end up paying more.

"The UK must not allow President Trump to ""bully"" his trading partners, the shadow international trade secretary has said, amid fears of a looming trade war over US tariffs on metals imports. Labour's Barry Gardiner said the move to impose levies on aluminium and steel from Europe was ""based on a lie"". He said the government and EU should work ""decisively"" on counter-measures. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said he hoped the US would think again and ""tit-for-tat"" action was an option. Bikes, bourbon and T-shirts on EU tax list UK labels US metal tariffs 'absurd' US tariffs: The unusual ways nations have retaliated Criticism of Trump trade tariffs intensifies The tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium, which affect the EU, Canada and Mexico, come into effect on Friday. Mr Trump first announced the plans in March but granted some exemptions while countries negotiated. He justified the tariffs by arguing US producers are vital to national security and were threatened by a global supply glut. This video can not be played Shadow Trade Secretary Barry Gardiner told Today the UK risks high tariffs outside the EU Mr Gardiner said such claims were ""based on a lie"" and it was simply an act of economic protectionism. He said Europe needed to show it would not be ""cowed"" and should pursue ""proportionate"" action through the World Trade Organisation. ""We believe in a multilateral rules-based system,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. President Trump does not. He wants to break up that system. ""We have to see this as part of a pattern of behaviour and respond strongly to it and make clear to him we are not susceptible to the intimidation, threats and bullying that he is putting in place."" Leaders from other affected nations reacted furiously,setting out tariffs on the US, ranging from steel to sleeping bags and ballpoint pens. International Trade Secretary Mr Fox said the move was ""disappointing"", adding ""in the case of the United Kingdom, where we send steel to the United States that is vital for their businesses and their defence industry, it is patently absurd"". He said he would speak to US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross on Monday but added the UK ""absolutely do not rule out counter-measures"". Former Conservative trade minister Lord Maude said the tariffs were ""stupid and counterproductive"" and would only hurt US consumers. But he warned the government against doing anything "" stupid and unreasonable ourselves"" in response. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said Washington's actions were ""petty and most probably illegal"". ""Trump's trade war is ultimately self-defeating,"" he said. ""We know he's illogical and stubborn, but he claims to be a good businessman. Trump must back down.""

"The EU, Canada and Mexico have announced retaliatory measures against the US tariffs The US has slapped tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from its allies the EU, Canada and Mexico - but don't think they'll take it without a fight. All three have already announced retaliatory measures as the US follows its new policy, which has been attacked as ""protectionism, pure and simple"" by the EU. Ranging from serious to strange, these counter-tariffs could play a part in a growing trade battle. It's too early to say how consumers will be hit in all the affected countries, but prices could rise throughout the world in light of these tariffs. Read on to see which American products each US ally plans to target. What is a trade war and why should I worry? Trade tariffs: Real war or phoney war Prime Minister Justin Trudeau objected strongly to the announced tariffs, calling them an ""affront"" to their nations' military alliance. He said Canada buys half of US steel exports. This video can not be played Trudeau: Canada not US national security threat Canada plans ""trade-restrictive countermeasures"" on C$16.6bn ($12.8bn) of US goods, to come into effect on 1 July. The country will impose a 25% tariff on assorted US steel products, including railway tracks, piping and steel sheets. But Canada also plans a 10% tariff on more varied items: Yoghurt, soya sauce, strawberry jam, ""mixed condiments"", pizza and quiche Orange juice, whiskies, coffee, soups and waters Manicure and pedicure products, hair lacquers, shaving foam, toilet paper and dishwasher detergents Playing cards, felt-tipped pens, inflatable boats, lawnmowers and sleeping bags The list,published by the Department of Finance,external, also includes a 10% tariff on candles - although, relax Canadians, ""not including those for birthdays, Christmas or other festive occasions"". Senior Canadian officials say the list is designed to exert political pressure on the US and make it take notice of how this will affect trade. Asked by reporters if he was ready to start a trade war with its southern neighbour, Mr Trudeau said Canada was ""ready for anything"". Canada is targeting a variety of US foods - including pizza European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said he planned to take the US to the World Trade Organization over the American tariffs, a policy he called ""totally unacceptable"". Meanwhile, EU Trade CommissionerCecilia Malmstrom called the US measures a ""dangerous game""and said the EU would not ""stay silent"". The bloc releaseda list of tariffs,externalin March - 10 pages of US goods it plans to target: Bourbon whiskey, orange juice and cranberries Jeans, T-shirts and tobacco Corn and other agricultural products Steel and industrial products Cosmetics, consumer goods, motorbikes and pleasure boats Snuff and chewing tobacco The EU plans to target iconic US goods, like Levi's jeans The aim is to have the maximum political effect. Kentucky, home to bourbon whiskey, is Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell's state. Orange juice, meanwhile, is a major export of Florida - a key US swing state. France's junior trade minister Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne said he expects EU counter-measures to be completed by mid-June. America's southern neighbour also swiftly released a list of products on which it would impose tariffs, ""up to an amount comparable to the level of damage"" of US tariffs. Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said in a radio interview that the measures would target US products from districts that would cause political difficulties for Mr Trump. He said levies would be placed on the following:,external Flat steel, hot and cold foil products, and piping Cold cuts, pork chops and sausages Berries, grapes, apples and ""various cheeses"" Lamps Mexico Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo attacked the US tariffs Mr Guajardo said Mexico was the top buyer of US aluminium and the second-biggest buyer of US steel, and that ""this kind of thing does not benefit anybody"". US tariffs could hit $4bn worth of trade between the two countries. In 2009, Mexico imposed higher tariffs on dozens of US products such as apples, frozen potatoes and Christmas trees in a dispute over the access of Mexican trucks to US highways. The two nations agreed a deal in 2011 allowing their trucks to use each other's roads.

"More than 31,000 people are employed in the UK steel industry, and 4,000 work at Tata Steel's plant in Port Talbot, above US tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from allies in Europe and North America are ""disappointing"" and ""absurd"", the UK trade secretary says. Liam Fox questioned the US decision to impose a25% tax on steel and a 10% tax on aluminiumfrom the EU, Mexico and Canada, from midnight, US time. UK Steel said the tariffs will damage not only the UK steel sector but also the US economy. The EU said it would retaliate with tariffs on products such as US bourbon. The tariffs apply to a wide range of steel and aluminium products such as sheets, plates, bars, pipes and ""semi-finished"" products. The new tariffs will make steel and aluminium from the UK more expensive in the US, which could lead to a decline in demand for it - potentially affecting thousands of jobs. It comes as the sector is still recovering from the 2016 steel crisis caused by oversupply and slack demand. US imposes metal tariffs on key allies Tata demands 'swift' action EU has 'gun held to head' on steel tariffs Bikes, bourbon and T-shirts on EU tax list According to UK Steel - the body which represents steel producers across the country -7% of steel exports go to the US, worth Â£360m.,external The organisation's director Gareth Stace said UK steel producers were ""going to be hit hard"". He admitted that there was a problem of global over-capacity in the industry, but he claimed most of that was in China. He said that about 20 million tonnes of Chinese steel would need to ""find a new home to go to"" because of the tariffs. ""Because we are a free and open market here in the UK/the EU, it'll come here, we believe, and therefore further damage our sector - not only from the direct impact of tariffs in the US but the surge of steel coming here,"" he added. US President Donald Trump justified the tariffs on national security grounds, arguing that global oversupply of steel and aluminium, driven by China, threatened American steel and aluminium producers. Mr Fox said: ""It's very disappointing that the United States has chosen to apply steel and aluminium tariffs... all in the name of national security. ""In the case of the United Kingdom, where we send steel to the United States that is vital for their businesses and their defence industry, it is patently absurd."" About 31,000 people across the UK work in steel production and many more in the supply chain. There are steel mills in the North East, East Midlands, Yorkshire, and Wales. Tata Steel, which employs 8,500 people across the UK,has called for ""swift and robust action"" in response to the steel tariffs. More than 7,000 Tata workers are employed in Wales, including about 4,000 in Port Talbot - the largest steelworks in the UK. UK exports of aluminium to the US are tiny, butin March the UK's Aluminium Federation said it was concerned about the impact 10% tariffs could have. President Giles Ashmead said: ""While the US is not a major export market for UK-produced aluminium, indiscriminate tariffs are a hindrance to free trade, and do little to secure a 'level playing field' for global commerce."" The EU has drawn up a target list of 100 US goods worth â¬2.8bn ($3.5bn, Â£2.5bn) for its retaliatory tariffs, the BBC understands.

"Bereaved parents say talking about their loss helps with the grieving process Two out of five parents who went back to work after their baby died said no-one talked to them about their loss, a charity says. A survey of more than 2,500 bereaved parents also found that most employers did not offer any support. One father said he was sacked after taking seven days off when his baby died. Another father, Dan Wood, who lost his two-day-old daughter, says deaths should be acknowledged and not ignored. ""It's difficult to start a conversation about it but I would rather talk about her than not,"" he says. ""Our baby was part of our lives for a long time."" Sands, the stillbirth and neonatal death charity, is calling on colleagues and employers to find the words to talk about the loss of a baby. Dan, from Warwickshire, returned to work in a large team after Layla, his first baby with wife Amanda, died in December 2014. Recognising how uncomfortable some people might be talking to them about what happened, the couple wrote down their experience on paper and handed it out to colleagues and friends. They also told people to ask them about it if they wanted. ""Some felt comfortable, some didn't, but overwhelmingly most mentioned it. ""And talking really helped us both with the grieving process,"" Dan says. Dan and Amanda Wood lost their daughter Layla when she was two days old However, not every bereaved parent has such a positive experience. One mum who completed the Sands survey commented: ""At first my colleagues never said a word about my baby, although quite a few of them, including my manager, attended the funeral, which was very kind and very supportive."" Gradually people did broach the subject, but she said: ""I wish someone had said to them it's OK to talk to me about the baby."" Another mum from south west England said people at work moved on quickly ""excitedly telling me about their baby news"", so she didn't bring up the subject of her baby's death. Baby loss: 'People sharing stories is the biggest comfort' We must do better on baby deaths and injuries - Hunt Responses to the survey found that only one in five parents had been offered or given any support by their employer on their return to work and around half said employers did not discuss entitlements to pay and leave following the death of their baby. Two out of five parents said they were not offered any additional time away from work. If a baby is stillborn after 24 weeks pregnancy, or is born alive at any time but dies shortly after birth, parents are entitled to maternity, paternity and shared parental leave, as well as full parental rights and benefits. The government is proposing two weeks of additional pay and leave for bereaved parents from 2020. In the UK every day, 15 babies die before, during or soon after birth. Dr Clea Harmer, chief executive of Sands, said: ""Sadly, the death of a baby is not a rare event but too often, bereaved parents are faced by a wall of silence because people around them, family, friends, and colleagues, are lost for words. ""Death is never an easy subject and when a baby dies it is even harder to talk about. ""But finding the right words at the right time can really help tosupport bereaved parents,externaland families when they need it most. ""Not everyone will be ready to talk about their bereavement - but simply saying, 'I'm so sorry,' for example, can really help."" Dr Harmer added: ""For grieving parents, returning to work may be a difficult step but the workplace can be a vital source of support.""

"Frustrated rail users let their feelings be known at Manchester Piccadilly Northern has cancelled 165 daily train services until the end of July following major disruption since new timetables were introduced last month. The ""interim timetable"", to be introduced on Monday, removes 6% of the train operator's total services. Areas affected include Manchester, Liverpool, Blackpool and the Lakes Line between Oxenholme and Windermere. Northern has aborted 2,200 services in the last fortnight, with more than 200 cancelled or heavily delayed on Friday. The company - which hasfaced calls for it to be stripped of its franchise- insisted it will still run more trains than it did before the timetable change on 20 May, and expects to ""get back to a full timetable service"" by the end of next month. It follows a warning by the mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, that an ""emergency"" timetable was being considered to deal with the scale of train cancellations and delays. This video can not be played Passengers react to Northern Rail ""carnage"" Mr Burnham said the introduction of an emergency timetable was ""unacceptable"". ""The travelling public are having their lives turned upside down."" Northern managing director David Brown said: ""We have been experiencing some significant disruption to train services, especially around north Manchester, Bolton, Liverpool, Blackpool and up to the Lake District."" He apologised for the ""unacceptable situation"" and ""unacceptable service many customers have been subject to"". Mr Brown added: ""We are absolutely committed to resolving the service issues and the interim plan will help ensure we start to get back on track and start to give customers more certainty around the services we operate."" Commuters across the north of England have faced overcrowding on trains and platforms The Transport Secretary Chris Grayling cited government-owned Network Rail - which manages the rail infrastructure - for the problems. He said it was ""too late in finalising planned timetable changes"" which have caused widespread problems since they were introduced. The RMT's general secretary Mick Cash said the minister should ""get out"" and described the situation as ""carnage"". Mr Cash said his members are facing public anger ""without a shred of support"" from Mr Grayling or Northern's management. He said it was ""disgusting"" that Mr Grayling and bosses of rail companies have ""dived for cover"" and not faced passengers. ""Not only is Chris Grayling incompetent and not fit to run a railway but he is a coward as well, leaving RMT members to take the flack for failed policies that are his responsibility,"" he said. Rail industry 'has failed passengers' 'Meltdown Monday' after rail changes Mayor demands Northern trains inquiry In response, the transport secretary issued a statement which said: ""I am in regular discussions with Network Rail, Northern and Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), and have reiterated that disruption suffered by passengers is wholly unacceptable. ""I have been very clear with Network Rail that it was far too late in finalising planned timetable changes and this must not happen again. ""Train companies are working to keep passengers moving and disruption minimised. ""While this is currently a huge inconvenience to passengers as the changes bed in, we are investing in the biggest modernisation of the railway since Victorian times and this new timetable will deliver hundreds more services up and down the country."" Transport Secretary Chris Grayling ""needs to come out of hiding"", said Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham Earlier this week,Mr Grayling wrote to MPsover the ""wholly unsatisfactory"" service on GTR in the south of England and Northern. He also criticised Network Rail, saying it ""cannot cope"" with the workload, and its performance was ""simply unacceptable"". Wigan MP Lisa Nandy said Mr Grayling would meet with MPs on Monday when the Transport Select Committee will review the Northern and GTR franchises. Allow Twitter content?

"Increasing numbers of people are being readmitted to hospital in England with preventable conditions such as pneumonia and pressure sores, according to Nuffield Trust research. Better care in hospital and at home afterwards could have made a difference, it said. Emergency readmissions, within 30 days of discharge, have risen by a fifth over the past seven years. The government said no-one should endure unnecessary trips to hospital. It has committed to a long-term funding plan for the NHS to help it manage growing patient demand. An analysis by the health think tank, the Nuffield Trust, found that a small and growing proportion of emergency readmissions - around 1% - were  preventable, affecting 185,000 people last year. Between 2010-11 and 2016-17, patients readmitted to hospital in an emergency with pneumonia rose from 41,003 to 70,731. Emergency readmissions for pressure sores almost trebled to 22,448 while patients readmitted with blood clots in a vein (venous thromboembolism) increased by a third to 23,006. These were conditions that were not diagnosed during their first hospital visit and could have been prevented, the analysis found. Pneumonia is one condition which is behind rising emergency readmissions It said the findings should raise questions about the quality of care during a patient's initial hospital stay, how they were discharged from hospital and also the quality of community and social care services. A growing older population with more complex conditions is one factor in emergency readmissions rising to 1.38 million over the last seven years in England. This is in line with overall admissions. Emergency readmissions account for 8% of total patient hospital stays, up from 7.5% seven years ago. Prof John Appleby, director of research at the Nuffield Trust, said: ""Unnecessary trips and overnight stays in hospital put a strain on elderly patients and their families. ""That is why it's concerning that our research shows the number of people being readmitted to hospital within 30 days with potentially preventable conditions is greater than it was seven years ago."" Jessica Morris, research author and analyst at the Nuffield Trust, said emergency readmissions to hospital are ""potentially a warning sign that a patient's quality of care may have been compromised"". She said local health providers should now focus their attention on the three conditions which had seen the most significant rise in readmissions. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: ""We expect the NHS to work closely with local authorities to ensure people are treated in the most suitable setting and when they are discharged from hospital they have a care plan in place."" Linda Thomas, from the Local Government Association, said adult social care needed to be put on an equal footing to the health service. ""Councils are keen to continue to liaise with their NHS partners locally but need urgent funding to invest in effective prevention work to reduce the need for people to be admitted to hospital in the first place,"" she said.

"This video can not be played Why Mariano Rajoy is facing defeat Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is set to be forced out of office in a motion of no confidence. On Friday he congratulated Socialist Party leader Pedro SÃ¡nchez, who will become prime minister after the ballot. Mr SÃ¡nchez, who needs 176 votes, filed the no-confidence motion after Mr Rajoy's People's Party (PP) was implicated in a corruption scandal. Mr Rajoy will be the first prime minister in modern Spanish history to be defeated in such a motion. Q&A: Rajoy party scandal in Spain On Friday, as debate on the no-confidence motion resumed for a second day, he told parliament that it has been ""an honour to leave a better Spain than I found"". He said me hoped Mr SÃ¡nchez would be able to ""say the same"". The opposition Socialists have secured support for the non-confidence motion from various smaller parties, including the Basque Nationalist Party - which has a crucial five seats in parliament. Mr SÃ¡nchez says Mr Rajoy, 63, had failed to take responsibility for his party's involvement in the scandal, which returned under scrutiny last week afterone of its former treasurers was given a 33-year jail sentence. The High Court in Madrid convicted Luis BÃ¡rcenas of receiving bribes, money laundering and tax crimes. The case centred on a secret campaign fund the PP ran from 1999 until 2005. Many Spanish voters, exasperated by corruption scandals involving the traditional centre-right PP and centre-left Socialist parties, have abandoned them for newcomers like the left-wing Podemos (We Can) and centrist Ciudadanos (Citizens), as well as regional parties. Analysis by Guy Hedgecoe, BBC News, Madrid Pedro SÃ¡nchez emerged as a virtual unknown to win the Spanish Socialist party premiership in 2014. The photogenic economist and former basketball player won members over with a promise to unite a divided party and put the Socialists back in power. Yet he subsequently suffered two humbling election defeats, in 2015 and 2016. He was eventually forced to resign after his refusal to back Mariano Rajoy in an investiture vote plunged the country into a prolonged political stalemate and his party into bitter infighting. Months later he confounded his many critics by returning to win the Socialist primary. Spain's constitution states that the party presenting a no-confidence motion must be prepared to govern and replace the deposed prime minister if a parliamentary majority backs it. Therefore this moderate but ambitious 46-year-old from Madrid is set to be Spain's new prime minister, despite the fact that his party commands less than a quarter of seats in Congress. ""Resign, Mr Rajoy, your time is up. Resign and this no-confidence motion ends here,"" Mr SÃ¡nchez said during the two-day debate that began in parliament on Thursday. ""Staying on as prime minister is harmful and is a burden not only for Spain but also for your party."" Mr Rajoy insisted he would stay put and accused the Socialists of opportunism. ""Mr SÃ¡nchez is concerned because he is not doing any better in the polls and he has realised that he will never reach government through elections,"" he added. PNV spokesman Aitor Esteban said voting against the censure motion would only increase political instability Mr Rajoy's resignation ahead of a vote would prevent Mr SÃ¡nchez from taking power and usher in a caretaker period of weeks, possibly months, before a new PM is sworn in. If he loses, however, Mr SÃ¡nchez is likely to replace him immediately. The PM did not return to parliament for the afternoon session. Instead he remained at a restaurant for about 10 hours, with various cabinet members visiting him over lunch and during the course of the afternoon, Spanish media reported. Also on Thursday, the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) confirmed that it would support the no-confidence motion. ""We believe we are responding to what most Basques want and best complying with our responsibility by voting yes [to the motion],"" said party spokesman Aitor Esteban. Mr Rajoy currently has the support of the PP, Ciudadanos and two regional parties, which between them can only muster 169 votes.

"The streets of San Francisco saw angry protests on Thursday morning - and once again, the target was the technology industry many people here think is causing great harm to the city. A group of around 50 demonstrators, according to local reports, blockaded at least nine buses ferrying workers to Silicon Valley giants such as Apple and Google. The barricade was carried out using some of the many on-demand electric scooters that can be seen on the city's streets, a trend seen here as the latest symbol of tech arrogance. Protesters held banners with slogans such as ""destroy the tech saviour industrial complex"" and ""sweep tech, not tents"". Protesters stacked electric scooters in the buses path The demonstration was organised by a coalition of local advocacy groups, and was fuelled in part by anger over the recent removal of homeless encampments in the city's Mission District - an area that has been greatly disrupted by rapid gentrification. According to the San Francisco Examiner,external, while there were 126 tents targeted for removal by the city in April, only six homeless people were placed into short-term shelters. The root causes of the city's crippling homelessness problem are the subject of great debate, and the stand-out talking point in the city's current mayoral race. One candidate, London Breed, criticised the protest. Around 50 people took part in the protest ""I know people are upset about the problems we face as a city,"" she said. ""But destructive behaviour is not helpful. When we pit one group of San Franciscans against another, or argue about who is a 'real' San Franciscan, it becomes harder to find common ground. We are ALL San Franciscans."" Meanwhile, San Francisco's streets have become awash with on-demand electric scooters that can be rented via a mobile app. Three companies have spread their scooters far and wide - with public pavements being used as storage. It's a transportation trend that has investors extremely excited. One company, Bird, raised $150m in a funding round that valued it at over $1bn. Officials in San Francisco have ordered the scooters off the streets until it can work out and set-up a permit system. But protesters said they felt the city was doing little to enforce the rules, instead putting more effort into removing homeless people from the streets. âItâs absurd scooters have more rights than the homeless do,â said protester Chirag Bhakta, 30, speaking to the Examiner. But Scott Wiener, a state senator, said the protests were inappropriate. ""Trashing scooters, blocking commuter shuttles so people can't get to work, and demonising people because of where they work isnât how you make positive change,"" he said. The double-decker buses that take employees to-and-from the vast tech campuses found south of the city have in recent years become an obvious target for protesters. In January, abus carrying Apple employees was hit by what police believed was a pellet gun. And in 2013, a bus carrying Google employees had its windows smashed, followed by protests over how the well-paid tech sector had pushed up house prices in the city. According to US home rental directory Abodo,external, the average monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment in the city last year was $3,333, compared with a national average of $1,040.

"This video can not be played Donald Trump's US trade tariffs worry first minister Tata Steel has urged the EU to take ""swift and robust action"" in response to a US decision to impose a 25% tariff on European steel. The US said the tariffs on imports from the EU, Mexico and Canadawould start at midnight. This will impact directly on Port Talbot as about 10% of Tata Steel Europe's exports go to the US. Wales' First Minister Carwyn Jones called it ""short-sighted"" with wide-ranging implications for business. Liberty Steel's Welsh plants including Newport will not be affected, but it could hit parts of its UK operations. Almost 7,000 workers are employed by Tata in Wales, including about 4,000 in Port Talbot. The US announcement of tariffs on steel and aluminium immediately triggered vows of retaliation from Mexico and the EU, which called the tariffs ""protectionism, pure and simple"". The Community union called on trade unions across the world to stand together to oppose the measures. Criticism of Trump trade tariffs intensifies UK labels US metal tariffs 'absurd' Five reasons why trade wars aren't easy to win Henrik Adam, chief commercial officer of Tata Steel in Europe, said: ""We have been, and will continue, to work closely with our customers on potential product exclusions as the vast majority of the products Tata Steel Europe exports to the US cannot be made by US steel companies, such as our extra wide strip, battery quality hot rolled material as well as certain packaging steels. ""We now call on the EU Commission to take swift and robust action to combat the indirect effects of these tariffs. ""We must ensure our markets are not destabilised by millions of tonnes of steel being diverted away from the US and into Europe. ""The European Commission now needs to put in place protection measures on a provisional basis without delay."" Tony Brady, Unite national officer, described the measures as blunt and short-sighted while Labour MP for Aberavon, Stephen Kinnock, said it was a ""major setback for the British steel industry"". Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of Community, the steelworkers' union, said: ""The problems of steel dumping will not be solved by unfair tariffs and steelworkers in the UK and USA must not fall into the trap of believing rhetoric from the likes of Donald Trump."" The George Bush administration introduced steel tariffs in 2002 which lasted for 20 months. Why is Port Talbot steelworks important?

"More than half of people say they would cycle more if roads were in a better condition, a survey for the charity Cycling UK suggests. The YouGov poll of 2,024 people found that potholes and drivers overtaking too closely were the joint second most common reasons for avoiding cycling. The most common concern was having to share the road with large lorries. Cycling UK wants ""fundamental changes"" to road design and the Highway Code to give confidence to potential cyclists. Between 2007 and 2016, potholes and other faults in the road were a factor in the deaths of 22 cyclists, according to the Department for Transport. More than 350 others were seriously injured. The poll showed that 57% of people were put off cycling by having to share the road with lorries and other large vehicles, while 56% of people would cycle more if roads had fewer potholes and other faults. Potholes: Your pictures of crumbling roads Thousands of miles of roads in disrepair Coroner fears rise in pothole road deaths One in five local roads in England and Wales is in poor condition as councils lack the funding to repair them, the Asphalt Industry Alliance says. Andrew Slorance caught the front wheel of his bike on the corner of a manhole cover which had been exposed by a pothole, while travelling home in Edinburgh in 2013. He lost control, narrowly avoiding the traffic around him, and hit the ground. His teeth went through his lip and he broke his elbow. He was taken to hospital but was soon discharged and had to return that same day to have pins put in his arm. After weeks off work and a round of physiotherapy, Mr Slorance remains unable to fully extend his injured arm. The father-of-five could not ride his bike for six months and says it took another year for him to regain the confidence to commute to work on it again. Duncan Dollimore, Cycling UK's head of campaigns, said: ""Cycling is still a minority activity in the UK with only 2% of all journeys made by bike. ""Those who do cycle put up with the potholes and dangerous traffic conditions daily and still continue. ""However, it's not always pleasant and it's no surprise most people do not consider cycling for their short everyday journeys."" The survey found other concerns that put people off cycling included threatening behaviour from drivers (for 43% of the respondents), car doors being opened in front of them (40%) and speeding motorists (37%). Mr Dollimore said: ""The government wants more and safer cycling, but as Cycling UK's research shows, people who don't currently cycle need change if they're going to choose to cycle short distances rather than drive."" Martin Tett, the Local Government Association's transport spokesman, said: ""Councils are fixing a pothole every 21 seconds and keeping roads safe for cyclists is one of the most important jobs we do. ""However, only long-term, consistent and fairer government investment in local road maintenance can allow councils to embark on the widespread improvement of our roads that is desperately needed.""

"Two men have been arrested in connection with the collision, which left seven people injured Seven people were injured, including a 20-year-old woman who is in a critical condition, when a car struck pedestrians in a hit-and-run collision. The crash happened at 21:50 BST on Thursday during what police described as a ""cruise meet"" on Europa Way, Trafford Park - an area reported to attract boy racers. One witness described seeing people get ""launched into the air"". Two men, aged 21 and 26, have been arrested. A blue BMW 330D understood to have been involved in the crash was later found in Salford. Greater Manchester Police has stepped up patrols in the area, but say there is no evidence the incident was terror-related. The men have been held on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving. The 21-year-old was also detained for failing to stop after a collision. There were 60 vehicles present at the time of the crash, police said. Ch Supt Wayne Miller said: ""We are appealing for anyone with any information, no matter how small or insignificant it may seem, to get in touch as a matter of urgency."" One witness described seeing ""people flying"" after they were hit by the car Ryan Currie, 23, from Didsbury, said he saw three people and a dog get ""launched into the air"". He said: ""The car then drove through them and carried on without stopping. ""Loads of people ran over to attend to the injured."" Trainers could be seen lying on the road and pavement, with purple medical gloves left strewn around. One man who lives in Trafford Park said ""boy racers"" were taking part in a car meet at about the time of the incident. ""Little kids in big cars are always racing around the roundabout so something like this is bound to happen."" Parts of the Trafford Park area have stretches of long, straight roads and have become known locally as a place for car enthusiasts. Jamie Brown saw the crash and knew some of those who were injured. He described seeing ""people flying"" and said he placed a girl in the recovery position. ""It was horrible to see. There were bodies lying on the road and people were screaming,"" he said. A police cordon is still in place and Europa Way, part of the Trafford Park industrial estate, remains closed northbound between Westinghouse Road and Eighth Street.

"The high cost of funerals is to come under scrutiny, with two separate reviews being launched. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is reviewing funeral costs, ""to ensure that people are not getting a bad deal"". Meanwhile, the Treasury is focusing on concerns over pre-paid funeral plans. Consumer groups have complained that people who pay for their funerals in advance could find their relatives face extra costs after they die. The Treasury is considering a move that would mean tougher regulation of pre-paid funerals and is opening a consultation process. The CMA said that because of the Treasury's separate action, it would not examine the pre-paid funerals sector. Instead, it will look into the cost of funerals in general. It wants to ensure that people have clear information on prices and services and get a fair deal on cremation fees. The average cost of a funeral in 2017 was nearly Â£3,800, the CMA said. Many plans do not cover costs such as embalming, limousines, a funeral service, a wake, burial plots or memorial stones. In some cases, families are left having to find an extra Â£2,000, even though they expect such items to be included. Were you to buy the parts of a funeral separately, rather than as a plan, these would be the typical costs - although they can vary significantly in different parts of the UK: Moving deceased to Chapel of Rest Â£99; hearse and chauffeur Â£315; coffin Â£275 to Â£1,500 or more; minister or officiant fee Â£148; funeral director's professional fees Â£1,000 to Â£1,500 Cremation costs: Cremation fee Â£660; cremation urn Â£200; ash plot Â£450; doctor's fees (not payable in Scotland) Â£164 Burial costs: Interment fee (grave-digging and backfilling for a single depth grave) Â£150 to Â£1,734; burial plot cost Â£280 to Â£5,000 or more; stone memorial Â£800 to Â£1,200 or more Optional costs: Embalming Â£136 to Â£165; limousine and chauffeur Â£305; flowers Â£151; order of service sheets Â£72; church service Â£98 to Â£149; catering Â£397 Source: Fairer Finance Daniel Gordon, senior director of markets at the CMA, said: ""People can understandably be very emotionally vulnerable when planning a funeral. ""We therefore think it is important that - at what can be a particularly challenging time - the process is made as easy as possible."" The CMA intends to publish an interim report in six months' time, with a final report coming six months after that. The Treasury is considering a suggestion from consumer group Fairer Finance that the Financial Conduct Authority should play a role in regulating pre-paid funeral plans. ""This announcement is only the start of the process, but it sends a clear message to those companies who are not acting responsibly that now is the time to clean up or exit the market,"" said James Daley, managing director of Fairer Finance. ""People who buy funeral plans are not around to measure delivery against their expectations, which is why it is so important there are clear rules around how companies must behave."" At present, regulation largely comes under the Funeral Planning Authority (FPA), which has limited powers to punish abuses. The FPA said that it was confident the review would prove the effectiveness of its work. Regulation by others would lead to less choice, higher costs and ""a less dedicated oversight of the market"", it argued. ""We continue to raise awareness among customers about how important it is to buy a funeral plan from an FPA registered provider. Only these providers will have undergone stringent checks and will be operating to an agreed set of standards, designed to protect the customer,"" it said. In April, one funeral services firm, Dignity, saidmore of its customers were opting for budget funerals, with a standard-issue coffin and no frills. But the company said ""simple"" funerals represented only 15% of its services, less than it had expected after it slashed prices earlier this year. In January, the firm announced it was cutting the cost of its ""simple funeral"" option from Â£2,700 to Â£1,995 in England and Wales (Â£1,695 in Scotland) in the face of increased competition. Dignity's head of insight, Simon Cox, welcomed the Treasury's consultation, saying: ""It is excellent news that the government has decided to do something about mis-selling in the funeral plan sector. ""Our research has shown that bad practices like persistent and pushy cold-calling are rife among firms that have no oversight from a regulatory body."" However,Dignity's share pricefell 14% following the Treasury and CMA announcements.

"School pupils should learn about organ and blood donation to help tackle the ""silent crisis"" of a lack of ethnic minority donors in England, a group of Labour MPs has said. Demand for blood, stem cells and organs in these groups is particularly high and supply very low, their review says. Lack of awareness and a mistrust of clinicians were among the reasons. MPs said teaching children about donation would boost donor numbers by preventing ""misinformation spreading"". Although people from ethnic minority groups can receive donations from white people, the best match is often from a person with the same ethnic background. 'I hope someone gives my life back to me' Call to ethnic minorities over organs The review into BAME (black, Asian and minority ethnic) blood, stem cell and organ donation, overseen by the group of ministers, highlighted that more than a third of those on the waiting list for a kidney transplant are from BAME groups, and they wait on average a year longer for a transplant than white people. They are disproportionately likely to need an organ transplant, the report's authors said, in part because some BAME groups are particularly vulnerable to illnesses that lead to organ failure. But fewer than 5% of blood donors last year were from BAME communities - which make up about 14% of the total UK population - and the percentage was similar for organ donations after death, according to the report. This video can not be played Ashley: ""A lot of African people don't believe in organ donation"" MPs said there were a number of reasons for the growing ""donation crisis"", including a lack of awareness, mistrust of medical institutions, and ""perceived or assumed religious barriers"". Teaching about donation on the national curriculum would provide children with ""myth-busting tools that are often vitally needed in BAME communities"", the report said. Although some resources for schools about donation exist, there is no national requirement to use them. Carl Anka donated bone marrow that was used in a stem cell transplant earlier this year, after registering to be a donor with theAnthony Nolan charity,externalthree years ago. When he mentioned his donation on social media he was met by ""a lot of baffled responses"", particularly from close friends who were confused about whether it hurt and what it involved, he said. ""I think because it's not that common an experience, a lot of people question why you would do it for a complete stranger. The idea of paying it forward is something I was brought up with. ""Because I'm black there's a chance that one day I would need help, too."" Carl Anka said some of his friends questioned why he would want to donate for a stranger He said he thought it was important to donate to add to the ethnic diversity of the donor pool. ""It's basic mathematics. ""If I'm in a car accident with three of my white peers, the medical process required in helping me may be difficult for a lack of compatible blood types for a transfusion. ""That's really scary and limiting to your lifestyle - if you get hurt, it can be harder for someone to put you back together."" The report said a cultural shift was needed around donation but there had been little activity involving national bodies and community groups to boost donor numbers outside London. It called for public awareness campaigns in the media to help change perceptions around donation. Eleanor Smith, chairwoman of the group of MPs, said: ""This issue needs to be a national priority as this injustice and unfairness can go on no longer. ""I'm calling on the government, NHS bodies, communities and individuals to do more by not only highlighting the scale of the problem, but implementing the review's recommendations immediately so that we can start saving more lives."" Recommendations from the review include: A long-term government strategy, co-produced with organisations who work in communities, to increase BAME donation rates ""Cultural competence training"" for members of the medical workforce who come into contact with potential donors A formalised commissioning process for BAME community organisations, allowing them to access funding to grow and continue their work among the hardest-to-reach communities Donation issues and processes to be added to the national curriculum, to ensure younger people have access to accurate information A specific public health campaign targeting BAME communities, which is developed and co-produced by the community itself Health minister Jackie Doyle-Price said: ""We are engaging with these communities to encourage more donors - but for some there will be concerns around their faith and religious beliefs. For others it will be an issue of trust. ""To donate is to give someone the gift of life. I encourage community leaders to work with us and help spread awareness and understanding of donation so that we can break down the taboos."" Follow Alex on Twitter,external.

"Anne Longfield says too many children are being ""pinged"" around the care system Thousands of ""pinball kids"" are being moved around the care system with too much instability, the children's commissioner for England has said. Anne Longfield says nearly 2,400 children changed home, school and social worker during the 2016-17 year, while 9,060 had two of those changes. Ms Longfield says instability puts them at greater risk of gang membership, grooming and exclusion from school. The government says it has taken a range of measures to address the issue. The children's commissioner'sstability index report,external, now in its second year, compiles data on children moving around the care system in England, with a view to improving outcomes for young people. The report says stability is crucial for the 70,000 children currently in the care of local authorities in England, saying instability can compound ""the difficulties they have already had to endure"". It says: ""We estimate that the majority of looked-after children - 74% - experienced some form of change during 2016-17: a placement move, a school move or change of worker. ""This is equivalent to 53,500 children."" It also warns that 10% of children in care attending school - 4,300 young people - experienced a school move mid-way through the academic year, ""over twice the rate of mid-year school moves amongst the full school population (4%)"". The report says older children - especially those entering care from the age of 12 to 15 - are most at risk of instability and may need extra support to prevent placements breaking down. Young people who are either in care, or who have experienced being in care, told the BBC News website that instability can have a detrimental effect on their well-being. Ethan, 14, - whose full name we have not used - has had one emergency placement, two foster family placements and four social workers over the past four years. But he has now had three happy years at his care home and says he has benefitted hugely from the stability it has given him - he has been predicted to gain good GCSE grades and is hoping to go on to boarding college. ""Being in a stable place, I'm being managed, the people around me are in control and are helping me to move on. Ethan says three stable years has helped him ""It's calm, it's relaxed and I think that's a contributory factor to where I am now, my well-being, my emotional stability."" Antony Corrigan, 34, experienced a lot of change as a child in care - he went to four primary and four secondary schools. ""You find it difficult to make a friendship group and you become alienated,"" he says. ""I had at least 10 placements, including two children's homes and in terms of social workers, I lost count, but I probably had about 10 in total. ""I just wish there was more consistency in the care I was given. It's so easy to get lost in the system, no-one's pushing you or encouraging you."" Ethan agrees, saying children in care who have too many many changes to deal with can't focus on building their futures. ""It would be a struggle for them because they'd be worrying about what's happening, who they're going to going to be with. Anthony, now 34, wishes his care had been more consistent ""All their focus is on that worry, rather than focusing on their well-being and how they can improve and build a sustainable future for themselves."" Care-leaver Liam, now 22 and studying for a degree, was fortunate not to have too much disruption when he was in the care system, but he says he knows a lot of others who have moved around. ""Psychologically it can be quite damaging because you think nobody really wants you and you're pulled from pillar to post, not being wanted. ""People say you always have a safety net of friends and family, but when you're in care, generally you don't have that safety net,"" added Liam, whose full name we have not used. ""As a child you need security and to know that someone's going to look out for you."" Ms Longfield says: ""Every day I hear from 'pinball kids' who are being pinged around the care system when all they really want is to be settled and to get on with normal life. ""These children need stability, yet far too many are living unstable lives, in particular children entering care in their early teens. ""This puts them at greater risk of falling through the gaps in the schools system and opens them up to exploitation by gangs or to abuse. ""The care system does work for many thousands of children but our ambition should be for every child growing up in care to have the same chances to live happy, healthy and rewarding lives as any other child. ""We put that at risk if we are expecting some children to constantly change school and home."" Children and Families Minister Nadhim Zahawi said: ""Children in care are some of the most vulnerable in society and it is important that we provide them with stability and support so they have the same opportunities as any other young person. ""We have taken a range of measures to help create a stable environment including the creation of a virtual network of head teachers to help looked-after children at school, giving those children priority in the school admissions system and funding new projects through our children's social care innovation programme to increase support."" Richard Watts, chairman of the Local Government Association's Children and Young People Board, said councils were supporting record numbers of children and young people through the care system. ""Ninety children a day entered care in the last year, and councils saw the biggest annual increase of children in care since 2010,"" he said. ""This is against a backdrop of unprecedented cuts to local authority budgets, with children's services alone facing a funding gap of around Â£2bn by 2020."" Mr Watts said while the LGA would share the report findings with councils, the government had ""a role to play, in supporting councils to provide the best possible experience for children in care"". Graham Baker, chief executive of Outcomes First Group, said: ""A significant proportion of  looked-after children have been subject to childhood trauma, emotional hardship, multiple placements and subsequent lack of support from social groups - issues that typically lead to truancy, gaps in attainment and a shortfall in elementary foundation skills. ""Understanding where they have come from, where they are currently and close liaison with relevant therapeutic teams is essential."" Natasha Finlayson, chief executive of Become, said: ""There is far too much complacency. ""Tackling these sorts of inequalities is vital if we are to narrow the gap in educational - and therefore employability - outcomes between children in care and their peers.""

"More than 11,000 air passengers accidentally bypassed UK border checks between 2013 and 2017 through misdirection, figures have shown. Home Office figures show the number of misdirected passengers increased by 70% from 1,364 in 2016 to 2,328 in 2017. Misdirection can occur when the wrong doors are opened at the arrival gate or the operator sends the passenger to the wrong place, the government says. The Home Office said these people are identified and the checks carried out. It is considering levying a fine on carriers and operators responsible for misdirecting passengers, but the Airport Operators Association (AOA) has called the proposal ""disproportionate"". The figures, released following a Freedom of Information request, show the Border Force recorded 2,394, 2,665 and 2,278 misdirected passengers in 2013, 2014 and 2015 respectively. It did not explain the circumstances of what happened in these instances. Davidson urges May to drop migration target 1,600 skilled workers denied UK visas Airports with worst flight delays revealed In a statement the Home Office said there were no examples of dangerous individuals arriving unchecked because of a misdirection. ""The security of our border is paramount,"" a statement said. They said the ""overwhelming majority"" of passengers pass through border control as planned, but acknowledged a ""relatively small but unacceptable"" number are misdirected. ""We are determined to eradicate these errors and believe a civil penalty is a vital tool in ensuring this happens,"" the spokesperson said. Ministers are considering whether to implement plans to fine airports and airlines up to Â£50,000 when they misdirect passengers past border control - a power that already exists under the Immigration Act 2016. A spokesman for the AOA said the proportion of misdirected passengers as a percentage of total travellers has fallen since 2013. He said this demonstrated that operators' efforts to tackle the problem are having an effect. ""We are committed to working with airlines, ground handlers and Border Force to continue to improve on our track record. ""We do not believe that the proposed civil penalty should be part of that ongoing work as it is disproportionate in light of the numbers of passengers involved,"" he said.

"Rosemary Powell is thought to be Britain's longest serving, and oldest, poppy seller A former World War Two nurse is to retire from selling poppies after 97 years of collecting for the appeal. Rosemary Powell, 103, first helped her mother sell poppies on Richmond Bridge at the age of six for the first Poppy Appeal in 1921. The great-grandmother, from London, said collecting had ""kept me going all these years"" but she was ""getting old"". The Royal British Legion said Mrs Powell's efforts had been ""nothing short of phenomenal"". She is thought to be Britain's longest serving, and oldest, poppy seller. Mrs Powell lived close to where poppies were made in 1921 and sold them on Richmond Bridge For the 1921 Poppy Appeal, Mrs Powell said her mother Evelyn had to buy red crepe paper to make her own poppies after they quickly sold out of the originals. ""She made these very simple little poppies and we soon sold out again. It was the very first one so it really caught the public's attention,"" she said.

Her father Charles Ashton James was left wounded after being shot in the head during the Battle of the Somme, and she lost two godfathers and three uncles during World War One. Mrs Powell's first fiance Robin Ellis, who was a commander in the Royal Navy, died in 1944 when the Lancaster bomber he was flying in crashed. She also lost her younger brother Peter, a major in the Army, during World War Two.

In later years she spent time living abroad but she continued to fundraise. She made poppies out of paper for Remembrance Day while living in Africa, and sold the French equivalent of poppies, blue cornflowers, while living with her husband in France.

"Journalist Hector Gonzalez was found beaten to death in Tamaulipas earlier this week Mexico has requested urgent talks with the UN after a report linked security forces to mass disappearances in the north-eastern state of Tamaulipas. The UN report says at least 21 people have gone missing since February after being detained by the security forces in and around Nuevo Laredo. A number of reporters have been killed in Tamaulipas, with UN officials calling the state a ""silenced zone"". This week, journalist Hector Gonzalez was found beaten to death in the state. Mexico police officers sought over three missing Italians Kidnapped Mexico students dissolved in acid The Mexican government said it would take immediate measures to stop the violence and find those still missing. It also asked for more information from the UN. The UN published its report on Wednesday, documenting the disappearance of at least 21 people. ""Many of these people are reported to have been arbitrarily detained and disappeared while going about their daily lives,"" the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, said. ""It is particularly horrific that at least five of the victims are minors, with three of them as young as 14. These crimes, perpetrated over four months in a single municipality, are outrageous."" Human rights activists in Mexico put the actual number of disappearances in Nuevo Laredo at more than 40. More than 200,000 people have been killed or have disappeared since Mexico's government declared war on organised crime in December 2006. The military offensive has led to the destruction of some drug gangs, splits within others and the emergence of new groups. But with widespread corruption and impunity exacerbating Mexico's problems, there is no end in sight to the violence. In 2014, 43 students disappeared in the southern state of Guerrero. The state prosecutor in that case said that the students had been handed by corrupt local police to a criminal gang, who killed them and burned their bodies.

"The EU has threatened ""all necessary measures"" in response The US is to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from key allies in Europe and North America. The US said a 25% tax on steel and 10% tax on aluminium from the EU, Mexico and Canada will start at midnight. The move immediately triggered vows of retaliation from Mexico, Canada and the EU, which called the tariffs ""protectionism, pure and simple"". The UK said it was ""deeply disappointed"" by the US decision, which followed weeks of negotiations. The tariffs will hit products such as plated steel, slabs, coil, rolls of aluminium, and tubes, raw materials which are used extensively across US manufacturing, construction, and the oil industry. EU trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said it was a ""bad day for world trade"", while European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said the move was ""totally unacceptable"". The EU has ""no choice"" but to bring a case before the World Trade Organization and impose duties on US imports, he added. The unusual ways nations have retaliated UK labels US metal tariffs 'absurd' US tariffs: Tata Steel calls for 'protection measures' Five reasons why trade wars aren't easy to win Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the tariffs were an ""affront"" to the longstanding relationship between Canada and the US, especially to the ""thousands of Canadian soldiers who fought and died alongside their American comrades-in-arms"" in Afghanistan. He said Canada plans to levy tariffs on American products worth about $13bn starting 1 July. It is also planning a challenge at the World Trade Organization. He said: ""We have to believe that at some point common sense will prevail but we see no sign of that in this [US] action today."" This video can not be played Trudeau: Canada not US national security threat Canada said it would put 25% tariffs on certain types of American steel, as well as a 10% tax on other items, including yoghurt, whiskey and roasted coffee. Mexico's Economy Ministry said it is planning new duties for steel, pork legs and shoulders, apples, grapes, blueberries and cheese. Europe had previously outlined a list of items, including US bourbon, cranberries and jeans, as targets for retaliation. US President Donald Trump announced plans for tariffs on foreign steel and aluminium in March, justifying them on national security grounds. He has argued that global oversupply of steel and aluminium, driven by China, threatens American steel and aluminium producers, which are vital to the US. Since the announcement, South Korea, Argentina, Australia and Brazil have agreed to put limits on the volume of metals they can ship to the US in lieu of tariffs. The US granted temporary exemptions to the EU, Canada and Mexico amid negotiations over limits. That deadline was due to expire on 1 June, having already been extended by a month. US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced the sanctions from Paris, where he had been negotiating with EU leaders who were trying to avert the tariffs. Mr Ross said talks had not made enough progress to warrant a further reprieve either for Europe or for Canada and Mexico, which are in negotiations with the US over North America's free trade agreement. Who is losing out from Trump's tariffs? Steel tariffs - what impact will they really have? Mr Trump has the authority to lift the tariffs or alter them at any time, he added. ""We continue to be quite willing and indeed eager to have discussions with all those parties,"" Mr Ross said. The Trump administration is determined to wring concessions from its trading partners around the world - and it's prepared to do so in belligerent style. The President believes cheap imports harm US industry and cost US workers their jobs. On the campaign trail, he promised them a fairer deal - and it seems he's happy to risk a trade war to get what he wants. In fact, he has previously suggested that trade wars are ""good, and easy to win"". So will it go that far? Certainly, the EU and Mexico seem prepared to retaliate - and Canada has hinted it in the past might take action as well. So it's not looking good. But if you look at Washington's dealings with China - its key target on trade - things seem less clear cut. On several occasions the rhetoric between the two sides has been ramped up, threats have been made, then positions have softened. So far, an all-out trade war has been avoided. And China has made some concessions. So perhaps this is simply how negotiations take place in the Trump era. Loudly - and in a blaze of publicity. Canada, Mexico and the EU combined exported $23bn worth of steel and aluminium to the US last year - nearly half of the $48bn total steel and aluminium imports in 2017. Since Mr Trump's announcement in March, companies in the US that buy metals have already reported higher steel prices and and complained that US producers do not have the ability to meet demand. Economists and US companies have warned that higher metal costs will disrupt supply chains and eventually get passed on to US households. They said the tariffs are likely to lead to job losses at firms that rely on the materials. Goldman Sachs in March estimated that the tariffs would boost inflation by less than half a percentage point. Four reasons Trump is hanging tough on trade Mr Ross has dismissed the concerns about higher costs, arguing that the effects will be minimal. Shares of US steel producers gained in trading on Thursday, while companies that rely on the metals, such as Caterpillar and Boeing, declined. Canada, Mexico and the EU combined exported $23bn worth of steel and aluminium to the US last year - nearly half of the $48bn of total steel and aluminium imports last year. UK producers, like those in mainland Europe, are worried the tariffs will cause a decline in US demand, while prompting a surge in steel imports diverted from the US. The disruption would hit the industry hard, said Gareth Stace, director of trade association UK Steel. The UK steel industry employs about 31,000 people and sends about 7% of its exports to the US,according to the organisation,external. The tariffs have faced sharp criticism in the US from businesses and lawmakers, including Republicans typically allied with the president. Republican Kevin Brady, who shepherded last year's tax cut through Congress and chairs the House Ways and Means Committee, called on the administration to reinstate the exemptions. He said: ""The administration will need to come to Capitol Hill to provide answers about the indiscriminate harm these tariffs are causing our local businesses."" The US Aluminum Association, which represents major producers, also criticised the US decision, saying tariffs would alienate allies and fail to address oversupply. France's junior trade minister Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne said he expects EU counter-measures to be completed by mid-June. Canada's tariffs - which target about $13bn worth of US products - are expected to start on 1 July. China has already imposed duties on $3bn worth of US goods, including wine and nuts, in retaliation for the steel and aluminium tariffs.

"Cecilia Malmstrom said the tariffs had created a ""very difficult situation"" The US is playing a ""dangerous game"" by slapping tariffs on European steel and aluminium, the European Union's trade commissioner has said. Cecilia Malmstrom warned the move by US President Donald Trump would have consequences for the economic recovery of the EU, as well as US consumers. The EU has issued a 10-page list of tariffs on US goods ranging from Harley-Davidson motorcycles to bourbon. Canada and Mexico are also planning retaliatory moves against the tariffs. Ms Malmstrom said the EU would challenge the move at the World Trade Organization (WTO) but that tariffs on US imports were necessary as ""we cannot just take these tariffs and stay silent"". The commissioner said that despite the EU's ""rebalancing"" action, the two sides were not in a trade war. ""What we are in is a very difficult situation,"" Ms Malmstrom said. This situation could only be defused by the US withdrawing its measures against the EU, she added. UK labels US metal tariffs 'absurd' 'Stand up to bully Trump', says Labour US tariffs: Tata Steel calls for 'protection measures' Five reasons why trade wars aren't easy to win Mr Trump claimed the tariffs would protect US steelmakers, which were vital to national security. He has also complained about barriers US firms face in Europe and elsewhere. Following Ms Malmstroms's speech, he repeated his call for ""fair trade"". ""We're going to have it for our workers and for our companies and you know what? The other side understands this,"" he said. Mr Trump said the US economy is strong enough to handle the consequences of the tariffs and retaliation and dismissed concerns about alienating diplomatic allies. ""They're our allies but they take advantage of us economically,"" he said. French President Emmanuel Macron called Mr Trump to tell him the tariffs were ""illegal"". Mr Trump told Mr Macron there was a need for the US to ""rebalance trade"" with the EU. UK International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said the 25% levy on steel was ""patently absurd"", adding: ""It would be a great pity if we ended up in a tit-for-tat trade dispute with our closest allies."" Gareth Stace, head of trade body UK Steel, said the tariffs were ""no way to treat your friend"" and called on the government to safeguard the industry's 31,000 jobs. Justin Trudeau, the Canadian Prime Minister, said the US move was ""totally unacceptable"" and rejected the claim that his country posed a national security threat to America. Canada plans to impose tariffs of up to 25% on about $13bn worth of US exports from 1 July. Goods affected will include some American steel, as well as consumer products such as yoghurt, whiskey and coffee. Opposition to the US tariffs was also voiced by prominent Republicans. House Speaker Paul Ryan, the most influential Republican in Congress, said the move ""targets America's allies when we should be working with them to address the unfair trading practices of countries like China"". Mr Trump first announced plans for the tariffs in March, but granted some exemptions while countries negotiated. On Thursday, US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said talks with the EU, Canada and Mexico had not made enough progress to warrant a further reprieve, meaning tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium have now come into effect. They apply to items such as plated steel, slabs, coil, rolls of aluminium and tubes - raw materials that are used extensively across US manufacturing, construction and the oil industry. Allies retaliate with levies on jam, lamps and sleeping bags Four reasons Trump is hanging tough on trade Mr Ross said the president could lift the tariffs or alter them at any time: ""We continue to be quite willing and indeed eager to have discussions with all those parties."" On 18 May, the EU told the WTO it planned to impose counter measures affecting goods worth almost â¬3bn. If approved by the 28 member states, the sanctions will come into effect in mid-June. Canada, Mexico and the EU together exported $23bn (Â£17bn) worth of steel and aluminium to the US in 2017 - nearly half of the $48bn of total steel and aluminium imports last year. European firms have said they fear lower US demand for foreign steel will divert shipments to Europe. Analysts at IHS Markit expect the effects to be distributed across a wide range of markets, limiting the effect on steel prices outside the US. That leaves America to bear the brunt of the economic impact, which economists say will appear in the form of higher prices and job losses - as many as 470,000 byone estimate,external. Steel prices in the US have already risen due to the uncertainty and may increase as the tariffs hit imports. Consumers outside the US could see prices of some goods fall, while those in America may end up paying more.

"Journalist Hector Gonzalez was found beaten to death in Tamaulipas earlier this week Mexico has requested urgent talks with the UN after a report linked security forces to mass disappearances in the north-eastern state of Tamaulipas. The UN report says at least 21 people have gone missing since February after being detained by the security forces in and around Nuevo Laredo. A number of reporters have been killed in Tamaulipas, with UN officials calling the state a ""silenced zone"". This week, journalist Hector Gonzalez was found beaten to death in the state. Mexico police officers sought over three missing Italians Kidnapped Mexico students dissolved in acid The Mexican government said it would take immediate measures to stop the violence and find those still missing. It also asked for more information from the UN. The UN published its report on Wednesday, documenting the disappearance of at least 21 people. ""Many of these people are reported to have been arbitrarily detained and disappeared while going about their daily lives,"" the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, said. ""It is particularly horrific that at least five of the victims are minors, with three of them as young as 14. These crimes, perpetrated over four months in a single municipality, are outrageous."" Human rights activists in Mexico put the actual number of disappearances in Nuevo Laredo at more than 40. More than 200,000 people have been killed or have disappeared since Mexico's government declared war on organised crime in December 2006. The military offensive has led to the destruction of some drug gangs, splits within others and the emergence of new groups. But with widespread corruption and impunity exacerbating Mexico's problems, there is no end in sight to the violence. In 2014, 43 students disappeared in the southern state of Guerrero. The state prosecutor in that case said that the students had been handed by corrupt local police to a criminal gang, who killed them and burned their bodies.

"Protestors in San Francisco have blockaded commuter buses heading for Silicon Valley, claiming that the tech industry is ruining their city. Demonstrators piled electric scooters in front of the coaches, some of which were bound for Google's headquarters. Around 50 people joined the protest, holding signs decrying what they called ""toxic techsploitation"". They chanted and swore at one man who was trying to board a bus bound for the Google HQ, calling him a ""sell-out"". Protesters stacked electric scooters in the buses path Around 50 people took part in the protest The tech industry has brought great wealth to San Francisco and its suburbs. But it has also sent property prices and homelessness soaring - exacerbating the income gap. The demonstration comes after city Mayor Mark Farrell ordered an ""aggressive"" push to sweep away homeless encampments. This is not the first time that buses carrying employees of Apple and Google to their company headquarters have been attacked by protesters. Earlier this year a bus carrying Apple employees had its windows smashedby people who police said may have been armed with pellet guns. The company told employees in an email at the time that buses would be re-routed in the future to avoid protests.
