"There is a tiny special club, a powerful group who knew Queen Elizabeth in a particular and private way - her prime ministers. They all used to speak to her in person for an hour or so each week. The monarch was their confidant of sorts, an adviser providing a shrewd ear. For this week's programme I've been speaking to Gordon Brown, David Cameron and Theresa May, the Queen's 11th, 12th, and 13th prime ministers, about why it matters, their memories of one monarch, and their hopes for the next. The Queen always would have ""done her red boxes, read government papers"" and would be well-versed in the dilemmas of government decisions, said Mrs May. Her predecessor, Mr Brown, joked that sometimes he had been ""embarrassed"" by the extent of her knowledge, recalling that on one occasion she had more up to date information about a particular Commonwealth country than he did. Mr Cameron described the Queen as the ""world's greatest public servant"" with a profound understanding of what was going on at any one moment. This video can not be played Watch: Mr Cameron told the BBC that Charles had served âthe longest apprenticeship in historyâ All three former PMs told me they benefitted enormously from her long years of experience that she shared with them in private - a sense that whatever the problem of the day, she could provide advice and a sense of proportion. They all emphasised the new King's long years of preparation and knowledge of the role he now occupies, with Mr Cameron telling me the then-Prince Charles, during what he called ""the longest apprenticeship in history"", had practised holding audiences with him while his mother was on the throne. Looking to the future, Mr Brown said he felt King Charles - in his televised address to the nation on Friday - had carefully sent a message to the country that his priorities would change, leaving his charities and causes to others to take on. What happens next after the Queen's death? How titles and the line of succession have changed Nine shows to stream about the Queen Yet what stood out in our conversations were their personal encounters with the Queen. For Mr Brown it was the time she told the corgis to ""shut up"" in front of his young sons. For months after, they would defend themselves when being told off for using the phrase by saying: ""If the Queen says it, why can't we?"" Gordon Brown recalls the Queen telling her corgis to ""shut up"" in front of his young sons Mr Cameron recalled the time he got lost on the Balmoral estate but was found by the Duke of Edinburgh - travelling at speed in his Land Rover across the moor - and how at state occasions, his wife Samantha always wanted to sit next to the then-Prince Charles because he was the most fun companion for a long, formal evening. Mrs May remembered with laughter the time she dropped the cheese at the Balmoral picnic, then put it back on the table even though the Queen was watching her every move, and how at those Highland weekends the monarch would sit happily playing patience on her own while her guests mingled around her. These politicians knew the Queen well, but our conversations echo how many members of the public perhaps felt - the most formal, yet familiar too. The monarch with golden robes and a jewel-laden Crown - but a friendly face in a difficult moment. The most experienced and knowledgeable diplomat the country has ever seen, and the party host clearing up the barbecue. The head of state of the sixth biggest economy in the world, but also a great-grandmother at ease with Paddington Bear. On our show last week we interviewed the woman who was the last politician to have the traditional audience with the Queen. It's fitting perhaps that the last formal photograph of her showed that vital encounter with Liz Truss. The new PM and the new King are now the next to fulfil this tradition. It's hard to fathom how much has changed in just seven days. But the connection, the importance of the conversations between the inhabitant of the Palace and the prime minister goes on.

"This video can not be played Watch: Three of Queen Elizabeth II's children pay tribute after her death Queen Elizabeth's children have shared their favourite memories of their mother's sense of humour, love of family holidays and ""fantastic twinkle"". The royals were speaking as part of a BBC One Special - A Tribute to Her Majesty The Queen. King Charles recalled a moment before Queen Elizabeth's coronation in 1953. ""I shall never forget, when we were small, having a bath and she came in practicing wearing the crown before the coronation,"" he said. ""All those sorts of marvellous moments, I shall never forget."" Charles was just three years old when his mother ascended to the throne. Now 73, he has had more training in the lead up to becoming King than any other British monarch. But he will miss having his mother to talk to: ""She was always there, I could talk to her about this, that, or the other. I think that's always going to be something that will be very difficult not to have."" The Queen and her daughter Princess Anne, shown here in Sandringham, England in 1979, shared a love of horses During a life of public service, moments of privacy were treasured, and they were often found in family holidays, the Queen's only daughter, Princess Anne, said. ""There was a lot going on in those periods... it was probably the times she most enjoyed,"" the 72-year-old Princess Royal told the BBC. ""Partly because it included all the things she enjoyed - the countryside, the dogs, the horses, and just being out and about - and being able to get away a bit from that public gaze."" The Queen's youngest son reminisced about ""probably the most jaw-dropping moment in any film television production"": her entrance to the 2012 London Olympic Games opening ceremony. A short film shows the Queen at Buckingham Palace meeting Daniel Craig, who played the famed secret agent James Bond in five films. With corgies in tow, the monarch boards a helicopter and then skydives into the Olympic stadium - with some help from a stunt double. ""There was Daniel Craig as James Bond, arriving at Buckingham Palaceâ¦ and everybody, wherever you were in the world, was thinking exactly the same thought - who will be playing the Queen? And it was the Queen,"" Prince Edward, 58, said. ""And it had the same effect on everybody who was watching - they just couldn't believe it. ""I thought it was an extraordinary moment because it just showed that fantastic twinkle and sense of humour - the fact that my mother kept that completely to herself, and the team didn't tell anybody was just brilliant.""

"We've been sharing your tributes to Queen Elizabeth II following her death aged 96 You've told us what she meant to you, moments you remember from her life and your stories of meeting the UK's longest-reigning monarch On Monday, the nation paid a final farewell to the Queen, with a state funeral and military procession Our tributes page has been a reminder that hundreds of thousands of us felt a personal connection with the Queen, says BBC Media and Arts Correspondent David Sillito ""She made you feel as if you were important at that moment in her life,"" says Simone Kennett, who was head teacher of a school when it was visited by the Queen We'll be preserving this page so people in the UK and around the world can continue to read the tributes so many of you have left for the Queen Deborah TurnessCEO, BBC News and Current Affairs As the Chief Executive of BBC News I
have the honour to write the closing message on this page of thousands of
tributes to Queen Elizabeth II. And itâs a message of thanks to every single
person who has taken the time to share their story. When the death of Queen Elizabeth was
announced, we at the BBC wanted to create a place where people could come
together to share their tributes, their photos and recollections. The
response has been incredible. We have received thousands of touching stories of
meeting the Queen, special moments, memories and messages of condolence. Thank you to everyone - from all
over the world - for coming together here in this virtual space for very real
acts a of remembrance. Looking at the contributions, the
common theme that emerges is that the Queen had a way of making each person she
met feel like the most important person in that moment. Thank you again for helping us remember
a woman whose promise to serve her people was fulfilled through a life of duty,
which touched so many people. Over the past 10 days, we've been asking you to share your memories of seeing and meeting Queen Elizabeth II or to send in your personal tributes. Thousands of people have sent their own messages of condolence. ""The stories speak to how many people felt a personal connection to Her Majesty,"" says BBC Media and Arts Correspondent David Sillito. ""It reminds us that, while the official record of the life of the Queen will be a series of great moments of national pageantry, those were rare special occasions. ""Her life was much more about handshakes, birthday cards and meeting ordinary, but often remarkable, people. ""No-one forgets a conversation with the Queen. And our tributes page has been a little reminder that for hundreds of thousands of us, the Queen was more than a distant figure in a palace. She was someone with whom they felt a personal connection."" You can read more from David on the tributes here. Sibella Laing went to Cambridge University with King Charles III, has known the Royal Family since she was a child and has met the Queen. She was, is, and always has been, incredibly kind to everybody, always anxious to put people at their ease, always anxious to make you feel you are the only person in the room.  Iâm sure this huge support across the country that Charles must have been seeing will have been really inspirational and uplifting for him. He has had the Queen as a wonderful role model all his life and I think in a sense his whole life has been preparation for this, so I think he is ready for it."" Sibella Laing Dinkie Flowers in the queue to pay her respects to Queen Elizabeth II in Westminster Hall Dinkie Flowers (nee Stapleton), aged 101, queued for several hours on Saturday to pay her respects to Queen Elizabeth II. Dinkie, who lives in Shoreham-by-Sea is holding a letter she received from Buckingham Palace 70 years ago thanking her for her performance in the Celebrity Ice Show at Queens Ice Dance Club on 30 April 1952. Dinkie entertained other members of the public in the queue with some of her memorabilia including the card from Her Majesty for her 100th birthday in 2021. Lesley Tomlinson, Dinkie's hairdresser In Ghana students at Legon Hills International School paid tribute to her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on the day of her funeral. The school held a special assembly reflecting her long reign. Pupils also wrote heartfelt condolence messages, while the little ones watched the Paddington film. Akua Agyemang, Founder of Legon Hills Internatonal School, Ghana The children wrote messages of farewell to the Queen Marie came to Windsor for the Queen's funeral with her friend Lee Stabler Marie Wood, 56, lived in Windsor for eight years when she was training to be a nurse and saw the Queen one day while out for a walk. Marie came to Windsor for the Queen's funeral on Monday, watching the procession from the Long Walk. I was walking in Great Park and she drove her Land Rover further up. I was just gobsmacked.  We always felt that she belonged here. This was her home. I am glad that she is in Windsor now, this was her favourite place. She will be missed."" Marie Wood Frances came from Italy to leave a portrait of the Queen drawn by her son Alex I have been living in Italy for the last 22 years. My son, Alex (13) drew this portrait of the Queen and I asked him if he wanted me to take it to London so I could leave it as a tribute for the Queen. He said yes.  On Saturday I got on a plane from Verona to come especially to leave the portrait before the funeral. Yesterday I took the 5.20am train from Havant to London and I left his portrait in Green Park. The policemen were very kind to take it for me as the park had already closed for laying flowers."" Frances King Simone Kennett was head teacher of Jersey College for Girls when the Queen visited to open a new building in 2001. The Queen said we had a beautiful school and that she had really enjoyed this visit. She made you feel as if you were important at that moment in her life. The students did the college proud and it was a successful visit.  We also had a light-hearted moment during the her visit. The Queen stamped her foot on the school's front terrace and said: 'This is hollow.' I said, 'Yes, Your Majesty, and if Your Majesty continues to bounce up and down she will find herself sitting in Home Economics,' and she absolutely roared with laughter!"" Simone Kennett, Former head of Jersey College for Girls Glyn Sherman, from Coventry, was serving in the Royal Horse Artillery in 1984 when as a guard of honour he met the Queen at a birthday parade. When she came along I said 'all right, Liz'? The top brass went to come down and she put her hand up to stop them, so I was lucky. I felt bad about it but had to explain to her that I've got a daughter called Elizabeth and it just came out like that.  She turned around and said 'I like to be unofficial sometimes'. It was brilliant. The memory will never go out of me.  Her death has left me heartbroken. I don't look at her as being Her Majesty. We call her our boss. Glyn Sherman I was born in 1926, a Londoner, and saw the Queen on the balcony with her parents on the day her father was crowned George VI. That memory is still very vivid in my mind. Beryl Smith Alicia Finn-OâShea, who is 10, met the Queen as a four-month-old baby. The family were so impressed by that encounter they named Alicia's little sister Elizabeth. She's now aged seven and prefers to be called Eliza, but they came to the Mall on Monday to watch the funeral procession with their mum Claire. It was really magical and amazing but also upsetting. The nice thought is the Queen is having marmalade sandwiches and tea with her family in heaven."" Alicia Finn-OâShea We arrived early from Birmingham to secure our place opposite Buckingham Palace gates to bid farewell to Her Majesty. We are really tired today but so happy we made it. It was an absolutely amazing day."" Claire Finn-O'Shea I used to make cakes and pastries for Her Majesty when I worked at Buckingham Palace from 2001 to 2002 and Sandringham from 2005 to 2006. I got really lucky. I did a modern apprenticeship under the patronage of the now King Charles III... On my days off I went and worked at Buckingham Palace two days a week. Over time I ended up working in the pastry kitchen and had the privilege of making some of the cakes and pastries that used to go out to the Queen during her teatime.  When I heard the news of the Queen's death I stepped outside for a good 10 minutes and really cried, I needed to get away from everyone. There are no Brits near me [in America] and so it's more of a challenge for people to understand what's going on.  It feels like more of a part of you has gone rather than a parent or relative. It feels a little bit of your identity has been lost. Kieron Hales Peter John Wailes, who served in the RAF for 25 years, met the Queen many times and headed to Windsor on the day of her funeral to pay his respects. The 63-year-old recalls how once at Buckingham Palace during a VJ Day parade the Queen noticed a veteran was struggling in the heat and ordered an officer to get them some water. âShe was fantastic and in charge of everything,â he says. Iâm here to pay respects to my ex-boss, I feel great respect for her and want to say thanks for everything - I enjoyed working for her and meeting her.â Peter John Wailes Paul Hayden and his sister handing flowers to the Queen during her visit to Essex My memory is a rather distant one: I think I was about five, and the Queen visited the Essex county show. I was photographed handing a bouquet of flowers to the Queen with my younger sister. Prince Phillip stood alongside the Queen. The photo ended up on the front page of the local newspaper and a framed photo was proudly displayed by my parents in their hallway for at least 20 years.  You can imagine the enjoyment all my friends (and my sister) have had over the years making fun of their once angelic mate and his little sister giving flowers to the Queen but I must admit to being rather proud of the occasion, particularly now.  Rest in Peace HRH Queen Elizabeth II."" Paul Hayden The Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell shared a jigsaw puzzle and watched TV with the Queen at Sandringham. It was a great privilege to be alongside her. We sat down after dinner and did a jigsaw and the television was on.  It's a bereavement, and with every bereavement there is shock, there is loss but there is also thankfulness for a life lived well. A life of astonishing service. She was a person of simple but profound faith, and it was that faith that shaped her."" Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell Raven Harlow Aspenwood is severely visually impaired and has channeled her grief into her portrait of the young Queen Elizabeth II I am registered severely visually impaired, but I felt compelled to do something to channel my overwhelming and surprising level of grief following the sad passing of HRH, Queen Elizabeth II. I think my strongest memory of the queen is how comforting her presence has been during every stage of my 28 years of life, when something difficult has happened she has comforted us with her words, when something wonderful has happened she has filled our hearts with joy, with her wonderful smile and calming presence. She has been the grandmother of our nation, the matriarch we all need in times of hardship and times of joy. Her dignity, strength and consistency has been a great comfort and I thank her for her seventy years of steadfast service. Raven Harlow Aspenwood from East Yorkshire What a smile. She could lift a room with that wonderful smile and that genuine interest that she has in the people of this country."" Warwickshire County Council Leader, Izzi Seccombe I do remember her smile, I experienced that myself. It not only lit up a room, it lit up a nation - and she had the capacity to make us smile too."" Bishop of Coventry, Reverend Christopher Cocksworth Zara Umar gave flowers to the Queen in 2002 My daughter Zara and I went down to the City Square in Dundee to see the Queen in 2002. We waited for a long time. Soon the time came and the Queen was walking towards us. She was about five or six steps away from us when one of her security personnel guided the Queen away to the car to leave. Zara was so disappointed and my heart sank. Just then a plain clothes man came and asked me if he could lift Zara over the barrier. Much to my delight, Zara presented the flowers to the Queen and said 'here you are then, take your flowers.' I couldnt believe it! The Queen must have found it funny though and watched Zara return to me with a big smile on her face. I will treasure this memory forever."" Ishrat Umar, Dundee Three army veterans from Worcestershire pay tribute to the Queen... She was our head, she was our leader, she was the person we were serving and she's the one that we would follow. It hits you, it hits your heart."" Eric Braithwaite, who served for 23 years with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers Everyone called her the boss in one way or another. I've actually guarded the Queen and Prince Philip on other duties. A big lump in the throat, lost the boss, getting a new one."" Dave Sandy, who served in the territorial army from the late 1970s until the 1990s I've done a lot of parades for the Queen, she was a lovely lady and worked so hard for the country. I was in tears, I will be honest. It was an honour to be with her and be a soldier for her."" Anthony Goodway, who spent two years in national service from 1958 until 1960 I met the Queen when she visited the Isle of Skye as part of her Golden Jubilee tour. As a nurse then at the local care home, myself and other staff members were invited to bring some of our residents to meet Her Majesty. The great day came, our ladies looking beautiful, wheelchairs polished. One of our residents had worked at the palace as a younger woman and had photos of the Queen all around her room in the care home, so, if any one was to be there that day, it was her.  As the Queen approached our little group that day she asked me: âAre these the ladies from the care home?' I replied in the positive and then said this resident had worked in the palace. The Queen looked down a little and asked her: âWhen did you work at the palace?â To which, the lady looked up and and replied, in a rather gruff voice: âAnd who are you?â What a moment. I apologised. The Queen just smiled and moved on.  I was quite overwhelmed, I donât have photos of the Queen all over the house, but Iâve always respected her, especially as a Christian woman. She had a real true faith, so meeting her was very special. I didnât expect to be so overcome by the moment. Her demeanour was that of interest and she handled the situation really well. She left us all feeling very special and honoured. Barbara Matheson from Glasgow Barbara Matheson has recalled the moment she met the Queen during Her Majesty's Golden Jubilee tour Â© 2025 BBC.

"Senior MPs including Prime Minister Liz Truss have sworn a new oath of allegiance to King Charles III in a special session of Parliament. Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle opened proceedings by taking the oath, followed by Sir Peter Bottomley, the longest-serving MP. Sir Keir Starmer and former PM Theresa May were also pledging allegiance. In a rare Saturday sitting, MPs and peers gathered for a second day of tributes to the late Queen. How ex-PMs valued Queen's advice and experience Queen saved blushes in awkward moments, MPs recall MPs are sworn in after each general election so they can take their seat, speak in debates, vote and receive a salary. The wording of the oath means MPs have already pledged their allegiance to the heirs and successors of the Queen, meaning they do not have to do it again at this point. Sir Lindsay told MPs: ""There will be further opportunities for all honourable members to take the oath or make the affirmation following her late majesty's funeral. ""There is no procedural requirement to do so."" Ms Truss was foremost among those taking the pledge, speaking the words: ""I swear by almighty God, that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to His Majesty King Charles, his heirs and successors, according to law, so help me God."" Following the taking of oaths, MPs took it in turns to pay their respects to Queen Elizabeth II and recount their memories of the late monarch. Many MPs used their speeches to tell amusing and at times emotional anecdotes about the Queen's wisdom, sense of humour and ability to put people at their ease. In all, 321 MPs spoke in the two-day session. Commons Leader Penny Mordaunt made the final speech of the special two-day session, closing proceedings by praising the Queen's ""devotion to duty"" and public service. ""Our great Queen has entrusted us all with a living legacy of triumph and over tribulation, of cheerfulness over challenge, of dedication and determination,"" Ms Mordaunt said. ""She has left us, her values remain with us. Her example compels us to continued fidelity to our king and our country. God save the King."" Wrapping up, Sir Lindsay said a humble address - which is a message to the monarch - paying tribute to the King Charles would be presented to His Majesty. With that Parliament was adjourned until after 21 September, during a period of national mourning. Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle was the first MP to take the oath Ms Truss, who was invited to form a government by the late Queen on Tuesday, had her initial audience with King Charles on Friday. The prime minister curtsied as she was ushered in by a royal aide for the first of what will be their regular weekly encounters. Earlier on Saturday, senior ministers attended the Accession Council at St James's Palace, where Charles was formally proclaimed sovereign. MPs share funny and moving memories of Queen Former prime ministers reflect on Queen's reign The king has also received the prime minister, members of the cabinet and opposition leaders at Buckingham Palace for an audience with the monarch. A period of national mourning will last until the day of the Queen's state funeral on 19 September. Ahead of the funeral, the new King will visit Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, and Ms Truss will accompany him.

"There is a tiny special club, a powerful group who knew Queen Elizabeth in a particular and private way - her prime ministers. They all used to speak to her in person for an hour or so each week. The monarch was their confidant of sorts, an adviser providing a shrewd ear. For this week's programme I've been speaking to Gordon Brown, David Cameron and Theresa May, the Queen's 11th, 12th, and 13th prime ministers, about why it matters, their memories of one monarch, and their hopes for the next. The Queen always would have ""done her red boxes, read government papers"" and would be well-versed in the dilemmas of government decisions, said Mrs May. Her predecessor, Mr Brown, joked that sometimes he had been ""embarrassed"" by the extent of her knowledge, recalling that on one occasion she had more up to date information about a particular Commonwealth country than he did. Mr Cameron described the Queen as the ""world's greatest public servant"" with a profound understanding of what was going on at any one moment. This video can not be played Watch: Mr Cameron told the BBC that Charles had served âthe longest apprenticeship in historyâ All three former PMs told me they benefitted enormously from her long years of experience that she shared with them in private - a sense that whatever the problem of the day, she could provide advice and a sense of proportion. They all emphasised the new King's long years of preparation and knowledge of the role he now occupies, with Mr Cameron telling me the then-Prince Charles, during what he called ""the longest apprenticeship in history"", had practised holding audiences with him while his mother was on the throne. Looking to the future, Mr Brown said he felt King Charles - in his televised address to the nation on Friday - had carefully sent a message to the country that his priorities would change, leaving his charities and causes to others to take on. What happens next after the Queen's death? How titles and the line of succession have changed Nine shows to stream about the Queen Yet what stood out in our conversations were their personal encounters with the Queen. For Mr Brown it was the time she told the corgis to ""shut up"" in front of his young sons. For months after, they would defend themselves when being told off for using the phrase by saying: ""If the Queen says it, why can't we?"" Gordon Brown recalls the Queen telling her corgis to ""shut up"" in front of his young sons Mr Cameron recalled the time he got lost on the Balmoral estate but was found by the Duke of Edinburgh - travelling at speed in his Land Rover across the moor - and how at state occasions, his wife Samantha always wanted to sit next to the then-Prince Charles because he was the most fun companion for a long, formal evening. Mrs May remembered with laughter the time she dropped the cheese at the Balmoral picnic, then put it back on the table even though the Queen was watching her every move, and how at those Highland weekends the monarch would sit happily playing patience on her own while her guests mingled around her. These politicians knew the Queen well, but our conversations echo how many members of the public perhaps felt - the most formal, yet familiar too. The monarch with golden robes and a jewel-laden Crown - but a friendly face in a difficult moment. The most experienced and knowledgeable diplomat the country has ever seen, and the party host clearing up the barbecue. The head of state of the sixth biggest economy in the world, but also a great-grandmother at ease with Paddington Bear. On our show last week we interviewed the woman who was the last politician to have the traditional audience with the Queen. It's fitting perhaps that the last formal photograph of her showed that vital encounter with Liz Truss. The new PM and the new King are now the next to fulfil this tradition. It's hard to fathom how much has changed in just seven days. But the connection, the importance of the conversations between the inhabitant of the Palace and the prime minister goes on.

"Domestic football, from the Premier League to grassroots, will not take place in most of the UK this weekend after Queen Elizabeth II died aged 96. Matches at all levels in England, Wales and Northern Ireland have been postponed, while in Scotland only senior games have been affected. However, several other sports are continuing as planned, including cricket, golf, rugby union and horse racing. At-a-glance: What's on and what's off this weekend Wiegman and Southgate honour 'inspirational' Queen Dan Roan, BBC sports editor After the Queen died on Thursday, football's governing bodies convened on Friday to discuss the best course of action for the upcoming weekend's fixtures. The government's national mourning guidance advised that cancelling games was not obligatory, leaving the decision to individual sports. The Football Associations of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland all confirmed on Friday that fixtures would be postponed as a mark of respect. The Premier League said the decision not to go ahead with its 10 games this weekend was made to honour the Queen's ""extraordinary life and contribution to the nation"". In a rare example of unity, football's authorities are understood to feel that - unlike other sports that have already paused events this week, like racing, cricket and golf - football has not yet had a chance to stop, reflect and show its respects. Many people disagree of course, and feel matches would have provided fans with an opportunity to pay tribute. There is understandable sympathy for those who have spent money on tickets and transport, and now have to change plans at short notice, especially with so many other events in other sports going ahead. The decision to stop grassroots and school sport is also contentious, especially after so much football was lost during the pandemic, even if it is just for one weekend. But the FA is known to be mindful of football's status as the national sport at this historic moment, and the close ties the sport had with the Queen, who was patron of the FA, while Prince William is its president. According to well-placed sources, there has been a provisional plan to pause fixtures in such circumstances for several years now, and it was always likely that those plans would be honoured, despite the inevitable scrutiny. West Ham's Europa Conference League game against FCSB went ahead on Thursday With it being part of this weekend's round of fixtures, Monday's Premier League game between Leeds and Nottingham Forest was also called off. But after that there are Champions League, Europa League, Europa Conference League and English Football League games taking place in midweek. European games on Thursday evening went ahead as scheduled, with a minute's silence observed in matches involving British teams. Uefa has not yet provided an update on next week's games involving British sides, but Manchester City's Champions League game with Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday is due to go ahead as planned. BBC Sport has been told City are able to provide the policing needed, so the game will take place as scheduled at Etihad Stadium. Rangers, who host Napoli in the Champions League on Tuesday, said in a statement they are in discussions with Uefa but ""at present, the game is scheduled to take place at the scheduled date and time"". Manchester United have confirmed their Europa League game with FC Sheriff in Moldova next Thursday will take place as scheduled ""following discussions with the relevant governing bodies and in line with guidance issued by the UK government"". Aston Villa players and staff paid their respects to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II with a minute's silence on Friday The EFL has not yet issued an update yet on its round of midweek games. As for next weekend's fixtures, they are currently taking place as planned although that could change depending on when details of the Queen's state funeral are provided. The funeral is expected to take place at Westminster Abbey in less than two weeks, but the exact day will be confirmed by Buckingham Palace. If it takes place next weekend then fixtures could again be postponed. Policing games could be a factor in the decision if they are redeployed to London en masse before the Queen's funeral. There are currently three matches scheduled to take place in the capital over Saturday and Sunday. The Premier League is understood to be talking to its clubs, while the Metropolitan Police has been asked for a comment. Tottenham play Leicester on Saturday evening, while Brentford face Arsenal and Chelsea are at home to Liverpool on Sunday 18 September. Simon Stone, BBC Sport Finding room in the packed English football calendar for a full round of Premier League fixtures (and possibly two) is going to be complicated. In a unique season that includes a winter World Cup - and restarts on 20 December with the Carabao Cup fourth round, space is severely limited. There is no spare midweek from now until the season ends on 3 June that exists without a purpose. Two, 17 January and 7 February, are for FA Cup third and fourth-round replays. Three more, 4 April, 2 May and 23 May, are for matches that have been postponed on the weekends of the EFL Cup final and the FA Cup sixth round and semi-finals. Two January midweeks are for the individual legs of the EFL Cup semi-finals. Eight midweeks are reserved for Uefa matches - and the European governing body is resistant to domestic games being played at the same time as its matches. And two midweeks in March form part of the final mid-season international break. Discussions will start next week about how to resolve the issue. The respective governing bodies are relaxed about the situation given they dealt with similar calendar issues during the 2020-21 Covid-19-affected season. Then, FA Cup replays were scrapped and the EFL Cup semi-finals were played as one game. Answers will be similarly difficult now. Fans observed a minute's silence at games involving British teams on Thursday evening The Football Supporters' Federation accepted there was ""no perfect decision"" for the football authorities, but added it believed many supporters would have wanted games to go ahead. It said in a statement: ""We believe football is at its finest when bringing people together at times of huge national significance - be those moments of joy or moments of mourning. ""Our view, which we shared with the football authorities, is that most supporters would have liked to go to games this weekend and pay their respects to the Queen alongside their fellow fans. ""Not everyone will agree, so there was no perfect decision for the football authorities, but many supporters will feel this was an opportunity missed for football to pay its own special tributes."" Play will resume in England's cricket Testagainst South Africa on Saturday, and the women's Twenty20 match between England and India will go ahead. Golf's PGA Championship will restart on Saturday after play was halted on Thursday. British horse racingwill return on Sunday, with rugby union's Premiership season beginning on Saturday aftertwo fixtures on Friday were postponed. Sunday's Great North Run will go ahead as planned, with organisers saying it is ""an opportunity to come together and express our condolences while celebrating the life of our extraordinary Queen"", and that the event would be ""more subdued out of respect"". Boxing's world title fight between Savannah Marshall and Claressa Shields on Saturday has been postponed, with a provisional date of 15 October set for it to be rescheduled. All British Boxing Board of Control tournaments have also been postponed for the weekend. Why is frustration growing at Arteta's Arsenal?

"This video can not be played BBC News NI's Gareth Gordon looks back at the Queen's relationship with Northern Ireland Royalty in the 21st Century is more about symbolism than power, but the Queen knew the power of symbols in the cause of reconciliation. In June 2012,she greeted thousands at Stormontfor a Diamond Jubilee party. Earlier the eyes of the world focused on an historic handshake with Martin McGuinness at Belfast's Lyric theatre. The Queen and the then Irish President, Mary McAleese, laid wreaths at the Garden of Remembrance in Dublin in May 2011 The four-second handshake between the former IRA leader and the British monarch appeared to usher in a new era in 40 years of troubled history. Queen at Stormont Jubilee party Queen makes 'giant leap for British-Irish relations' A year earlier, the Queen had broken new ground in Dublin, joining the then Irish President, Mary McAleese, to lay wreaths at the Garden of Remembrance. Queen Elizabeth at the National Convention Centre, Dublin, in 2011 Given that the garden is dedicated to those who died fighting British rule, this was another occasion that, at one time, would have seemed unimaginable. Then the Queen went on to charm her Irish audience at a state banquet when she spoke in Irish, greeting them:  ""A UachtarÃ¡in agus a chairde"" (president and friends). There were some small, republican protests, but during a visit to the English market in Cork, most people seemed more than ready to welcome the Queen on the first visit to the Republic of Ireland by a British monarch since King George V in 1911. If these scenes were a novelty in Cork, not so north of the border where the Queen was a frequent visitor over the decades. The Queen and the Duke Of Edinburgh arrived by steam train to open the new Bellarena Station village in County Londonderry in 2016 In fact, she took her first flight in an aircraft in 1945 when, as a teenage princess, she accompanied her parents to Northern Ireland on a two-day visit. Four years later, Princess Elizabeth was back, together with her husband, Prince Philip. Thecouple returned in 1953 after the Queen's coronation. Inevitably, given the politics of Ireland, not everyone was a fan. In 1966, the Queen opened a new bridge across the River Lagan in Belfast named in her honour. But as her motorcade wound through the city, a protester dropped a brick from a high building onto the bonnet of the Royal car. When the Queen celebrated her Silver Jubilee in 1977, the Troubles were at their height. The IRA threatened to give the monarch a ""visit to remember"". Spectators lined the shores of Belfast Lough to watch the Queen arrive on board the Royal Yacht Britannia. She made a special reference to Northern Ireland in her Christmas message that year. ""No-where is reconciliation more desperately needed than in Northern Ireland,"" she said. The Queen visited Pat O'Connell's fish stall at the English Market in Cork in 2011 ""That is why I was particularly pleased to go there. No-one dared to promise an early end to the Troubles but there is no doubt that people of goodwill in Northern Ireland were greatly heartened by the chance they had to share the celebrations with the rest of the nation and Commonwealth."" She often expressed sadness after atrocities committed during the Troubles. But the murder that hurt her most personally had to be the IRA's assassination of Earl Mountbatten, in 1979. The earl was her husband's uncle. She appeared to refer implicitly to his loss many years later in her Dublin speech. ""It is a sad and regrettable reality that through history our islands have experienced more than their fair share of heartache, turbulence and loss,"" she said. ""These events have touched us all, many of us personally, and are a painful legacy. We can never forget those who have died or been injured, and their families. ""To all those who have suffered as a consequence of our troubled past I extend my sincere thoughts and deep sympathy. ""With the benefit of historical hindsight we can all see things which we would wish had been done differently or not at all."" The then Northern Ireland Secretary John Reid showed the Queen the site of the 1998 Real IRA bombing in Omagh, as part of the Golden Jubilee Tour in 2002 As the Troubles raged, the Queen did not visit Northern Ireland at all during the 1980s. But she returned in the 1990s - praising the Ulster Defence Regiment in Lisburn, opening another new bridge in Belfast and meeting church leaders in Armagh. Hillsborough gun salute marks King's proclamation Queen Elizabeth II: Island of Ireland pays tribute In pictures: Royal visits over the years In 2000, she presented the Royal Ulster Constabulary with the George Cross, then later that decade watched dance and drama in Londonderry, andtoured the site of the Omagh bombing,external. At Stormont, she praised the progress made towards peace. ""Life has never been straightforward here, but I welcome the real sense of normality that has, over recent years, been returning to the lives of ordinary people, even if tempered from time to time by moments of disappointment and pessimism. You now have a better future for Northern Ireland in your grasp,"" she told politicians. The Queen's trip to the Giant's Causeway in 2016 was her first visit to Northern Ireland's best known tourist attraction Her last visit to Northern Ireland ended up being in 2016 - she had been due to visit Northern Ireland for a two-day trip in October 2021 to coincidewith the centenary but it was cancelled on medical advice. This was perhaps when the public first became aware of concerns surrounding the then 95-year-old's health. Throughout her reign, the Queen remained painfully aware of the tragedies that beset Northern Ireland. But she seemed to take heart from the knowledge that she could play an important role in helping people put the past in perspective and concentrating minds on what she hoped would be a brighter future.

"A bank holiday across the UK has been approved by King Charles III for the day of the funeral of his mother Queen Elizabeth II. The new king confirmed the order at a ceremony in London proclaiming him as monarch. The Queen's state funeral will be held on Monday 19 September. The Queen, Britain's longest ever reigning monarch, died peacefully on Thursday afternoon at her Scottish estate in Balmoral. The state funeral will take place at Westminster Abbey, the historic church where Britain's kings and queens are crowned, and where Queen Elizabeth II married Prince Philip in 1947. There has not been a monarch's funeral service in the Abbey since the 18th Century, although the funeral of the Queen's mother was held there in 2002. Westminster Abbey is the historic church where Britain's kings and queens are crowned, including the Queen's coronation in 1953, and where she married Prince Philip in 1947. Heads of state from across the world will be invited to join members of the Royal Family to remember the life and service of the Queen. Senior UK politicians and former prime ministers are also expected to attend the service, which will be televised. It is expected that certain aspects of daily life will be put on hold for the date of the state funeral, with some businesses and organisations choosing to close or halt their operations. The Royal Mail has announced that its postal services will be suspended on the day, and some shops like Harrods have already said they plan to close. The upcoming bank holiday is one of several ways in which life in the UK is temporarily being put on hold following the Queen's death. A period of national mourning is now in place and will last until the day of the state funeral, the government has announced. There is no obligation for organisers to cancel planned events, but many that were due to happen in the immediate aftermath of the Queen's death have already been cancelled or postponed for a few days. Football matches in the Premier League, English Football League or in Scotland or Northern Ireland have been postponed until Tuesday, while all games in the Women's Super League, Women's Championship and Women's FA Cup have also been put on hold. A number of horse racing, golf, and boxing fixtures have also been called off. Large-scale strike actions planned for next week were immediately cancelled following the Queen's death, and the Trades Union Congress said it was postponing its annual conference in Brighton this weekend out of respect.

"Senior MPs including Prime Minister Liz Truss have sworn a new oath of allegiance to King Charles III in a special session of Parliament. Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle opened proceedings by taking the oath, followed by Sir Peter Bottomley, the longest-serving MP. Sir Keir Starmer and former PM Theresa May were also pledging allegiance. In a rare Saturday sitting, MPs and peers gathered for a second day of tributes to the late Queen. How ex-PMs valued Queen's advice and experience Queen saved blushes in awkward moments, MPs recall MPs are sworn in after each general election so they can take their seat, speak in debates, vote and receive a salary. The wording of the oath means MPs have already pledged their allegiance to the heirs and successors of the Queen, meaning they do not have to do it again at this point. Sir Lindsay told MPs: ""There will be further opportunities for all honourable members to take the oath or make the affirmation following her late majesty's funeral. ""There is no procedural requirement to do so."" Ms Truss was foremost among those taking the pledge, speaking the words: ""I swear by almighty God, that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to His Majesty King Charles, his heirs and successors, according to law, so help me God."" Following the taking of oaths, MPs took it in turns to pay their respects to Queen Elizabeth II and recount their memories of the late monarch. Many MPs used their speeches to tell amusing and at times emotional anecdotes about the Queen's wisdom, sense of humour and ability to put people at their ease. In all, 321 MPs spoke in the two-day session. Commons Leader Penny Mordaunt made the final speech of the special two-day session, closing proceedings by praising the Queen's ""devotion to duty"" and public service. ""Our great Queen has entrusted us all with a living legacy of triumph and over tribulation, of cheerfulness over challenge, of dedication and determination,"" Ms Mordaunt said. ""She has left us, her values remain with us. Her example compels us to continued fidelity to our king and our country. God save the King."" Wrapping up, Sir Lindsay said a humble address - which is a message to the monarch - paying tribute to the King Charles would be presented to His Majesty. With that Parliament was adjourned until after 21 September, during a period of national mourning. Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle was the first MP to take the oath Ms Truss, who was invited to form a government by the late Queen on Tuesday, had her initial audience with King Charles on Friday. The prime minister curtsied as she was ushered in by a royal aide for the first of what will be their regular weekly encounters. Earlier on Saturday, senior ministers attended the Accession Council at St James's Palace, where Charles was formally proclaimed sovereign. MPs share funny and moving memories of Queen Former prime ministers reflect on Queen's reign The king has also received the prime minister, members of the cabinet and opposition leaders at Buckingham Palace for an audience with the monarch. A period of national mourning will last until the day of the Queen's state funeral on 19 September. Ahead of the funeral, the new King will visit Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, and Ms Truss will accompany him.

"We've been sharing your tributes to Queen Elizabeth II following her death aged 96 You've told us what she meant to you, moments you remember from her life and your stories of meeting the UK's longest-reigning monarch On Monday, the nation paid a final farewell to the Queen, with a state funeral and military procession Our tributes page has been a reminder that hundreds of thousands of us felt a personal connection with the Queen, says BBC Media and Arts Correspondent David Sillito ""She made you feel as if you were important at that moment in her life,"" says Simone Kennett, who was head teacher of a school when it was visited by the Queen We'll be preserving this page so people in the UK and around the world can continue to read the tributes so many of you have left for the Queen Deborah TurnessCEO, BBC News and Current Affairs As the Chief Executive of BBC News I
have the honour to write the closing message on this page of thousands of
tributes to Queen Elizabeth II. And itâs a message of thanks to every single
person who has taken the time to share their story. When the death of Queen Elizabeth was
announced, we at the BBC wanted to create a place where people could come
together to share their tributes, their photos and recollections. The
response has been incredible. We have received thousands of touching stories of
meeting the Queen, special moments, memories and messages of condolence. Thank you to everyone - from all
over the world - for coming together here in this virtual space for very real
acts a of remembrance. Looking at the contributions, the
common theme that emerges is that the Queen had a way of making each person she
met feel like the most important person in that moment. Thank you again for helping us remember
a woman whose promise to serve her people was fulfilled through a life of duty,
which touched so many people. Over the past 10 days, we've been asking you to share your memories of seeing and meeting Queen Elizabeth II or to send in your personal tributes. Thousands of people have sent their own messages of condolence. ""The stories speak to how many people felt a personal connection to Her Majesty,"" says BBC Media and Arts Correspondent David Sillito. ""It reminds us that, while the official record of the life of the Queen will be a series of great moments of national pageantry, those were rare special occasions. ""Her life was much more about handshakes, birthday cards and meeting ordinary, but often remarkable, people. ""No-one forgets a conversation with the Queen. And our tributes page has been a little reminder that for hundreds of thousands of us, the Queen was more than a distant figure in a palace. She was someone with whom they felt a personal connection."" You can read more from David on the tributes here. Sibella Laing went to Cambridge University with King Charles III, has known the Royal Family since she was a child and has met the Queen. She was, is, and always has been, incredibly kind to everybody, always anxious to put people at their ease, always anxious to make you feel you are the only person in the room.  Iâm sure this huge support across the country that Charles must have been seeing will have been really inspirational and uplifting for him. He has had the Queen as a wonderful role model all his life and I think in a sense his whole life has been preparation for this, so I think he is ready for it.""

Marie Wood Frances came from Italy to leave a portrait of the Queen drawn by her son Alex I have been living in Italy for the last 22 years. My son, Alex (13) drew this portrait of the Queen and I asked him if he wanted me to take it to London so I could leave it as a tribute for the Queen. He said yes.  On Saturday I got on a plane from Verona to come especially to leave the portrait before the funeral. Yesterday I took the 5.20am train from Havant to London and I left his portrait in Green Park. The policemen were very kind to take it for me as the park had already closed for laying flowers."" Frances King Simone Kennett was head teacher of Jersey College for Girls when the Queen visited to open a new building in 2001. The Queen said we had a beautiful school and that she had really enjoyed this visit. She made you feel as if you were important at that moment in her life. The students did the college proud and it was a successful visit.  We also had a light-hearted moment during the her visit. The Queen stamped her foot on the school's front terrace and said: 'This is hollow.' I said, 'Yes, Your Majesty, and if Your Majesty continues to bounce up and down she will find herself sitting in Home Economics,' and she absolutely roared with laughter!"" Simone Kennett, Former head of Jersey College for Girls Glyn Sherman, from Coventry, was serving in the Royal Horse Artillery in 1984 when as a guard of honour he met the Queen at a birthday parade. When she came along I said 'all right, Liz'? The top brass went to come down and she put her hand up to stop them, so I was lucky. I felt bad about it but had to explain to her that I've got a daughter called Elizabeth and it just came out like that.  She turned around and said 'I like to be unofficial sometimes'. It was brilliant. The memory will never go out of me.  Her death has left me heartbroken. I don't look at her as being Her Majesty. We call her our boss. Glyn Sherman I was born in 1926, a Londoner, and saw the Queen on the balcony with her parents on the day her father was crowned George VI. That memory is still very vivid in my mind. Beryl Smith Alicia Finn-OâShea, who is 10, met the Queen as a four-month-old baby. The family were so impressed by that encounter they named Alicia's little sister Elizabeth. She's now aged seven and prefers to be called Eliza, but they came to the Mall on Monday to watch the funeral procession with their mum Claire. It was really magical and amazing but also upsetting. The nice thought is the Queen is having marmalade sandwiches and tea with her family in heaven."" Alicia Finn-OâShea We arrived early from Birmingham to secure our place opposite Buckingham Palace gates to bid farewell to Her Majesty. We are really tired today but so happy we made it. It was an absolutely amazing day."" Claire Finn-O'Shea I used to make cakes and pastries for Her Majesty when I worked at Buckingham Palace from 2001 to 2002 and Sandringham from 2005 to 2006. I got really lucky. I did a modern apprenticeship under the patronage of the now King Charles III... On my days off I went and worked at Buckingham Palace two days a week. Over time I ended up working in the pastry kitchen and had the privilege of making some of the cakes and pastries that used to go out to the Queen during her teatime.  When I heard the news of the Queen's death I stepped outside for a good 10 minutes and really cried, I needed to get away from everyone. There are no Brits near me [in America] and so it's more of a challenge for people to understand what's going on.  It feels like more of a part of you has gone rather than a parent or relative. It feels a little bit of your identity has been lost. Kieron Hales Peter John Wailes, who served in the RAF for 25 years, met the Queen many times and headed to Windsor on the day of her funeral to pay his respects. The 63-year-old recalls how once at Buckingham Palace during a VJ Day parade the Queen noticed a veteran was struggling in the heat and ordered an officer to get them some water. âShe was fantastic and in charge of everything,â he says. Iâm here to pay respects to my ex-boss, I feel great respect for her and want to say thanks for everything - I enjoyed working for her and meeting her.â Peter John Wailes Paul Hayden and his sister handing flowers to the Queen during her visit to Essex My memory is a rather distant one: I think I was about five, and the Queen visited the Essex county show. I was photographed handing a bouquet of flowers to the Queen with my younger sister. Prince Phillip stood alongside the Queen. The photo ended up on the front page of the local newspaper and a framed photo was proudly displayed by my parents in their hallway for at least 20 years.  You can imagine the enjoyment all my friends (and my sister) have had over the years making fun of their once angelic mate and his little sister giving flowers to the Queen but I must admit to being rather proud of the occasion, particularly now.  Rest in Peace HRH Queen Elizabeth II."" Paul Hayden The Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell shared a jigsaw puzzle and watched TV with the Queen at Sandringham. It was a great privilege to be alongside her. We sat down after dinner and did a jigsaw and the television was on.  It's a bereavement, and with every bereavement there is shock, there is loss but there is also thankfulness for a life lived well. A life of astonishing service. She was a person of simple but profound faith, and it was that faith that shaped her."" Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell Raven Harlow Aspenwood is severely visually impaired and has channeled her grief into her portrait of the young Queen Elizabeth II I am registered severely visually impaired, but I felt compelled to do something to channel my overwhelming and surprising level of grief following the sad passing of HRH, Queen Elizabeth II. I think my strongest memory of the queen is how comforting her presence has been during every stage of my 28 years of life, when something difficult has happened she has comforted us with her words, when something wonderful has happened she has filled our hearts with joy, with her wonderful smile and calming presence. She has been the grandmother of our nation, the matriarch we all need in times of hardship and times of joy. Her dignity, strength and consistency has been a great comfort and I thank her for her seventy years of steadfast service. Raven Harlow Aspenwood from East Yorkshire What a smile. She could lift a room with that wonderful smile and that genuine interest that she has in the people of this country."" Warwickshire County Council Leader, Izzi Seccombe I do remember her smile, I experienced that myself. It not only lit up a room, it lit up a nation - and she had the capacity to make us smile too."" Bishop of Coventry, Reverend Christopher Cocksworth Zara Umar gave flowers to the Queen in 2002 My daughter Zara and I went down to the City Square in Dundee to see the Queen in 2002. We waited for a long time. Soon the time came and the Queen was walking towards us. She was about five or six steps away from us when one of her security personnel guided the Queen away to the car to leave. Zara was so disappointed and my heart sank. Just then a plain clothes man came and asked me if he could lift Zara over the barrier. Much to my delight, Zara presented the flowers to the Queen and said 'here you are then, take your flowers.' I couldnt believe it! The Queen must have found it funny though and watched Zara return to me with a big smile on her face. I will treasure this memory forever."" Ishrat Umar, Dundee Three army veterans from Worcestershire pay tribute to the Queen... She was our head, she was our leader, she was the person we were serving and she's the one that we would follow. It hits you, it hits your heart."" Eric Braithwaite, who served for 23 years with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers Everyone called her the boss in one way or another. I've actually guarded the Queen and Prince Philip on other duties. A big lump in the throat, lost the boss, getting a new one."" Dave Sandy, who served in the territorial army from the late 1970s until the 1990s I've done a lot of parades for the Queen, she was a lovely lady and worked so hard for the country. I was in tears, I will be honest. It was an honour to be with her and be a soldier for her."" Anthony Goodway, who spent two years in national service from 1958 until 1960 I met the Queen when she visited the Isle of Skye as part of her Golden Jubilee tour. As a nurse then at the local care home, myself and other staff members were invited to bring some of our residents to meet Her Majesty. The great day came, our ladies looking beautiful, wheelchairs polished. One of our residents had worked at the palace as a younger woman and had photos of the Queen all around her room in the care home, so, if any one was to be there that day, it was her.  As the Queen approached our little group that day she asked me: âAre these the ladies from the care home?' I replied in the positive and then said this resident had worked in the palace. The Queen looked down a little and asked her: âWhen did you work at the palace?â To which, the lady looked up and and replied, in a rather gruff voice: âAnd who are you?â What a moment. I apologised. The Queen just smiled and moved on.  I was quite overwhelmed, I donât have photos of the Queen all over the house, but Iâve always respected her, especially as a Christian woman. She had a real true faith, so meeting her was very special. I didnât expect to be so overcome by the moment. Her demeanour was that of interest and she handled the situation really well. She left us all feeling very special and honoured. Barbara Matheson from Glasgow Barbara Matheson has recalled the moment she met the Queen during Her Majesty's Golden Jubilee tour Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Watch: Ukrainian military enter key city of Kupiansk Russian forces have withdrawn from key eastern towns, as a rapid Ukrainian counter-attack makes further gains. Ukrainian officials said troops entered Kupiansk, a vital eastern supply hub for Russian forces, on Saturday. Russia's defence ministry then said its troops have retreated from nearby Izyum to allow them ""to regroup"". The ministry also confirmed the withdrawal of troops from a third key town, Balaklyia, in order to ""bolster efforts"" on the Donetsk front. The Ukrainian advances - if held - would be the most significant since Russia withdrew from areas around Kyiv in April. In his nightly video address on Saturday, President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed that Ukraine had now liberated 2,000 sq km (700 sq miles) from Russia since beginning a renewed counter-offensive earlier this month. His claim would suggest that half of that area has been recaptured in the last 48 hours alone - as it istwice the area of territory Mr Zelensky said had been liberated when he spoke on Thursday evening. Russia's admission of a withdrawal from Izyum is significant because it was a major military hub for Moscow. ""A three-day operation was carried out on the drawdown and organised transfer of the Izyum-Balakliya group of troops to the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic,"" the Russian statement said. ""In order to prevent damage to the Russian troops, a powerful fire defeat was inflicted on the enemy."" Shortly afterwards, the chief administrator of Russian-controlled parts of the Kharkiv region recommended that its residents evacuate to Russia ""to save lives"", according to the Russian state-run Tass news agency. And the governor of the neighbouring Belgorod region, in Russia, said mobile catering, heating, and medical assistance would be available to people queuing to cross the border. The advances will be seen as a sign that Ukraine's army has the capacity to retake Russian-occupied territory, crucial as Kyiv continues to ask its hard-pressed Western allies for military support. Ukraine's Foreign Minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said the latest developments had shown its forces were able to defeat the Russian army and could end the war faster with more Western weapons. Encouragement for Kyiv and allies Analysis by Orla Guerin, Senior International Correspondent in central Ukraine The pace of the counter-offensive has not only caught the Russians off guard, but even surprised some Ukrainians. People here have been struggling to keep up with news of the latest gains. The Russians have now lost two key logistics hubs - the railway cities of Izyum and Kupiansk. This is a military setback and a public humiliation for President Putin. We cannot reach the frontlines. Journalists have been denied access. Ukraine is determined to control the information war. But plenty of footage has emerged on social media showing Ukrainian troops raising their flag in newly liberated areas. All of this is cathartic for Ukraine and reassuring for its Western backers. The Russians still hold around a fifth of the country and few imagine a swift end to the war. But the Ukrainians have now shown they can beat the Russians in battle, not just outmanoeuvre them. According to one military expert, it's the first time since World War Two that whole Russian units have been lost. Earlier, UK defence officials said Ukraine had advanced 50km (31 miles) into previously Russian-held territory. ""Russian forces were likely taken by surprise,"" the UK Ministry of Defence said. ""The sector was only lightly held and Ukrainian units have captured or surrounded several towns."" Ukraine launched its counter-offensive in the east earlier this week, while international attention was focused on an anticipated advance near the southern city of Kherson. Analysts believe Russia redirected some of its most seasoned troops to defend the city. But as well as gaining ground in the east, Ukraine is also making gains in the south, an official said. Nataliya Gumenyuk, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian army's southern command, said they had advanced ""between two and several dozens of kilometres"" along that front. But Russian forces fighting on the southern front are said to have dug into defensive positions, and Ukraine's troops have faced heavy resistance since the offensive began. And in Kharkiv itself, one person was killed and several homes damaged on Saturday as Russian rocket fire hit the city, according to local officials. Ukrainian officials shared a picture on social media that appeared to show Ukrainian troops holding up the country's flag in front of Kupiansk city hall, with the Russian flag at their feet.

"This video can not be played BBC News NI's Gareth Gordon looks back at the Queen's relationship with Northern Ireland Royalty in the 21st Century is more about symbolism than power, but the Queen knew the power of symbols in the cause of reconciliation. In June 2012,she greeted thousands at Stormontfor a Diamond Jubilee party. Earlier the eyes of the world focused on an historic handshake with Martin McGuinness at Belfast's Lyric theatre. The Queen and the then Irish President, Mary McAleese, laid wreaths at the Garden of Remembrance in Dublin in May 2011 The four-second handshake between the former IRA leader and the British monarch appeared to usher in a new era in 40 years of troubled history. Queen at Stormont Jubilee party Queen makes 'giant leap for British-Irish relations' A year earlier, the Queen had broken new ground in Dublin, joining the then Irish President, Mary McAleese, to lay wreaths at the Garden of Remembrance. Queen Elizabeth at the National Convention Centre, Dublin, in 2011 Given that the garden is dedicated to those who died fighting British rule, this was another occasion that, at one time, would have seemed unimaginable. Then the Queen went on to charm her Irish audience at a state banquet when she spoke in Irish, greeting them:  ""A UachtarÃ¡in agus a chairde"" (president and friends). There were some small, republican protests, but during a visit to the English market in Cork, most people seemed more than ready to welcome the Queen on the first visit to the Republic of Ireland by a British monarch since King George V in 1911. If these scenes were a novelty in Cork, not so north of the border where the Queen was a frequent visitor over the decades. The Queen and the Duke Of Edinburgh arrived by steam train to open the new Bellarena Station village in County Londonderry in 2016 In fact, she took her first flight in an aircraft in 1945 when, as a teenage princess, she accompanied her parents to Northern Ireland on a two-day visit. Four years later, Princess Elizabeth was back, together with her husband, Prince Philip. Thecouple returned in 1953 after the Queen's coronation. Inevitably, given the politics of Ireland, not everyone was a fan. In 1966, the Queen opened a new bridge across the River Lagan in Belfast named in her honour. But as her motorcade wound through the city, a protester dropped a brick from a high building onto the bonnet of the Royal car. When the Queen celebrated her Silver Jubilee in 1977, the Troubles were at their height. The IRA threatened to give the monarch a ""visit to remember"". Spectators lined the shores of Belfast Lough to watch the Queen arrive on board the Royal Yacht Britannia. She made a special reference to Northern Ireland in her Christmas message that year. ""No-where is reconciliation more desperately needed than in Northern Ireland,"" she said. The Queen visited Pat O'Connell's fish stall at the English Market in Cork in 2011 ""That is why I was particularly pleased to go there. No-one dared to promise an early end to the Troubles but there is no doubt that people of goodwill in Northern Ireland were greatly heartened by the chance they had to share the celebrations with the rest of the nation and Commonwealth."" She often expressed sadness after atrocities committed during the Troubles. But the murder that hurt her most personally had to be the IRA's assassination of Earl Mountbatten, in 1979. The earl was her husband's uncle. She appeared to refer implicitly to his loss many years later in her Dublin speech. ""It is a sad and regrettable reality that through history our islands have experienced more than their fair share of heartache, turbulence and loss,"" she said. ""These events have touched us all, many of us personally, and are a painful legacy. We can never forget those who have died or been injured, and their families. ""To all those who have suffered as a consequence of our troubled past I extend my sincere thoughts and deep sympathy. ""With the benefit of historical hindsight we can all see things which we would wish had been done differently or not at all."" The then Northern Ireland Secretary John Reid showed the Queen the site of the 1998 Real IRA bombing in Omagh, as part of the Golden Jubilee Tour in 2002 As the Troubles raged, the Queen did not visit Northern Ireland at all during the 1980s. But she returned in the 1990s - praising the Ulster Defence Regiment in Lisburn, opening another new bridge in Belfast and meeting church leaders in Armagh. Hillsborough gun salute marks King's proclamation Queen Elizabeth II: Island of Ireland pays tribute In pictures: Royal visits over the years In 2000, she presented the Royal Ulster Constabulary with the George Cross, then later that decade watched dance and drama in Londonderry, andtoured the site of the Omagh bombing,external. At Stormont, she praised the progress made towards peace. ""Life has never been straightforward here, but I welcome the real sense of normality that has, over recent years, been returning to the lives of ordinary people, even if tempered from time to time by moments of disappointment and pessimism. You now have a better future for Northern Ireland in your grasp,"" she told politicians. The Queen's trip to the Giant's Causeway in 2016 was her first visit to Northern Ireland's best known tourist attraction Her last visit to Northern Ireland ended up being in 2016 - she had been due to visit Northern Ireland for a two-day trip in October 2021 to coincidewith the centenary but it was cancelled on medical advice. This was perhaps when the public first became aware of concerns surrounding the then 95-year-old's health. Throughout her reign, the Queen remained painfully aware of the tragedies that beset Northern Ireland. But she seemed to take heart from the knowledge that she could play an important role in helping people put the past in perspective and concentrating minds on what she hoped would be a brighter future.

"Julie Stockman on the Shankill Road where people have been gathering in tribute to the Queen People across Northern Ireland have been reacting to the news of the Queen's death with many describing a sense of shock and loss. On Belfast's Shankill Road, a recently unveiled mural marking the Queen's Jubilee has become a focal point for the community's grief. Julie Stockman is one four local women who have booked flights to London to see the Queen's funeral cortÃ¨ge. ""We want to pay our respects. We loved the Queen and always will,"" she said. The Queen died at her Balmoral estate in Scotland on Thursday at the age of 96. Within minutes of her death being announced, people began laying flowers at the gates of Hillsborough Castle, her official residence in Northern Ireland. Some were close to tears, moved by the death of the only monarch they had known. Queen Elizabeth II stayed at Hillsborough Castle many times over the years. Edwin Parks put the union flag outside his house at half-mast. An emotional Mr Parks, a former presenter at BBC Radio Guernsey and ex-major in the Royal Horse Artillery, said it was ""a very, very sad day"". Hillsborough man Edwin Parks places the Union flag outside his house at half-mast Living just across the road from the castle, Mr Parks used to see Her Majesty ""every now and again"". ""She was a very lovely woman and I was very privileged to have met her on three or four occasions,"" he said. ""And one of the amazing things about her was that when you met her, without the cameras and all of that around, she was a very ordinary woman. ""I always used to say she reminds me of my mother. She was just the same sort of person - very informed. ""She had a wicked sense of humour - I mean a really, really wicked sense of humour which, away from the cameras, appeared the whole time. ""She was just a lovely person to talk to. ""She was part of Hillsborough. And presumably her son will continue to be part of Hillsborough."" Stephen Gilmore: ""One day you've a new prime minister, the next a new monarch"" Speaking at the castle gates, as people laid tributes while a light drizzle fell, Stephen Gilmore told BBC News NI he was ""very shocked"" by the Queen's death ""because we saw her on the TV yesterday appointing the new prime minister"". ""Yes, she was frail but she looked in good health - and today she's gone,"" he said. Mr Gilmore described Queen Elizabeth as ""a tremendous woman of faith and of leadership"". A clearly emotional Colin McCrory said he had travelled especially to Hillsborough to lay flowers. Colin McCrory, from the Shankill area of Belfast, travelled to Hillsborough to pay his respects ""It's just a day everyone expected but you never thought you'd see it,"" he said. ""My granny loved her. I was brought up loving her. There's a picture of the Queen in every single room in my house. ""It's just loyalty and devotion. She had it to the world and to the UK, and we had it to her."" Live: Northern Ireland reacts The Queen's delight on Irish visits Queen Elizabeth II: Island of Ireland pays tribute In pictures: Royal visits over the years Laura Porter, who was also at the castle to pay her respects, told BBC News NI: ""She's been the longest-reigning monarch and as a woman she is just so inspirational. ""After the past couple of years with her family, as well, they kind of put her through the rounds a little bit. I feel quite sad for her today but I think she's with Philip, the love of her life. ""She was a mother and she had a full time job as well. Many women can relate to that. ""And she was our servant too. I just heard today that she signed off in all her communications as 'Your servant' and that just means a lot to me."" Ms Porter expressed hope that everyone in Northern Ireland could come together to pay respect to Queen Elizabeth. Laura Porter: ""As a woman she is just so inspirational"" Lyndsey Gault, from Dromore, County Down, spoke of a sense of ""tremendous sadness for the nation"". She said she had come to Hillsborough to pay her respects to ""a godly lady"". ""Her service has been impeccable,"" she said. ""My granny would have remembered the Queen's coronation.

I think a lot of people would. You know, she is the nation's granny."" In Londonderry's Fountain Estate, there was a sombre, reflective mood. Community worker Jeanette Warke was awarded an MBE by the Queen in 1999. ""I will always remember that day and I will never forget that lady,"" Ms Warke told BBC Radio Foyle on Friday. Jeanette Warke says meeting the Queen in 1999 was a day she will never forget ""It was just a privilege to stand before her and look into her eyes. ""She made every single person feel the same way, you feel as if you're the only one in that room and that is so special - it's not just simply handing over a medal. ""She actually knew the work that I did and it's just something I'll never forget."" The union flag flying at half-mast over Belfast City Hall Tributes were paid on the Shankill Road in Belfast with a recently unveiled Jubilee mural a focal point for the community's grief On the Shankill Road in Belfast, many local residents expressed their grief. Community development worker, Stacey Graham, lay flowers with her husband and children and said the experience was ""really really moving"". ""I'm showing my respect because I'm British and I love the Queen. We had helped organise the Jubilee mural that everybody is now using as a focal point for their grief,"" she said. Stacey Graham said she was moved by the tributes on the Shankill Road ""It's only right that we come down and remember such an amazing, admirable woman. ""Her grace to the very end was just unbelievable and I don't think we'll ever see another lady like her again."" Ms Graham added that she thinks Charles will be a powerful, modern monarch and she says she admires his views on climate change. Sharon Burns lay flowers to show her respect Sharon Burns said she was very upset to hear the news. ""When I heard they'd sent for the Royal family, I knew that was it. ""She did her duty right up until the very end. We'll see what happens but (Charles and Camilla) will not do the job the way she did it. ""She was our Queen, she'll always be our Queen,"" she added. Mr Finlay paid tribute to the Queen's work across the Commonwealth Stuart Finlay works with the Shankill community garden and is responsible for maintaining the mural. He knew this would be a busy area. He said he was ""heartbroken"" to hear the news of the Queen's passing. ""It's a shock to everybody... She's done so much for the whole of the UK and the Commonwealth, and did her fair share for the peace process. ""Just look down the road, there's tributes everywhere for her."" Members of the community marked their respects on Friday morning ""She just kept going and going"" said Gemma Davison Gemma Davison spoke to BBC NI as she lay flowers, saying that she felt the need to ""pay my respects, she did her service for over 70 years"". ""She just kept going and going. ""I think Charles will just carry on from what his Mummy did, he'll follow her example,"" she added.

Queen Elizabeth with the Duke of Edinburgh at a lodge in Kenya In January 1952, Princess Elizabeth and her husband the Duke of Edinburgh set off on an overseas tour in place of the monarch, who was terminally ill with lung cancer. Against medical advice, the King went to the airport to see the couple off. It was to be the last time Elizabeth, then just 25 years old, would see her father. She heard the news of his death while staying at a game lodge in Kenya and immediately returned to London as the Queen. She later recalled: ""In a way, I didn't have an apprenticeship. My father died much too young, so it was all a very sudden kind of taking on and making the best job you can.â Queen Elizabeth II returns to England Welsh politicians will be recalled to the Senedd - the Welsh
Parliament - on Sunday to pay tribute to Queen Elizabeth II. The session, in Cardiff Bay, will take place at 14:00 BST and
all other business will be suspended until after the state funeral. Amotion of condolence will express the Seneddâs ""deep sadness at the death of Her Majesty The Queen"". The Queen officially opened the Senedd building in 2006 and last
visited in 2021 to open its sixth session.

""One of the reasons we got them was because the Queen had them,"" she said, pushing a pram with two corgis patiently sitting inside. The Queen was known for her love of corgis dating back to when she was a child, and kept dozens of them over the course of her 70-year reign. Read more abouthow the Queen's love of corgis started a global phenomenon On Saturday, Windsor Castle became the site of a rare joint appearance by the new Prince of Wales, William, with his brother Prince Harry, and their wives. It is a building that had deep significance to the monarch throughout her life - a place of work but also her own private retreat. The Queen's special association with Windsor Castle began when she was a child. 
The then-Princess Elizabeth and her family made Royal Lodge - a mansion in the grounds of the Windsor Estate - their weekend country home. The first instinct of many mourning the death of Queen Elizabeth II has been to leave flowers at Windsor Castle.  At the age of 14, the then-princess and her sister Margaret were sent to the castle for much of World War Two while their home in London faced the threat of being bombed. The castle has been inhabited continuously by 40 monarchs across almost 1,000 years. With 1,000 rooms, 13 acres (five hectares) of grounds and reminders of its rich history amid the gothic architecture, it is little wonder the Queen saw the castle as a sanctuary. This video can not be played Commonwealth countries pay tribute to the Queen Countries throughout the Commonwealth - the association of 56 nations with ties to the former British empire - have been sharing their condolences and memories of Queen Elizabeth II. From world leaders to members of the public, people reflected on Her Majesty's legacy. Tributes for the Queen have poured in from statesmen around the world, and on Saturday, the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was the latest to issue his  condolences. On Twitter, Blinken posted a photo from the US embassy in Washington, thanking the Queen for her ""steadfast leadership"" and ""unwavering commitment to service"". Dame Karen Pierce, the UK ambassador to the US, thanked Blinken for the message, calling the Queen ""our foremost diplomat"" and ""active supporter"" of the two countries' ""special relationship"" - a phrase that had been coined by her first prime minister, Churchill.

Katty KayUS special correspondent Queen Elizabeth and Ronald Reagan ride horses in Windsor Home Park in 1982 US presidents wield hard power. They control the
biggest military in the world and its richest country. Yet,
one after one, they would walk into Buckingham Palace and go jelly-kneed. This
diminutive woman reduced powerful presidents to grinning school boys. She traded scone recipes with Dwight Eisenhower, danced
with Gerald Ford and rode with Ronald Reagan. Somehow she managed to find a way to
connect with each of them, not just as a fellow head of state, but as a person. The one president who, according to someone who worked
for him, didn't go into his first meeting with the Queen already star struck
was Barack Obama. Apparently he rather resisted the ""hype,"" as
this staffer put it. But then he met her. And, like the 11 presidents
before him, he, too, was won over. Indeed, the two developed such a good
relationship that the Queen reportedly asked him to come and visit even after
he left office. I'm told that what changed the 44th president's view was her
sense of responsibility and duty - she was, in Obama language, a no-drama
Queen. US presidents often have a keen sense of history and all those years on the throne wasn't lost on them. As a long day draws to a close in the UK, let's look back at what happened today: Charles III was proclaimed kingby the Accession Council in a ceremony at St James's Palace in London.Read more here. In Balmoral, three of the Queen's children -Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward -attended a church service along with other members of the royal family, and stopped to greet well-wishers outside the gates of Balmoral. Details of the Queen's funeral were announced- it will take place at 11am on Monday, 19 September at Westminster Abbey.Get more details here. Prince William, the new Prince of Wales,paid tribute to Queen Elizabeth saying his grandmother had been at his side on both his happiest and saddest days.Read what he said here. King Charlesheld audiences with ministers and met opposition politicians at Buckingham Palace. Princes Harry and William, joined by their wives,delighted crowds as they went for a walkabout in Windsor, collecting floral tributes and meeting some of those who turned out to pay their respects.Watch the moment here. The Queen was a big part of the community in the village near Balmoral, says the church minister Balmoral, the Scottish castle where the Queen died, was the place where she ""enjoyed being normal"", according to royal historian Robert Lacey, So it's no surprise thatpeople in the nearby village of Ballater remember her with special affection. ""She was not just our Queen, she was a neighbour - and a big part of this community,"" says Rev David Barr at Glenmuick Church in the village. Alistair Cassie, who runs a hardware shop in Ballater and has a royal warrant for supplying Balmoral with its televisions, remembered being called to the castle to fix interference with the radio. The Royal Banner of Scotland flies at half-mast at Balmoral Castle ""I was walking along this corridor, and who did I meet but the Queen,"" he says. They chatted about her appreciation for the BBC Radio 2 presenter Jimmy Young. The sprawling Balmoral Estate includes dozens of houses, many occupied by estate staff, and Cassie says at times the Queen would appear unannounced at someone's home, asking: ""How are you doing?"" Grant Harrold, a former butler to King Charles when he was Prince of Wales, says the Queen and Prince Philip would sometimes stay at a small cottage on the estate. He says: ""From what I was told - I never witnessed it - she would be in the kitchen cooking away and he would lay the table, so it was very much a chance for them to be a normal couple."" Alistair Cassie met the Queen on a formal visit - and unexpectedly in the corridor of the castle Crowds continued to form at Buckingham Palace on Saturday night as people paid tribute to the Queen Many took photos at the gates, where flowers have been left in memory of the monarch Six-year-old Penelope is among the people to have left tributes for the Queen near the palace As the nation continues to mourn the death of Queen Elizabeth II, here's what we know about the plans for tomorrow:  Sean CoughlanBBC News, royal correspondent Headline writers will be thinking about ""Brothers in arms"" or maybe ""Brothers in grief"" for their coverage. The sight of Princes William and Harry meeting the crowds together will become one of the stand-out and most unexpected images from what have been sombre days. With their wives, Catherine and Meghan, they greeted people in Windsor, in a way that couldn't have been predicted last week, when the Sussexes returned to the UK. The talk then was of feuds and unbridgeable differences between couples. They were said to be staying in houses close together on the Windsor estate, while emotionally many miles apart. The couple hadn't been seen together in public for more than two years. That all changed on Thursday. If William and Harry were not planning to see each other, they were brought together in ways that couldn't have been predicted.

Chi Chi IzunduReporting from Washington DC A
small group of people were making their way to the British Embassy in
Washington DC to lay flowers and read some of the messages that people had
left. Dignitaries
are expected to continue to make their way to the embassy and pay their
respects. Wanita Harris-Wise was
carrying a small bunch of flowers and wanted to go and show her respects to the
monarch. âQueen Elizabeth was all we
knew growing up. Iâm 64 years of age and when you thought of the Queen thatâs
who the Queen was. We call our children princesses. We want our children to
grow up to be in that same honour in light of the Queen.â Wanita left a small bunch of flowers in memory of the Queen Eloise AlannaReporting from Ottawa, Canada Itâs been a very hot day
     here in the capital of Canada, Ottawa. Justin Trudeau and his
     son walked slowly up to Rideau Hall, the residency of the Governor
     General, Mary Simon - she is the representative of the monarch in Canada
     and the first indigenous person to hold that position. Itâs a quiet residency
     just out of town. Wild turkeys walk around the grounds and among the
     trees, some of which have been planted by royals. There are 14
     commonwealth realms in addition to the UK. A realm is a country whose
     monarch is the King. Canada is one of the realms and today, like in the
     UK, there was an official proclamation of the King. Trumpets sounded, the
     doors opened and the Chief Herald walked out of Rideau Hall to announce
     the King of Canada. Firstly in English and then in French, with Trudeau at
     his side, Samy Khalid, proclaimed His Royal Highness Prince Charles III,
     King. Cannon shots were fired,
     flags were raised and Guardsmen marched among the small crowd that had
     gathered.  Tributes for Queen Elizabeth II are continuing to pour in from around the world. Oliver Atkin from Bromley says he remembers meeting the monarch on the Balmoral estate in 2012 while on a family day out. She ""walked straight up to us and said hello. I remember my Mum and Dad introducing us all. She asked where we were going and took time to find out where we were from,"" he recalls. Yasmine Jamil says she ""couldn't have enough"" of stories about the Queen when she was growing up in Pakistan, and that the monarch's death felt like ""losing a dear family member"".

Windsor Castle today to pay her respects to the Queen. Just feet away when Kate, William, Harry and Meghan came
to speak to the crowd, she was disappointed not to get the chance to talk to
them. âBut honestly it was amazing to see them. Kate was bending to see all the children, if she heard
anyone say her name she would turn around and try to talk to them - like
the Queen did,"" she said. âThey really seem to understand the nation has lost the
Queen too - theyâre allowing us to grieve with them.â Julia from London was also close enough to catch a glimpse of the royals but didnât manage to speak to them. âThis morning on TV William looked very sombre

"This video can not be played BBC News NI's Gareth Gordon looks back at the Queen's relationship with Northern Ireland Royalty in the 21st Century is more about symbolism than power, but the Queen knew the power of symbols in the cause of reconciliation. In June 2012,she greeted thousands at Stormontfor a Diamond Jubilee party. Earlier the eyes of the world focused on an historic handshake with Martin McGuinness at Belfast's Lyric theatre. The Queen and the then Irish President, Mary McAleese, laid wreaths at the Garden of Remembrance in Dublin in May 2011 The four-second handshake between the former IRA leader and the British monarch appeared to usher in a new era in 40 years of troubled history. Queen at Stormont Jubilee party Queen makes 'giant leap for British-Irish relations' A year earlier, the Queen had broken new ground in Dublin, joining the then Irish President, Mary McAleese, to lay wreaths at the Garden of Remembrance. Queen Elizabeth at the National Convention Centre, Dublin, in 2011 Given that the garden is dedicated to those who died fighting British rule, this was another occasion that, at one time, would have seemed unimaginable. Then the Queen went on to charm her Irish audience at a state banquet when she spoke in Irish, greeting them:  ""A UachtarÃ¡in agus a chairde"" (president and friends). There were some small, republican protests, but during a visit to the English market in Cork, most people seemed more than ready to welcome the Queen on the first visit to the Republic of Ireland by a British monarch since King George V in 1911. If these scenes were a novelty in Cork, not so north of the border where the Queen was a frequent visitor over the decades. The Queen and the Duke Of Edinburgh arrived by steam train to open the new Bellarena Station village in County Londonderry in 2016 In fact, she took her first flight in an aircraft in 1945 when, as a teenage princess, she accompanied her parents to Northern Ireland on a two-day visit. Four years later, Princess Elizabeth was back, together with her husband, Prince Philip. Thecouple returned in 1953 after the Queen's coronation. Inevitably, given the politics of Ireland, not everyone was a fan. In 1966, the Queen opened a new bridge across the River Lagan in Belfast named in her honour. But as her motorcade wound through the city, a protester dropped a brick from a high building onto the bonnet of the Royal car. When the Queen celebrated her Silver Jubilee in 1977, the Troubles were at their height. The IRA threatened to give the monarch a ""visit to remember"". Spectators lined the shores of Belfast Lough to watch the Queen arrive on board the Royal Yacht Britannia. She made a special reference to Northern Ireland in her Christmas message that year. ""No-where is reconciliation more desperately needed than in Northern Ireland,"" she said. The Queen visited Pat O'Connell's fish stall at the English Market in Cork in 2011 ""That is why I was particularly pleased to go there. No-one dared to promise an early end to the Troubles but there is no doubt that people of goodwill in Northern Ireland were greatly heartened by the chance they had to share the celebrations with the rest of the nation and Commonwealth."" She often expressed sadness after atrocities committed during the Troubles. But the murder that hurt her most personally had to be the IRA's assassination of Earl Mountbatten, in 1979. The earl was her husband's uncle. She appeared to refer implicitly to his loss many years later in her Dublin speech. ""It is a sad and regrettable reality that through history our islands have experienced more than their fair share of heartache, turbulence and loss,"" she said. ""These events have touched us all, many of us personally, and are a painful legacy. We can never forget those who have died or been injured, and their families. ""To all those who have suffered as a consequence of our troubled past I extend my sincere thoughts and deep sympathy. ""With the benefit of historical hindsight we can all see things which we would wish had been done differently or not at all."" The then Northern Ireland Secretary John Reid showed the Queen the site of the 1998 Real IRA bombing in Omagh, as part of the Golden Jubilee Tour in 2002 As the Troubles raged, the Queen did not visit Northern Ireland at all during the 1980s. But she returned in the 1990s - praising the Ulster Defence Regiment in Lisburn, opening another new bridge in Belfast and meeting church leaders in Armagh. Hillsborough gun salute marks King's proclamation Queen Elizabeth II: Island of Ireland pays tribute In pictures: Royal visits over the years In 2000, she presented the Royal Ulster Constabulary with the George Cross, then later that decade watched dance and drama in Londonderry, andtoured the site of the Omagh bombing,external. At Stormont, she praised the progress made towards peace. ""Life has never been straightforward here, but I welcome the real sense of normality that has, over recent years, been returning to the lives of ordinary people, even if tempered from time to time by moments of disappointment and pessimism. You now have a better future for Northern Ireland in your grasp,"" she told politicians. The Queen's trip to the Giant's Causeway in 2016 was her first visit to Northern Ireland's best known tourist attraction Her last visit to Northern Ireland ended up being in 2016 - she had been due to visit Northern Ireland for a two-day trip in October 2021 to coincidewith the centenary but it was cancelled on medical advice. This was perhaps when the public first became aware of concerns surrounding the then 95-year-old's health. Throughout her reign, the Queen remained painfully aware of the tragedies that beset Northern Ireland. But she seemed to take heart from the knowledge that she could play an important role in helping people put the past in perspective and concentrating minds on what she hoped would be a brighter future.

In the coming days, her coffin will travel from Balmoral to the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh - the official residence of the British monarch in Scotland. From here it will be taken in procession to St Giles' Cathedral, where the Queen will lie at rest for 24 hours, allowing the public to view her coffin.

"Domestic football, from the Premier League to grassroots, will not take place in most of the UK this weekend after Queen Elizabeth II died aged 96. Matches at all levels in England, Wales and Northern Ireland have been postponed, while in Scotland only senior games have been affected. However, several other sports are continuing as planned, including cricket, golf, rugby union and horse racing. At-a-glance: What's on and what's off this weekend Wiegman and Southgate honour 'inspirational' Queen Dan Roan, BBC sports editor After the Queen died on Thursday, football's governing bodies convened on Friday to discuss the best course of action for the upcoming weekend's fixtures. The government's national mourning guidance advised that cancelling games was not obligatory, leaving the decision to individual sports. The Football Associations of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland all confirmed on Friday that fixtures would be postponed as a mark of respect. The Premier League said the decision not to go ahead with its 10 games this weekend was made to honour the Queen's ""extraordinary life and contribution to the nation"". In a rare example of unity, football's authorities are understood to feel that - unlike other sports that have already paused events this week, like racing, cricket and golf - football has not yet had a chance to stop, reflect and show its respects. Many people disagree of course, and feel matches would have provided fans with an opportunity to pay tribute. There is understandable sympathy for those who have spent money on tickets and transport, and now have to change plans at short notice, especially with so many other events in other sports going ahead. The decision to stop grassroots and school sport is also contentious, especially after so much football was lost during the pandemic, even if it is just for one weekend. But the FA is known to be mindful of football's status as the national sport at this historic moment, and the close ties the sport had with the Queen, who was patron of the FA, while Prince William is its president. According to well-placed sources, there has been a provisional plan to pause fixtures in such circumstances for several years now, and it was always likely that those plans would be honoured, despite the inevitable scrutiny. West Ham's Europa Conference League game against FCSB went ahead on Thursday With it being part of this weekend's round of fixtures, Monday's Premier League game between Leeds and Nottingham Forest was also called off. But after that there are Champions League, Europa League, Europa Conference League and English Football League games taking place in midweek. European games on Thursday evening went ahead as scheduled, with a minute's silence observed in matches involving British teams. Uefa has not yet provided an update on next week's games involving British sides, but Manchester City's Champions League game with Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday is due to go ahead as planned. BBC Sport has been told City are able to provide the policing needed, so the game will take place as scheduled at Etihad Stadium. Rangers, who host Napoli in the Champions League on Tuesday, said in a statement they are in discussions with Uefa but ""at present, the game is scheduled to take place at the scheduled date and time"". Manchester United have confirmed their Europa League game with FC Sheriff in Moldova next Thursday will take place as scheduled ""following discussions with the relevant governing bodies and in line with guidance issued by the UK government"". Aston Villa players and staff paid their respects to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II with a minute's silence on Friday The EFL has not yet issued an update yet on its round of midweek games. As for next weekend's fixtures, they are currently taking place as planned although that could change depending on when details of the Queen's state funeral are provided. The funeral is expected to take place at Westminster Abbey in less than two weeks, but the exact day will be confirmed by Buckingham Palace. If it takes place next weekend then fixtures could again be postponed. Policing games could be a factor in the decision if they are redeployed to London en masse before the Queen's funeral. There are currently three matches scheduled to take place in the capital over Saturday and Sunday. The Premier League is understood to be talking to its clubs, while the Metropolitan Police has been asked for a comment. Tottenham play Leicester on Saturday evening, while Brentford face Arsenal and Chelsea are at home to Liverpool on Sunday 18 September. Simon Stone, BBC Sport Finding room in the packed English football calendar for a full round of Premier League fixtures (and possibly two) is going to be complicated. In a unique season that includes a winter World Cup - and restarts on 20 December with the Carabao Cup fourth round, space is severely limited. There is no spare midweek from now until the season ends on 3 June that exists without a purpose. Two, 17 January and 7 February, are for FA Cup third and fourth-round replays. Three more, 4 April, 2 May and 23 May, are for matches that have been postponed on the weekends of the EFL Cup final and the FA Cup sixth round and semi-finals. Two January midweeks are for the individual legs of the EFL Cup semi-finals. Eight midweeks are reserved for Uefa matches - and the European governing body is resistant to domestic games being played at the same time as its matches. And two midweeks in March form part of the final mid-season international break. Discussions will start next week about how to resolve the issue. The respective governing bodies are relaxed about the situation given they dealt with similar calendar issues during the 2020-21 Covid-19-affected season. Then, FA Cup replays were scrapped and the EFL Cup semi-finals were played as one game. Answers will be similarly difficult now. Fans observed a minute's silence at games involving British teams on Thursday evening The Football Supporters' Federation accepted there was ""no perfect decision"" for the football authorities, but added it believed many supporters would have wanted games to go ahead. It said in a statement: ""We believe football is at its finest when bringing people together at times of huge national significance - be those moments of joy or moments of mourning. ""Our view, which we shared with the football authorities, is that most supporters would have liked to go to games this weekend and pay their respects to the Queen alongside their fellow fans. ""Not everyone will agree, so there was no perfect decision for the football authorities, but many supporters will feel this was an opportunity missed for football to pay its own special tributes."" Play will resume in England's cricket Testagainst South Africa on Saturday, and the women's Twenty20 match between England and India will go ahead.

"Domestic football, from the Premier League to grassroots, will not take place in most of the UK this weekend after Queen Elizabeth II died aged 96. Matches at all levels in England, Wales and Northern Ireland have been postponed, while in Scotland only senior games have been affected. However, several other sports are continuing as planned, including cricket, golf, rugby union and horse racing. At-a-glance: What's on and what's off this weekend Wiegman and Southgate honour 'inspirational' Queen Dan Roan, BBC sports editor After the Queen died on Thursday, football's governing bodies convened on Friday to discuss the best course of action for the upcoming weekend's fixtures. The government's national mourning guidance advised that cancelling games was not obligatory, leaving the decision to individual sports. The Football Associations of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland all confirmed on Friday that fixtures would be postponed as a mark of respect. The Premier League said the decision not to go ahead with its 10 games this weekend was made to honour the Queen's ""extraordinary life and contribution to the nation"". In a rare example of unity, football's authorities are understood to feel that - unlike other sports that have already paused events this week, like racing, cricket and golf - football has not yet had a chance to stop, reflect and show its respects. Many people disagree of course, and feel matches would have provided fans with an opportunity to pay tribute. There is understandable sympathy for those who have spent money on tickets and transport, and now have to change plans at short notice, especially with so many other events in other sports going ahead. The decision to stop grassroots and school sport is also contentious, especially after so much football was lost during the pandemic, even if it is just for one weekend. But the FA is known to be mindful of football's status as the national sport at this historic moment, and the close ties the sport had with the Queen, who was patron of the FA, while Prince William is its president. According to well-placed sources, there has been a provisional plan to pause fixtures in such circumstances for several years now, and it was always likely that those plans would be honoured, despite the inevitable scrutiny.

"The Royal Mile is prepared for the arrival of the Queen's coffin Major roads in the centre of Edinburgh have now closed as the city prepares to become a focal point for people mourningthe death of the Queen. In the coming days, her coffin will travel from Balmoral to the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh - the official residence of the British monarch in Scotland. From here it will be taken in procession to St Giles' Cathedral, where the Queen will lie at rest for 24 hours, allowing the public to view her coffin. Edinburgh City Council said it was working with the Scottish government and Police Scotland to accommodate significant numbers of visitors wishing to pay their respects. What happens next after the Queen's death? Queen Elizabeth II: Plans for her lying in state and funeral Other disruption in the city centre includes the closure of Royal Mile Primary School, Abbeyhill Primary School and the Cowgate Early Years Centre on Monday and Tuesday. Street litter bins have been removed from the length of the Royal Mile with people being urged to take litter home or use the next nearest bin. Edinburgh City Council has also issued a list of its current temporary road closures and more will be added in the coming days. Floral tributes have been laid outside Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh People are being advised to plan ahead and avoid any non-essential travel through the city centre, particularly the Old Town, during the period of mourning. Those wishing to take part in events are being advised to plan ahead and take account of weather conditions, limited facilities and the likelihood of spending long periods at the roadside. Edinburgh council leader Cammy Day said: ""Our city is highly experienced in handling major events, and we are working to safely accommodate the large crowds of visitors who will wish to pay their respects to Her Majesty The Queen and the Royal Family over the next few days.

"This video can not be played Watch: Tears and laughter as MPs and peers pay tribute to Queen Elizabeth II Politicians from both Houses of Parliament have gathered to mark the death of Queen Elizabeth II and share their memories of the late monarch. Prime Minister Liz Truss described the Queen as one of the world's greatest-ever leaders, as she opened two days of special tributes in Parliament. MPs and ex-PMs paid their respects in personal speeches that aroused both tears and laughter in emotional scenes. A minute's silence was held to remember the Queen after 70 years on the throne. Both Houses of Parliament are sitting on Friday and Saturday to allow politicians to pay tribute to the Queen, following her death on Thursday. Follow the latest developments A life well lived - King pays tribute to his mother Former prime ministers reflect on Queen's reign Obituary: A long life marked by a sense of duty Friday's proceedings in Parliament paused at 18:00 BST for MPs and peers to watch the new king, Charles III, deliver a televised address to the nation, his first as monarch. Earlier, King Charles III was greeted by crowds singing ""God save the king"" outside Buckingham Palace, where he held his first in-person audience with Ms Truss. On Saturday, Ms Truss and senior ministers will attend the Accession Council at St James's Palace, where Charles will be formally proclaimed king. In Parliament on Friday, MPs and peers from all sides, dressed in dark clothing, paid tribute to the Queen by sharing memories of their own encounters with her. There have been many anecdotes about the Queen's wisdom, sense of humour and ability to put people at their ease. Some MPs laughed uproariously as former Prime Minister Theresa May recalled how mortified she was when the Queen caught her returning a dropped piece of cheese to a plate, as she helped prepare a picnic at Balmoral. ""I looked at her. She looked at me. And she just smiled. And the cheese remained on the table."" But the session began in solemn fashion, as Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle invited a packed Commons chamber to rise and observe a minute's silence. MPs stood for a minute's silence as they gathered for tributes to the Queen As the silence ended, Sir Lindsay described the Queen as a ""devoted monarch"" who had seen 57 complete sessions of Parliament during her reign in a brief speech. Ms Truss, who was appointed prime minister by the Queen just three days ago at Balmoral, paid tribute to her ""sheer humanity"", which she said had made her ""loved and admired"" all over the world. She said her reign had been ""dignified but not distant"" and credited her with re-inventing the British monarchy for the modern age. The Queen's successor, her eldest son King Charles III, now carried the ""awesome responsibility"" of the British crown, added the prime minister. ""The crown endures. Our nation endures. And in that spirit, I say God save the King."" Cheers of approval erupted from MPs, with some shouting ""God save the King"" from the side gallery in the moments after Ms Truss's speech concluded. This video can not be played Liz Truss: Queen 'one of the greatest leaders the world has known' Next to speak was the leader of the Opposition, Labour MP Sir Keir Starmer, who reflected on the tumultuous political events of recent times and the extraordinary national change heralded by the Queen's death. ""When everything is spinning, a nation requires a still point, when times are difficult, it requires comfort, and when direction is hard to find, it requires leadership,"" Sir Keir said. ""The loss of our Queen robs this country of its stillest point, its greatest comfort, at precisely the time we need those things most."" He said the Queen had enjoyed a ""personal relationship with us all"", based on ""total commitment"" to duty and a ""deep devotion to the country, the Commonwealth, and the people she loved"". This video can not be played Watch: Sir Keir Starmer pays tribute to the Queen Boris Johnson - who offered the Queen his resignation as prime minister at Balmoral on Tuesday - reflected on that meeting, saying the late monarch ""was as radiant and as knowledgeable and as fascinated by politics as ever I can remember"". Praising the late monarch as ""Elizabeth the Great"", he recalled her ""humility"" and, like other former leaders, spoke of informal gatherings with the Royal Family, at Balmoral. ""Unlike us politicians, with our outriders and our armour-plated convoys, I can tell you as a direct eyewitness that she drove herself in her own car with no detectives and no bodyguard, bouncing at alarming speed over the Scottish landscape to the total amazement of the ramblers and the tourists we encountered."" Mrs May described her weekly prime ministerial meetings with the Queen as ""a conversation with a woman of experience and knowledge and immense wisdom"". ""They were also the one meeting I went to, which I knew it would not be briefed out to the media,"" Mrs May said, to laughter from MPs. Harriet Harman, who is known as Mother of the House, told MPs about the Queen's kindness after she lost her senior government role in 1998. ""My diary was empty, and my phone stopped ringing. My office was astonished to get a call from Buckingham Palace. No one else wanted to have anything to do with me, but the Queen wanted to see me. ""I was invited to take tea with the Queen for her to thank me for my service as secretary of state."" This video can not be played Theresa May shares an amusing story about how down-to-earth the Queen was SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford used his speech to draw attention to the Queen's well-known affection for Scotland, where she spent her final days at Balmoral Castle. ""The relationship between Scotland and the Queen was one of shared admiration,"" Mr Blackford said. ""Indeed, whilst she was everyone's Queen, for many in Scotland, she was Elizabeth, Queen of Scots."" Former Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett said she was one of the few MPs to remember the Queen's coronation in 1953. The veteran Labour MP shared fond memories of the Queen's sense of fun, and choked back tears as she hailed ""a remarkable person, a remarkable monarch"". Meanwhile in the Lords, the newly appointed leader of Parliament's upper house, Lord True, led tributes to the Queen, calling her an ""anchor of stability in a changing world"". Ending his moving tribute, Lord True looked poignantly at the sovereign's throne, where the Queen had sat for numerous state openings of Parliament, and said: ""Thank you, Ma'am. May you ever rest in peace as you will ever rest in our hearts."" His words were followed by those of Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, who spoke of the Queen's ""profound sense of being called by God"" and her dry sense of humour. And former Labour cabinet minister Lord Blunkett recalled how the Queen came to his aid after he ended up facing the wrong way as he knelt during a royal audience. The blind peer said the Queen, in a ""careful and never patronising way"" managed to ""gently - by touching my arm - shift me round"". On Saturday evening, Parliament will be postponed until after 21 September, during a period of national mourning.

"We've been sharing your tributes to Queen Elizabeth II following her death aged 96 You've told us what she meant to you, moments you remember from her life and your stories of meeting the UK's longest-reigning monarch On Monday, the nation paid a final farewell to the Queen, with a state funeral and military procession Our tributes page has been a reminder that hundreds of thousands of us felt a personal connection with the Queen, says BBC Media and Arts Correspondent David Sillito ""She made you feel as if you were important at that moment in her life,"" says Simone Kennett, who was head teacher of a school when it was visited by the Queen We'll be preserving this page so people in the UK and around the world can continue to read the tributes so many of you have left for the Queen Deborah TurnessCEO, BBC News and Current Affairs As the Chief Executive of BBC News I
have the honour to write the closing message on this page of thousands of
tributes to Queen Elizabeth II. And itâs a message of thanks to every single
person who has taken the time to share their story. When the death of Queen Elizabeth was
announced, we at the BBC wanted to create a place where people could come
together to share their tributes, their photos and recollections. The
response has been incredible. We have received thousands of touching stories of
meeting the Queen, special moments, memories and messages of condolence. Thank you to everyone - from all
over the world - for coming together here in this virtual space for very real
acts a of remembrance. Looking at the contributions, the
common theme that emerges is that the Queen had a way of making each person she
met feel like the most important person in that moment. Thank you again for helping us remember
a woman whose promise to serve her people was fulfilled through a life of duty,
which touched so many people. Over the past 10 days, we've been asking you to share your memories of seeing and meeting Queen Elizabeth II or to send in your personal tributes. Thousands of people have sent their own messages of condolence. ""The stories speak to how many people felt a personal connection to Her Majesty,"" says BBC Media and Arts Correspondent David Sillito. ""It reminds us that, while the official record of the life of the Queen will be a series of great moments of national pageantry, those were rare special occasions. ""Her life was much more about handshakes, birthday cards and meeting ordinary, but often remarkable, people. ""No-one forgets a conversation with the Queen. And our tributes page has been a little reminder that for hundreds of thousands of us, the Queen was more than a distant figure in a palace. She was someone with whom they felt a personal connection."" You can read more from David on the tributes here. Sibella Laing went to Cambridge University with King Charles III, has known the Royal Family since she was a child and has met the Queen. She was, is, and always has been, incredibly kind to everybody, always anxious to put people at their ease, always anxious to make you feel you are the only person in the room.  Iâm sure this huge support across the country that Charles must have been seeing will have been really inspirational and uplifting for him. He has had the Queen as a wonderful role model all his life and I think in a sense his whole life has been preparation for this, so I think he is ready for it."" Sibella Laing Dinkie Flowers in the queue to pay her respects to Queen Elizabeth II in Westminster Hall Dinkie Flowers (nee Stapleton), aged 101, queued for several hours on Saturday to pay her respects to Queen Elizabeth II. Dinkie, who lives in Shoreham-by-Sea is holding a letter she received from Buckingham Palace 70 years ago thanking her for her performance in the Celebrity Ice Show at Queens Ice Dance Club on 30 April 1952. Dinkie entertained other members of the public in the queue with some of her memorabilia including the card from Her Majesty for her 100th birthday in 2021.

Marie Wood Frances came from Italy to leave a portrait of the Queen drawn by her son Alex I have been living in Italy for the last 22 years. My son, Alex (13) drew this portrait of the Queen and I asked him if he wanted me to take it to London so I could leave it as a tribute for the Queen. He said yes.  On Saturday I got on a plane from Verona to come especially to leave the portrait before the funeral. Yesterday I took the 5.20am train from Havant to London and I left his portrait in Green Park. The policemen were very kind to take it for me as the park had already closed for laying flowers."" Frances King Simone Kennett was head teacher of Jersey College for Girls when the Queen visited to open a new building in 2001. The Queen said we had a beautiful school and that she had really enjoyed this visit. She made you feel as if you were important at that moment in her life. The students did the college proud and it was a successful visit.  We also had a light-hearted moment during the her visit. The Queen stamped her foot on the school's front terrace and said: 'This is hollow.' I said, 'Yes, Your Majesty, and if Your Majesty continues to bounce up and down she will find herself sitting in Home Economics,' and she absolutely roared with laughter!"" Simone Kennett, Former head of Jersey College for Girls Glyn Sherman, from Coventry, was serving in the Royal Horse Artillery in 1984 when as a guard of honour he met the Queen at a birthday parade. When she came along I said 'all right, Liz'? The top brass went to come down and she put her hand up to stop them, so I was lucky. I felt bad about it but had to explain to her that I've got a daughter called Elizabeth and it just came out like that.  She turned around and said 'I like to be unofficial sometimes'. It was brilliant. The memory will never go out of me.  Her death has left me heartbroken. I don't look at her as being Her Majesty. We call her our boss. Glyn Sherman I was born in 1926, a Londoner, and saw the Queen on the balcony with her parents on the day her father was crowned George VI. That memory is still very vivid in my mind. Beryl Smith Alicia Finn-OâShea, who is 10, met the Queen as a four-month-old baby. The family were so impressed by that encounter they named Alicia's little sister Elizabeth. She's now aged seven and prefers to be called Eliza, but they came to the Mall on Monday to watch the funeral procession with their mum Claire. It was really magical and amazing but also upsetting. The nice thought is the Queen is having marmalade sandwiches and tea with her family in heaven."" Alicia Finn-OâShea We arrived early from Birmingham to secure our place opposite Buckingham Palace gates to bid farewell to Her Majesty. We are really tired today but so happy we made it. It was an absolutely amazing day."" Claire Finn-O'Shea I used to make cakes and pastries for Her Majesty when I worked at Buckingham Palace from 2001 to 2002 and Sandringham from 2005 to 2006. I got really lucky. I did a modern apprenticeship under the patronage of the now King Charles III... On my days off I went and worked at Buckingham Palace two days a week. Over time I ended up working in the pastry kitchen and had the privilege of making some of the cakes and pastries that used to go out to the Queen during her teatime.  When I heard the news of the Queen's death I stepped outside for a good 10 minutes and really cried, I needed to get away from everyone. There are no Brits near me [in America] and so it's more of a challenge for people to understand what's going on.  It feels like more of a part of you has gone rather than a parent or relative. It feels a little bit of your identity has been lost. Kieron Hales Peter John Wailes, who served in the RAF for 25 years, met the Queen many times and headed to Windsor on the day of her funeral to pay his respects. The 63-year-old recalls how once at Buckingham Palace during a VJ Day parade the Queen noticed a veteran was struggling in the heat and ordered an officer to get them some water. âShe was fantastic and in charge of everything,â he says. Iâm here to pay respects to my ex-boss, I feel great respect for her and want to say thanks for everything - I enjoyed working for her and meeting her.â Peter John Wailes Paul Hayden and his sister handing flowers to the Queen during her visit to Essex My memory is a rather distant one: I think I was about five, and the Queen visited the Essex county show. I was photographed handing a bouquet of flowers to the Queen with my younger sister. Prince Phillip stood alongside the Queen. The photo ended up on the front page of the local newspaper and a framed photo was proudly displayed by my parents in their hallway for at least 20 years.  You can imagine the enjoyment all my friends (and my sister) have had over the years making fun of their once angelic mate and his little sister giving flowers to the Queen but I must admit to being rather proud of the occasion, particularly now.  Rest in Peace HRH Queen Elizabeth II."" Paul Hayden The Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell shared a jigsaw puzzle and watched TV with the Queen at Sandringham. It was a great privilege to be alongside her. We sat down after dinner and did a jigsaw and the television was on.  It's a bereavement, and with every bereavement there is shock, there is loss but there is also thankfulness for a life lived well. A life of astonishing service. She was a person of simple but profound faith, and it was that faith that shaped her."" Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell Raven Harlow Aspenwood is severely visually impaired and has channeled her grief into her portrait of the young Queen Elizabeth II I am registered severely visually impaired, but I felt compelled to do something to channel my overwhelming and surprising level of grief following the sad passing of HRH, Queen Elizabeth II. I think my strongest memory of the queen is how comforting her presence has been during every stage of my 28 years of life, when something difficult has happened she has comforted us with her words, when something wonderful has happened she has filled our hearts with joy, with her wonderful smile and calming presence. She has been the grandmother of our nation, the matriarch we all need in times of hardship and times of joy. Her dignity, strength and consistency has been a great comfort and I thank her for her seventy years of steadfast service. Raven Harlow Aspenwood from East Yorkshire What a smile. She could lift a room with that wonderful smile and that genuine interest that she has in the people of this country."" Warwickshire County Council Leader, Izzi Seccombe I do remember her smile, I experienced that myself. It not only lit up a room, it lit up a nation - and she had the capacity to make us smile too."" Bishop of Coventry, Reverend Christopher Cocksworth Zara Umar gave flowers to the Queen in 2002 My daughter Zara and I went down to the City Square in Dundee to see the Queen in 2002. We waited for a long time. Soon the time came and the Queen was walking towards us. She was about five or six steps away from us when one of her security personnel guided the Queen away to the car to leave. Zara was so disappointed and my heart sank. Just then a plain clothes man came and asked me if he could lift Zara over the barrier. Much to my delight, Zara presented the flowers to the Queen and said 'here you are then, take your flowers.' I couldnt believe it! The Queen must have found it funny though and watched Zara return to me with a big smile on her face. I will treasure this memory forever."" Ishrat Umar, Dundee Three army veterans from Worcestershire pay tribute to the Queen... She was our head, she was our leader, she was the person we were serving and she's the one that we would follow. It hits you, it hits your heart."" Eric Braithwaite, who served for 23 years with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers Everyone called her the boss in one way or another. I've actually guarded the Queen and Prince Philip on other duties. A big lump in the throat, lost the boss, getting a new one."" Dave Sandy, who served in the territorial army from the late 1970s until the 1990s I've done a lot of parades for the Queen, she was a lovely lady and worked so hard for the country. I was in tears, I will be honest. It was an honour to be with her and be a soldier for her."" Anthony Goodway, who spent two years in national service from 1958 until 1960 I met the Queen when she visited the Isle of Skye as part of her Golden Jubilee tour. As a nurse then at the local care home, myself and other staff members were invited to bring some of our residents to meet Her Majesty. The great day came, our ladies looking beautiful, wheelchairs polished. One of our residents had worked at the palace as a younger woman and had photos of the Queen all around her room in the care home, so, if any one was to be there that day, it was her.  As the Queen approached our little group that day she asked me: âAre these the ladies from the care home?' I replied in the positive and then said this resident had worked in the palace. The Queen looked down a little and asked her: âWhen did you work at the palace?â To which, the lady looked up and and replied, in a rather gruff voice: âAnd who are you?â What a moment. I apologised. The Queen just smiled and moved on.  I was quite overwhelmed, I donât have photos of the Queen all over the house, but Iâve always respected her, especially as a Christian woman. She had a real true faith, so meeting her was very special. I didnât expect to be so overcome by the moment. Her demeanour was that of interest and she handled the situation really well. She left us all feeling very special and honoured. Barbara Matheson from Glasgow Barbara Matheson has recalled the moment she met the Queen during Her Majesty's Golden Jubilee tour Â© 2025 BBC.

"A bank holiday across the UK has been approved by King Charles III for the day of the funeral of his mother Queen Elizabeth II. The new king confirmed the order at a ceremony in London proclaiming him as monarch. The Queen's state funeral will be held on Monday 19 September. The Queen, Britain's longest ever reigning monarch, died peacefully on Thursday afternoon at her Scottish estate in Balmoral. The state funeral will take place at Westminster Abbey, the historic church where Britain's kings and queens are crowned, and where Queen Elizabeth II married Prince Philip in 1947. There has not been a monarch's funeral service in the Abbey since the 18th Century, although the funeral of the Queen's mother was held there in 2002. Westminster Abbey is the historic church where Britain's kings and queens are crowned, including the Queen's coronation in 1953, and where she married Prince Philip in 1947. Heads of state from across the world will be invited to join members of the Royal Family to remember the life and service of the Queen. Senior UK politicians and former prime ministers are also expected to attend the service, which will be televised. It is expected that certain aspects of daily life will be put on hold for the date of the state funeral, with some businesses and organisations choosing to close or halt their operations. The Royal Mail has announced that its postal services will be suspended on the day, and some shops like Harrods have already said they plan to close. The upcoming bank holiday is one of several ways in which life in the UK is temporarily being put on hold following the Queen's death. A period of national mourning is now in place and will last until the day of the state funeral, the government has announced. There is no obligation for organisers to cancel planned events, but many that were due to happen in the immediate aftermath of the Queen's death have already been cancelled or postponed for a few days. Football matches in the Premier League, English Football League or in Scotland or Northern Ireland have been postponed until Tuesday, while all games in the Women's Super League, Women's Championship and Women's FA Cup have also been put on hold. A number of horse racing, golf, and boxing fixtures have also been called off. Large-scale strike actions planned for next week were immediately cancelled following the Queen's death, and the Trades Union Congress said it was postponing its annual conference in Brighton this weekend out of respect. On the day of the state funeral, government guidance suggests organisers of sporting fixtures or pre-planned events may wish to adjust timings to avoid clashing with the service or processions.

"We've been sharing your tributes to Queen Elizabeth II following her death aged 96 You've told us what she meant to you, moments you remember from her life and your stories of meeting the UK's longest-reigning monarch On Monday, the nation paid a final farewell to the Queen, with a state funeral and military procession Our tributes page has been a reminder that hundreds of thousands of us felt a personal connection with the Queen, says BBC Media and Arts Correspondent David Sillito ""She made you feel as if you were important at that moment in her life,"" says Simone Kennett, who was head teacher of a school when it was visited by the Queen We'll be preserving this page so people in the UK and around the world can continue to read the tributes so many of you have left for the Queen Deborah TurnessCEO, BBC News and Current Affairs As the Chief Executive of BBC News I
have the honour to write the closing message on this page of thousands of
tributes to Queen Elizabeth II. And itâs a message of thanks to every single
person who has taken the time to share their story. When the death of Queen Elizabeth was
announced, we at the BBC wanted to create a place where people could come
together to share their tributes, their photos and recollections. The
response has been incredible. We have received thousands of touching stories of
meeting the Queen, special moments, memories and messages of condolence. Thank you to everyone - from all
over the world - for coming together here in this virtual space for very real
acts a of remembrance. Looking at the contributions, the
common theme that emerges is that the Queen had a way of making each person she
met feel like the most important person in that moment. Thank you again for helping us remember
a woman whose promise to serve her people was fulfilled through a life of duty,
which touched so many people. Over the past 10 days, we've been asking you to share your memories of seeing and meeting Queen Elizabeth II or to send in your personal tributes. Thousands of people have sent their own messages of condolence. ""The stories speak to how many people felt a personal connection to Her Majesty,"" says BBC Media and Arts Correspondent David Sillito. ""It reminds us that, while the official record of the life of the Queen will be a series of great moments of national pageantry, those were rare special occasions. ""Her life was much more about handshakes, birthday cards and meeting ordinary, but often remarkable, people. ""No-one forgets a conversation with the Queen. And our tributes page has been a little reminder that for hundreds of thousands of us, the Queen was more than a distant figure in a palace. She was someone with whom they felt a personal connection."" You can read more from David on the tributes here. Sibella Laing went to Cambridge University with King Charles III, has known the Royal Family since she was a child and has met the Queen. She was, is, and always has been, incredibly kind to everybody, always anxious to put people at their ease, always anxious to make you feel you are the only person in the room.  Iâm sure this huge support across the country that Charles must have been seeing will have been really inspirational and uplifting for him. He has had the Queen as a wonderful role model all his life and I think in a sense his whole life has been preparation for this, so I think he is ready for it."" Sibella Laing Dinkie Flowers in the queue to pay her respects to Queen Elizabeth II in Westminster Hall Dinkie Flowers (nee Stapleton), aged 101, queued for several hours on Saturday to pay her respects to Queen Elizabeth II.

Dinkie entertained other members of the public in the queue with some of her memorabilia including the card from Her Majesty for her 100th birthday in 2021.

Queen Elizabeth with the Duke of Edinburgh at a lodge in Kenya In January 1952, Princess Elizabeth and her husband the Duke of Edinburgh set off on an overseas tour in place of the monarch, who was terminally ill with lung cancer. Against medical advice, the King went to the airport to see the couple off. It was to be the last time Elizabeth, then just 25 years old, would see her father. She heard the news of his death while staying at a game lodge in Kenya and immediately returned to London as the Queen. She later recalled: ""In a way, I didn't have an apprenticeship. My father died much too young, so it was all a very sudden kind of taking on and making the best job you can.â Queen Elizabeth II returns to England Welsh politicians will be recalled to the Senedd - the Welsh
Parliament - on Sunday to pay tribute to Queen Elizabeth II. The session, in Cardiff Bay, will take place at 14:00 BST and
all other business will be suspended until after the state funeral. Amotion of condolence will express the Seneddâs ""deep sadness at the death of Her Majesty The Queen"". The Queen officially opened the Senedd building in 2006 and last
visited in 2021 to open its sixth session.

""One of the reasons we got them was because the Queen had them,"" she said, pushing a pram with two corgis patiently sitting inside. The Queen was known for her love of corgis dating back to when she was a child, and kept dozens of them over the course of her 70-year reign. Read more abouthow the Queen's love of corgis started a global phenomenon On Saturday, Windsor Castle became the site of a rare joint appearance by the new Prince of Wales, William, with his brother Prince Harry, and their wives. It is a building that had deep significance to the monarch throughout her life - a place of work but also her own private retreat. The Queen's special association with Windsor Castle began when she was a child. 
The then-Princess Elizabeth and her family made Royal Lodge - a mansion in the grounds of the Windsor Estate - their weekend country home. The first instinct of many mourning the death of Queen Elizabeth II has been to leave flowers at Windsor Castle.  At the age of 14, the then-princess and her sister Margaret were sent to the castle for much of World War Two while their home in London faced the threat of being bombed. The castle has been inhabited continuously by 40 monarchs across almost 1,000 years. With 1,000 rooms, 13 acres (five hectares) of grounds and reminders of its rich history amid the gothic architecture, it is little wonder the Queen saw the castle as a sanctuary.

From world leaders to members of the public, people reflected on Her Majesty's legacy. Tributes for the Queen have poured in from statesmen around the world, and on Saturday, the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was the latest to issue his  condolences. On Twitter, Blinken posted a photo from the US embassy in Washington, thanking the Queen for her ""steadfast leadership"" and ""unwavering commitment to service"". Dame Karen Pierce, the UK ambassador to the US, thanked Blinken for the message, calling the Queen ""our foremost diplomat"" and ""active supporter"" of the two countries' ""special relationship"" - a phrase that had been coined by her first prime minister, Churchill.

Katty KayUS special correspondent Queen Elizabeth and Ronald Reagan ride horses in Windsor Home Park in 1982 US presidents wield hard power. They control the
biggest military in the world and its richest country. Yet,
one after one, they would walk into Buckingham Palace and go jelly-kneed. This
diminutive woman reduced powerful presidents to grinning school boys. She traded scone recipes with Dwight Eisenhower, danced
with Gerald Ford and rode with Ronald Reagan. Somehow she managed to find a way to
connect with each of them, not just as a fellow head of state, but as a person. The one president who, according to someone who worked
for him, didn't go into his first meeting with the Queen already star struck
was Barack Obama. Apparently he rather resisted the ""hype,"" as
this staffer put it. But then he met her. And, like the 11 presidents
before him, he, too, was won over. Indeed, the two developed such a good
relationship that the Queen reportedly asked him to come and visit even after
he left office. I'm told that what changed the 44th president's view was her
sense of responsibility and duty - she was, in Obama language, a no-drama
Queen. US presidents often have a keen sense of history and all those years on the throne wasn't lost on them. As a long day draws to a close in the UK, let's look back at what happened today: Charles III was proclaimed kingby the Accession Council in a ceremony at St James's Palace in London.Read more here. In Balmoral, three of the Queen's children -Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward -attended a church service along with other members of the royal family, and stopped to greet well-wishers outside the gates of Balmoral. Details of the Queen's funeral were announced- it will take place at 11am on Monday, 19 September at Westminster Abbey.Get more details here. Prince William, the new Prince of Wales,paid tribute to Queen Elizabeth saying his grandmother had been at his side on both his happiest and saddest days.Read what he said here. King Charlesheld audiences with ministers and met opposition politicians at Buckingham Palace. Princes Harry and William, joined by their wives,delighted crowds as they went for a walkabout in Windsor, collecting floral tributes and meeting some of those who turned out to pay their respects.Watch the moment here. The Queen was a big part of the community in the village near Balmoral, says the church minister Balmoral, the Scottish castle where the Queen died, was the place where she ""enjoyed being normal"", according to royal historian Robert Lacey, So it's no surprise thatpeople in the nearby village of Ballater remember her with special affection. ""She was not just our Queen, she was a neighbour - and a big part of this community,"" says Rev David Barr at Glenmuick Church in the village. Alistair Cassie, who runs a hardware shop in Ballater and has a royal warrant for supplying Balmoral with its televisions, remembered being called to the castle to fix interference with the radio. The Royal Banner of Scotland flies at half-mast at Balmoral Castle ""I was walking along this corridor, and who did I meet but the Queen,"" he says. They chatted about her appreciation for the BBC Radio 2 presenter Jimmy Young. The sprawling Balmoral Estate includes dozens of houses, many occupied by estate staff, and Cassie says at times the Queen would appear unannounced at someone's home, asking: ""How are you doing?"" Grant Harrold, a former butler to King Charles when he was Prince of Wales, says the Queen and Prince Philip would sometimes stay at a small cottage on the estate. He says: ""From what I was told - I never witnessed it - she would be in the kitchen cooking away and he would lay the table, so it was very much a chance for them to be a normal couple."" Alistair Cassie met the Queen on a formal visit - and unexpectedly in the corridor of the castle Crowds continued to form at Buckingham Palace on Saturday night as people paid tribute to the Queen Many took photos at the gates, where flowers have been left in memory of the monarch Six-year-old Penelope is among the people to have left tributes for the Queen near the palace As the nation continues to mourn the death of Queen Elizabeth II, here's what we know about the plans for tomorrow:  Sean CoughlanBBC News, royal correspondent Headline writers will be thinking about ""Brothers in arms"" or maybe ""Brothers in grief"" for their coverage. The sight of Princes William and Harry meeting the crowds together will become one of the stand-out and most unexpected images from what have been sombre days. With their wives, Catherine and Meghan, they greeted people in Windsor, in a way that couldn't have been predicted last week, when the Sussexes returned to the UK. The talk then was of feuds and unbridgeable differences between couples. They were said to be staying in houses close together on the Windsor estate, while emotionally many miles apart. The couple hadn't been seen together in public for more than two years. That all changed on Thursday. If William and Harry were not planning to see each other, they were brought together in ways that couldn't have been predicted. Read the full piece here King Charles III paid tribute to the Queen and spoke of the ""irreparable loss we've all suffered"" as he was formally declared monarch William, Catherine, Harry and Meghan appeared together outside Windsor Castle The group spent time greeting people and looking at tributes to the Queen Lady Louise Windsor, Princess Beatrice of York, and Sophie, Countess of Wessex, looked at tributes to the Queen in Scotland You can view the full gallery here. Chi Chi IzunduReporting from Washington DC A
small group of people were making their way to the British Embassy in
Washington DC to lay flowers and read some of the messages that people had
left. Dignitaries
are expected to continue to make their way to the embassy and pay their
respects. Wanita Harris-Wise was
carrying a small bunch of flowers and wanted to go and show her respects to the
monarch. âQueen Elizabeth was all we
knew growing up. Iâm 64 years of age and when you thought of the Queen thatâs
who the Queen was. We call our children princesses. We want our children to
grow up to be in that same honour in light of the Queen.â Wanita left a small bunch of flowers in memory of the Queen Eloise AlannaReporting from Ottawa, Canada Itâs been a very hot day
     here in the capital of Canada, Ottawa. Justin Trudeau and his
     son walked slowly up to Rideau Hall, the residency of the Governor
     General, Mary Simon - she is the representative of the monarch in Canada
     and the first indigenous person to hold that position. Itâs a quiet residency
     just out of town. Wild turkeys walk around the grounds and among the
     trees, some of which have been planted by royals. There are 14
     commonwealth realms in addition to the UK. A realm is a country whose
     monarch is the King. Canada is one of the realms and today, like in the
     UK, there was an official proclamation of the King. Trumpets sounded, the
     doors opened and the Chief Herald walked out of Rideau Hall to announce
     the King of Canada. Firstly in English and then in French, with Trudeau at
     his side, Samy Khalid, proclaimed His Royal Highness Prince Charles III,
     King. Cannon shots were fired,
     flags were raised and Guardsmen marched among the small crowd that had
     gathered.  Tributes for Queen Elizabeth II are continuing to pour in from around the world. Oliver Atkin from Bromley says he remembers meeting the monarch on the Balmoral estate in 2012 while on a family day out. She ""walked straight up to us and said hello. I remember my Mum and Dad introducing us all. She asked where we were going and took time to find out where we were from,"" he recalls. Yasmine Jamil says she ""couldn't have enough"" of stories about the Queen when she was growing up in Pakistan, and that the monarch's death felt like ""losing a dear family member"". Jimmy Staveley from Carmarthenshire in Wales tells us that he has always admired the monarch and received five letters from her after writing to her a number of times.

Jimmy Staveley holds up a letter from the Queen Jo CouzensReporting from Windsor Castle SJ and Julia were among the crowd at Windsor Castle Sukhjit Johal (SJ) travelled from her home in Coventry to
Windsor Castle today to pay her respects to the Queen. Just feet away when Kate, William, Harry and Meghan came
to speak to the crowd, she was disappointed not to get the chance to talk to
them. âBut honestly it was amazing to see them. Kate was bending to see all the children, if she heard
anyone say her name she would turn around and try to talk to them - like
the Queen did,"" she said. âThey really seem to understand the nation has lost the
Queen too - theyâre allowing us to grieve with them.â Julia from London was also close enough to catch a glimpse of the royals but didnât manage to speak to them. âThis morning on TV William looked very sombre
but now he was smiling. I could see Harry on the other side and he was reaching up high, trying to reach as many hands as possible,"" she said. Read more from about the scene in Windsor here.

"We've been sharing your tributes to Queen Elizabeth II following her death aged 96 You've told us what she meant to you, moments you remember from her life and your stories of meeting the UK's longest-reigning monarch On Monday, the nation paid a final farewell to the Queen, with a state funeral and military procession Our tributes page has been a reminder that hundreds of thousands of us felt a personal connection with the Queen, says BBC Media and Arts Correspondent David Sillito ""She made you feel as if you were important at that moment in her life,"" says Simone Kennett, who was head teacher of a school when it was visited by the Queen We'll be preserving this page so people in the UK and around the world can continue to read the tributes so many of you have left for the Queen Deborah TurnessCEO, BBC News and Current Affairs As the Chief Executive of BBC News I
have the honour to write the closing message on this page of thousands of
tributes to Queen Elizabeth II. And itâs a message of thanks to every single
person who has taken the time to share their story. When the death of Queen Elizabeth was
announced, we at the BBC wanted to create a place where people could come
together to share their tributes, their photos and recollections. The
response has been incredible. We have received thousands of touching stories of
meeting the Queen, special moments, memories and messages of condolence. Thank you to everyone - from all
over the world - for coming together here in this virtual space for very real
acts a of remembrance. Looking at the contributions, the
common theme that emerges is that the Queen had a way of making each person she
met feel like the most important person in that moment. Thank you again for helping us remember
a woman whose promise to serve her people was fulfilled through a life of duty,
which touched so many people. Over the past 10 days, we've been asking you to share your memories of seeing and meeting Queen Elizabeth II or to send in your personal tributes. Thousands of people have sent their own messages of condolence. ""The stories speak to how many people felt a personal connection to Her Majesty,"" says BBC Media and Arts Correspondent David Sillito. ""It reminds us that, while the official record of the life of the Queen will be a series of great moments of national pageantry, those were rare special occasions. ""Her life was much more about handshakes, birthday cards and meeting ordinary, but often remarkable, people. ""No-one forgets a conversation with the Queen. And our tributes page has been a little reminder that for hundreds of thousands of us, the Queen was more than a distant figure in a palace. She was someone with whom they felt a personal connection."" You can read more from David on the tributes here. Sibella Laing went to Cambridge University with King Charles III, has known the Royal Family since she was a child and has met the Queen. She was, is, and always has been, incredibly kind to everybody, always anxious to put people at their ease, always anxious to make you feel you are the only person in the room.  Iâm sure this huge support across the country that Charles must have been seeing will have been really inspirational and uplifting for him. He has had the Queen as a wonderful role model all his life and I think in a sense his whole life has been preparation for this, so I think he is ready for it."" Sibella Laing Dinkie Flowers in the queue to pay her respects to Queen Elizabeth II in Westminster Hall Dinkie Flowers (nee Stapleton), aged 101, queued for several hours on Saturday to pay her respects to Queen Elizabeth II. Dinkie, who lives in Shoreham-by-Sea is holding a letter she received from Buckingham Palace 70 years ago thanking her for her performance in the Celebrity Ice Show at Queens Ice Dance Club on 30 April 1952. Dinkie entertained other members of the public in the queue with some of her memorabilia including the card from Her Majesty for her 100th birthday in 2021. Lesley Tomlinson, Dinkie's hairdresser In Ghana students at Legon Hills International School paid tribute to her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on the day of her funeral. The school held a special assembly reflecting her long reign. Pupils also wrote heartfelt condolence messages, while the little ones watched the Paddington film. Akua Agyemang, Founder of Legon Hills Internatonal School, Ghana The children wrote messages of farewell to the Queen Marie came to Windsor for the Queen's funeral with her friend Lee Stabler Marie Wood, 56, lived in Windsor for eight years when she was training to be a nurse and saw the Queen one day while out for a walk. Marie came to Windsor for the Queen's funeral on Monday, watching the procession from the Long Walk. I was walking in Great Park and she drove her Land Rover further up. I was just gobsmacked.  We always felt that she belonged here. This was her home. I am glad that she is in Windsor now, this was her favourite place. She will be missed."" Marie Wood Frances came from Italy to leave a portrait of the Queen drawn by her son Alex I have been living in Italy for the last 22 years. My son, Alex (13) drew this portrait of the Queen and I asked him if he wanted me to take it to London so I could leave it as a tribute for the Queen. He said yes.  On Saturday I got on a plane from Verona to come especially to leave the portrait before the funeral. Yesterday I took the 5.20am train from Havant to London and I left his portrait in Green Park. The policemen were very kind to take it for me as the park had already closed for laying flowers."" Frances King Simone Kennett was head teacher of Jersey College for Girls when the Queen visited to open a new building in 2001. The Queen said we had a beautiful school and that she had really enjoyed this visit. She made you feel as if you were important at that moment in her life. The students did the college proud and it was a successful visit.  We also had a light-hearted moment during the her visit. The Queen stamped her foot on the school's front terrace and said: 'This is hollow.' I said, 'Yes, Your Majesty, and if Your Majesty continues to bounce up and down she will find herself sitting in Home Economics,' and she absolutely roared with laughter!"" Simone Kennett, Former head of Jersey College for Girls Glyn Sherman, from Coventry, was serving in the Royal Horse Artillery in 1984 when as a guard of honour he met the Queen at a birthday parade. When she came along I said 'all right, Liz'? The top brass went to come down and she put her hand up to stop them, so I was lucky. I felt bad about it but had to explain to her that I've got a daughter called Elizabeth and it just came out like that.  She turned around and said 'I like to be unofficial sometimes'. It was brilliant. The memory will never go out of me.  Her death has left me heartbroken. I don't look at her as being Her Majesty. We call her our boss. Glyn Sherman I was born in 1926, a Londoner, and saw the Queen on the balcony with her parents on the day her father was crowned George VI. That memory is still very vivid in my mind. Beryl Smith Alicia Finn-OâShea, who is 10, met the Queen as a four-month-old baby. The family were so impressed by that encounter they named Alicia's little sister Elizabeth. She's now aged seven and prefers to be called Eliza, but they came to the Mall on Monday to watch the funeral procession with their mum Claire. It was really magical and amazing but also upsetting. The nice thought is the Queen is having marmalade sandwiches and tea with her family in heaven."" Alicia Finn-OâShea We arrived early from Birmingham to secure our place opposite Buckingham Palace gates to bid farewell to Her Majesty. We are really tired today but so happy we made it. It was an absolutely amazing day."" Claire Finn-O'Shea I used to make cakes and pastries for Her Majesty when I worked at Buckingham Palace from 2001 to 2002 and Sandringham from 2005 to 2006. I got really lucky. I did a modern apprenticeship under the patronage of the now King Charles III... On my days off I went and worked at Buckingham Palace two days a week. Over time I ended up working in the pastry kitchen and had the privilege of making some of the cakes and pastries that used to go out to the Queen during her teatime.  When I heard the news of the Queen's death I stepped outside for a good 10 minutes and really cried, I needed to get away from everyone. There are no Brits near me [in America] and so it's more of a challenge for people to understand what's going on.  It feels like more of a part of you has gone rather than a parent or relative. It feels a little bit of your identity has been lost. Kieron Hales Peter John Wailes, who served in the RAF for 25 years, met the Queen many times and headed to Windsor on the day of her funeral to pay his respects. The 63-year-old recalls how once at Buckingham Palace during a VJ Day parade the Queen noticed a veteran was struggling in the heat and ordered an officer to get them some water. âShe was fantastic and in charge of everything,â he says. Iâm here to pay respects to my ex-boss, I feel great respect for her and want to say thanks for everything - I enjoyed working for her and meeting her.â Peter John Wailes Paul Hayden and his sister handing flowers to the Queen during her visit to Essex My memory is a rather distant one: I think I was about five, and the Queen visited the Essex county show. I was photographed handing a bouquet of flowers to the Queen with my younger sister. Prince Phillip stood alongside the Queen. The photo ended up on the front page of the local newspaper and a framed photo was proudly displayed by my parents in their hallway for at least 20 years.  You can imagine the enjoyment all my friends (and my sister) have had over the years making fun of their once angelic mate and his little sister giving flowers to the Queen but I must admit to being rather proud of the occasion, particularly now.  Rest in Peace HRH Queen Elizabeth II."" Paul Hayden The Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell shared a jigsaw puzzle and watched TV with the Queen at Sandringham. It was a great privilege to be alongside her. We sat down after dinner and did a jigsaw and the television was on.  It's a bereavement, and with every bereavement there is shock, there is loss but there is also thankfulness for a life lived well. A life of astonishing service. She was a person of simple but profound faith, and it was that faith that shaped her."" Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell Raven Harlow Aspenwood is severely visually impaired and has channeled her grief into her portrait of the young Queen Elizabeth II I am registered severely visually impaired, but I felt compelled to do something to channel my overwhelming and surprising level of grief following the sad passing of HRH, Queen Elizabeth II. I think my strongest memory of the queen is how comforting her presence has been during every stage of my 28 years of life, when something difficult has happened she has comforted us with her words, when something wonderful has happened she has filled our hearts with joy, with her wonderful smile and calming presence. She has been the grandmother of our nation, the matriarch we all need in times of hardship and times of joy. Her dignity, strength and consistency has been a great comfort and I thank her for her seventy years of steadfast service. Raven Harlow Aspenwood from East Yorkshire What a smile. She could lift a room with that wonderful smile and that genuine interest that she has in the people of this country."" Warwickshire County Council Leader, Izzi Seccombe I do remember her smile, I experienced that myself. It not only lit up a room, it lit up a nation - and she had the capacity to make us smile too."" Bishop of Coventry, Reverend Christopher Cocksworth Zara Umar gave flowers to the Queen in 2002 My daughter Zara and I went down to the City Square in Dundee to see the Queen in 2002. We waited for a long time. Soon the time came and the Queen was walking towards us. She was about five or six steps away from us when one of her security personnel guided the Queen away to the car to leave. Zara was so disappointed and my heart sank. Just then a plain clothes man came and asked me if he could lift Zara over the barrier. Much to my delight, Zara presented the flowers to the Queen and said 'here you are then, take your flowers.' I couldnt believe it! The Queen must have found it funny though and watched Zara return to me with a big smile on her face. I will treasure this memory forever."" Ishrat Umar, Dundee Three army veterans from Worcestershire pay tribute to the Queen... She was our head, she was our leader, she was the person we were serving and she's the one that we would follow. It hits you, it hits your heart."" Eric Braithwaite, who served for 23 years with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers Everyone called her the boss in one way or another. I've actually guarded the Queen and Prince Philip on other duties. A big lump in the throat, lost the boss, getting a new one."" Dave Sandy, who served in the territorial army from the late 1970s until the 1990s I've done a lot of parades for the Queen, she was a lovely lady and worked so hard for the country. I was in tears, I will be honest. It was an honour to be with her and be a soldier for her."" Anthony Goodway, who spent two years in national service from 1958 until 1960 I met the Queen when she visited the Isle of Skye as part of her Golden Jubilee tour. As a nurse then at the local care home, myself and other staff members were invited to bring some of our residents to meet Her Majesty. The great day came, our ladies looking beautiful, wheelchairs polished. One of our residents had worked at the palace as a younger woman and had photos of the Queen all around her room in the care home, so, if any one was to be there that day, it was her.  As the Queen approached our little group that day she asked me: âAre these the ladies from the care home?' I replied in the positive and then said this resident had worked in the palace. The Queen looked down a little and asked her: âWhen did you work at the palace?â To which, the lady looked up and and replied, in a rather gruff voice: âAnd who are you?â What a moment. I apologised. The Queen just smiled and moved on.  I was quite overwhelmed, I donât have photos of the Queen all over the house, but Iâve always respected her, especially as a Christian woman. She had a real true faith, so meeting her was very special. I didnât expect to be so overcome by the moment. Her demeanour was that of interest and she handled the situation really well. She left us all feeling very special and honoured. Barbara Matheson from Glasgow Barbara Matheson has recalled the moment she met the Queen during Her Majesty's Golden Jubilee tour Â© 2025 BBC.

I was photographed handing a bouquet of flowers to the Queen with my younger sister. Prince Phillip stood alongside the Queen. The photo ended up on the front page of the local newspaper and a framed photo was proudly displayed by my parents in their hallway for at least 20 years.  You can imagine the enjoyment all my friends (and my sister) have had over the years making fun of their once angelic mate and his little sister giving flowers to the Queen but I must admit to being rather proud of the occasion, particularly now.  Rest in Peace HRH Queen Elizabeth II."" Paul Hayden The Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell shared a jigsaw puzzle and watched TV with the Queen at Sandringham. It was a great privilege to be alongside her. We sat down after dinner and did a jigsaw and the television was on.  It's a bereavement, and with every bereavement there is shock, there is loss but there is also thankfulness for a life lived well. A life of astonishing service. She was a person of simple but profound faith, and it was that faith that shaped her."" Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell Raven Harlow Aspenwood is severely visually impaired and has channeled her grief into her portrait of the young Queen Elizabeth II I am registered severely visually impaired, but I felt compelled to do something to channel my overwhelming and surprising level of grief following the sad passing of HRH, Queen Elizabeth II. I think my strongest memory of the queen is how comforting her presence has been during every stage of my 28 years of life, when something difficult has happened she has comforted us with her words, when something wonderful has happened she has filled our hearts with joy, with her wonderful smile and calming presence. She has been the grandmother of our nation, the matriarch we all need in times of hardship and times of joy. Her dignity, strength and consistency has been a great comfort and I thank her for her seventy years of steadfast service. Raven Harlow Aspenwood from East Yorkshire What a smile. She could lift a room with that wonderful smile and that genuine interest that she has in the people of this country."" Warwickshire County Council Leader, Izzi Seccombe I do remember her smile, I experienced that myself. It not only lit up a room, it lit up a nation - and she had the capacity to make us smile too."" Bishop of Coventry, Reverend Christopher Cocksworth Zara Umar gave flowers to the Queen in 2002 My daughter Zara and I went down to the City Square in Dundee to see the Queen in 2002. We waited for a long time. Soon the time came and the Queen was walking towards us. She was about five or six steps away from us when one of her security personnel guided the Queen away to the car to leave. Zara was so disappointed and my heart sank. Just then a plain clothes man came and asked me if he could lift Zara over the barrier. Much to my delight, Zara presented the flowers to the Queen and said 'here you are then, take your flowers.' I couldnt believe it! The Queen must have found it funny though and watched Zara return to me with a big smile on her face. I will treasure this memory forever."" Ishrat Umar, Dundee Three army veterans from Worcestershire pay tribute to the Queen... She was our head, she was our leader, she was the person we were serving and she's the one that we would follow. It hits you, it hits your heart."" Eric Braithwaite, who served for 23 years with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers Everyone called her the boss in one way or another. I've actually guarded the Queen and Prince Philip on other duties. A big lump in the throat, lost the boss, getting a new one."" Dave Sandy, who served in the territorial army from the late 1970s until the 1990s I've done a lot of parades for the Queen, she was a lovely lady and worked so hard for the country. I was in tears, I will be honest. It was an honour to be with her and be a soldier for her."" Anthony Goodway, who spent two years in national service from 1958 until 1960 I met the Queen when she visited the Isle of Skye as part of her Golden Jubilee tour. As a nurse then at the local care home, myself and other staff members were invited to bring some of our residents to meet Her Majesty. The great day came, our ladies looking beautiful, wheelchairs polished. One of our residents had worked at the palace as a younger woman and had photos of the Queen all around her room in the care home, so, if any one was to be there that day, it was her.  As the Queen approached our little group that day she asked me: âAre these the ladies from the care home?' I replied in the positive and then said this resident had worked in the palace. The Queen looked down a little and asked her: âWhen did you work at the palace?â To which, the lady looked up and and replied, in a rather gruff voice: âAnd who are you?â What a moment. I apologised. The Queen just smiled and moved on.  I was quite overwhelmed, I donât have photos of the Queen all over the house, but Iâve always respected her, especially as a Christian woman. She had a real true faith, so meeting her was very special. I didnât expect to be so overcome by the moment. Her demeanour was that of interest and she handled the situation really well.

"This video can not be played Watch: Tears and laughter as MPs and peers pay tribute to Queen Elizabeth II Politicians from both Houses of Parliament have gathered to mark the death of Queen Elizabeth II and share their memories of the late monarch. Prime Minister Liz Truss described the Queen as one of the world's greatest-ever leaders, as she opened two days of special tributes in Parliament. MPs and ex-PMs paid their respects in personal speeches that aroused both tears and laughter in emotional scenes. A minute's silence was held to remember the Queen after 70 years on the throne. Both Houses of Parliament are sitting on Friday and Saturday to allow politicians to pay tribute to the Queen, following her death on Thursday. Follow the latest developments A life well lived - King pays tribute to his mother Former prime ministers reflect on Queen's reign Obituary: A long life marked by a sense of duty Friday's proceedings in Parliament paused at 18:00 BST for MPs and peers to watch the new king, Charles III, deliver a televised address to the nation, his first as monarch. Earlier, King Charles III was greeted by crowds singing ""God save the king"" outside Buckingham Palace, where he held his first in-person audience with Ms Truss. On Saturday, Ms Truss and senior ministers will attend the Accession Council at St James's Palace, where Charles will be formally proclaimed king. In Parliament on Friday, MPs and peers from all sides, dressed in dark clothing, paid tribute to the Queen by sharing memories of their own encounters with her. There have been many anecdotes about the Queen's wisdom, sense of humour and ability to put people at their ease. Some MPs laughed uproariously as former Prime Minister Theresa May recalled how mortified she was when the Queen caught her returning a dropped piece of cheese to a plate, as she helped prepare a picnic at Balmoral. ""I looked at her. She looked at me. And she just smiled. And the cheese remained on the table."" But the session began in solemn fashion, as Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle invited a packed Commons chamber to rise and observe a minute's silence. MPs stood for a minute's silence as they gathered for tributes to the Queen As the silence ended, Sir Lindsay described the Queen as a ""devoted monarch"" who had seen 57 complete sessions of Parliament during her reign in a brief speech. Ms Truss, who was appointed prime minister by the Queen just three days ago at Balmoral, paid tribute to her ""sheer humanity"", which she said had made her ""loved and admired"" all over the world. She said her reign had been ""dignified but not distant"" and credited her with re-inventing the British monarchy for the modern age. The Queen's successor, her eldest son King Charles III, now carried the ""awesome responsibility"" of the British crown, added the prime minister. ""The crown endures. Our nation endures. And in that spirit, I say God save the King."" Cheers of approval erupted from MPs, with some shouting ""God save the King"" from the side gallery in the moments after Ms Truss's speech concluded. This video can not be played Liz Truss: Queen 'one of the greatest leaders the world has known' Next to speak was the leader of the Opposition, Labour MP Sir Keir Starmer, who reflected on the tumultuous political events of recent times and the extraordinary national change heralded by the Queen's death. ""When everything is spinning, a nation requires a still point, when times are difficult, it requires comfort, and when direction is hard to find, it requires leadership,"" Sir Keir said. ""The loss of our Queen robs this country of its stillest point, its greatest comfort, at precisely the time we need those things most."" He said the Queen had enjoyed a ""personal relationship with us all"", based on ""total commitment"" to duty and a ""deep devotion to the country, the Commonwealth, and the people she loved"". This video can not be played Watch: Sir Keir Starmer pays tribute to the Queen Boris Johnson - who offered the Queen his resignation as prime minister at Balmoral on Tuesday - reflected on that meeting, saying the late monarch ""was as radiant and as knowledgeable and as fascinated by politics as ever I can remember"". Praising the late monarch as ""Elizabeth the Great"", he recalled her ""humility"" and, like other former leaders, spoke of informal gatherings with the Royal Family, at Balmoral. ""Unlike us politicians, with our outriders and our armour-plated convoys, I can tell you as a direct eyewitness that she drove herself in her own car with no detectives and no bodyguard, bouncing at alarming speed over the Scottish landscape to the total amazement of the ramblers and the tourists we encountered."" Mrs May described her weekly prime ministerial meetings with the Queen as ""a conversation with a woman of experience and knowledge and immense wisdom"". ""They were also the one meeting I went to, which I knew it would not be briefed out to the media,"" Mrs May said, to laughter from MPs. Harriet Harman, who is known as Mother of the House, told MPs about the Queen's kindness after she lost her senior government role in 1998. ""My diary was empty, and my phone stopped ringing. My office was astonished to get a call from Buckingham Palace. No one else wanted to have anything to do with me, but the Queen wanted to see me. ""I was invited to take tea with the Queen for her to thank me for my service as secretary of state."" This video can not be played Theresa May shares an amusing story about how down-to-earth the Queen was SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford used his speech to draw attention to the Queen's well-known affection for Scotland, where she spent her final days at Balmoral Castle. ""The relationship between Scotland and the Queen was one of shared admiration,"" Mr Blackford said. ""Indeed, whilst she was everyone's Queen, for many in Scotland, she was Elizabeth, Queen of Scots."" Former Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett said she was one of the few MPs to remember the Queen's coronation in 1953. The veteran Labour MP shared fond memories of the Queen's sense of fun, and choked back tears as she hailed ""a remarkable person, a remarkable monarch"". Meanwhile in the Lords, the newly appointed leader of Parliament's upper house, Lord True, led tributes to the Queen, calling her an ""anchor of stability in a changing world"". Ending his moving tribute, Lord True looked poignantly at the sovereign's throne, where the Queen had sat for numerous state openings of Parliament, and said: ""Thank you, Ma'am. May you ever rest in peace as you will ever rest in our hearts."" His words were followed by those of Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, who spoke of the Queen's ""profound sense of being called by God"" and her dry sense of humour. And former Labour cabinet minister Lord Blunkett recalled how the Queen came to his aid after he ended up facing the wrong way as he knelt during a royal audience. The blind peer said the Queen, in a ""careful and never patronising way"" managed to ""gently - by touching my arm - shift me round"". On Saturday evening, Parliament will be postponed until after 21 September, during a period of national mourning.

"We've been sharing your tributes to Queen Elizabeth II following her death aged 96 You've told us what she meant to you, moments you remember from her life and your stories of meeting the UK's longest-reigning monarch On Monday, the nation paid a final farewell to the Queen, with a state funeral and military procession Our tributes page has been a reminder that hundreds of thousands of us felt a personal connection with the Queen, says BBC Media and Arts Correspondent David Sillito ""She made you feel as if you were important at that moment in her life,"" says Simone Kennett, who was head teacher of a school when it was visited by the Queen We'll be preserving this page so people in the UK and around the world can continue to read the tributes so many of you have left for the Queen Deborah TurnessCEO, BBC News and Current Affairs As the Chief Executive of BBC News I
have the honour to write the closing message on this page of thousands of
tributes to Queen Elizabeth II. And itâs a message of thanks to every single
person who has taken the time to share their story. When the death of Queen Elizabeth was
announced, we at the BBC wanted to create a place where people could come
together to share their tributes, their photos and recollections. The
response has been incredible. We have received thousands of touching stories of
meeting the Queen, special moments, memories and messages of condolence. Thank you to everyone - from all
over the world - for coming together here in this virtual space for very real
acts a of remembrance. Looking at the contributions, the
common theme that emerges is that the Queen had a way of making each person she
met feel like the most important person in that moment. Thank you again for helping us remember
a woman whose promise to serve her people was fulfilled through a life of duty,
which touched so many people. Over the past 10 days, we've been asking you to share your memories of seeing and meeting Queen Elizabeth II or to send in your personal tributes. Thousands of people have sent their own messages of condolence. ""The stories speak to how many people felt a personal connection to Her Majesty,"" says BBC Media and Arts Correspondent David Sillito. ""It reminds us that, while the official record of the life of the Queen will be a series of great moments of national pageantry, those were rare special occasions. ""Her life was much more about handshakes, birthday cards and meeting ordinary, but often remarkable, people. ""No-one forgets a conversation with the Queen. And our tributes page has been a little reminder that for hundreds of thousands of us, the Queen was more than a distant figure in a palace. She was someone with whom they felt a personal connection."" You can read more from David on the tributes here. Sibella Laing went to Cambridge University with King Charles III, has known the Royal Family since she was a child and has met the Queen. She was, is, and always has been, incredibly kind to everybody, always anxious to put people at their ease, always anxious to make you feel you are the only person in the room.  Iâm sure this huge support across the country that Charles must have been seeing will have been really inspirational and uplifting for him. He has had the Queen as a wonderful role model all his life and I think in a sense his whole life has been preparation for this, so I think he is ready for it."" Sibella Laing Dinkie Flowers in the queue to pay her respects to Queen Elizabeth II in Westminster Hall Dinkie Flowers (nee Stapleton), aged 101, queued for several hours on Saturday to pay her respects to Queen Elizabeth II. Dinkie, who lives in Shoreham-by-Sea is holding a letter she received from Buckingham Palace 70 years ago thanking her for her performance in the Celebrity Ice Show at Queens Ice Dance Club on 30 April 1952. Dinkie entertained other members of the public in the queue with some of her memorabilia including the card from Her Majesty for her 100th birthday in 2021. Lesley Tomlinson, Dinkie's hairdresser In Ghana students at Legon Hills International School paid tribute to her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on the day of her funeral. The school held a special assembly reflecting her long reign. Pupils also wrote heartfelt condolence messages, while the little ones watched the Paddington film. Akua Agyemang, Founder of Legon Hills Internatonal School, Ghana The children wrote messages of farewell to the Queen Marie came to Windsor for the Queen's funeral with her friend Lee Stabler Marie Wood, 56, lived in Windsor for eight years when she was training to be a nurse and saw the Queen one day while out for a walk. Marie came to Windsor for the Queen's funeral on Monday, watching the procession from the Long Walk. I was walking in Great Park and she drove her Land Rover further up. I was just gobsmacked.  We always felt that she belonged here. This was her home. I am glad that she is in Windsor now, this was her favourite place. She will be missed."" Marie Wood Frances came from Italy to leave a portrait of the Queen drawn by her son Alex I have been living in Italy for the last 22 years. My son, Alex (13) drew this portrait of the Queen and I asked him if he wanted me to take it to London so I could leave it as a tribute for the Queen. He said yes.  On Saturday I got on a plane from Verona to come especially to leave the portrait before the funeral. Yesterday I took the 5.20am train from Havant to London and I left his portrait in Green Park. The policemen were very kind to take it for me as the park had already closed for laying flowers."" Frances King Simone Kennett was head teacher of Jersey College for Girls when the Queen visited to open a new building in 2001. The Queen said we had a beautiful school and that she had really enjoyed this visit. She made you feel as if you were important at that moment in her life. The students did the college proud and it was a successful visit.  We also had a light-hearted moment during the her visit. The Queen stamped her foot on the school's front terrace and said: 'This is hollow.' I said, 'Yes, Your Majesty, and if Your Majesty continues to bounce up and down she will find herself sitting in Home Economics,' and she absolutely roared with laughter!"" Simone Kennett, Former head of Jersey College for Girls Glyn Sherman, from Coventry, was serving in the Royal Horse Artillery in 1984 when as a guard of honour he met the Queen at a birthday parade. When she came along I said 'all right, Liz'? The top brass went to come down and she put her hand up to stop them, so I was lucky. I felt bad about it but had to explain to her that I've got a daughter called Elizabeth and it just came out like that.  She turned around and said 'I like to be unofficial sometimes'. It was brilliant. The memory will never go out of me.  Her death has left me heartbroken. I don't look at her as being Her Majesty. We call her our boss. Glyn Sherman I was born in 1926, a Londoner, and saw the Queen on the balcony with her parents on the day her father was crowned George VI. That memory is still very vivid in my mind. Beryl Smith Alicia Finn-OâShea, who is 10, met the Queen as a four-month-old baby. The family were so impressed by that encounter they named Alicia's little sister Elizabeth. She's now aged seven and prefers to be called Eliza, but they came to the Mall on Monday to watch the funeral procession with their mum Claire. It was really magical and amazing but also upsetting. The nice thought is the Queen is having marmalade sandwiches and tea with her family in heaven."" Alicia Finn-OâShea We arrived early from Birmingham to secure our place opposite Buckingham Palace gates to bid farewell to Her Majesty. We are really tired today but so happy we made it. It was an absolutely amazing day."" Claire Finn-O'Shea I used to make cakes and pastries for Her Majesty when I worked at Buckingham Palace from 2001 to 2002 and Sandringham from 2005 to 2006. I got really lucky. I did a modern apprenticeship under the patronage of the now King Charles III... On my days off I went and worked at Buckingham Palace two days a week. Over time I ended up working in the pastry kitchen and had the privilege of making some of the cakes and pastries that used to go out to the Queen during her teatime.  When I heard the news of the Queen's death I stepped outside for a good 10 minutes and really cried, I needed to get away from everyone. There are no Brits near me [in America] and so it's more of a challenge for people to understand what's going on.  It feels like more of a part of you has gone rather than a parent or relative. It feels a little bit of your identity has been lost. Kieron Hales Peter John Wailes, who served in the RAF for 25 years, met the Queen many times and headed to Windsor on the day of her funeral to pay his respects.

The Queen said we had a beautiful school and that she had really enjoyed this visit. She made you feel as if you were important at that moment in her life. The students did the college proud and it was a successful visit.  We also had a light-hearted moment during the her visit. The Queen stamped her foot on the school's front terrace and said: 'This is hollow.' I said, 'Yes, Your Majesty, and if Your Majesty continues to bounce up and down she will find herself sitting in Home Economics,' and she absolutely roared with laughter!"" Simone Kennett, Former head of Jersey College for Girls Glyn Sherman, from Coventry, was serving in the Royal Horse Artillery in 1984 when as a guard of honour he met the Queen at a birthday parade. When she came along I said 'all right, Liz'? The top brass went to come down and she put her hand up to stop them, so I was lucky. I felt bad about it but had to explain to her that I've got a daughter called Elizabeth and it just came out like that.  She turned around and said 'I like to be unofficial sometimes'. It was brilliant. The memory will never go out of me.  Her death has left me heartbroken. I don't look at her as being Her Majesty. We call her our boss. Glyn Sherman I was born in 1926, a Londoner, and saw the Queen on the balcony with her parents on the day her father was crowned George VI. That memory is still very vivid in my mind. Beryl Smith Alicia Finn-OâShea, who is 10, met the Queen as a four-month-old baby. The family were so impressed by that encounter they named Alicia's little sister Elizabeth. She's now aged seven and prefers to be called Eliza, but they came to the Mall on Monday to watch the funeral procession with their mum Claire. It was really magical and amazing but also upsetting. The nice thought is the Queen is having marmalade sandwiches and tea with her family in heaven."" Alicia Finn-OâShea We arrived early from Birmingham to secure our place opposite Buckingham Palace gates to bid farewell to Her Majesty. We are really tired today but so happy we made it. It was an absolutely amazing day."" Claire Finn-O'Shea I used to make cakes and pastries for Her Majesty when I worked at Buckingham Palace from 2001 to 2002 and Sandringham from 2005 to 2006. I got really lucky. I did a modern apprenticeship under the patronage of the now King Charles III... On my days off I went and worked at Buckingham Palace two days a week. Over time I ended up working in the pastry kitchen and had the privilege of making some of the cakes and pastries that used to go out to the Queen during her teatime.  When I heard the news of the Queen's death I stepped outside for a good 10 minutes and really cried, I needed to get away from everyone. There are no Brits near me [in America] and so it's more of a challenge for people to understand what's going on.  It feels like more of a part of you has gone rather than a parent or relative. It feels a little bit of your identity has been lost. Kieron Hales Peter John Wailes, who served in the RAF for 25 years, met the Queen many times and headed to Windsor on the day of her funeral to pay his respects. The 63-year-old recalls how once at Buckingham Palace during a VJ Day parade the Queen noticed a veteran was struggling in the heat and ordered an officer to get them some water. âShe was fantastic and in charge of everything,â he says. Iâm here to pay respects to my ex-boss, I feel great respect for her and want to say thanks for everything - I enjoyed working for her and meeting her.â Peter John Wailes Paul Hayden and his sister handing flowers to the Queen during her visit to Essex My memory is a rather distant one: I think I was about five, and the Queen visited the Essex county show. I was photographed handing a bouquet of flowers to the Queen with my younger sister. Prince Phillip stood alongside the Queen. The photo ended up on the front page of the local newspaper and a framed photo was proudly displayed by my parents in their hallway for at least 20 years.  You can imagine the enjoyment all my friends (and my sister) have had over the years making fun of their once angelic mate and his little sister giving flowers to the Queen but I must admit to being rather proud of the occasion, particularly now.  Rest in Peace HRH Queen Elizabeth II."" Paul Hayden The Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell shared a jigsaw puzzle and watched TV with the Queen at Sandringham. It was a great privilege to be alongside her. We sat down after dinner and did a jigsaw and the television was on.  It's a bereavement, and with every bereavement there is shock, there is loss but there is also thankfulness for a life lived well. A life of astonishing service. She was a person of simple but profound faith, and it was that faith that shaped her."" Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell Raven Harlow Aspenwood is severely visually impaired and has channeled her grief into her portrait of the young Queen Elizabeth II I am registered severely visually impaired, but I felt compelled to do something to channel my overwhelming and surprising level of grief following the sad passing of HRH, Queen Elizabeth II. I think my strongest memory of the queen is how comforting her presence has been during every stage of my 28 years of life, when something difficult has happened she has comforted us with her words, when something wonderful has happened she has filled our hearts with joy, with her wonderful smile and calming presence. She has been the grandmother of our nation, the matriarch we all need in times of hardship and times of joy. Her dignity, strength and consistency has been a great comfort and I thank her for her seventy years of steadfast service. Raven Harlow Aspenwood from East Yorkshire What a smile. She could lift a room with that wonderful smile and that genuine interest that she has in the people of this country."" Warwickshire County Council Leader, Izzi Seccombe I do remember her smile, I experienced that myself. It not only lit up a room, it lit up a nation - and she had the capacity to make us smile too."" Bishop of Coventry, Reverend Christopher Cocksworth Zara Umar gave flowers to the Queen in 2002 My daughter Zara and I went down to the City Square in Dundee to see the Queen in 2002. We waited for a long time. Soon the time came and the Queen was walking towards us. She was about five or six steps away from us when one of her security personnel guided the Queen away to the car to leave. Zara was so disappointed and my heart sank. Just then a plain clothes man came and asked me if he could lift Zara over the barrier. Much to my delight, Zara presented the flowers to the Queen and said 'here you are then, take your flowers.' I couldnt believe it! The Queen must have found it funny though and watched Zara return to me with a big smile on her face. I will treasure this memory forever."" Ishrat Umar, Dundee Three army veterans from Worcestershire pay tribute to the Queen... She was our head, she was our leader, she was the person we were serving and she's the one that we would follow. It hits you, it hits your heart."" Eric Braithwaite, who served for 23 years with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers Everyone called her the boss in one way or another. I've actually guarded the Queen and Prince Philip on other duties. A big lump in the throat, lost the boss, getting a new one."" Dave Sandy, who served in the territorial army from the late 1970s until the 1990s I've done a lot of parades for the Queen, she was a lovely lady and worked so hard for the country. I was in tears, I will be honest. It was an honour to be with her and be a soldier for her."" Anthony Goodway, who spent two years in national service from 1958 until 1960 I met the Queen when she visited the Isle of Skye as part of her Golden Jubilee tour. As a nurse then at the local care home, myself and other staff members were invited to bring some of our residents to meet Her Majesty. The great day came, our ladies looking beautiful, wheelchairs polished. One of our residents had worked at the palace as a younger woman and had photos of the Queen all around her room in the care home, so, if any one was to be there that day, it was her.  As the Queen approached our little group that day she asked me: âAre these the ladies from the care home?' I replied in the positive and then said this resident had worked in the palace. The Queen looked down a little and asked her: âWhen did you work at the palace?â To which, the lady looked up and and replied, in a rather gruff voice: âAnd who are you?â What a moment. I apologised. The Queen just smiled and moved on.  I was quite overwhelmed, I donât have photos of the Queen all over the house, but Iâve always respected her, especially as a Christian woman. She had a real true faith, so meeting her was very special. I didnât expect to be so overcome by the moment. Her demeanour was that of interest and she handled the situation really well. She left us all feeling very special and honoured. Barbara Matheson from Glasgow Barbara Matheson has recalled the moment she met the Queen during Her Majesty's Golden Jubilee tour Â© 2025 BBC.
