"RWE's gas power station in Pembrokeshire is one of the top emitters in the UK ""Genuine courage"" is needed to tackle climate change in Wales, which produces a fifth of the UK's industrial emissions, an economist has said. Thousands of Welsh jobs rely on Tata's steelworks in Port Talbot and RWE's gas power station in Pembrokeshire, the UK's top two emitters. Prof Calvin Jones said it was ""good news"" that a big difference can be made from a small number of industries. But he said people should accept not every industry will survive. The Cardiff University academic said: ""As a teenager in the valleys, we were absolutely clear that it was unconscionable that pits should close. ""The inability to have a plan B is writ large across the shuttered shops of Maerdy, and what I don't want is for the same thing to happen in Neyland, or Port Talbot, or Broughton."" What the COP26 climate summit could mean for us all Prince Charles: I understand climate activists' anger Thunberg: Scotland not world leader on climate change The Welsh government said net-zero targets may be different for each organisation, and it is working with each to help them reach their goals. Wales is among several nations who have pledgednet-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The UK will host the UN climate change conference, COP26, in Glasgow at the end of this month. RWE has committed to making its Pembrokeshire operation carbon neutral by 2040, replacing natural gas burning with offshore wind and schemes to store energy when there is no wind. But environmental campaign group Friends of the Earth Cymru said the climate emergency meant the plan for Welsh industry was ""decades too late"" to prevent catastrophic warming. Tata Steel, in Port Talbot, is one of the UK's top two emitters of climate-warming gases - the other is also in Wales BBC Wales analysis of official emissions data from 2019 shows major Welsh industries pumped out the equivalent of more than 23.5 million tonnes of climate-warming gases, 93% of which came from just 25 sites. The Welsh economy is more reliant on carbon-intensive industries than the other home nations. With just 4.73% of the UK population, companies in Wales produced 18.8% of all UK carbon emissions from major industries. RWE's gas-fired power station in Pembroke Dock, Valero's nearby oil refinery and the South Hook LNG terminal in Milford Haven produce a combined total of 7.9 million tonnes of climate-warming gases annually - a third of all carbon emissions from major industries in Wales. The UK's highest-emitting power station at Pembroke Dock pumped out more than 4.7 million tonnes of climate-warming gases in 2019. Operator RWE said it is also one of the most efficient gas-powered machines in Europe and is the ""best option"" if the UK is forced to burn fossil fuels to keep the lights on. Fleeing as Greek island burns Young people 'feel hopeless' on climate change Battle against 'historic' California wildfire Greta Thunberg calls out fashion brands on climate toll But the plant manager, Richard Little, said every year the plant shut down for longer periods as more wind power came online. He said the same trend happened right up to the closure of RWE'scoal-fired power station at Aberthawin 2019. RWE said it had ""huge ambitions"" to be a part of the UK's push to build40 gigawatts of floating offshore wind capacity, but said it was also looking into alternative measures such as battery storage, for periods of low wind. Mr Little said: ""RWE now directs more than 90% of its capital investment into renewables, hydrogen and battery storage. ""Our strategy is to build as fast as we can while we maintain plants such as Pembroke here in support of that bridge to renewable future."" Bleddyn Lake, of Friends of the Earth Cymru, said Wales was ""decades too late"" to prevent global warming Bleddyn Lake, of Friends of the Earth Cymru, has called on industry to match the public sector's goal to be net-zero by 2030 and said ""they need to up their game"". ""Science tells us that we absolutely need to act decisively by 2030, so the time frames they are looking at are way too far into the future."" Mr Little said shortening the timescale was technically feasible, ""but the sheer scale of what we need to build, 40 gigawatts, is like building the entire energy infrastructure of the UK again in floating wind in the next nine years"". He said stumbling blocks remained, including over planning permissions for offshore wind and a deal with the UK government on how it can get a return on the billions of pounds of investment needed. ""We are working closely with the UK government to try and generate a framework that can allow businesses such as ours to invest at the fastest possible rate,"" Mr Little added. A Welsh government spokesperson said carbon capture and storage technology, currently under development, may be more applicable to the small number of large, high-emitting sites in Wales. ""Due to economies of scale, large firms may generally be able to adopt new low-carbon technologies and new low-carbon processes quicker and at lower cost,"" the spokesperson said. ""There may also be challenges if low-carbon technologies take longer to be developed and rolled out in these key, high-emitting industries."" Prof Jones said Welsh ministers had limited influence on ""the big players in the carbon economy"" because they all had headquarters outside Wales. ""We could decide to twist our industrial policy to a certain direction to make it supportive of a transformation in these high-carbon industries,"" he added. ""And they may still close because global conditions might mean that investment in Wales is just simply irrational.""

"Klarna has over 15 million customers in the UK and was recently valued at $46.5bn Buy now, pay later firm Klarna is planning changes ahead of an expected Treasury crackdown on the UK market. They include a ""pay now"" option, to let people pay for items in full, immediately. The boom in the use of buy now, pay later has fuelled fears that it encourages people into debt. Klarna's boss, Sebastian Siemiatkowski, told the BBC that retailers using its service see the average value of an order increase by 40%. The company said it wanted to ""drive up standards"" in the sector by improving the way it operates and communicates as well as introducing the choice of paying for items in full, immediately. Klarna said the ""pay now"" option and other changes it was making would give customers more clarity and control. It also said it would perform more thorough checks on how much users could afford to borrow, and use clearer language during the checkout process to ensure customers understood they were taking on debt. The ""pay now"" option for customers is already available in several of the 20 other countries where Klarna operates. Buy Now Pay Later: 'I'm stressed over debt' Klarna better than costly credit cards, says boss Charities sound alarm over buy-now-pay-later debt Like other buy now, pay later services, Klarna offers shoppers the opportunity of delaying or spreading the cost of a purchase without being charged fees or interest. Instead Klarna charges retailers a small percentage of the transaction cost in exchange for providing the payment service. The opportunity to pay in instalments appeals in particular to younger and low-income shoppers. It allows customers to order several sizes of a clothing item, for example, in the expectation that those which do not fit will have been returned and refunded before they are charged the full amount. But such schemes have been widely criticised for encouraging shoppers to buy more than they can afford, with charities warning it can be a ""slippery slope into debt"". Critics say customers are bombarded with messages urging them to use buy now, pay later credit without a clear enough explanation of what it involves. In particular, buy now, pay later firms have been accused of failing to explain that customers could be referred to debt collectors and that their credit scores could be affected if they miss payments. Consumer group Which? recently found that although Klarna and other firms shared their guidelines with retailers about how their service should be presented, some retailers did not adhere to those guidelines. Klarna is the largest buy now, pay later platform but many other firms offer a similar service, including Clearpay, LayBuy and Paypal. Buy now, pay later services were used by five million people in the UK for total sales of Â£2.7bn in 2020. However, one in 10 people using them already had debt arrears elsewhere, a review by the Financial Conduct Authority found. The review, led by Chris Woolard, found that three quarters of buy now, pay later users were under the age of 36 and the vast majority of transactions related to clothing purchases. The Citizens Advice charity said it had found shoppers did not view buy now, pay later services as ""proper borrowing"" and many did not understand fully what they were signing up for. The charity warned that four-in-10 of those who had used this type of credit in the previous 12 months were struggling to repay. Klarna's boss said he believed there was a place for this kind of affordable credit offering. ""We firmly believe that most of the time, people should pay with the money they have, but there are certain times where credit makes sense,"" Mr Siemiatkowski said. ""In those cases, our [buy now, pay later] products offer a sustainable and no-cost healthy form of credit - and a much needed alternative to high-cost credit cards."" Klarna said it had worked with consumer group Fairer Finance to ensure its terms and conditions were ""clear, simple and easy to understand"", and that the language during the checkout process made it ""absolutely clear"" there would be ""consequences for missed payments"". It had also improved its complaints procedure for dissatisfied customers, it said. In February, the government announced,externalthat buy now, pay later products would be regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The Treasury's consultation on the sector is expected before the financial watchdog sets out its rules on regulation later. The government said that giving the FCA oversight of firms like Klarna, Clearpay or Laybuy would mean that customers would be able to complain to the Financial Ombudsman if they were not happy with the service.

"Spanish Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez was addressing his party conference in Valencia. Spain's Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez pledged on Sunday to criminalise prostitution in the country. Speaking to supporters at the end of his Socialist Party's three-day congress in Valencia, Mr SÃ¡nchez said that the practice ""enslaves"" women. Prostitution was decriminalised in Spain in 1995 and in 2016 the UN estimated the country's sex industry was worth â¬3.7bn (Â£3.1bn, $4.2bn). A 2009 survey found that up to one in three Spanish men had paid for sex. However, another report published in 2009 suggested that the figure may be as high as 39% and a 2011 UN study cited Spain as the third biggest centre for prostitution in the world, behind Thailand and Puerto Rico. Prostitution is currently unregulated in Spain, and there is no punishment for those who offer paid sexual services of their own will, as long as it does not take place in public spaces. However, pimping or acting as a proxy between a sex worker and a potential client is illegal. The industry has boomed since its decriminalisation and it is commonly estimated that around 300,000 women work as prostitutes in Spain. The Spanish police freed 896 women being exploited as sex workers in 2019 and estimate that over 80% of those working as prostitutes are victims of mafias. ""Prostitution is not an expression of women's sexual freedom,"" said APRAMP, an association which campaigns to prevent and eradicate sexual exploitation. ""It is almost always linked to violence, marginalisation, economic difficulties and a sexist, patriarchal culture."" This Socialist Party (PSOE) proposal comes at a time when issues such as gender violence and sexual consent have been taking centre stage in Spanish public debate. However, CATS, a charity which provides support to sex workers in southeastern Spain, warned that policies aimed at abolition are unlikely to work, instead sending the sex industry further underground. ""If you throw people engaged in prostitution out of the establishments and flats where they work, then they're going to end up on the street,"" said Nacho Pardo of CATS. ""And that is sad, it's dangerous and it makes them vulnerable to mafias."" CÃ©sar Jara, a Spanish journalist who has researched the sex industry, told Efe news agency that ""95% of prostitution in Spain is not free, it's forced in one way or another, whether because of socio-economic conditions, threats or other pressures"". Sex trafficking generates â¬7-8m daily in Spain, he says, describing the country as Europe's second-biggest prostitution market in Europe after Germany, and as ""a paradise for international mafias"". ""The worst thing is that some young people see it as normal to pay so that a woman gives them pleasure however they want."" In 2019, Mr SÃ¡nchez's PSOE published a pledge in its election manifesto to outlaw prostitution, in what was seen as a move to attract more female voters. The manifesto called prostitution ""one of the cruellest aspects of the feminisation of poverty and one of the worst forms of violence against women"". However two years on from the election, no legislation has yet been tabled. Spanish media report that the PSOE would need to agree on a draft with their left-wing Podemos coalition partners before presenting a bill to parliament, so there is still a long way to go. PSOE equality secretary Carmen Calvo, quoted by Efe, said ""we've passed other laws which were much more difficult, so we'll get this one done"", though she warned of ""ridiculous traps"" frequently placed in the path of feminists. Supporters of Spain's current system say that it has brought huge benefits to the women working in the trade and made life safer for them. However in recent years significant concerns have grown around the potential for women to be trafficked into sex work.

"Staff at University of Leicester joined the strike in 2019 Students could face more strike action at universities this term after the academics' union opened a ballot over pay, pensions and conditions. University and College Union (UCU) general secretary Jo Grady said the UK's flagship university sector was built on the ""exploitation of staff"". They had experienced a decade of pension cuts, collapsing pay and insecure contracts, she said. University employers said the prospect of disruption was ""disappointing"". University staff strike over pensions and pay 'We want our lecturers to be there and be happy' University workers vote for eight-day strike 2018: Strike action suspended in pension truce The union is demanding: a Â£2,500 pay increase across all pay points an end to race, gender and disability pay injustice a framework to eliminate zero-hours and other precarious contracts meaningful action to tackle unmanageable workloads withdrawal of pension cuts The ballot represents a ramping up of the long-running dispute between UCU members and university employers, with staff at 152 institutions being balloted. A total of 78 of these are being consulted during the next three weeks over pay and working conditions, with another 68 facing two ballots - over pay and conditions, plus the USS pensions scheme. The dispute over pensions has been rumbling on for nearly a decade, and has been kicked into action again after what the UCU describes as a ""flawed valuation of the USS pension fund"" wiped ""an estimated 35% off the value of a typical pension"". The pay dispute has led to numerous strike days over the past two years, and was only paused during the pandemic. Ms Grady said: ""There is a sense that we are at a breaking point and a sense that this is a sector that needs saving. I don't think I can over-articulate that enough. ""The idea that staff would want to go out on strike again could not be further from the truth."" She accused institutions of spending their increased fee and research income on extravagant building projects, advertising and advice from consultants, rather than the staff who are teaching young people. And she added that ""exploitative contracts"" were the ""dirty secret"" of a higher education sector which requires students to pay Â£9,000-plus fees a year for tuition. The union estimates that there are some 74,000 staff working on such temporary contracts. The UCU says pay for university staff fell by 17.6% relative to inflation between 2009 and 2019. Since then employers made further below-inflation offers, despite university income from tuition fees growing by a third in the last five years, it said. TheUniversity and Colleges Employers Association,externalhas offered guaranteed increases of at least 1.5% to the pay spine. Higher percentage rises were pledged for lower-paid staff, up to a maximum of 3.6%. Chief executive Raj Jethwa said: ""We are disappointed that UCU is encouraging its members to ballot for action which is specifically designed to disrupt teaching and learning for students who have endured so many recent upheavals."" Mr Jethwa continued: ""The final offer from employers was fair and meaningful in the context of the sector's ongoing delicate financial situation. ""We very much hope the trade union members understand the considerable pressures which continue to face their HE [higher education] institutions. The financial impact of Covid-19 continues to affect these HE institutions, alongside declines in other income sources."" He added that most staff understood the ""financial realities facing their institutions"".

After being put in to bat Scotland made a slow start and lost captain Kyle Coetzer for a duck, but recovered to 45-1, before losing five wickets for just eight runs in 25 balls, to slip to 53-6. Greaves then shared 51 with Mark Watt, who made 22, and 27 with Josh Davey to work Scotland up to a defendable total. Scotland removed both openers to leave Bangladesh 18-2, before a 47-run partnership between Shakib (20) and Mushfiqur Rahim (38) gave the Tigers a platform. But both fell in the space of two overs, meaning the run-rate started to rise sharply, and despite conceding 17 from the final over some earlier good bowling and catching was enough for Scotland to pick up the win. Hampshire's Brad Wheal was the pick of the bowlers, taking 3-24. In the tournament's first game Papua New Guinea - who had lost their previous 10 games in white-ball cricket and were making their World Cup debut, resulting in tears during the national anthems - were 0-2 before recovering to 102-3, but another collapse restricted them to 129-9, with captain Assad Vala top scoring with 56. Oman captain and spinner Zeeshan Maqsood claimed 4-20, the best figures by an Oman bowler in T20 cricket, before his openers Jatinder Singh and Aqib Ilyas - who had never batted together for Oman - hit 12 fours and five sixes as Oman won with 38 balls to spare and became just the third men's team to win a T20 World Cup game by 10 wickets.

"The cost to scam victims' wellbeing can be calculated at a monetary total of Â£9.3bn a year, according to the consumer group Which?. That is the equivalent of Â£2,509 a year for each victim, but the impact can be higher for someone hit by online fraud. People targeted by fraudsters have spoken of suffering from anxiety and ill-health after being scammed. Which? says the cost to well-being is higher than the typical financial hit of Â£600. The consumers' association appointed consultants to study data including 17,000 responses to the Office for National Statistics' Crime Survey for England and Wales. The results were then applied to an approach to assessing social impacts approved by the Treasury earlier this year. The model allows researchers to value changes in wellbeing in monetary terms. The research suggested scam victims faced a drop in life satisfaction, significantly higher levels of anxiety, and lower levels of happiness. It was also associated with people self-reporting worse general health, although to a much smaller degree. Jennifer Runham burst into tears in her local bank branch, on her way to the school run, after being told she was a victim of a scam. A cycle of events began when she received an email claiming that she needed to renew her TV licence. She entered her details on what proved to be a fake website, before receiving a call from criminals claiming to be from her bank's fraud department. They had even spoofed her bank's phone number. She transferred Â£1,500 before realising she had been tricked. Jennifer Runham says the impact of being scammed was more than financial ""The impact was massive. I was so upset, scared and anxious,"" said Mrs Runham, who is in her 40s. ""My severe level of anxiety meant I had a lot of help from Victim Support."" It took a year of battling before her bank reimbursed the money. ""It takes a lot of courage to go through the complaints process. I felt they were blaming me,"" she said. ""I went to the ombudsman. When I got my money back, I felt I had some freedom to get on with my life."" Charity Age UK hasinformation and advice about TV Licence scams,external Rocio Concha, Which? director of policy and advocacy, said: ""This brings home the scale of the emotional and psychological harm that victims suffer when they are defrauded.Â ""The government must not ignore the huge impact an epidemic of fraud is having on our society."" She is presenting the findings to MPs on the Draft Online Safety Bill Joint Committee on Monday. Fraudsters steal Â£4m a day as crime surges 'We lost nearly Â£10k to TV licence scammers' New 159 fraud hotline launched to counter threat The draft Bill includes measures to tackle user-generated fraud like romance scams, but omits the scam adverts leading to other types of fraud such as investment scams. The consumer group, alongside campaigners such as Moneysavingexpert's Martin Lewis, are calling for more comprehensive and urgent action regarding online scams. It is calling on the government to include scam adverts in the Online Safety Bill as the first step towards new laws and regulations placing more content policing responsibility on online platforms.

"Harry Kane scored his first Premier League goal of the season for Tottenham Newcastle manager Steve Bruce said he will ""carry on as best I can"" after the club's new era under its Saudi Arabian owners got off to a losing start at home to Tottenham. Watched by new non-executive chair Yasir Al-Rumayyan and part-owner Amanda Staveley, Newcastle led after two minutes as Callum Wilson returned from injury to head in. The home fans went wild with delight, a continuation of carnival-esque scenes before the match. Bruce, marking his 1,000th game in management, might have felt a sense of optimism while clinging to hope he may continue in the job. But then reality struck for a team yet to win in eight Premier League games this season as Spurs scored twice in five minutes. First, Tanguy Ndombele fired in a right-footed drive, before Harry Kane scored his first league goal of the season when he beat the Newcastle offside trap to dink in, the goal awarded by the video assistant referee after initially being ruled out. The game was thenhalted when a fan suffered a medical emergencyin the stands. Supporters and players - including Eric Dier - played their part in alerting medics to the seriousness of the situation before the game was suspended. Play resumed with five minutes of the first half remaining, and Tottenham extended their lead when Son Heung-min slid in at the back post for his fourth of the season. Nuno Espirito Santo's side, who moved up to fifth in the table, looked comfortable in the second half as the mood turned sour towards Bruce, with home fans calling for him to be sacked. A poor audition to stay in the job was made worse when substitute Jonjo Shelvey received a second yellow card for a rash challenge on Sergio Reguilon after 83 minutes. And despite a brief response when Dier's own goal made it 3-2, the result left Newcastle next-to-bottom of the table with a huge transformation needed to turn the club into the superpower that the new owners want them to be. Asked if he will remain in the job, Bruce said: ""That is for other people to decide. Ever since I have walked into this club, it is difficult. I knew how difficult it was going to be with the frustrations. ""I will carry on as best I can until I hear otherwise. The owners have conducted themselves respectfully since they came in. As long as I don't hear otherwise, I will go into work tomorrow.""

What Newcastle need to do to stay up - analysis Fan 'stable' after game halted because of medical emergency Reaction from Sunday's games including Tottenham's win at Newcastle Go to the Newcastle page Go to the Spurs page Newcastle fans celebrated the club's new era under new owners before and during Sunday's game Prior to kick-off, there was a unique atmosphere outside St James' Park and around the city. There were some fans who celebrated the Saudi Arabian-backed takeover by wearing headdresses and draping themselves in Saudi flags, but the overwhelming majority answered the call to wear black and white as they celebrated a new era after Mike Ashley's 14-year reign came to an end. Inside the stadium, the Gallowgate End was a sea of black and white as supporters waved flags and unveiled a banner quoting lyrics from Newcastle-born performer Jimmy Nail's 1995 song Big River, about the city and rebuilding hope for the future. It must have been an uplifting sight for Al-Rumayyan, who was attending his first game in his capacity as the governor of the Saudi Public Investment Fund, which now owns 80% of the club. He broke out into a huge grin as Wilson scored early on from Javier Manquillo's cross, while Staveley hugged her husband Mehrdad Ghodoussi. Newcastle's new owners were in attendance on Sunday But the way Tottenham opened up the Newcastle defence showed how much work is needed to take the club to the top end of the Premier League, let alone into contention to win the title. The priority this season is to avoid relegation. And the result will not have given Bruce any further security about his job. After reports last week that he would be sacked, with the club then saying he would remain in charge for this game 45 minutes before his pre-match press conference on Friday, his future remains unclear. But this was a demonstration of a team struggling for form, and with little chance of the game turning Newcastle's way, chants of ""We want Brucey out"" came from the Gallowgate End after 74 minutes and continued until the end, when the final whistle was met with boos. It was a message that would have been heard loud and clear by the new owners. Tanguy Ndombele was on the scoresheet and put in an all round excellent display for Tottenham On a day when the visitors might have been distracted by the atmosphere, this was a welcome boost to Spurs boss Nuno, whose side have earned successive wins after a derby defeat by Arsenal that led to many questions about the club's direction. Tottenham's front four of Ndombele, Son, Lucas Moura and Kane were a menace to the hosts, who need to prioritise a defensive midfielder among their spending plans. Prior to the game being stopped and with Spurs already leading 2-1, Moura headed on to the bar, and they looked far more likely to score in the second half than their opponents before Dier's late own goal. ""We knew we had to ignore the noise and do our job,"" said Nuno. ""We did not start well but did an amazing job after. I'm really proud of them. This video can not be played Newcastle United 2-3 Tottenham Hotspur: Nuno 'proud' after win against Newcastle ""I would like to score more, the boys would also, but Newcastle are a good team with good defenders."" Credit must also go to Reguilon and Dier for the part they played in alerting medics to the stricken supporter and to midfielder Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, who continued after the incident, having also played when Denmark team-mate Christian Eriksen had a cardiac arrest during their Euro 2020 match against Finland in June. After a day when there were conflicting emotions and no end of drama, it put the result into perspective.

"Southeastern has handed over the running of its services to the Operator of Last Resort Southeastern's train services have been taken over by the government. Franchise holder Govia was informed of the decision last month after failing to declare more than Â£25m of taxpayer funding. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the Operator of Last Resort would take over the running to protect taxpayers' interests. Passengers are unlikely to see any immediate changes as trains, timetables and fares will stay the same. Southeastern's vast network includes London, Kent, East Sussex and the High Speed 1 line. The franchise was owned by Govia - a joint venture between Go-Ahead Group and Keolis. The government stepped in after an investigation by the Department for Transport (DfT) identified Govia had not declared millions of pounds of historic taxpayer funding. The DfT said the money had since been reclaimed. Further investigations are being conducted and the government is considering more action, including financial penalties. Anthony Smith, chief executive of passenger watchdog Transport Focus, said: ""Passengers will want a punctual, reliable, clean train, with enough room to sit and stand, and value for money fares."" Cat Hobbs, director of public ownership campaign group We Own It, said ""privatisation is failing our railway"" and called for the whole rail network to be brought into public hands ""where it belongs"".

"Bethan Maunder, 45, from Swansea and her daughter before the game against Cardiff On the first weekend since Covid passes were introduced in Wales, football stadiums and nightclubs received a mixed reaction from punters. At the south Wales derby between Swansea and Cardiff City, fans were divided overthe pass, which is now mandatory for over-18s at large events. The pass proves vaccination, a negative lateral flow test in the last 48 hours, or having Covid in the past six months. It applies to nightclubs and stadiums with a capacity of more than 10,000. As fans headed to the Swansea.com Stadium for the derby -which Swansea won 3-0- some said passes were open to abuse and a restriction on personal freedoms, while others said it made them feel safer. What is a Covid pass and how do I get one? Nightclubs reported some confrontations between customers and door staff over the checks. Nick Newman of Cardiff Licensees Forum said reports he received suggested that generally the pass had had a negative impact on venues. He said it was time-consuming to check passes, and the Welsh government website had crashed when customers tried to download them at the door, This video can not be played Shoppers have shared their views on vaccine passes in Wales Swansea City fan Luke Davies said he did not have a problem with the introduction of the Covid pass, as fans attended the derby in person for the first time since January last year. ""Personally I think, if you remember back to last year, there was a long period where we couldn't go to games,"" he said. ""The game this weekend is a big one for the team. We missed out on that last year, it's the one everyone gets excited for. ""If [showing a Covid pass] means we can get back into the stadiums full time then I'm not bothered by the decision. ""I think it's a case of better safe than sorry. It helps the bigger picture really and helps get everything back to normal."" A fan has a Covid pass checked by an official before Sunday's game Pass breaches 'should not be police priority' 'Wales set for more normal Christmas' But Mr Davies, who also hosts the Swans Cast supporters podcast, feared it could put others off attending. ""I think there's been a bit of a mixed reaction,"" he said. ""I understand the frustration for those who chose not to have the vaccine. ""There's a little bit more effort involved there. They have to test proving they're negative to get in and that's a little bit more effort. Some people will be happy just to stay at home, especially if it's on TV."" He said some people had viewed the rule as an ""extra control on society"". ""I've not really heard anyone saying 'this is going to make me feel safer and now I'm happy to go,' but I've definitely seen some that are saying 'I don't want to go while this is a rule, I won't go back, refund my season ticket'. That sort of thing. ""It's a different way of living and I understand some people are not going to be able to adjust as easily as others, so it could definitely have an impact [on attendances]."" Covid passes introduced in Welsh sport First day of Covid passes in Wales Fellow Swansea fan Cath Dyer said she was hopeful most fans would get behind the new requirements. ""It's got to be done, the legislation has been passed, so we've got to follow Welsh government rules,"" she said. ""People, hopefully, will feel a bit safer knowing either that they've either been double jabbed or had a lateral flow test. ""Safety is the top priority and that's what the club are working towards. ""The club wants everything to run as smoothly as possible, because at the end of the day, everybody wants to get into the ground to get all the excitement, the build-up, ready for the game."" Fan Cath Dyer said safety was the top priority as Swansea host rivals Cardiff Some supporters have expressed concern that having to show Covid passes before going in could cause disruption, but Ms Dyer said she was confident the club was well prepared. ""The club was proactive before everything started,"" she said. ""They gave us plenty of warning to get ready before everything came into effect. Everybody knows they have to have their passports, passports will be checked."" Swansea fan Nicola Bennet: ""I'd feel safer with Covid passes - it's good for mass gatherings"" But Mr Davies said he was worried some might not have got the message, which could affect what kind of reception the passes get. ""It might have an impact on how long it takes you to get into the stadium, how early you've got to go down"", he said. ""That will be interesting, to see how many people miss kick-off, and to see if their reaction to the rules then might change after that. ""The club has actually communicated about this and said to bear it in mind and to factor that in to your timings and come down a bit earlier, but not everyone is going to see that. ""I'm not concerned because I'd make sure I account for that, but I can completely understand sometimes you might just get caught out."" Bethan Maunder, 45 from Swansea, said she believed the Covid pass system was flawed, and easy to get around. ""I know there's a lot of people that have got issues with being dictated to, having that restriction of freedom,"" she said. ""The lateral flows don't work, because you self input the data. I do them in work and I can put down negative whether it's positive or negative. ""If you want to get in you're just going to put negative and put that result in."" Fellow supporter John Evans, 74, said he has had all of his jabs and had no issues with passes being required. ""It makes you feel safer if someone hasn't had their jabs, they can't get in,"" he said. Nicola Bennet, 57, from Swansea, said it was a personal choice whether people wanted to get the vaccine or not, but there were ""consequences for that decision"". ""I'd feel safer with Covid passes - it's good for mass gatherings,"" she said. Door staff check passes outside the Philharmonic in Cardiff on the first Saturday since the passes where introduced Gary Lulham, boss of venue Sin City Swansea, said most customers have been ""really good"" but trade had declined. ""We've seen around 25% fewer people than expected but that could have happened anyway,"" he said. ""We had a couple of people who didn't want to do it and were quite vocal about the fact they couldn't come in. ""There is an element of relying on people being honest. ""I have a Covid pass and it is valid until November  - but what happens if I get Covid next week? I still have the pass on my phone."" Michael Kill, from the Night Time Industries Association, said checking Covid passes has led to ""quite a divisive situation on the door"" of clubs. ""We've heard of confrontations between customers and staff because the Covid passport has a poor reputation,"" he said. ""Businesses are picking up the flak from people who haven't had vaccines and not done lateral flow tests."" Health Minister Eluned Morgan toldDewi Llwyd on BBC Radio Cymruthat the pass system ""isn't perfect"". ""But we were also aware, for example, that nightclubs are places where lots of young people congregate, and that there were no other measures, or a very small number of other measures to keep people from coming into contact with another,"" she said. ""Therefore, this hopefully will make a difference, especially amongst young people,"" she said.

"Lidos, including in Barry, pictured in 1995, were very popular until travelling abroad became cheaper and more accessible Lidos became the staple of a 19th Century summer's day - but are they making a comeback after falling out of favour? With a record-breaking summer at Wales' only lido in Pontypridd, Abergavenny Lido Group are aiming to raise enough money to build one in the town. The Monmouthshire group said there was a ""great deal of enthusiasm"" to bring back outdoor swimming spaces. Historian Daryl Leeworthy said the enthusiasm ""comes in waves"". At one time there were more than 57 outdoor pools in Wales. Now there is just one, the National Lido of Wales in Pontypridd, Rhondda Cynon Taf. Urgent tourism rethink call amid staycation boom Sunset bar defends Â£200 fee to deter instagrammers 'Trigger's broom' bridge to get Â£30m upgrade The Grade II-listed Lido Ponty, set in Ynysangharad War Memorial Park,reopened in 2015 after a Â£6.3m revamp. But the Pontypridd poolneeded extensive repairs after Storm Dennisbrought a month's worth of rain in 48 hours in February 2020. Due to Covid restrictions, it also had to close for over a year. Lido Ponty had a record-breaking summer this year The answer is ""absolutely"", according to Brent Bennett, operations manager at Ponty Lido. Mr Bennett said the facility had been ""hugely popular"" since reopening because more people wanted to exercise outside due to Covid. ""We got around 75,000 visitors in 2018, which was a particularly hot and sunny season, and now we're just over 92,000 visitors,"" he explained. ""We've shortened our sessions to allow more people to have an opportunity so they are not turned away. ""Obviously, when people have been stuck indoors, when they then open the floodgates... it's been once again very popular."" Lido Ponty reopened in 2015 after a Â£6.3m revamp Mr Bennett said he believed people have been increasingly turning to outdoor exercise in recent years, even before the pandemic, so was not surprised the lido, which has a 17-week season, had a record-breaking summer. ""It could be quite freezing cold but behind the walls you could be anywhere in the world,"" he said. ""If you just looked up in the mountains in the greenery, it could be absolutely anywhere, and you know, is fantastic."" He said if projects could find the money, lidos would thrive in other areas too and attract visitors. The Abergavenny Lido Group say they are getting a lot of support from the community The Abergavenny Lido Group are looking to fund a feasibility study to assess the viability of a project - the first step towards funding for a lido. The original pool opened in 1938 and was demolished a decade after it closed in 1996. The planned lido would be powered by renewable energy and built on the site of the former pool at Bailey Park. This video can not be played Bailey Park Pool Chairman George Foster said the group had been inundated with support on social media due to a ""huge resurgence"" of interest in swimming outdoors during lockdown. Mr Foster said ""an awful lot of people"" had fond memories of being at the old lido during the summer months. ""It could be a real asset for the town, great tourist attraction and also something that people can be proud of,"" he added. ""The town really needs a lift, like any other towns do after the pandemic, and this is something that we feel an awful lot of people will continue to support."" Swimmers enjoy the open air pool in Bailey Park in 1972 Monmouthshire council, which owns the land, previously granted the lido group consent to carry out fundraising activities, such as applying for grants, but said it would be unable to provide further financial support. A previous estimate said it would cost about Â£7m to rebuild the outdoor pool. The Pontypridd Lido opened in 1927 and Cardiff's Guildford Crescent pool was said to be Wales' oldest Mr Leeworthy, a historian at Swansea University, said a resurgence of love for lidos in Wales is not unusual, and that it comes in ""waves of popularity"". ""In the 1920s, they were brand new facilities for communities to use,"" he said. ""The growth of swimming in the 1950s was helped by the popularity of open air swimmers and big races taking place around the world, and in the 1970s they were massively helped by the sports councils."" But once package holidays became cheaper and more accessible, Mr Leeworthy said holidays in often colder and wetter Wales ""lost its appeal"". The Brynmawr pool in Blaenau Gwent was built by the International Voluntary Service Mr Leeworthy said nostalgia could be driving the resurgence. In north Wales, many were introduced in the 1920s and 1930s to ""give an extra"" to seaside towns. But in the south, particularly in the valleys, many were introduced as a consequence of the Miners' Welfare Fund and ""a desire to have open air, leisure facilities"". The aim of the fund was to provide facilities in coalfield areas to help make them ""less riotous"", Mr Leeworthy explained. He added: ""So the swimming pools and recreation grounds that were built were very much a demand from communities themselves.""

"Spanish Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez was addressing his party conference in Valencia. Spain's Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez pledged on Sunday to criminalise prostitution in the country. Speaking to supporters at the end of his Socialist Party's three-day congress in Valencia, Mr SÃ¡nchez said that the practice ""enslaves"" women. Prostitution was decriminalised in Spain in 1995 and in 2016 the UN estimated the country's sex industry was worth â¬3.7bn (Â£3.1bn, $4.2bn). A 2009 survey found that up to one in three Spanish men had paid for sex. However, another report published in 2009 suggested that the figure may be as high as 39% and a 2011 UN study cited Spain as the third biggest centre for prostitution in the world, behind Thailand and Puerto Rico. Prostitution is currently unregulated in Spain, and there is no punishment for those who offer paid sexual services of their own will, as long as it does not take place in public spaces. However, pimping or acting as a proxy between a sex worker and a potential client is illegal. The industry has boomed since its decriminalisation and it is commonly estimated that around 300,000 women work as prostitutes in Spain. The Spanish police freed 896 women being exploited as sex workers in 2019 and estimate that over 80% of those working as prostitutes are victims of mafias. ""Prostitution is not an expression of women's sexual freedom,"" said APRAMP, an association which campaigns to prevent and eradicate sexual exploitation. ""It is almost always linked to violence, marginalisation, economic difficulties and a sexist, patriarchal culture."" This Socialist Party (PSOE) proposal comes at a time when issues such as gender violence and sexual consent have been taking centre stage in Spanish public debate. However, CATS, a charity which provides support to sex workers in southeastern Spain, warned that policies aimed at abolition are unlikely to work, instead sending the sex industry further underground. ""If you throw people engaged in prostitution out of the establishments and flats where they work, then they're going to end up on the street,"" said Nacho Pardo of CATS. ""And that is sad, it's dangerous and it makes them vulnerable to mafias."" CÃ©sar Jara, a Spanish journalist who has researched the sex industry, told Efe news agency that ""95% of prostitution in Spain is not free, it's forced in one way or another, whether because of socio-economic conditions, threats or other pressures"". Sex trafficking generates â¬7-8m daily in Spain, he says, describing the country as Europe's second-biggest prostitution market in Europe after Germany, and as ""a paradise for international mafias"". ""The worst thing is that some young people see it as normal to pay so that a woman gives them pleasure however they want."" In 2019, Mr SÃ¡nchez's PSOE published a pledge in its election manifesto to outlaw prostitution, in what was seen as a move to attract more female voters. The manifesto called prostitution ""one of the cruellest aspects of the feminisation of poverty and one of the worst forms of violence against women"". However two years on from the election, no legislation has yet been tabled. Spanish media report that the PSOE would need to agree on a draft with their left-wing Podemos coalition partners before presenting a bill to parliament, so there is still a long way to go. PSOE equality secretary Carmen Calvo, quoted by Efe, said ""we've passed other laws which were much more difficult, so we'll get this one done"", though she warned of ""ridiculous traps"" frequently placed in the path of feminists. Supporters of Spain's current system say that it has brought huge benefits to the women working in the trade and made life safer for them. However in recent years significant concerns have grown around the potential for women to be trafficked into sex work.

"The man arrested by police following the killing of the MP Sir David Amess has been named as Ali Harbi Ali. The 25-year-old is being held under the Terrorism Act and officers have until Friday to question him. Whitehall officials confirmed the man's name to the BBC, and said he was a British man of Somali heritage. The BBC understands Mr Ali was referred to the counter-terrorist Prevent scheme some years ago, but was never a formal subject of interest to MI5. It also understands that his father, Harbi Ali Kullane, who was previously an adviser to Somalia's prime minister, has been visited by police who have taken his phone for analysis. Police officers have spent the weekend searching three addresses in the London area. It is thought a converted Victorian property in Lady Somerset Road in north-west London is linked to the investigation. Neighbours said officers started searching it late on Friday night. Further searches, also believed to be part of the inquiry, have been taking place at a property in Bounds Green Road, north London, and another in Cranmer Road, Croydon. A police search at a house in north London is thought to be linked to the inquiry Sir David, who had been a Conservative MP since 1983, was stabbed multiple times during a regular Friday meeting with his Southend West constituents at Belfairs Methodist Church in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex. Southend councillor John Lamb said he has since spoken to two of Sir David's assistants who were at the constituency surgery with Sir David at the time of the attack. He described how one was in the room with Sir David taking notes. ""All of a sudden there was a scream from her, because the person deliberately whipped out a knife and started stabbing David,"" he said. ""The other lady who was getting names from people outside, she came running in and saw poor David had been stabbed."" He said both were quite distressed but were ""coping quite well"" under the circumstances. Catholic priest Father Jeff Woolnough saidhe tried to administer last rites to Sir Davidshortly after the stabbing but police told him he could not enter a crime scene. Instead, he prayed for his friend on the street behind a police cordon. Sombre mood as town bewildered by MP's killing Not the end of MPs meeting public, says Patel How a tragic day unfolded in Leigh-on-Sea Ali Harbi Ali was initially arrested on suspicion of murder and held in Essex. He has since been transferred to a London police station where he was further detained under Section 41 of the Terrorism Act. Police say they are not looking for anyone else for now. Early investigations revealed a potential motivation linked to Islamist extremism, police said. It is thought Ali Harbi Ali did not spend long in the Prevent programme - which aims to stop people becoming radicalised. Teachers, members of the public, the NHS and others can refer individuals to a local panel of police, social workers and other experts who decide whether and how to intervene in their lives. Engagement in the scheme is voluntary and it is not a criminal sanction. Obituary: Sir David Amess MPs' security being reviewed at pace - speaker Sir David, 69, who was married with four daughters and a son, is the second MP to be killed in recent years following the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox in June 2016. The latest attack has raised concerns for the safety of MPs, many of whom hold constituency surgeries which anyone can attend. Home Secretary Priti Patel said MPs had access to a ""panoply"" of security measures - many of which were put in place after Ms Cox's murder - but said changes could be made to constituency surgeries. Any measures needed to be proportionate, she told the BBC's Andrew Marr show. ""We're here to serve, we're here to be accessible to the British public."" Ms Patel described hearing the news that Sir David had died, saying ""our worlds were shattered"". A post-mortem examination of Sir David took place on Saturday, police said. This video can not be played Watch: Home Secretary Priti Patel says security measures for MPs are ""being looked at"" Meanwhile, Tory MP Andrew Rosindell said the killing of his friend and fellow Essex MP ""shouldn't change things in a way that stops us going about our democratic role"". ""There's got to be some balance to this. I don't have an answer,"" he told BBC Breakfast on Sunday. ""This is not the Britain I want, this is not the country that we're used to."" Labour's Diane Abbott MP said she would prefer to meet constituents behind a screen to prevent possible stabbing attacks. Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle said he wanted to avoid a knee-jerk reaction but insisted ""the best had to come out of this hideous killing"". He said security measures would be reviewed to improve MPs' safety and urged MPs to take up measures already available to them. People in Leigh-on Sea have been remembering Sir David Conservative MP Mark Francois described his colleague as his ""oldest and best friend"" as he laid flowers Tributes to Sir David have been pouring in from politicians and constituents, with the home secretary saying his ""infectious personality"" meant he ""touched so many lives"". Over the weekend, people have gathered for a candlelit vigil in Leigh-on-Sea to mark Sir David's life and attended a church service to share their memories of him. Many constituents have reflected on his gentle nature and willingness to listen and to help. Sir David had long campaigned for Southend to be given city status. On Sunday, Sir Lindsay Hoyle said that would be ""a good thing to do"" in his memory.

"This video can not be played Watch: Home Secretary Priti Patel says security measures for MPs are ""being looked at"" Giving MPs police guards at local meetings is one of a ""range"" of steps that could protect politicians, Priti Patel has said after an MP's killing. The death of Sir David Amess has raised concern over the safety of politicians and the abuse they receive online. The home secretary said she and Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle were working on ""practical"" measures to protect MPs. But she stressed action should be ""proportionate to the risk"" and that MPs should remain ""accessible"". She added that any action against anonymous social media accounts, which could be used for ""pro-democracy"" reasons, should be ""balanced"". Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr, she said it ""wasn't just about MPs"" adding that children had been ""subject to the most appalling hate and abuse online"". She said the government's Online Harms Bill offered an opportunity for all politicians to come together to close ""the corrosive space online where we see just dreadful behaviour"".

Jo Cox's sister urged to quit as MP by partner Sir David, 69, was stabbed at Belfairs Methodist Church in Leigh-on-Sea on Friday, where he had been meeting members of the public. A man arrested by police after the killingis Ali Harbi Ali, a 25-year-old British citizen of Somali heritage, Whitehall officials have told the BBC. Police say he is being held at a London police station under the Terrorism Act 2000. The BBC has been told that some years ago he was referred to the government's counter-extremism programme, Prevent which aims to de-radicalised people. Teachers, members of the public, the NHS and others can refer individuals to a local panel of police, social workers and other experts who decide whether and how to intervene in their lives. It is believed that Mr Ali was not in the voluntary scheme for long and was not on MI5's current watch list. Ms Patel described hearing the news that Sir David had died, saying ""frankly our worlds were shattered"". She said the MP had been a ""dear friend"" whose ""infectious personality"" meant that he ""touched so many lives"". The attack has prompted questions about whether MPs should continue to meet constituents face-to-face without police protection - with one Conservative MP suggesting in-person surgeries should be temporarily paused. Most MPs hold weekly surgeries in their local area, often in public buildings such as libraries where their constituents can seek help or advice. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr, Ms Patel said MPs were ""here to serve"" and to be ""accessible to the British public"" but that there was ""a way to do things differently around surgeries"". Local residents have left tributes Sir David in Leigh-on-Sea She added that MPs could protect themselves by only seeing constituents who have pre-booked an appointment and making sure to check the backgrounds of the individuals. Asked about whether MPs should be offered police protection when holding constituency meetings, Ms Patel said there were a ""range of measures available"" to politicians. ""This isn't about just saying let's just go for option A â have bodyguards or security,"" she said adding that any action should be ""proportionate"" to the risk faced by each individual MP following a one-to-one assessment between an MP and the police. Speaker of the House of Commons Sir Lindsay Hoyle has also said he is working ""at pace"" to improve the safety of MPs. Writing inthe Observer,externalandthe Mail on Sunday,external, he said he didn't want MPs to stop meeting their constituents but that it was necessary ""to take stock and review whether those measures are adequate to safeguard members, staff and constituents, especially during surgeries"". He also called for an end to ""the hate which drives... attacks"" against MPs. ""If anything positive is to come out of this latest awful tragedy,"" he said, ""it is that the quality of political discourse has to change. The conversation has to be kinder and based on respect,"" he said. Most MPs do not get close protection while in their constituencies, but security was increased following Ms Cox's killing. All MPs were offered panic buttons, extra lighting, additional locks and emergency fobs at their homes and constituency offices. The spending on such measures soared from Â£170,576 in 2015-16 to Â£4.5m two years later. Asked about the role of social media, Ms Patel said the culture department was leading work into online abuse, but that she was ""absolutely vigorous"" when speaking to tech companies such as Facebook and Twitter. She said there had to be a ""proportionate"" and ""balanced"" approach to the issue of anonymous use of social media. Labour's shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy agreed that it was right to be ""cautious"" about ending anonymity online, arguing that it was ""lifesaving"" for some campaigners such as whistleblowers or campaigners in Belarus and Hong Kong. However, she said people should be ""held to account for what would be criminal behaviour in the real world if they indulge in it online"". ""The trick is to get the right balance,"" she said adding that the government had ""dragged its feet on this for years"".

"The voucher scheme would give people discounts when visiting tourist attractions such as the Titanic Belfast Museum A holiday-at-home voucher scheme will need more money behind it to stop people from missing out, a tourism body has said. Under the proposal, vouchers will be issued on a first-come, first-served basis. Unlikethe high street scheme, there will be a limited number available. The Northern Ireland Tourism Alliance (NITA) said the draft Â£2m budget would need to be increased to avoid disappointment. The Department for the Economy said officials were still considering the scheme's suitability. Plans for the schemewere first revealed by BBC News NI in September 2020. High street and holiday voucher schemes announced Â£50 household voucher scheme in draft tourism plan It will allow households to claim back 50% off a stay of two nights or more in certified accommodation, up to the value of Â£100. Vouchers will also be issued, offering 50% off visits to attractions or tourism experience providers, up to the value of Â£20. Every household can apply for one of each type of voucher. The Dark Hedges in north Antrim received a tourism boost due to the popularity of HBO series Game of Thrones. NITA chief executive Joanne Stuart said a lot of people would be disappointed. ""Â£2m has been allocated to this scheme and we do believe the demand will be high and a lot of people will be disappointed, so we would ask the minister to consider the funding he has and whether there is more available to the scheme,"" she said. ""This is not just support for the accommodation sector and tourism attractions. When people stay in a destination, they spend money in hospitality or retail so there would be much more in terms of a wider economic benefit. ""We believe this is a really important intervention for the accommodation and attraction sector and we are working with the department and the minister with regards to when this needs to be launched. ""Given the funding needs to be spent by the end of the financial year we would like to see it launched as soon as possible to see the maximum return on investment,"" she said. Asked if the scheme would be beneficial if launched in January or February, Ms Stuart said she believe it would provide a boost. ""January to March is traditionally the slowest period of the year so if we were able to get a scheme that starts in January, we would get the chance to get the benefit in those slow months,"" she said. ""From 1 April, we are going to see significant cost increases with the rates holiday ending and VAT returning to 20%. ""The majority of tourism businesses have had to take loans and in 2022 the repayments are going to be starting, so anything we can do to help those businesses have a better January to March period would be really good before moving into the high season. We are not out of the woods."" The Giant's Causeway is one of Northern Ireland's best known tourist attractions Northern Ireland's tourism industry has been severely affected by coronavirus restrictions, with lockdowns closing most of the sector. The industry does not expect to welcome international visitors until spring 2022. Under the proposed scheme, money is claimed back by uploading a receipt and voucher details online. A spokesperson for the Department for the Economy told BBC News NI the scheme was one of a number of steps being taken to support the tourism sector. ""The department is currently considering the suitability of the intervention in the context of the levels of consumer demand that were experienced over the summer and the impact of the high street scheme,"" they said. ""This consideration includes working with the industry to decide on the most opportune time to launch any scheme."" Ms Stuart said while there had been support from the domestic market in August and September, the expectation was that demand would begin to fall. ""What we need to remember is the sector has only been able to open for about 50% during 2020 and 50% during 2021,"" she said. ""Year-to-date occupancy figures for hotels are 44% and we are now moving into the low season and there are real financial viability concerns within the industry. ""We are still not out of the woods, so this scheme is really important especially at this time of the year.""

"Bethan Maunder, 45, from Swansea and her daughter before the game against Cardiff On the first weekend since Covid passes were introduced in Wales, football stadiums and nightclubs received a mixed reaction from punters. At the south Wales derby between Swansea and Cardiff City, fans were divided overthe pass, which is now mandatory for over-18s at large events. The pass proves vaccination, a negative lateral flow test in the last 48 hours, or having Covid in the past six months. It applies to nightclubs and stadiums with a capacity of more than 10,000. As fans headed to the Swansea.com Stadium for the derby -which Swansea won 3-0- some said passes were open to abuse and a restriction on personal freedoms, while others said it made them feel safer. What is a Covid pass and how do I get one? Nightclubs reported some confrontations between customers and door staff over the checks. Nick Newman of Cardiff Licensees Forum said reports he received suggested that generally the pass had had a negative impact on venues. He said it was time-consuming to check passes, and the Welsh government website had crashed when customers tried to download them at the door, This video can not be played Shoppers have shared their views on vaccine passes in Wales Swansea City fan Luke Davies said he did not have a problem with the introduction of the Covid pass, as fans attended the derby in person for the first time since January last year. ""Personally I think, if you remember back to last year, there was a long period where we couldn't go to games,"" he said. ""The game this weekend is a big one for the team. We missed out on that last year, it's the one everyone gets excited for. ""If [showing a Covid pass] means we can get back into the stadiums full time then I'm not bothered by the decision. ""I think it's a case of better safe than sorry. It helps the bigger picture really and helps get everything back to normal."" A fan has a Covid pass checked by an official before Sunday's game Pass breaches 'should not be police priority' 'Wales set for more normal Christmas' But Mr Davies, who also hosts the Swans Cast supporters podcast, feared it could put others off attending. ""I think there's been a bit of a mixed reaction,"" he said. ""I understand the frustration for those who chose not to have the vaccine. ""There's a little bit more effort involved there. They have to test proving they're negative to get in and that's a little bit more effort. Some people will be happy just to stay at home, especially if it's on TV."" He said some people had viewed the rule as an ""extra control on society"". ""I've not really heard anyone saying 'this is going to make me feel safer and now I'm happy to go,' but I've definitely seen some that are saying 'I don't want to go while this is a rule, I won't go back, refund my season ticket'. That sort of thing. ""It's a different way of living and I understand some people are not going to be able to adjust as easily as others, so it could definitely have an impact [on attendances]."" Covid passes introduced in Welsh sport First day of Covid passes in Wales Fellow Swansea fan Cath Dyer said she was hopeful most fans would get behind the new requirements. ""It's got to be done, the legislation has been passed, so we've got to follow Welsh government rules,"" she said. ""People, hopefully, will feel a bit safer knowing either that they've either been double jabbed or had a lateral flow test. ""Safety is the top priority and that's what the club are working towards. ""The club wants everything to run as smoothly as possible, because at the end of the day, everybody wants to get into the ground to get all the excitement, the build-up, ready for the game."" Fan Cath Dyer said safety was the top priority as Swansea host rivals Cardiff Some supporters have expressed concern that having to show Covid passes before going in could cause disruption, but Ms Dyer said she was confident the club was well prepared. ""The club was proactive before everything started,"" she said. ""They gave us plenty of warning to get ready before everything came into effect. Everybody knows they have to have their passports, passports will be checked."" Swansea fan Nicola Bennet: ""I'd feel safer with Covid passes - it's good for mass gatherings"" But Mr Davies said he was worried some might not have got the message, which could affect what kind of reception the passes get. ""It might have an impact on how long it takes you to get into the stadium, how early you've got to go down"", he said. ""That will be interesting, to see how many people miss kick-off, and to see if their reaction to the rules then might change after that. ""The club has actually communicated about this and said to bear it in mind and to factor that in to your timings and come down a bit earlier, but not everyone is going to see that. ""I'm not concerned because I'd make sure I account for that, but I can completely understand sometimes you might just get caught out."" Bethan Maunder, 45 from Swansea, said she believed the Covid pass system was flawed, and easy to get around. ""I know there's a lot of people that have got issues with being dictated to, having that restriction of freedom,"" she said. ""The lateral flows don't work, because you self input the data. I do them in work and I can put down negative whether it's positive or negative. ""If you want to get in you're just going to put negative and put that result in."" Fellow supporter John Evans, 74, said he has had all of his jabs and had no issues with passes being required. ""It makes you feel safer if someone hasn't had their jabs, they can't get in,"" he said. Nicola Bennet, 57, from Swansea, said it was a personal choice whether people wanted to get the vaccine or not, but there were ""consequences for that decision"". ""I'd feel safer with Covid passes - it's good for mass gatherings,"" she said. Door staff check passes outside the Philharmonic in Cardiff on the first Saturday since the passes where introduced Gary Lulham, boss of venue Sin City Swansea, said most customers have been ""really good"" but trade had declined. ""We've seen around 25% fewer people than expected but that could have happened anyway,"" he said. ""We had a couple of people who didn't want to do it and were quite vocal about the fact they couldn't come in. ""There is an element of relying on people being honest. ""I have a Covid pass and it is valid until November  - but what happens if I get Covid next week? I still have the pass on my phone."" Michael Kill, from the Night Time Industries Association, said checking Covid passes has led to ""quite a divisive situation on the door"" of clubs. ""We've heard of confrontations between customers and staff because the Covid passport has a poor reputation,"" he said. ""Businesses are picking up the flak from people who haven't had vaccines and not done lateral flow tests."" Health Minister Eluned Morgan toldDewi Llwyd on BBC Radio Cymruthat the pass system ""isn't perfect"". ""But we were also aware, for example, that nightclubs are places where lots of young people congregate, and that there were no other measures, or a very small number of other measures to keep people from coming into contact with another,"" she said. ""Therefore, this hopefully will make a difference, especially amongst young people,"" she said.

"The man arrested by police following the killing of the MP Sir David Amess has been named as Ali Harbi Ali. The 25-year-old is being held under the Terrorism Act and officers have until Friday to question him. Whitehall officials confirmed the man's name to the BBC, and said he was a British man of Somali heritage. The BBC understands Mr Ali was referred to the counter-terrorist Prevent scheme some years ago, but was never a formal subject of interest to MI5. It also understands that his father, Harbi Ali Kullane, who was previously an adviser to Somalia's prime minister, has been visited by police who have taken his phone for analysis. Police officers have spent the weekend searching three addresses in the London area. It is thought a converted Victorian property in Lady Somerset Road in north-west London is linked to the investigation. Neighbours said officers started searching it late on Friday night. Further searches, also believed to be part of the inquiry, have been taking place at a property in Bounds Green Road, north London, and another in Cranmer Road, Croydon. A police search at a house in north London is thought to be linked to the inquiry Sir David, who had been a Conservative MP since 1983, was stabbed multiple times during a regular Friday meeting with his Southend West constituents at Belfairs Methodist Church in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex. Southend councillor John Lamb said he has since spoken to two of Sir David's assistants who were at the constituency surgery with Sir David at the time of the attack. He described how one was in the room with Sir David taking notes. ""All of a sudden there was a scream from her, because the person deliberately whipped out a knife and started stabbing David,"" he said. ""The other lady who was getting names from people outside, she came running in and saw poor David had been stabbed."" He said both were quite distressed but were ""coping quite well"" under the circumstances. Catholic priest Father Jeff Woolnough saidhe tried to administer last rites to Sir Davidshortly after the stabbing but police told him he could not enter a crime scene. Instead, he prayed for his friend on the street behind a police cordon. Sombre mood as town bewildered by MP's killing Not the end of MPs meeting public, says Patel How a tragic day unfolded in Leigh-on-Sea Ali Harbi Ali was initially arrested on suspicion of murder and held in Essex. He has since been transferred to a London police station where he was further detained under Section 41 of the Terrorism Act. Police say they are not looking for anyone else for now. Early investigations revealed a potential motivation linked to Islamist extremism, police said. It is thought Ali Harbi Ali did not spend long in the Prevent programme - which aims to stop people becoming radicalised. Teachers, members of the public, the NHS and others can refer individuals to a local panel of police, social workers and other experts who decide whether and how to intervene in their lives. Engagement in the scheme is voluntary and it is not a criminal sanction. Obituary: Sir David Amess MPs' security being reviewed at pace - speaker Sir David, 69, who was married with four daughters and a son, is the second MP to be killed in recent years following the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox in June 2016. The latest attack has raised concerns for the safety of MPs, many of whom hold constituency surgeries which anyone can attend. Home Secretary Priti Patel said MPs had access to a ""panoply"" of security measures - many of which were put in place after Ms Cox's murder - but said changes could be made to constituency surgeries. Any measures needed to be proportionate, she told the BBC's Andrew Marr show. ""We're here to serve, we're here to be accessible to the British public."" Ms Patel described hearing the news that Sir David had died, saying ""our worlds were shattered"". A post-mortem examination of Sir David took place on Saturday, police said. This video can not be played Watch: Home Secretary Priti Patel says security measures for MPs are ""being looked at"" Meanwhile, Tory MP Andrew Rosindell said the killing of his friend and fellow Essex MP ""shouldn't change things in a way that stops us going about our democratic role"". ""There's got to be some balance to this. I don't have an answer,"" he told BBC Breakfast on Sunday. ""This is not the Britain I want, this is not the country that we're used to."" Labour's Diane Abbott MP said she would prefer to meet constituents behind a screen to prevent possible stabbing attacks. Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle said he wanted to avoid a knee-jerk reaction but insisted ""the best had to come out of this hideous killing"". He said security measures would be reviewed to improve MPs' safety and urged MPs to take up measures already available to them. People in Leigh-on Sea have been remembering Sir David Conservative MP Mark Francois described his colleague as his ""oldest and best friend"" as he laid flowers Tributes to Sir David have been pouring in from politicians and constituents, with the home secretary saying his ""infectious personality"" meant he ""touched so many lives"". Over the weekend, people have gathered for a candlelit vigil in Leigh-on-Sea to mark Sir David's life and attended a church service to share their memories of him. Many constituents have reflected on his gentle nature and willingness to listen and to help. Sir David had long campaigned for Southend to be given city status. On Sunday, Sir Lindsay Hoyle said that would be ""a good thing to do"" in his memory.
