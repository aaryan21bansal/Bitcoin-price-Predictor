Asher-Smith failed to reach the 100m final and later said she would drop out of the 200m because of an injury. But GB claimed the inaugural Olympic triathlon mixed relay title. And their swimmers followed that up by winning the 4x100m mixed medley relay in a world-record time. GB head fourth-place table, Canadian women dominate & Japan get hosts' boost - Tokyo stats Emma Wilson then added a sailing bronze medal in thewomen's RS:X windsurfingand boxer Karriss Artingstall collected featherweight bronze after losing her semi-final against Japan's Sena Irie. It takes GB's total medal haul in Tokyo to 28, with eight gold medals, four of those coming in swimming - the first time they have won that many in the pool in 113 years.

But Great Britain's women's rugby sevens team missed out on a medal, losing 26-19 to France in the semi-finals and laterbeaten 21-12 by Fiji in the bronze-medal match. Meanwhile, US Gymnastics has announced four-time Olympic championSimone Biles will not competein Sunday's vault and uneven bars gymnastics finals. The 24-year-old withdrew from the women's team final and the individual all-around final earlier this week saying she needed to focus on her mental health. A statement from the governing body said it was ""in awe"" of Biles, who is yet to decide if she will compete in the floor final on Monday and the balance beam final on Tuesday, and that she ""continues to handle this situation with courage and grace"". For the first time in the Tokyo Games, Team GB (28 medals) have slipped behind London 2012 (29) and Rio 2016 (30) in the day-by-day medal comparisons The first gold came early on Saturday as Jessica Learmonth, Jonny Brownlee, Georgia Taylor-Brown and Alex Yeewon the first-ever Olympic triathlon mixed relay. Learmonth set the platform, Brownlee broke away from the pack and Taylor-Brown and Yee maintained the advantage to secure Britain's third triathlon medal of the week. ""The Olympics? I've completed it,"" said 31-year-old Brownlee, who claimed bronze at London 2012 and silver at Rio 2016. ""It feels absolutely amazing. It's my third Olympics and I finally walk away with gold."" Britain finished 14 seconds ahead of the United States while France claimed the bronze medal. ""I can't believe it. I was slightly nervous being in a team of Olympic medallists and I'm just so glad we executed a brilliant race,"" said 33-year-old Learmonth. This video can not be played Tokyo Olympics: GB win gold in mixed medley relay in world-record time More success followed in the pool in another event introduced for the Tokyo Olympics, with GB taking a thrilling4x100m mixed medley relay victoryin world-record time. It was Britain's fourth swimming gold in Tokyo - their best total since 1908. A quartet of Kathleen Dawson, Adam Peaty, James Guy and Anna Hopkin won in three minutes 37.58 seconds, with China taking silver and Australia bronze. ""One word has changed the whole British team - belief,"" said Peaty, who also won gold in the 100m breaststroke. ""We believe we can win, we believe we can get world records. If you have belief, you can build everything around that and we showed that here."" Guy was also in the 4x200m freestyle relay team that won gold earlier in the week, and Tom Dean earned the other in the men's 200m freestyle. Caeleb Dressel was part of a USA team that finished fifth in the 4x100m mixed medley relay but earlier claimed his third gold at the Games and set a new100m butterfly world recordin the process. Changes to the schedule at Tokyo are the result of the International Olympic Committee pledging to make this the ""most gender equal"" Games and its president Thomas Bach saying they would be ""more youthful, more urban and include more women"". It means as well as introducing events such as skateboarding, sport climbing and BMX freestyle, nine new mixed-gender disciplines were added to seven current Olympic sports. The British team were hoping to add to the gold medals in triathlon and swimming in the final of the 4x400m mixed relay on the track, but they could only manage sixth as Poland stormed to victory in the inaugural event. They finished ahead of the Dominican Republic in second and the USA in third. Other mixed-gender events have been introduced in archery, judo, table tennis and shooting, where San Marino won a first-ever silver medal and Spain took gold. You can expect to see similar at next year's Beijing Winter Olympics, with mixed snowboarding, freestyle skiing, short track speed skating and ski jumping in the line up. Allow Twitter content?

"Mortgage lenders ""wouldn't touch"" her flat under the current situation, says Emma Lee The government's latest attempts to unlock parts of the property market paralysed by the cladding crisis have stalled, according to campaign groups. An agreement between the High Street's biggest banks and the Ministry of Housing was supposed to pave the way for mortgages to be offered again on more than 800,000 flats in low and medium rise buildings that have been left unsellable after the Grenfell Tragedy in 2017. Last month, Housing Secretary Robert Jenricksaid buildings under 18 metres in height would no longer need an EWS1 fire safety form and should be presumed safe by lenders. But the BBC has learnt that banks are unlikely to change their policies until the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS), which advises property valuers, updates its specialist guidance. Alex Dickin said many people remain stuck in a financially perilous situation. However, in turn RICS has said it can't alter its position on the issue until the government changes its official fire safety advice; that could take until November according to those familiar with the process. Alex Dickin, from campaign group Ipswich Cladiators, warns that many people remain stuck in a financially perilous situation. ""The government announcement has once again made no difference to the millions of leaseholders trapped in unsellable and mortgageable homes. We've yet to see any significant move from lenders,"" Mr Dickin, who's 28, told the BBC. This is a problem of the government's own making. Previously, EWS1 survey forms were only required on the tallest tower blocks. Ministers inadvertently expanded the scope of the cladding crisis in January 2020 whenthey said residential blocks of any height should be checked for fire risks. Mortgage lenders then began demanding fire surveys - known as EWS1 forms - from a much wider range of sellers. Latest government moves won't make a difference, says Emma Lee. Emma Lee's home, in south London, is one of an estimated 3.2 million flats that has been left unsellable as a result. The mother of two bought 50% of her one bed flat under shared ownership in 2008. Her block has four floors. A survey revealed problems with timber cladding and missing fire breaks; Ms Lee fears she will be left with a massive bill for work that may not be necessary. ""The genie is out of the bottle. What the government is now saying won't make any difference. No one wants to buy these flats with these problems, a lender won't touch us at the moment,"" said Ms Lee. Research by a group of independent experts, commissioned by the government, concluded last month that there was no systematic fire risk in buildings below 18 metres. The expert panel said that in most mid and low-rise blocks expensive repair work was unnecessary; instead the fire risk could be managed by installing alarm systems or sprinklers. Grenfell survivor warns lives are still in danger Delay removing dangerous cladding âsoul destroyingâ That brings little comfort to Ms Lee, who said 'extensive remediation works' are still planned for her block with residents facing 'devastating bills on the way and a real possibility of homelessness.' She believes she has become a victim of the zero-risk approach from lenders. For Jelena and Igor Solovjova the problem isn't the cladding on their building in Ipswich, but the insulation and plywood beneath it. When the couple tried to sell their property it was valued at nothing because it didn't have an ESW1 form. Jelena and Igor Solovjova have lost trust in the government Fixing the faults could run into tens of thousands of pounds. Mr Solovjova, 45, has multiple sclerosis and can only work part time. While his wife, Jelena, who is 35, is working three jobs to cover the increasing costs. ""This is stressful for us,"" she said. ""We are disappointed with the current situation. Our trust in government has been shaken, we are confused as to why the government compounds things by not achieving anything and doesn't appear to understand the crisis, our emotions are mixed."" The housing secretary told parliament last month that major lenders had agreed to swiftly change their rules; the Solovjovas are now hoping their building, which is under 18 metres, will now be reassessed. But while banks, including HSBC, Barclays and Lloyds Banking Group, have welcomed the announcement from the Mr Jenrick, the BBC understands it will not change their policies in the short term. UK Finance, which represents the banking industry, said until RICS guidance and the government's official advice is updated ""lenders will continue to be guided by surveyors' expert opinions when a EWS1 form is required for medium and low-rise blocks of flats"". That's left leaseholders like Georgie Hulme, who lives on the third floor of a low-rise block in south Manchester, feeling angry and trapped. Inspections of her building after the Grenfell Tower tragedy revealed problems including dangerous cladding. Georgie Hulme says it's a ""horrendous situation"" Ms Hulme doubts a change to fire safety guidance will make any difference to her and thousands of others who have already been dragged into this crisis. ""All these issues have now been flagged up, how can they all now just be ignored and buildings under 18 metres be deemed as safe?"" she said. ""If you wanted to sell, who would buy any of these flats? I can't see a huge demand. It is impossible to know between the government, manufacturers, developers, managing agents, who can be trusted in this horrendous situation?"" Ms Hulme, 42, who has disabilities and can't work, now fears bankruptcy. Her building is not eligible for any government funding to make it safe. ""For someone like myself who's disabled and on benefits, even if this means that technically I could borrow on the value of my property, the reality is not the case, as nobody would lend to someone in my situation,"" she told the BBC. The Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government said in a statement: ""We are committed to correcting the present market failure and supporting leaseholders to sell their properties should they wish to do so."" ""The view from the independent experts is that there is no evidence of a systemic risk of fire in blocks of flats, but excessive industry caution is leaving many leaseholders in lower risk buildings unable to sell, or facing bills for work which is often not necessary. ""This must stop and, in line with the expert advice, we've set out that EWS1 forms should not be requested for buildings below 18 metres.""

"The Taliban have taken control of Afghanistan, almost 20 years after being ousted by a US-led military coalition. Emboldened by the withdrawal of US troops, they now control all key cities in the country, including Kabul. Who are the Taliban? The Taliban took some areas from government by force. In other areas, the Afghan National Army withdrew without a shot being fired. Although renewed clashes had been going on for several weeks, from 6 August the Taliban made a more rapid advance across the country, as they took control of provincial cities. The maps below start in early July and show the 400 or so government districts as they fell to the Taliban. Source: BBC research. Districts are 2005 government boundaries Ten days that shook Afghanistan US forces based outside Afghanistan had launched air strikes against Taliban positions earlier last week, but they failed to slow the advance of the insurgents. Although most US troops left in July, several thousand returned to Kabul at the weekend to help evacuate American and allied personnel from the capital. The airport in the capital was the only official route out of the country after the Taliban took control of all the major border crossings. Customs duty on goods entering the country via crossings they control is now collected by the Taliban - although exact amounts are unclear as the volume of trade has fallen as a result of the fighting. But, Islam Qala on the border with Iran was, for example, capable of generating more than $20 million per month. Disruption to the flow of imports and exports has affected prices of essential goods in the markets - fuel and foodstuffs in particular. US troops and their Nato and regional allies forced the Taliban from power in November 2001. The group had been harbouring Osama Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda figures linked to the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US. But despite a continued international presence in the region, billions of dollars of support and training for the Afghan government forces, the Taliban regrouped and gradually regained strength in more remote areas. A  BBC study in 2017 showed the Taliban were in full control of a number of districts. But the research also showed they were active in many other parts of the country, mounting weekly or monthly attacks in some areas, suggesting significantly higher strength than previous estimates. In 2017 about 15 million people - half the population - were reported to be living in areas either controlled by the Taliban or where the Taliban were openly present.

"Ministers are no longer considering making it compulsory for university students to be fully vaccinated against Covid to attend lectures in England, the BBC has been told. The foreign secretary previously said students would get ""advance warning"" if they needed to be double jabbed. The government plans to require two jabs to go to nightclubs and other crowded venues from September. More than 72% of UK adults have had two doses so far, while 88.5% have had one. How can I prove I'm fully vaccinated? How many people have been vaccinated so far? The idea of making vaccines compulsory for university students - either to attend lectures or to live in halls of residence - was not ruled out by either education minister Vicky Ford or Downing Street when asked about it earlier this week. And asked whether vaccination would be mandatory for students returning to halls of residence, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said a decision would be taken in September. ""We will certainly make sure university students have advance warning, of course we're going to be mindful of this,""he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday. But now the idea of requiring students in England to show proof of vaccination to attend lectures or stay in halls of residence has been shelved, the BBC has been told. BBC political correspondent Peter Saull said he believed there were two key reasons why the government had rowed back on this. ""The first is logistics - how on earth could universities police this? And there were potentially some legal questions too because when you get an offer of a university place, that is considered to be legally binding,"" our correspondent said. ""But also I think ministers are keenly aware that unease is growing in the Conservative backbenches about this wider issue of vaccine passports."" The governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are in charge of their own coronavirus rules and education policy. Unions have been critical of making vaccines mandatory for university students. The University and College Union previously said this would be wrong and ""hugely discriminatory against those who are unable to be vaccinated"" as well as for international students. And the National Union of Students had called the idea ""appalling"", accusing the government of ""lining students up as scapegoats"". Both Labour and leading universities have called for vaccination centres to be set up on campuses so that students are jabbed before the winter. The Russell Group - made up of the UK's top universities - has offered its own spaces and facilities to be used as pop-up centres. All over-18s in the UK have now been offered a first dose of a Covid vaccine - and people can get their second dose eight weeks later. This means the government expects all adults to have had the opportunity to have both jabs by the end of September. However, 32% of 18 to 29-year-olds in England had not had their first dose by 25 July, according to the latest data from NHS England. From the end of September, ministers have said people will need proof of full vaccination to attend nightclubs and other crowded venues in England. The full details of the plan are yet to be seen but an NHS Covid Pass - which you can obtain electronically or as a letter - will be used as proof. Meanwhile, a letter sent to GPs last week by NHS England said those who were three months away from turning 18 could get their first jab immediately. But families have criticised the guidance, which also warns doctors not to begin vaccinating some clinically vulnerable children against Covid-19 - because they may not be covered by insurance. Some GPs have said it has created mixed messages and confusion. The document said more information would be provided soon. Earlier this month, the government's vaccine advisers recommended offering the Pfizer jab to children in England, which includes about 150,000 12-15 year olds most at risk. In response, the NHS said there was ""no delay"" to vaccinating children in this age group and they would be offered a first dose before the start of the school year. It said the letter to GPs made clear a national indemnity contract will be set out shortly. Will my child get the vaccine? Elsewhere, the Equalities and Human Rights Commission has warned companies that rules requiring staff to be fully vaccinated must not be disproportionate and discriminatory. The rights watchdog said it understood that firms will want to protect their staff and customers by requiring employees to be vaccinated but advised that they consider other factors. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has previously suggested it is a good idea for people to be double-jabbed before returning to the office, but legislation would not require it. Guidance from the CIPD,external, the trade body for human resources professionals, says that while employers do have a duty of care to employees they cannot force them to have the vaccine. A further 26,144 coronavirus cases have been recorded in the UK and another 71 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according to Saturday's government figures.

"One in five firms plan on letting staff go in response to Sunday's furlough policy change, which will see employers contribute more, a survey has found. The British Chamber of Commerce said extra training was needed to deal with thousands of redundancies predicted. From Sunday, government payments reduce to 60% towards salaries, with employers paying 20%. The government said the approach was ""right"" and meant ""we can focus support elsewhere"" as the economy recovers. According to the most recent figures up to 30 June, about 1.9m workers were on furlough, down from a peak of 5.1m in January. The government said 11.6 million jobs have been supported since the Job Retention Scheme launched in April 2020. The scheme is due to close at the end of September. How is furlough changing? Fewest people on furlough since pandemic began It meant that staff whose jobs were put on hold during the coronavirus pandemic were guaranteed 80% of their salaries - to a limit - from the government. As the scheme winds down, the support is slowly being made less generous. Since 1 July, employers have been asked to contribute 10% towards the wages of furloughed workers for hours their staff do not work. That amount has now risen to 20% during August and September. The British Chamber of Commerce surveyed 250 businesses, with 18% telling the chamber they were likely to make staff redundant in response to the change to furlough. A quarter said they would aim to reduce hours or move staff to part-time working patterns. Jane Gratton, head of people policy at the chamber, said the change ""will likely result in many thousands of people being released back into the labour market, as employers who are still struggling to recover from the recession are forced to make redundancies and cuts to working hours"". She said it was ""crucial"" that employers and the government give returning furloughed workers the support and training they need ""to be re-engaged and productive"". Hannah Slaughter, an economist from the Resolution Foundation, told the BBC that over the majority of the pandemic, the highest rates of furlough was among the under 25s, but the most recent data it was the over 60s who were more likely to be furloughed. ""That's concerning because we are likely to see a rise in unemployment when the Job Retention Scheme ends in the autumn and any workers who are left on furlough are more likely to become unemployed,"" she said. She said older people were more likely to leave the workforce when they lose their jobs and those who return in a new job were ""more likely to face a pay penalty"" relative to younger workers. The government said its employment programmes were working and had supported workers' livelihoods through the pandemic. ""We've always been clear that it's not possible to save every job, but our Plan for Jobs is helping people of all ages find the skills they need to get back into work,"" a spokesman said.

"The travel industry is one sector which still has high numbers of staff on furlough, figures show Making businesses pay more to furloughed staff could push firms ""off a cliff edge"" as they are trying to recover from Covid, unions have warned. Almost 70,000 people in Wales were on furlough at the end of June,according to latest figures. Unions have warned changes from Sunday, doubling the amount firms pay, put jobs at risk and call for it to be delayed. The UK government said the furlough scheme was in place until September to provide ""certainty over the summer"". At the height of the pandemic last year, 378,400 people in Wales were furloughed. But as lockdown restrictions eased, numbers on the government's coronavirus job retention scheme have fallen - with an estimated 68,800 furloughed at the end of June,according to UK government figures,external. What impact has the furlough scheme had? How many people are now on furlough? Fewest people on furlough since pandemic began Staff returned to work in most sectors as the country reopened but some employed in the travel and hospitality industries remain on flexi-furlough - and work is based on demand. Numbers furloughed in the hospitality industry have fallen since bars and pubs reopened Furlough was introduced in spring 2020 to stop people being laid off by their employers during lockdown. The government initially paid 80% of the wages of people who could not work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them, up to a monthly limit of Â£2,500. But the scheme is being wound down, and since 1 July, employers have been asked to contribute 10% towards the wages of furloughed workers - with the government's contribution falling to 70%. That amount is now set to rise to 20%. The monthly limit of Â£2,500 will stay in place, so workers will not notice the difference. However, by making furlough more expensive for employers, the UK government hopes to encourage them to take workers back full-time if they can. The scheme is set to continue until 30 September. Ahead of the changes, unions warned the increased financial burden on firms could hit industries just as they were trying to recover from repeated lockdowns. With coronavirus measures still in place restricting numbers allowed in bars and restaurants, nightclubs unable to open and many not going abroad on holiday due to Covid rules, unions fear the travel and hospitality sectors could be badly affected. The Wales TUC said some firms were still having to furlough staff due to not being able to open fully, and ""half of all staff in travel agencies are still on furlough"". ""We do feel that doubling the employer contribution is too much too soon, and puts jobs at risk in some parts of the economy,"" a spokesperson said. The union representing travel and transport industries, the TSSA, said many people were still wary of booking holidays abroad and companies were struggling to survive. ""Any cuts to the furlough scheme will be like kicking people when they're already down,"" General Secretary Manuel Cortes said. ""With no structured plan to provide the extra support, we are likely to see more travel agencies go under."" After months of being ground to a halt due to travel restrictions in the pandemic, drivers are back on the roads taking people on trips across the UK. ""We were faced with the really difficult decision of laying everyone off if it wasn't for furlough. It was a godsend,"" said Jason Edwards, director of Llantrisant-based Edwards Coaches. More than 500 staff at Edwards Coaches were furloughed when the pandemic struck He said while it was good more than 500 staff who were on furlough were now back at work, the company was struggling with staff needing to take holidays, and being unable to recruit to deal with demand. ""You'd pinch yourself after the 14 to 15 months we've had, but we are short of staff,"" he said. ""There's a huge appetite for travel, but I feel there's a reluctance now to change jobs because people are nervous they might lose their furlough protection."" What's it like to be on furlough for a year? 'I fell through the gap with the furlough scheme' Why are hospitality workers leaving the industry? Mr Edwards said changes to furlough should be industry-specific as the scheme comes to an end. In Denbighshire, drivers have been excited to welcome back customers at Voel Coaches, but manager Chris Gentle said he was ""extremely concerned"" furlough was being wound down just before winter. While 50 staff who had been furloughed are now back in work, they are on flexi-furlough, allowing the company to send them home if they hit a quiet period. ""We are receiving a high number of bookings, and starting to operate back to full capacity on some trips, but there's still that knock-on effect of a whole 16 months of being closed, with overheads and maintenance still being paid,"" he said. The tourism and hospitality sectors are among the main users of furlough now ""We are trying to recover from that, and also now paying more of the staff wages when they go into furlough, and team that with the winter, it's really unsettling."" The Welsh government said it had repeatedly called on the UK government not to withdraw the furlough scheme until the economy ""is ready"". Allow Twitter content?

The UK government said the scheme had protected over 11.6 million jobs and eligible tourism businesses would also continue to benefit from reduced VAT until March 2022. ""We deliberately went long with our support to provide certainty to people and businesses over the summer,"" a spokesperson said. ""Businesses can also continue to access other support including our Recovery Loan scheme - and we recently made cautious changes to the requirements for international travel which will support activity within the industry.""

"Ministers are no longer considering making it compulsory for university students to be fully vaccinated against Covid to attend lectures in England, the BBC has been told. The foreign secretary previously said students would get ""advance warning"" if they needed to be double jabbed. The government plans to require two jabs to go to nightclubs and other crowded venues from September. More than 72% of UK adults have had two doses so far, while 88.5% have had one. How can I prove I'm fully vaccinated? How many people have been vaccinated so far? The idea of making vaccines compulsory for university students - either to attend lectures or to live in halls of residence - was not ruled out by either education minister Vicky Ford or Downing Street when asked about it earlier this week. And asked whether vaccination would be mandatory for students returning to halls of residence, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said a decision would be taken in September. ""We will certainly make sure university students have advance warning, of course we're going to be mindful of this,""he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday. But now the idea of requiring students in England to show proof of vaccination to attend lectures or stay in halls of residence has been shelved, the BBC has been told. BBC political correspondent Peter Saull said he believed there were two key reasons why the government had rowed back on this. ""The first is logistics - how on earth could universities police this? And there were potentially some legal questions too because when you get an offer of a university place, that is considered to be legally binding,"" our correspondent said. ""But also I think ministers are keenly aware that unease is growing in the Conservative backbenches about this wider issue of vaccine passports."" The governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are in charge of their own coronavirus rules and education policy. Unions have been critical of making vaccines mandatory for university students. The University and College Union previously said this would be wrong and ""hugely discriminatory against those who are unable to be vaccinated"" as well as for international students. And the National Union of Students had called the idea ""appalling"", accusing the government of ""lining students up as scapegoats"". Both Labour and leading universities have called for vaccination centres to be set up on campuses so that students are jabbed before the winter. The Russell Group - made up of the UK's top universities - has offered its own spaces and facilities to be used as pop-up centres. All over-18s in the UK have now been offered a first dose of a Covid vaccine - and people can get their second dose eight weeks later. This means the government expects all adults to have had the opportunity to have both jabs by the end of September. However, 32% of 18 to 29-year-olds in England had not had their first dose by 25 July, according to the latest data from NHS England. From the end of September, ministers have said people will need proof of full vaccination to attend nightclubs and other crowded venues in England. The full details of the plan are yet to be seen but an NHS Covid Pass - which you can obtain electronically or as a letter - will be used as proof. Meanwhile, a letter sent to GPs last week by NHS England said those who were three months away from turning 18 could get their first jab immediately. But families have criticised the guidance, which also warns doctors not to begin vaccinating some clinically vulnerable children against Covid-19 - because they may not be covered by insurance. Some GPs have said it has created mixed messages and confusion. The document said more information would be provided soon. Earlier this month, the government's vaccine advisers recommended offering the Pfizer jab to children in England, which includes about 150,000 12-15 year olds most at risk. In response, the NHS said there was ""no delay"" to vaccinating children in this age group and they would be offered a first dose before the start of the school year. It said the letter to GPs made clear a national indemnity contract will be set out shortly. Will my child get the vaccine? Elsewhere, the Equalities and Human Rights Commission has warned companies that rules requiring staff to be fully vaccinated must not be disproportionate and discriminatory. The rights watchdog said it understood that firms will want to protect their staff and customers by requiring employees to be vaccinated but advised that they consider other factors. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has previously suggested it is a good idea for people to be double-jabbed before returning to the office, but legislation would not require it. Guidance from the CIPD,external, the trade body for human resources professionals, says that while employers do have a duty of care to employees they cannot force them to have the vaccine. A further 26,144 coronavirus cases have been recorded in the UK and another 71 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according to Saturday's government figures.

"The owners of Escobar said the venue's name was a ""play on words"" Owners of a South American-themed bar that shares its name with notorious Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar have been urged to rethink their branding. Colombians living in Nottingham said calling the venue Escobar was in poor taste, given the pain and death inflicted by the famous cartel boss. They also criticised a mural inside the bar that appears to depict Escobar. A bar spokesperson said the venue's name was just a ""play on words"" and the mural was not based on Pablo Escobar. Pablo Escobar was the leader of the Medellin drugs cartel in Colombia and one of the wealthiest villains in history. During the 1980s, he was the biggest manufacturer and distributor of cocaine in the world, responsible for as much as 80% of the global trade in the drug at that time. Thousands of people were killed during his reign of terror before he was shot dead by police in 1993. Pablo Escobar became the world's most notorious drug lord The Escobar venue launched in Market Street in Nottingham in December but could not host customers until May due to Covid restrictions. Maria Motonya, who left her home in Medellin in 1985 and has lived in the UK for 20 years, said she was appalled at the bar's name. ""For me it's very distasteful and insensitive,"" she said. ""Clearly the owners did not do their research. ""In Medellin we were terrified, afraid to come to the door. ""My father's family were beheaded because they wouldn't give him [Escobar] their farm. ""Escobar is a very common name in South America but with the mural and everything else, this bar has a very clear association with Pablo Escobar. ""You'd have to be blind not to see that. ""And what are we saying to young people who visit this bar. That it's OK to be a gangster? That it's OK to be associated with drugs? ""I think they [the owners] have probably been watching too many American films."" Carolina and Katherine Hannigan have both urged the bar's owner to change the name Katherine Hannigan, who lives in Nottingham but has a Colombian mother, said she was ""disgusted"" by the bar's name and felt it glamorised terror. ""Escobar murdered thousands of innocent Colombians, groomed children, raped young women and stole land from farmers, leaving them homeless and starving,"" she said. ""Did they not know or did they not care? I don't know which is worse. Will their next bar be called Bin Laden Cafe? ""It feels like they are capitalising on our history yet excluding us by celebrating our most painful past."" Her sister Carolina Hannigan said: ""Escobar wasn't some Hollywood Netflix gangster. He was a horrible, evil man who did unspeakable things to his own community. ""Yet this bar wants you to have a drink in memory of him and feel like a gangster next to a shrine of a murderer."" Escobar said the mural was there to bring a ""South American theme"" to the restaurant Escobar's owners said: ""Our bar does not glamorise a known drug lord and we are not a Colombian bar. ""We are a Latin American bar and restaurant, and the mural in question is one of three which all have tried to bring a South American theme to the restaurant. ""We decided to go with the name Escobar as it is just a clever play on words, incorporating the word 'bar' into our name. ""We have tried to react very amicably and even apologised for any resemblance that may have hurt the sentiments of our community. ""We have no connections to the drug lord nor do we have any affiliations with his network. ""As a gesture of goodwill, we offered to host some charity events to support the Colombian community.""

"It is traditional in Hindu and Sikh communities for the cremated ashes of the dead to be scattered into flowing water A site where Sikhs and Hindus can scatter the ashes of loved ones has been officially opened in south Wales. It is traditional in both religions for bodies to be cremated and their ashes scattered into flowing water to be carried out to sea. The site at Llandaff Rowing Club in Cardiff, on the River Taff, is the first of its kind in Wales. Channi Kaler, from the Antim Sanskar Group Wales (ASGW), said he was ""really excited"" before Saturday's ceremony. 'More and more people don't want a traditional burial' In pictures: Diwali celebrations around the world Lockdown Diwali 'is like our Christmas gone' Mr Kaler began searching for a site for people from the Sikh and Hindu communities after his sister almost slipped into a river while scattering his father's ashes at Pontsarn, Merthyr Tydfil, in 2012. He said: ""My sister, who had come from California, was with us and we went to scatter the ashes. ""Because it was a rainy day, the bank was quite slippery and she slipped and nearly fell into the river. It could've been a nasty accident."" Radhika Kadaba's family were able to use the pontoon in Cardiff to scatter her father's ashes when they were unable to return to India due to Covid rules Mr Kaler, a Tanzanian-born Sikh who moved to Wales in 1961, contacted the Hindu community and together they formed the ASGW. The group then spent several years looking for a suitable spot for people to perform the last rites of dead family and friends, with the rowing club eventually agreed with Cardiff council. Anyone who wishes to scatter ashes there can book to use the site - a pontoon shared with the rowing club - close to Llandaff Weir. Mr Kaler, from Caerphilly, said he was only aware of one other dedicated site in the UK, in Leicester. The pontoon has been in use since November, although Covid restrictions have prevented it being officially opened until now. Vimla Patel (right) and Radhika Kadaba (left) performed prayers to sanctify the site in July 2020 Radhika Kadaba, the general secretary of the ASGW and the Hindu Council of Wales, has already used it to scatter her father's ashes after her family was unable to travel to India, where cremated remains are traditionally scattered into the River Ganges. She said: ""Last year, at the beginning of the pandemic, we lost my father. Usually we take the ashes back home to India, but obviously we haven't been able go to India or travel anywhere. ""My children couldn't come to his funeral either, they're all in England."" She added the opening of the site had come ""at the right time"" for the communities, particularly after the pandemic, with her children able to gather a few months ago to scatter her father's ashes. Sikh food bank helps hundreds during pandemic The Sikh temple that's gone 100% plastic-free Vimla Patel, chairwoman of the ASGW, said the site was also very important to British Hindus and Sikhs who feel most strongly connected to the UK and wish to have their ashes scattered here. She said: ""This is an important aspect of the last rites for the departed souls. ""There are three generations of Hindus and Sikhs living in Wales. They used to take the ashes to the motherland and now people want to scatter their ashes in Wales."" The Antim Sanskar Group Wales has worked for nine years to find a suitable site in Wales The platform was officially opened on Saturday at a ceremony attended by members of Cardiff council and First Minister Mark Drakeford. A Cardiff council spokesperson said: ""The ASGW have been working with the council for a number of years to identify a suitable location where cremated remains can be dispersed into a flowing water course - as is the tradition of the Sikh and Hindu faiths. ""Several areas have been considered over this time, but this location and partnership with the rowing club proved to be the best option by far and was welcomed by the group when first suggested. ""It has taken some time to get the platform in place due to engineering issues, as well as problems caused by the pandemic, but we now have a permanent and managed location that will be used by the current and future generations of the Sikh and Hindu communities.""

Dina Asher-Smith, Team GB's poster girl of the Games, failed to make the 100m final, and then announced she would be withdrawing from the 200m because of a torn hamstring. Her interview was heartbreaking. The 100m final, the blue riband event, took place later on with a stellar line-up, featuring GB's Daryll Neita.

""It broke my heart because I am a competitor. It is the Olympics but there are plenty other championships for me to come and kill,"" she told BBC Sport. GB'sDaryll Neitaedged through to her first major individual final by one one-thousandth of a second, but finished eighth asElaine Thompson-Herah took goldin a Jamaican clean sweep.

Meanwhile, US Gymnastics has announced four-time Olympic championSimone Biles will not competein Sunday's vault and uneven bars gymnastics finals. The 24-year-old withdrew from the women's team final and the individual all-around final earlier this week saying she needed to focus on her mental health. A statement from the governing body said it was ""in awe"" of Biles, who is yet to decide if she will compete in the floor final on Monday and the balance beam final on Tuesday, and that she ""continues to handle this situation with courage and grace"". For the first time in the Tokyo Games, Team GB (28 medals) have slipped behind London 2012 (29) and Rio 2016 (30) in the day-by-day medal comparisons The first gold came early on Saturday as Jessica Learmonth, Jonny Brownlee, Georgia Taylor-Brown and Alex Yeewon the first-ever Olympic triathlon mixed relay.

Britain finished 14 seconds ahead of the United States while France claimed the bronze medal. ""I can't believe it. I was slightly nervous being in a team of Olympic medallists and I'm just so glad we executed a brilliant race,"" said 33-year-old Learmonth. This video can not be played Tokyo Olympics: GB win gold in mixed medley relay in world-record time More success followed in the pool in another event introduced for the Tokyo Olympics, with GB taking a thrilling4x100m mixed medley relay victoryin world-record time. It was Britain's fourth swimming gold in Tokyo - their best total since 1908. A quartet of Kathleen Dawson, Adam Peaty, James Guy and Anna Hopkin won in three minutes 37.58 seconds, with China taking silver and Australia bronze. ""One word has changed the whole British team - belief,"" said Peaty, who also won gold in the 100m breaststroke. ""We believe we can win, we believe we can get world records. If you have belief, you can build everything around that and we showed that here."" Guy was also in the 4x200m freestyle relay team that won gold earlier in the week, and Tom Dean earned the other in the men's 200m freestyle. Caeleb Dressel was part of a USA team that finished fifth in the 4x100m mixed medley relay but earlier claimed his third gold at the Games and set a new100m butterfly world recordin the process. Changes to the schedule at Tokyo are the result of the International Olympic Committee pledging to make this the ""most gender equal"" Games and its president Thomas Bach saying they would be ""more youthful, more urban and include more women"". It means as well as introducing events such as skateboarding, sport climbing and BMX freestyle, nine new mixed-gender disciplines were added to seven current Olympic sports. The British team were hoping to add to the gold medals in triathlon and swimming in the final of the 4x400m mixed relay on the track, but they could only manage sixth as Poland stormed to victory in the inaugural event. They finished ahead of the Dominican Republic in second and the USA in third. Other mixed-gender events have been introduced in archery, judo, table tennis and shooting, where San Marino won a first-ever silver medal and Spain took gold. You can expect to see similar at next year's Beijing Winter Olympics, with mixed snowboarding, freestyle skiing, short track speed skating and ski jumping in the line up. Allow Twitter content?

"Ministers are no longer considering making it compulsory for university students to be fully vaccinated against Covid to attend lectures in England, the BBC has been told. The foreign secretary previously said students would get ""advance warning"" if they needed to be double jabbed. The government plans to require two jabs to go to nightclubs and other crowded venues from September. More than 72% of UK adults have had two doses so far, while 88.5% have had one. How can I prove I'm fully vaccinated? How many people have been vaccinated so far? The idea of making vaccines compulsory for university students - either to attend lectures or to live in halls of residence - was not ruled out by either education minister Vicky Ford or Downing Street when asked about it earlier this week. And asked whether vaccination would be mandatory for students returning to halls of residence, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said a decision would be taken in September. ""We will certainly make sure university students have advance warning, of course we're going to be mindful of this,""he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday. But now the idea of requiring students in England to show proof of vaccination to attend lectures or stay in halls of residence has been shelved, the BBC has been told. BBC political correspondent Peter Saull said he believed there were two key reasons why the government had rowed back on this. ""The first is logistics - how on earth could universities police this? And there were potentially some legal questions too because when you get an offer of a university place, that is considered to be legally binding,"" our correspondent said. ""But also I think ministers are keenly aware that unease is growing in the Conservative backbenches about this wider issue of vaccine passports."" The governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are in charge of their own coronavirus rules and education policy. Unions have been critical of making vaccines mandatory for university students. The University and College Union previously said this would be wrong and ""hugely discriminatory against those who are unable to be vaccinated"" as well as for international students. And the National Union of Students had called the idea ""appalling"", accusing the government of ""lining students up as scapegoats"". Both Labour and leading universities have called for vaccination centres to be set up on campuses so that students are jabbed before the winter. The Russell Group - made up of the UK's top universities - has offered its own spaces and facilities to be used as pop-up centres. All over-18s in the UK have now been offered a first dose of a Covid vaccine - and people can get their second dose eight weeks later. This means the government expects all adults to have had the opportunity to have both jabs by the end of September. However, 32% of 18 to 29-year-olds in England had not had their first dose by 25 July, according to the latest data from NHS England. From the end of September, ministers have said people will need proof of full vaccination to attend nightclubs and other crowded venues in England. The full details of the plan are yet to be seen but an NHS Covid Pass - which you can obtain electronically or as a letter - will be used as proof. Meanwhile, a letter sent to GPs last week by NHS England said those who were three months away from turning 18 could get their first jab immediately. But families have criticised the guidance, which also warns doctors not to begin vaccinating some clinically vulnerable children against Covid-19 - because they may not be covered by insurance. Some GPs have said it has created mixed messages and confusion. The document said more information would be provided soon. Earlier this month, the government's vaccine advisers recommended offering the Pfizer jab to children in England, which includes about 150,000 12-15 year olds most at risk. In response, the NHS said there was ""no delay"" to vaccinating children in this age group and they would be offered a first dose before the start of the school year. It said the letter to GPs made clear a national indemnity contract will be set out shortly. Will my child get the vaccine? Elsewhere, the Equalities and Human Rights Commission has warned companies that rules requiring staff to be fully vaccinated must not be disproportionate and discriminatory. The rights watchdog said it understood that firms will want to protect their staff and customers by requiring employees to be vaccinated but advised that they consider other factors. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has previously suggested it is a good idea for people to be double-jabbed before returning to the office, but legislation would not require it. Guidance from the CIPD,external, the trade body for human resources professionals, says that while employers do have a duty of care to employees they cannot force them to have the vaccine. A further 26,144 coronavirus cases have been recorded in the UK and another 71 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according to Saturday's government figures.

"Donald Trump still has ways to try to fight the justice department's ruling in court The US justice department has ordered the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to hand over former President Donald Trump's tax returns to Congress. The move reverses a 2019 finding that the request from the House Ways and Means Committee was ""disingenuous"". The decision appears to end a long legal battle over the records, and is seen as a sharp legal blow to Mr Trump. Although not required by law, every US president since 1976 - except Mr Trump - has released their tax returns. Mr Trump is yet to publicly comment on the latest developments, although he still has ways to try to fight the ruling in court. Republicans on Capitol Hill denounced the decision, describing it as politically motivated. When he was president, Mr Trump repeatedly said he was under audit by the IRS and so could not release his tax returns - although the IRS has said an audit would not stop the release of the information. The House Ways and Means Committee has previously argued that it required the Republican former president's tax returns for an investigation into whether he complied with tax law. The Trump-era justice department, however, refused to hand them over. It argued that the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives was seeking them for partisan political gain. In an opinion released on Friday, the justice department's Office of Legal Counsel determined that the committee ""has invoked sufficient reasons"" for requesting the tax information. ""Treasury must furnish the information to the Committee,"" the opinion said. Among those who praised the decision was House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, who said the American people ""deserve to know the facts of his troubling conflicts and undermining of our security and democracy as president"". In February, Mr Trump was ordered by the US Supreme Court to hand over his tax returns and other financial records to prosecutors in New York. The decision was a blow to Mr Trump, who had been in a legal battle to protect his records from a grand jury. He has continuously denied any wrongdoing and has called the investigation into his tax affairs a ""witch hunt"".

Dina Asher-Smith, Team GB's poster girl of the Games, failed to make the 100m final, and then announced she would be withdrawing from the 200m because of a torn hamstring. Her interview was heartbreaking. The 100m final, the blue riband event, took place later on with a stellar line-up, featuring GB's Daryll Neita. Elaine Thompson-Herah won in a new Olympic record, defending her title from Rio 2016. Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce and Shericka Jackson completed a Jamaican one-two-three. In boxing, Great Britain's Karriss Artingstall claimed Olympic bronze in Tokyo after a narrow defeat by Japan's Sena Irie in the semi-finals. She was denied the chance to fight for gold as Irie edged a 3-2 split-decision win at the Kokugikan Arena. Artingstall's flat-mate Lauren Price will also return home with a medal after a dominant win over Panama's Atheyna Bylon earlier on Saturday. The Welsh middleweight won 5-0 to guarantee at least a bronze and book a place in Friday's semi-finals, where she will face Nouchka Fontijn of the Netherlands. The Olympic debutant is the number one seed having won gold at the 2019 World Championships and the 2018 Commonwealth Games. Price is the fourth member of GB's boxing team for Tokyo 2020 to guarantee a medal, after Artingstall,Pat McCormack and Ben Whittaker. Women's RS:X There was a medal on the waves as GB windsurferEmma Wilson won bronzeon her Olympics debut. The 22-year-old was already guaranteed a medal after winning four of her 12 races heading into Saturday's final, but gold was taken by China's Lu Yunxiu while Rio 2016 champion Charline Picon of France took silver. Wilson's mother, Penny, was world windsurfing champion in 1986, 1990 and 1991, and represented Great Britain at the 1992 and 1996 Olympics. Men's singles In tennis, Novak Djokovic wasn't a happy man. Hemissed out on a medalin Tokyo, beaten 6-4 6-7 (6-8) 6-3 by Pablo Carreno Busta in the bronze medal match. The Serb then pulled out of his mixed doubles bronze medal match with an injury to leave Tokyo empty-handed. His poor racquet bore the brunt of his frustration. 4x100m mixed medley relay Turns out us Brits are pretty good at mixed events.

Asher-Smith failed to reach the 100m final and later said she would drop out of the 200m because of an injury. But GB claimed the inaugural Olympic triathlon mixed relay title. And their swimmers followed that up by winning the 4x100m mixed medley relay in a world-record time. GB head fourth-place table, Canadian women dominate & Japan get hosts' boost - Tokyo stats Emma Wilson then added a sailing bronze medal in thewomen's RS:X windsurfingand boxer Karriss Artingstall collected featherweight bronze after losing her semi-final against Japan's Sena Irie.

The 25-year-old spoke afterwards about her lack of preparation for the Games after suffering a hamstring tear and, in an emotional interview, said shewould not compete in the 200m,an event in which she is the reigning world champion. ""It broke my heart because I am a competitor. It is the Olympics but there are plenty other championships for me to come and kill,"" she told BBC Sport. GB'sDaryll Neitaedged through to her first major individual final by one one-thousandth of a second, but finished eighth asElaine Thompson-Herah took goldin a Jamaican clean sweep.

Meanwhile, US Gymnastics has announced four-time Olympic championSimone Biles will not competein Sunday's vault and uneven bars gymnastics finals. The 24-year-old withdrew from the women's team final and the individual all-around final earlier this week saying she needed to focus on her mental health. A statement from the governing body said it was ""in awe"" of Biles, who is yet to decide if she will compete in the floor final on Monday and the balance beam final on Tuesday, and that she ""continues to handle this situation with courage and grace"". For the first time in the Tokyo Games, Team GB (28 medals) have slipped behind London 2012 (29) and Rio 2016 (30) in the day-by-day medal comparisons The first gold came early on Saturday as Jessica Learmonth, Jonny Brownlee, Georgia Taylor-Brown and Alex Yeewon the first-ever Olympic triathlon mixed relay. Learmonth set the platform, Brownlee broke away from the pack and Taylor-Brown and Yee maintained the advantage to secure Britain's third triathlon medal of the week. ""The Olympics? I've completed it,"" said 31-year-old Brownlee, who claimed bronze at London 2012 and silver at Rio 2016. ""It feels absolutely amazing. It's my third Olympics and I finally walk away with gold."" Britain finished 14 seconds ahead of the United States while France claimed the bronze medal. ""I can't believe it. I was slightly nervous being in a team of Olympic medallists and I'm just so glad we executed a brilliant race,"" said 33-year-old Learmonth. This video can not be played Tokyo Olympics: GB win gold in mixed medley relay in world-record time More success followed in the pool in another event introduced for the Tokyo Olympics, with GB taking a thrilling4x100m mixed medley relay victoryin world-record time. It was Britain's fourth swimming gold in Tokyo - their best total since 1908. A quartet of Kathleen Dawson, Adam Peaty, James Guy and Anna Hopkin won in three minutes 37.58 seconds, with China taking silver and Australia bronze. ""One word has changed the whole British team - belief,"" said Peaty, who also won gold in the 100m breaststroke. ""We believe we can win, we believe we can get world records. If you have belief, you can build everything around that and we showed that here."" Guy was also in the 4x200m freestyle relay team that won gold earlier in the week, and Tom Dean earned the other in the men's 200m freestyle. Caeleb Dressel was part of a USA team that finished fifth in the 4x100m mixed medley relay but earlier claimed his third gold at the Games and set a new100m butterfly world recordin the process. Changes to the schedule at Tokyo are the result of the International Olympic Committee pledging to make this the ""most gender equal"" Games and its president Thomas Bach saying they would be ""more youthful, more urban and include more women"". It means as well as introducing events such as skateboarding, sport climbing and BMX freestyle, nine new mixed-gender disciplines were added to seven current Olympic sports. The British team were hoping to add to the gold medals in triathlon and swimming in the final of the 4x400m mixed relay on the track, but they could only manage sixth as Poland stormed to victory in the inaugural event. They finished ahead of the Dominican Republic in second and the USA in third. Other mixed-gender events have been introduced in archery, judo, table tennis and shooting, where San Marino won a first-ever silver medal and Spain took gold. You can expect to see similar at next year's Beijing Winter Olympics, with mixed snowboarding, freestyle skiing, short track speed skating and ski jumping in the line up. Allow Twitter content?

"The owners of Escobar said the venue's name was a ""play on words"" Owners of a South American-themed bar that shares its name with notorious Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar have been urged to rethink their branding. Colombians living in Nottingham said calling the venue Escobar was in poor taste, given the pain and death inflicted by the famous cartel boss. They also criticised a mural inside the bar that appears to depict Escobar. A bar spokesperson said the venue's name was just a ""play on words"" and the mural was not based on Pablo Escobar. Pablo Escobar was the leader of the Medellin drugs cartel in Colombia and one of the wealthiest villains in history. During the 1980s, he was the biggest manufacturer and distributor of cocaine in the world, responsible for as much as 80% of the global trade in the drug at that time. Thousands of people were killed during his reign of terror before he was shot dead by police in 1993. Pablo Escobar became the world's most notorious drug lord The Escobar venue launched in Market Street in Nottingham in December but could not host customers until May due to Covid restrictions. Maria Motonya, who left her home in Medellin in 1985 and has lived in the UK for 20 years, said she was appalled at the bar's name. ""For me it's very distasteful and insensitive,"" she said. ""Clearly the owners did not do their research. ""In Medellin we were terrified, afraid to come to the door. ""My father's family were beheaded because they wouldn't give him [Escobar] their farm. ""Escobar is a very common name in South America but with the mural and everything else, this bar has a very clear association with Pablo Escobar. ""You'd have to be blind not to see that. ""And what are we saying to young people who visit this bar. That it's OK to be a gangster? That it's OK to be associated with drugs? ""I think they [the owners] have probably been watching too many American films."" Carolina and Katherine Hannigan have both urged the bar's owner to change the name Katherine Hannigan, who lives in Nottingham but has a Colombian mother, said she was ""disgusted"" by the bar's name and felt it glamorised terror. ""Escobar murdered thousands of innocent Colombians, groomed children, raped young women and stole land from farmers, leaving them homeless and starving,"" she said. ""Did they not know or did they not care? I don't know which is worse. Will their next bar be called Bin Laden Cafe? ""It feels like they are capitalising on our history yet excluding us by celebrating our most painful past."" Her sister Carolina Hannigan said: ""Escobar wasn't some Hollywood Netflix gangster. He was a horrible, evil man who did unspeakable things to his own community. ""Yet this bar wants you to have a drink in memory of him and feel like a gangster next to a shrine of a murderer."" Escobar said the mural was there to bring a ""South American theme"" to the restaurant Escobar's owners said: ""Our bar does not glamorise a known drug lord and we are not a Colombian bar. ""We are a Latin American bar and restaurant, and the mural in question is one of three which all have tried to bring a South American theme to the restaurant. ""We decided to go with the name Escobar as it is just a clever play on words, incorporating the word 'bar' into our name. ""We have tried to react very amicably and even apologised for any resemblance that may have hurt the sentiments of our community. ""We have no connections to the drug lord nor do we have any affiliations with his network. ""As a gesture of goodwill, we offered to host some charity events to support the Colombian community.""

Dina Asher-Smith, Team GB's poster girl of the Games, failed to make the 100m final, and then announced she would be withdrawing from the 200m because of a torn hamstring. Her interview was heartbreaking. The 100m final, the blue riband event, took place later on with a stellar line-up, featuring GB's Daryll Neita. Elaine Thompson-Herah won in a new Olympic record, defending her title from Rio 2016. Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce and Shericka Jackson completed a Jamaican one-two-three. In boxing, Great Britain's Karriss Artingstall claimed Olympic bronze in Tokyo after a narrow defeat by Japan's Sena Irie in the semi-finals. She was denied the chance to fight for gold as Irie edged a 3-2 split-decision win at the Kokugikan Arena. Artingstall's flat-mate Lauren Price will also return home with a medal after a dominant win over Panama's Atheyna Bylon earlier on Saturday. The Welsh middleweight won 5-0 to guarantee at least a bronze and book a place in Friday's semi-finals, where she will face Nouchka Fontijn of the Netherlands. The Olympic debutant is the number one seed having won gold at the 2019 World Championships and the 2018 Commonwealth Games. Price is the fourth member of GB's boxing team for Tokyo 2020 to guarantee a medal, after Artingstall,Pat McCormack and Ben Whittaker. Women's RS:X There was a medal on the waves as GB windsurferEmma Wilson won bronzeon her Olympics debut. The 22-year-old was already guaranteed a medal after winning four of her 12 races heading into Saturday's final, but gold was taken by China's Lu Yunxiu while Rio 2016 champion Charline Picon of France took silver. Wilson's mother, Penny, was world windsurfing champion in 1986, 1990 and 1991, and represented Great Britain at the 1992 and 1996 Olympics. Men's singles In tennis, Novak Djokovic wasn't a happy man. Hemissed out on a medalin Tokyo, beaten 6-4 6-7 (6-8) 6-3 by Pablo Carreno Busta in the bronze medal match. The Serb then pulled out of his mixed doubles bronze medal match with an injury to leave Tokyo empty-handed. His poor racquet bore the brunt of his frustration. 4x100m mixed medley relay Turns out us Brits are pretty good at mixed events. That triathlon gold was quickly followed by more gold in the pool, as Kathleen Dawson, Adam Peaty, James Guy and Anna Hopkinwon the inaugural 4x100m mixed medley relayin a world-record time. That was Team GB's fourth swimming gold in Tokyo, the first time the swimming team have won four Olympic golds in 113 years. Triathlon mixed relay Saturday got off to a blistering start as GB - Jessica Learmonth, Jonny Brownlee, Georgia Taylor-Brown and Alex Yee -won the inaugural triathlon mixed relay. It meant a triumphant Games farewell for Brownlee, who secured his first gold in his third and likely final Olympics. He now has gold, silver and bronze medals from three Olympics. ""The Olympics? I've completed it,"" he said. That, my friends, is that for our live text today. Thank you for joining us. I'll leave you with all the highlights from day eight of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.

Women's 100m final Allison CurbishleyAthletics expert on BBC Radio 5 Live There will be a lot of emotions in Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce's head right now. She said the Olympics would be a year too late for her essentially. She wasn't putting enough pressure on Elaine Thompson-Herah. Shelly-Ann didn't have it at the latter stages. You want to be the best in your group, the main dog, but she is still a living legend in our sport. Women's 100m final Marlon DevonishFormer 4x100m gold medal medallist on BBC Radio 5 Live I had expectations of it being a 10.60 performance. I hoped it might be a 10.59. Text book running. I don't think Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce got the best of starts. It's a fantastic performance and it's great to see the women's race getting the credit it deserves.

"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Saturday. We'll have another update for you on Sunday. The official heading up Northern Ireland'sCovid vaccine certificate systemhas saidthere are ""frantic"" continued efforts to resolve issues with it.Dr Eddie O'Neill, from Northern Ireland's Department of Health, said staff worked until 05:00 BST on Friday to try to fix problems. But the system, which was temporarily suspended on Tuesday, did not resume as planned on Friday morning. It had been out of action due to a risk of some applicants' data being wrongly sent to other users. It was hoped it would be back up by early afternoon, but as of midnight the service was still unavailable. The CovidCertNI allows people to prove they are double-vaccinated when they travel abroad. Vaccine certificates are required by people who are travelling abroad and need to prove their vaccination status When retired children's social worker Sioban Moore received an email inviting her for a Covid-19 vaccination, she was only too keen to accept. The message said that unless she responded within 12 hours, the opportunity would disappear and be given to someone else. She was asked for her personal information - such as her date of birth and phone number - before being asked for her bank details. It was only when she got her credit card out of her purse that the ""penny dropped"" and she narrowly avoided being scammed. Not everyone has been so lucky. You can read morehere. The fake emails purporting to be from the NHS can look convincing at first glance From hospitality to road haulage, firms say they can't get staff. Some are wondering whether Covid-19 is sparking an historic rebalancing of power between the bosses and the workers. The pandemic has prompted some people to reconsider their priorities, to retire early or to leave employment to start their own business; while many foreign workers in the UK have decided to return home to wait things out. So what has been happening to the labour market? You can read morehere. In Wales, unions have warned that making businesses contribute more towards furloughed workers' wagescould push firms ""off a cliff edge""as they try to recover from the pandemic. Under the furlough scheme, which came into force in spring last year, the government initially paid 80% of the wages of people who could not work - up to a monthly limit of Â£2,500. But as the initiative has been gradually winding down with the easing of lockdown restrictions, employers have been asked to pay 10% towards the wages of staff - which is due to rise to 20%. The TUC in Wales says the move could endanger jobs, and has called for it to be delayed. The UK government said the scheme was in place until September. The travel industry is one sector which still has high numbers of staff on furlough, figures show A woman who travelled from red-list Turkey to see her dying father no longer has to quarantine in a hotel after authorities ruled that she had an ""exceptional"" case - but has criticised the lack of mental health support she experienced during the process  Claire Herriot, from Glasgow, flew home to visit Gordon Herriot in hospital after being granted a one-off compassionate visit. And she has since been told she can have two further visits to her father if she continued to test negative for Covid.Ms Herriot has called for more support for people in similar situations.She says being kept in a hotel had added to her trauma - and she was concerned that she was only able to navigate the system of seeking an exemption because of her experience and contacts as a TV producer.

"The travel industry is one sector which still has high numbers of staff on furlough, figures show Making businesses pay more to furloughed staff could push firms ""off a cliff edge"" as they are trying to recover from Covid, unions have warned. Almost 70,000 people in Wales were on furlough at the end of June,according to latest figures. Unions have warned changes from Sunday, doubling the amount firms pay, put jobs at risk and call for it to be delayed. The UK government said the furlough scheme was in place until September to provide ""certainty over the summer"". At the height of the pandemic last year, 378,400 people in Wales were furloughed. But as lockdown restrictions eased, numbers on the government's coronavirus job retention scheme have fallen - with an estimated 68,800 furloughed at the end of June,according to UK government figures,external. What impact has the furlough scheme had? How many people are now on furlough? Fewest people on furlough since pandemic began Staff returned to work in most sectors as the country reopened but some employed in the travel and hospitality industries remain on flexi-furlough - and work is based on demand. Numbers furloughed in the hospitality industry have fallen since bars and pubs reopened Furlough was introduced in spring 2020 to stop people being laid off by their employers during lockdown. The government initially paid 80% of the wages of people who could not work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them, up to a monthly limit of Â£2,500. But the scheme is being wound down, and since 1 July, employers have been asked to contribute 10% towards the wages of furloughed workers - with the government's contribution falling to 70%. That amount is now set to rise to 20%. The monthly limit of Â£2,500 will stay in place, so workers will not notice the difference. However, by making furlough more expensive for employers, the UK government hopes to encourage them to take workers back full-time if they can. The scheme is set to continue until 30 September. Ahead of the changes, unions warned the increased financial burden on firms could hit industries just as they were trying to recover from repeated lockdowns. With coronavirus measures still in place restricting numbers allowed in bars and restaurants, nightclubs unable to open and many not going abroad on holiday due to Covid rules, unions fear the travel and hospitality sectors could be badly affected. The Wales TUC said some firms were still having to furlough staff due to not being able to open fully, and ""half of all staff in travel agencies are still on furlough"". ""We do feel that doubling the employer contribution is too much too soon, and puts jobs at risk in some parts of the economy,"" a spokesperson said. The union representing travel and transport industries, the TSSA, said many people were still wary of booking holidays abroad and companies were struggling to survive. ""Any cuts to the furlough scheme will be like kicking people when they're already down,"" General Secretary Manuel Cortes said. ""With no structured plan to provide the extra support, we are likely to see more travel agencies go under."" After months of being ground to a halt due to travel restrictions in the pandemic, drivers are back on the roads taking people on trips across the UK. ""We were faced with the really difficult decision of laying everyone off if it wasn't for furlough. It was a godsend,"" said Jason Edwards, director of Llantrisant-based Edwards Coaches. More than 500 staff at Edwards Coaches were furloughed when the pandemic struck He said while it was good more than 500 staff who were on furlough were now back at work, the company was struggling with staff needing to take holidays, and being unable to recruit to deal with demand. ""You'd pinch yourself after the 14 to 15 months we've had, but we are short of staff,"" he said. ""There's a huge appetite for travel, but I feel there's a reluctance now to change jobs because people are nervous they might lose their furlough protection."" What's it like to be on furlough for a year? 'I fell through the gap with the furlough scheme' Why are hospitality workers leaving the industry? Mr Edwards said changes to furlough should be industry-specific as the scheme comes to an end. In Denbighshire, drivers have been excited to welcome back customers at Voel Coaches, but manager Chris Gentle said he was ""extremely concerned"" furlough was being wound down just before winter. While 50 staff who had been furloughed are now back in work, they are on flexi-furlough, allowing the company to send them home if they hit a quiet period. ""We are receiving a high number of bookings, and starting to operate back to full capacity on some trips, but there's still that knock-on effect of a whole 16 months of being closed, with overheads and maintenance still being paid,"" he said. The tourism and hospitality sectors are among the main users of furlough now ""We are trying to recover from that, and also now paying more of the staff wages when they go into furlough, and team that with the winter, it's really unsettling."" The Welsh government said it had repeatedly called on the UK government not to withdraw the furlough scheme until the economy ""is ready"". Allow Twitter content?

The UK government said the scheme had protected over 11.6 million jobs and eligible tourism businesses would also continue to benefit from reduced VAT until March 2022. ""We deliberately went long with our support to provide certainty to people and businesses over the summer,"" a spokesperson said. ""Businesses can also continue to access other support including our Recovery Loan scheme - and we recently made cautious changes to the requirements for international travel which will support activity within the industry.""
