"The Duke of Sussex has spoken for the first time after Buckingham Palace announced the terms on which he and his wife Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, will step back from being senior royals. He made his remarks during a speech at a private reception in central London for his charity Sentebale. No other option but to step back, says Harry ""Good evening, and thank you for being here for Sentebale, a charity me and Prince Seeiso created back in 2006 to honour my mother's legacy in supporting those affected by HIV and Aids. ""Before I begin, I must say that I can only imagine what you may have heard or perhaps read over the last few weeks... ""So, I want you to hear the truth from me, as much as I can share - not as a prince, or a duke, but as Harry, the same person that many of you have watched grow up over the last 35 years - but with a clearer perspective. ""The UK is my home and a place that I love. That will never change. ""I have grown up feeling support from so many of you, and I watched as you welcomed Meghan with open arms as you saw me find the love and happiness that I had hoped for all my life. Finally, the second son of Diana got hitched, hurray! ""I also know you've come to know me well enough over all these years to trust that the woman I chose as my wife upholds the same values as I do. And she does, and she's the same woman I fell in love with. ""We both do everything we can to fly the flag and carry out our roles for this country with pride. ""Once Meghan and I were married, we were excited, we were hopeful, and we were here to serve. ""For those reasons, it brings me great sadness that it has come to this. ""The decision that I have made for my wife and I to step back is not one I made lightly. It was so many months of talks after so many years of challenges. And I know I haven't always got it right, but as far as this goes, there really was no other option. ""What I want to make clear is we're not walking away, and we certainly aren't walking away from you. Our hope was to continue serving the Queen, the Commonwealth, and my military associations, but without public funding. Unfortunately, that wasn't possible. ""I've accepted this, knowing that it doesn't change who I am or how committed I am. ""But I hope that helps you understand what it had come to, that I would step my family back from all I have ever known, to take a step forward into what I hope can be a more peaceful life. ""I was born into this life, and it is a great honour to serve my country and the Queen. ""When I lost my mum 23 years ago, you took me under your wing. ""You've looked out for me for so long, but the media is a powerful force, and my hope is one day our collective support for each other can be more powerful because this is so much bigger than just us. ""It has been our privilege to serve you, and we will continue to lead a life of service. ""It has also been a privilege to meet so many of you, and to feel your excitement for our son Archie, who saw snow for the first time the other day and thought it was bloody brilliant! ""I will always have the utmost respect for my grandmother, my commander in chief, and I am incredibly grateful to her and the rest of my family for the support they have shown Meghan and I over the last few months. ""I will continue to be the same man who holds his country dear and dedicates his life to supporting the causes, charities and military communities that are so important to me. ""Together, you have given me an education about living. And this role has taught me more about what is right and just than I could have ever imagined.

"The government is examining whether to move the House of Lords out of London, the Conservative Party chairman has said. James Cleverly told Sky News the idea was among a ""range of options"" being considered to ""reconnect"" politics with voters outside of the capital. According to the Sunday Times,external, York and Birmingham have emerged as contenders to permanently host the upper chamber. But Labour MP Nadia Whittome described the idea as ""superficial"". According to the newspaper, a decision on whether to relocate the chamber will be determined as part of a constitutional review being launched in the spring. It reported that disused land near York railway station has been identified as a possible site to host the chamber, which houses 795 peers. How stand-in Commons chamber will look What is the House of Lords? House of Lords 'should lose 200 peers' The House of Lords is already due to temporarily relocate out of the Palace of Westminster as part of refurbishment plans due to begin in around 2025. A parliamentary committee haspreviously recommended,externalthe chamber should move to the government-owned Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre in Westminster whilst works are under way. The venue would only be a short walk from Richmond House, the former home of the Department of Health, which has been proposed as a temporary home for the House of Commons. Asked to comment on the proposals in the Sunday Times report, Mr Cleverly told Sky's Sophy Ridge: ""It's one of a range of things that we are looking into. ""What we are looking at is a whole range of options about making sure every part of the UK feels properly connected to politics,"" he added. ""Fundamentally what this is about is demonstrating to the people that we are going to do things differently."" Analysis by Peter Saull, BBC political reporter For many reasons, 'The Lords of the North,' as some are calling it, appears far-fetched. However, the fact that it is being considered at all highlights the government's desire to address a perceived disconnect between politicians and voters. The subject has also featured heavily in the Labour leadership contest, with several of the candidates calling for our democracy to be far less London-centric. Large swathes of the Midlands and the north of England turned Conservative in the election - and the government wants to bring Westminster closer to the voters it represents; perhaps literally. Whether or not it actually comes to pass, the idea of moving the second chamber north fits in nicely with Downing Street's ""levelling up"" agenda. Sending peers to work hundreds of miles away from MPs would, though, present logistical as well as constitutional challenges. What would happen, for example, on the day of the Queen's Speech? Would Her Majesty have to travel to York? Would Black Rod take a train to London, only to have the door of the Commons ceremonially slammed in her face? Would MPs go on a coach trip up the M1 to hear the government's plans? International Development Secretary Alok Sharma said he was not involved in discussions about a Lords relocation but was ""supportive"" of the idea. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr show: ""As a principle it's a perfectly good thing that we are connecting government to all parts of the country. ""I think it's absolutely right that if you want to be a government of the people, you must reach out to people across the country."" But Nadia Whittome, the newly-elected MP for Nottingham East, told the programme: ""Working class people whether in the North, the Midlands or the South don't care about the unelected House of Lords."" ""We want jobs, we want proper investment and meaningful decentralisation of power,"" she said. ""Replace the House of Lords with an elected chamber and move it to the North and then we're talking - but this is superficial, it's tinkering around the edges."" What is the House of Lords?

"A forensic examination of the scene is under way, police said Three men have died in a stabbing in east London. Police said they were called at about 19:40 GMT on Sunday to reports of a disturbance in Elmstead Road in Seven Kings, Ilford. Three men, aged in their 20s or 30s, who were involved in a fight, were found by emergency services with stab injuries, the Metropolitan Police said. All three were pronounced dead at the scene. Two men, aged 29 and 39, have been arrested on suspicion of murder. Ch Supt Steve Clayman said a fight had broken out between two groups who were armed with knives, leaving three men fatally stabbed. ""We can now say that two arrests have since been made, so there has been progress. ""The parties are believed to be known to each other and the group are within the Sikh community,"" he added. Sabih Qureshi, who lives in the area, told the BBC he had seen seven or eight men ""fighting each other"" in the same place on Saturday, which he believed was ""linked for sure"". He said: ""They were saying 'I will kill you', and the person was saying 'ok kill me'. For sure it was linked."" After seeing the three ""badly injured"" men following the attack, Mr Qureshi said he and several others tried to help and give them CPR. The Ilford resident added that one of the men was already dead, while the other two were ""not conscious"" but breathing ""just a little"". ""It was very violent. All the blood was in the street,"" he said. Police investigations are continuing Louis O'Donoghoe described seeing ""absolute chaos"" after he had heard screaming and shouting outside his house. It was like something out of a movie, horrific,"" the 40-year-old scaffolder said. Formal identification of the victims is yet to take place. The stabbings bring the number of homicide investigations launched by the Met in 2020 to six. Police will continue to patrol the area on Monday Greg Mckenzie, BBC London There has been a visible police presence here since Sunday night. Officers were called just before 20:00 to reports of a disturbance but when they arrived, they found three young men - all in close proximity to each other - with fatal stab wounds. At the end of one of the police cordons put in place you can just about make out the tops of the forensic tents - three dotted next to each other  - which marks the exact spots where these individuals were pronounced dead. An enhanced police presence was seen in the Redbridge area on Monday Despite the works of the emergency services, these men could not be saved. I've seen graphic video from a nearby resident that was filmed shortly after the incident showing pools of blood on the street. I've been speaking to some residents here this morning who say they have raised concerns to police over gangs congregating behind Seven King's train station, where they often drink and smoke cannabis. Road closures and an enhanced police presence will be seen in the Redbridge area. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan tweeted: ""My thoughts are with their families and the local community at this dreadful time."" He said extra police enforcement powers had been authorised for the whole of Redbridge borough until 08:00 on Monday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Leaked documents reveal how Africa's richest woman made her fortune through exploiting her own country, and corruption. Isabel dos Santos got access to lucrative deals involving land, oil, diamonds and telecoms when her father was president of Angola, a southern African country rich in natural resources. The documents show how she and her husband were allowed to buy valuable state assets in a series of suspicious deals. Ms Dos Santos says the allegations against her are entirely false and that there is a politically motivated witch-hunt by the Angolan government. The former president's daughter has made the UK her home and owns expensive properties in central London. She is already under criminal investigation by the authorities in Angola for corruption and her assets in the country have been frozen. Now BBC Panorama has been given access to more than 700,000 leaked documents about the billionaire's business empire. Most were obtained by the Platform to Protect Whistle-blowers in Africa and shared with theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists,external(ICIJ). They've been investigated by 37 media organisations including the Guardian and Portugal's Expresso newspaper. Thirty per cent of Angolans live in poverty on less than $2 a day Andrew Feinstein, the head of Corruption Watch, says the documents show how Ms Dos Santos exploited her country at the expense of ordinary Angolans. ""Every time she appears on the cover of some glossy magazine somewhere in the world, every time that she hosts one of her glamorous parties in the south of France, she is doing so by trampling on the aspirations of the citizens of Angola."" The ICIJ have called the documents the Luanda Leaks. One of the most suspicious deals was run from London through a UK subsidiary of the Angolan state oil company Sonangol. Ms Dos Santos had been put in charge of the struggling Sonangol in 2016, thanks to a presidential decree from her father Jose Eduardo dos Santos, who kept a tight grip on his country for the 38 years he was in power. But when he retired as president in September 2017 her position was soon under threat, even though his hand-picked successor came from the same party. Ms Dos Santos was sacked two months later. Many Angolans have been surprised at the way that President JoÃ£o LourenÃ§o has gone after the business interests of his predecessor's family.  29 millionpopulation 27-yearcivil war, fought from independence to 2002 $4,170average income, but this masks big disparities 30%of population live in poverty - less than $1.90/day 2ndbiggest oil producer in Africa. Also major diamond producer The leaked documents show that as she left Sonangol, Ms Dos Santos approved $58m of suspicious payments to a consultancy company in Dubai called Matter Business Solutions. She says she has no financial interest in Matter, but the leaked documents reveal it was run by her business manager and owned by a friend. Panorama understands that Matter sent more than 50 invoices to Sonangol in London on the day that she was fired. Ms Dos Santos appears to have approved payments to her friend's company after she was sacked. Although some consultancy work had been carried out by Matter, there's very little detail on the invoices to justify such large bills. One asks for â¬472,196 for unspecified expenses - another asks for $928,517 for unspecified legal services. Two of the invoices - each for â¬676,339.97  - are for exactly the same work on the same date and Ms Dos Santos signed them both off anyway. These are some of the invoices Isabel dos Santos signed off in her last week at Sonangol Lawyers for Matter Business Solutions say it was brought in to help restructure the oil industry in Angola, and that the invoices were for work that had already been carried out by other consultancy companies it had hired. ""Regarding the invoices related with expenses, it is common for consultancy companies to add expenses to invoices as a general item. This is often due to those expenses involving large amounts of paperwork... Matter can produce documentary evidence to confirm all expenses incurred."" Ms Dos Santos's lawyers said her actions with regard to the Matter payments were entirely lawful and that she had not authorised payments after she had been dismissed from Sonangol. They said: ""All invoices paid were in relation to services contracted and agreed between the two parties, under a contract that was approved with the full knowledge and approval of the Sonangol Board of Directors."" This video can not be played Isabel dos Santos: ""I regret that Angola has chosen this path"" The ICIJ and Panorama have also uncovered new details about the business deals that made Ms Dos Santos rich. Much of her fortune is based on her ownership of a stake in the Portuguese energy company Galp, which one of her companies bought from Sonangol in 2006. The documents show it only had to pay 15% of the price upfront and that the remaining â¬63m ($70m) was turned into a low-interest loan from Sonangol. Under the generous terms of the loan, her debt to the Angolan people didn't have to be repaid for 11 years. Her stake in Galp is now worth more than â¬750m. Ms Dos Santos's company did offer to repay the Sonangol loan in 2017. The repayment offer should have been rejected because it didn't include almost â¬9m of interest owing. Bank orders signed by Isabel dos Santos transferred almost $58m out of the Angolan state oil company But Ms Dos Santos was in charge of Sonangol at the time and she accepted the money as full payment of her own debt. She was fired six days later and the payment was returned by the new Sonangol management. Ms Dos Santos says she initiated the purchase of the stake in Galp, and that Sonangol made money from the deal as well. ""There's absolutely no wrongdoing in any of those transactions. This investment is the investment that in history has generated the most benefit for the national oil company and all the contracts that were drafted are perfectly legal contracts, there are no wrongdoings."" Her lawyers say the repayment offer in 2017 covered what Sonangol had indicated was owed. It's a similar story in the diamond industry. Ms Dos Santos's husband, Sindika Dokolo, signed a one-sided agreement in 2012 with Angolan state diamond company Sodiam. They were supposed to be 50-50 partners in a deal to buy a stake in the Swiss luxury jeweller De Grisogono. But it was funded by the state company. The documents show that 18 months after the deal, Sodiam had put $79m into the partnership, while Mr Dokolo had only invested $4m. Sodiam also awarded him a â¬5m success fee for brokering the deal, so he didn't have to use any of his own money. Isabel dos Santos and her husband Sindika Dokolo can often be seen at film premieres and festivals with the world's stars The diamond deal gets even worse for the Angolan people. The documents reveal how Sodiam borrowed all the cash from a private bank in which Ms Dos Santos is the biggest shareholder. Sodiam has to pay 9% interest and the loan was guaranteed by a presidential decree from her father, so Ms Dos Santos's bank cannot lose out. Bravo da Rosa, the new chief executive of Sodiam, told Panorama that the Angolan people hadn't got a single dollar back from the deal: ""In the end, when we have finished paying back this loan, Sodiam will have lost more than $200m."" The former president also gave Ms Dos Santos's husband the right to buy some of Angola's raw diamonds. Eldest daughter of ex-President Jose Eduardo dos Santos Married to Congolese art collector and businessman Sindika Dokolo Educated in UK, where she currently lives Reported to be Africa's richest woman, with a fortune of some $2bn Has stakes in oil and mobile phone companies and banks, mostly in Angola and Portugal Source: Forbes magazine and others Read more:Africa's richest woman eyes Angolan presidency The Angolan government says the diamonds were sold at a knockdown price and sources have told Panorama that almost $1bn may have been lost. Ms Dos Santos told the BBC she couldn't comment because she was not a shareholder of De Grisogono. But the leaked documents show that she is described as a shareholder of De Grisogono by her own financial advisers. Mr Dokolo did put in some money later. His lawyers say he invested $115m and that the takeover of De Grisogono was his idea. They say his company paid above the market rate for the raw diamonds. The leaked documents also reveal how Ms Dos Santos bought land from the state in September 2017. Once again she only had to pay a small up-front fee. Her company bought a square kilometre of prime beachfront land in the capital Luanda with the help of presidential decrees signed by her father. Angolan state oil company Sonangol has a subsidiary in London where suspicious deals took place The contract says the land was worth $96m, but the documents show her company paid only 5% of that after agreeing to invest the rest in the development. Panorama traced some of the ordinary Angolans who were evicted to make way for the Futungo development. This video can not be played Albertina de Fatima describes living next to an open sewer in Angola They've been moved from the Luandan seafront to an isolated housing development 30 miles (50km) from the capital. Teresa Vissapa lost her business to Ms Dos Santos' development and is now struggling to bring up her seven children. She said: ""I only ask God to make her think a little more about our situation. Maybe she doesn't even know it, but we are suffering."" Ms Dos Santos declined to comment on the Futungo development. But it was not the only land deal involving Ms Dos Santos that displaced the local population. About 500 families were evicted from another stretch of the Luandan seafront after Isabel dos Santos got involved in another major redevelopment project. The families are now living in desperate conditions next to an open sewer. Some of their shacks are flooded with sewage whenever the tide rises. Ms Dos Santos says there weren't any evictions linked to her project and that her companies were never paid because the development was cancelled. The billionaire has also made big profits from the telecoms industry in Angola. She acquired a 25% stake in the country's biggest mobile phone provider, Unitel. It was granted a telecoms licence by her father in 1999 and she bought her stake the following year from a high ranking government official. Unitel has already paid her $1bn in dividends and her stake is worth another $1bn. But that's not the only way she got cash from the private company. She arranged for Unitel to lend â¬350m to a new company she set up, called Unitel International Holdings. The leaked documents show Isabel dos Santos signed off on loans from Unitel as both the borrower and the lender The company name was misleading because it wasn't connected to Unitel and Ms Dos Santos was the owner. The documents show Ms Dos Santos signed off on the loans as both lender and borrower, which is a blatant conflict of interest. Ms Dos Santos denied that the loans were corrupt. She said: ""This loan had both directors' approval and shareholders' approval, and it's a loan that will generate, and has generated, benefit for Unitel."" Her lawyers say the loans protected Unitel from currency fluctuations. Most of the companies involved in the dodgy deals were overseen by accountants working for the financial services company, Price Waterhouse Coopers (PWC). It's made millions providing auditing, consultancy and tax advice to her companies. But PWC has terminated its relationship with the billionaire and her family, after Panorama questioned the way the company had assisted Ms Dos Santos in the deals that had made her rich. PWC says it is holding an inquiry into the ""very serious and concerning allegations"". Tom Keatinge, director of the Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies, criticised PWC for giving the corruption a ""veneer of respectability"" Tom Keatinge, director of the Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies, told Panorama that PWC had given legitimacy to Ms Dos Santos and her companies. ""PWC, if not facilitating the corruption, are providing a veneer of respectability that makes what's happening acceptable or more acceptable than it might otherwise be. ""So if I was at PWC I'd be conducting a pretty thorough audit of what decisions were made, and in hindsight actually: 'Did we make the wrong decision to accept this business and should we have reported what we had been presented with?'"" PWC says it strives to maintain the highest professional standards and has set expectations for consistent ethical behaviour across its global network. ""In response to the very serious and concerning allegations that have been raised, we immediately initiated an investigation and are working to thoroughly evaluate the facts and conclude our inquiry. ""We will not hesitate to take appropriate actions to ensure that we always stand for the very highest standards of behaviour, wherever we operate in the world.""

"This video can not be played Prince Harry says it is ""a great sadness that it has come to this"" The Duke of Sussex has said he is ""taking a leap of faith"" in stepping back from being a senior royal, adding: ""There really was no other option."" Speaking at an event on Sunday evening, Prince Harry said he and Meghan had hoped to continue serving the Queen, but without public funding. ""Unfortunately, that wasn't possible,"" he said. It was his first speech since the couple said they wanted to stand down from being full-time working royals. The prince said he had found ""the love and happiness that I had hoped for all my life"" with Meghan, but he wanted to make it clear they were ""not walking away"". ""The UK is my home and a place that I love, that will never change,"" he said. Harry's speech in full on his royal future Harry and Meghan: What we know so far Where do Prince Harry and Meghan get their money? Prince Harry said it was a sign of the pressures he was feeling that he would ""step my family back from all I have ever known"" in search of ""a more peaceful life"". This video can not be played BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond gives his five takeaways from Harry's speech Earlier this month, Prince Harry and Meghan saidthey intended ""to step back as 'senior' members of the Royal Familyand work to become financially independent"". On Saturday,Buckingham Palace announcedthat from the spring they will stop using their HRH titles and withdraw from royal duties, including official military appointments. And on Monday Prince Harry was pictured at the UK-Africa Investment Summit in London, where he held a number of private meetings, including with Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge hosted an evening reception at Buckingham Palace for heads of government, ministers, business leaders and members of NGOs attending the summit. It was the first time the duke and duchess had hosted a reception for world leaders on behalf of the Queen. Prince Harry did not attend, with BBC royal correspondent, Nicholas Witchell, saying he is believed to have left on a flight for Canada from Heathrow airport. Prince William and Catherine were joined at the reception by senior royals including the Princess Royal and the Earl and Countess of Wessex. How could the Sussexes make money? Harry and Meghan's future: Your questions answered Country wishes Harry and Meghan well - Johnson Beginning his speechat a fund-raising reception in central London for Sentebale, the charity he co-founded which helps children living with HIV in southern Africa, he said: ""I can only imagine what you may have heard and perhaps read over the past few weeks. ""So I want you to hear the truth from me as much as I can share, not as a prince or a duke but as Harry."" During his address, the prince said he would always have ""the utmost respect for my grandmother, my commander in chief"". ""Our hope was to continue serving the Queen, the Commonwealth, and my military associations, but without public funding. Unfortunately, that wasn't possible,"" he said. ""I've accepted this, knowing that it doesn't change who I am or how committed I am."" Prince Harry met the prime minister at the UK-Africa Investment Summit in London Prince Harry and Meghan have both spoken about the difficulties of royal life and media attention, with the duke saying he feared his wife would fall victim to ""the same powerful forces"" that led to his mother's death. He told the audience at the reception for Sentebale, which he founded to continue Princess Diana's legacy in supporting those with HIV and Aids, that he felt they took him ""under your wing"" after she died. ""You've looked out for me for so long, but the media is a powerful force, and my hope is one day our collective support for each other can be more powerful because this is so much bigger than just us,"" he said.

As part of a deal finalised on Saturday between the Queen, senior royals, and the couple, Harry and Meghan agreed they will no longer formally represent the monarch. However, the statement by Buckingham Palace said they would continue to maintain their private patronages and associations. Prince Harry said in his speech that he and Meghan ""will continue to lead a life of service"". ""I will continue to be the same man who holds his country dear and dedicates his life to supporting the causes, charities and military communities that are so important to me,"" he said. Johnny Hornby, chairman of Sentebale, said the new arrangements would not affect the prince's work for the charity. ""We don't need - from Sentebale's perspective - his title, we just need his time and his passion,"" he told the BBC. There are two big messages in this speech.  The first is to deal with the ""Meghan myth"" - the idea that the Duchess of Sussex is at the root of the couple's desire to lead a different life. Harry speaks of ""many months"" of discussions over how to deal with the challenges of ""many years""; he's making it clear that he was unhappy with his role long before Meghan entered his life And he talks about the decision that ""I"" made, a decision ""I"" did not make lightly. He stresses that this was his call, though it was clearly one that they came to together. The second message is that he wanted to continue in some sort of a royal role; ""unfortunately,"" he says ""that wasn't possible."" Both sides - the Sussexes and the Palace - thought at the beginning of negotiations that such a half-in, half-out role might be possible. But the tension between a royal life and an independent life was too great; the contradictions and possible conflicts of interest were too many. Harry may or may not believe that to be true. But he wants to let people know that his desire, at least, was to continue to serve. Former Liberal Democrat MP Norman Baker, who is the author of a critical book about the Royal Family, said the public could end up paying for part of the Prince of Wales' ongoing financial support for his son. Mr Baker told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the Queen already offset support for family members against the tax bill for the Duchy of Lancaster, the sovereign's estate. Much of Prince Harry's funding comes from his father's estate, the Duchy of Cornwall. Mr Baker called for Prince Charles to say how he will support Harry and to publicly guarantee there would be no loss to the taxpayer through a reduction in his tax liability. The former MP also called for the Commons public accounts committee to investigate royal finances. Why Meghan and Harry have Canada in their sights The big question Canadians have about royal move Journalist and royal author Robert Hardman said the agreement with the Queen meantthe duke and duchess's Sussex Royal brand, which they applied to trademark last year,,externalis not ""sustainable"". ""The whole thrust of what has been agreed with the Queen is they won't be trading on their royal credentials,"" he said. In Prince Harry's speech,posted on the couple's Instagram account,external, he said that when he and Meghan were married ""we were excited, we were hopeful, and we were here to serve"". ""For those reasons, it brings me great sadness that it has come to this. ""The decision that I have made for my wife and I to step back is not one I made lightly,"" he said. ""It was so many months of talks after so many years of challenges and I know I haven't always got it right, but as far as this goes there really was no other option."" The couple, together with their son Archie, spent time in Victoria over Christmas The couple said they plan to divide their time between the UK and Canada, after they spent six weeks on Vancouver Island with their son Archie over Christmas. The prince told attendees it was a ""privilege... to feel your excitement for our son Archie, who saw snow for the first time the other day and thought it was bloody brilliant!"" The duchess is currently staying on Canada's west coast with her son, after briefly returning to the UK earlier this month. What questions do you have about Prince Harry and Meghan's future?

"One of Africa's major oil producers, Angola is still tackling the physical, social and political legacy of a 27-year civil war that ravaged the country after independence. Following Portugal's own revolution in 1974, and the subsequent withdrawal of its colonial administration in 1975, the rival former independence movements competed for power until 2002. Angola has vast mineral and petroleum reserves, and its economy is among the fastest-growing in the world - but economic growth is highly uneven. Much of its oil wealth lies in its separate Cabinda province, where a decades-long separatist conflict simmers.

He was the chosen candidate of his predecessor Jose Eduardo dos Santos, who did not run in the general election but who was still expected to retain a strong influence over the running of the country. However, Mr Lourenco surprised many by firing several security chiefs close to his predecessor. He also removed Isabel dos Santos, daughter of the former president, as head of the country's state oil company Sonangol. The former president's son, JosÃ© Filomeno dos Santos, was sentenced for five years in jail for fraud and corruption in 2020. Mr Lourenco is a retired general who first fought in the independence struggle against Portugal, and later against the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (Unita) during the civil war. State-owned media dominate the media landscape. Of the many privately owned newspapers that emerged following the advent of multiparty politics in 1992, only four still exist in print form.

"The Queen, accompanied by the Duke of York, was greeted by well-wishers at St Mary the Virgin Church in Norfolk Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the whole country will want to wish the Duke and Duchess of Sussex well for the future as they give up royal duties. It came as the Queen went to church near Sandringham, in her first public appearance since it was announced the couple were giving up their HRH titles. In her statement yesterday she wished them ""a happy and peaceful new life"". But Thomas Markle, Meghan's father, accused them of ""cheapening"" the Royal Family. Earlier this month, Prince Harry and Meghan announcedtheir intention ""to step back as 'senior' members of the Royal Familyand work to become financially independent"". It prompted intensive discussions between the prince and other senior royals, led by the Queen. On Saturday, the Queen and Buckingham Palace announced that they had reached a new arrangement - that the couple would no longer use their HRH titles, receive public funds for royal duties or formally represent the Queen from spring. Queen's statement on Harry and Meghan in full Harry and Meghan's future: Your questions answered This video can not be played ""Nothing like this has ever happened before"" â royal correspondent Daniela Relph explains Speaking briefly to reporters at a summit in Berlin, Mr Johnson said he had been confident the Royal Family would find a way forward for Prince Harry and Meghan, adding: ""I think the whole country will want to join in wishing them the very best for the future."" However in comments made for a forthcoming Channel 5 documentary, Meghan's father, Thomas Markle, accused the couple of ""destroying"" the Royal Family which he called ""one of the greatest long-living institutions ever"". ""Every young girl wants to become a princess and she got that and now she's tossing that away,"" he said. ""It looks like she's tossing that away for money."" This video can not be played Meghan Markle's father reacts to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex deciding to step down as senior royals Dickie Arbiter, former press secretary to the Queen, said the new arrangement had turned a crisis for the Royal Family into a ""workable situation"" that was ""the best sort of deal they could have come up with, without totally upsetting the apple cart"". Diana Pearl, a former Royal reporter at People, agreed, saying perception of the Royal Family would not ultimately be damaged. She said the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge ""look very solid and drama-free after this whole experience - and they really are the future of the family."" However Katie Nicholl, Vanity Fair royal correspondent, said Harry and Meghan have won their independence, but the Royal Family has lost their ""very magical and unique brand"". The party prince who carved his own path The Harry and Meghan story Who has won?, some ask. Harry and Meghan have got what they want. And for some that is enough. Round one to the Sussexes. But the price is high, much higher than it was originally thought. The Sussexes and the palace first hoped there might be a way to keep the couple half-in half-out, perhaps with select but high visibility royal duties in and out of the UK. That's not happening. Royal through blood and marriage they will always be.  But professionally Royal, publicly Royal, they no longer are. They will carry out no duties, no tours, use no royal title. That Royal part their life - all of Harry's life - is over. It is a huge step. Only Edward VIII went further, and his is a bitter example. No one has won. Everyone - family, Crown and country - has lost. Last year, Prince Harry and Meghan spoke of the difficulties of royal life and media scrutiny, with the duke saying he feared his wife would fall victim to ""the same powerful forces"" that led to his mother's death. In her statement on Saturday, the Queen said she was pleased that a ""constructive and supportive way forward for [her] grandson and his family"" had been found. She said she recognised the ""challenges"" they had experienced ""as a result of intense scrutiny over the last two years"". Buckingham Palace said the duke and duchess understood that under the new arrangement, they were required to withdraw from royal duties, including official military appointments, but would continue to ""uphold the values of Her Majesty"". The duke and duchess intend to repay Â£2.4m of taxpayer money used for the refurbishment of Frogmore Cottage, the statement said. The house in Windsor, for which they will pay rent, will remain their family home as they divide their time between the UK and Canada. The pair will continue to maintain their private patronages and associations - the duke currently holds 16 patronages, including the Invictus Games Foundation, the Royal Marines and the Rugby Football League; and the duchess four - the National Theatre, the Association of Commonwealth Universities, London-based animal charity Mayhew, and women's charity Smart Works. They will no longer use HRH, an abbreviation of His/Her Royal Highness, which is part of the title of some members of the Royal Family. Prince Harry outside Buckingham Palace on Thursday Some questions about the couple's future status remain unanswered, including what their tax and immigration status will be in the UK and Canada. It is not yet known whether Meghan still intends to gain British citizenship, which would entail her spending a certain amount of time in the UK. Another question is the issue of their security bill when they are in Canada, said David McClure, an expert on royal finances. ""The Canadians are not keen on picking up the tab, so I'm sure there will be quite heated discussions between the Canadian government and the British government as to who pays for it,"" he said, adding that the Sussexes might come under pressure to contribute to the cost. Meghan this week visited a girls' charity in Vancouver The couple have already begun a transition phase of living in Canada and the UK. The duchess is in the Commonwealth country with son Archie, where the Sussexes were for six weeks over the festive period. On Tuesday she visited a charity in Vancouver which campaigns for teenage girls living in poverty.

"German Chancellor Angela Merkel welcomed Russian President Vladimir Putin and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said that major powers are ""fully committed"" to a peaceful resolution in Libya after a summit in Berlin. World leaders have pledged not to interfere in Libya's ongoing civil conflict, and have vowed to uphold a UN arms embargo. The conflict pits powerful General Khalifa Haftar against the UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA). But although both Libyan warring sides were present, they did not meet. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the two sides were briefed and consulted by the other parties. Alongside Mrs Merkel, attendees included Russia's President Vladimir Putin, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. This video can not be played What's behind the fight for Libya? Before the meeting, Mr Johnson said the aim of the conference was to ""stop this jockeying for position"". ""The people of Libya have suffered enough,"" he said as he arrived on Sunday. ""It's time for the country to move forward."" Leaders from the EU, Russia and Turkey were among those who committed to an end to foreign intervention in Libya's war, and to uphold a UN arms embargo. After the conference, German leader Mrs Merkel stressed there was no military way to end the conflict,  ""only a political solution"". Who is Gen Khalifa Haftar? A migrant's tale: Jailed and ransomed in Libya Mr Guterres meanwhile said all the major powers present shared ""a strong commitment to stop"" any further escalation in the region. He did however say he was ""very worried"" about reports that forces loyal to Gen Hafter had closed several key ports and a major oil pipeline in the country. Tripoli-based Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj (left) and General Khalifa Haftar did not meet face to face Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov also expressed concerns. He said afterwards the major powers ""have not yet succeeded in launching a serious and stable dialogue"" between the warring parties. And there were questions about whether there could be a lasting ceasefire, and how this could be maintained. Nevertheless, Mr Lavrov said both sides had taken ""a small step"" forward. A ceasefirestill looks far-fetched By Rana Jawad, BBC North Africa correspondent The commitment by foreign backers of the conflict - which include Russia, Egypt and Turkey - to respect the UN arms embargo on Libya will only be taken seriously if the UN Security Council acts on violations. This is something it has failed to do in years of conflict. For any progress to be made in the long term, Libya's warring sides will need to declare and commit to a ceasefire, which still looks far-fetched. If there is eventually a long-enough ceasefire in place, it would allow the UN to go back to the political drawing board, and design a fresh political process for the country. Europe is trying to jostle its way back into a complex scene, which it all but abandoned over the past year because of its own divisions over a solution. If nothing else, the Berlin summit may have enabled it  to elbow its way back into a position with more leverage over stabilising Libya. Libya has been wracked by conflict since the 2011 uprising which ousted long-time strongman Muammar Gaddafi. Gen Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) controls much of eastern Libya, and last April he launched an offensive against the country's rival Government of National Accord (GNA) in the capital, Tripoli. His forces have so far been unable to take the city, but earlier this month the LNAcaptured the country's third-biggest city, Sirte. According to the UN, the fighting has killed hundreds of people and displaced thousands more from their homes. A truce was announced earlier this month between Gen Haftar and the GNA, led by Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj. But both sides blame each other for reported breaches of the agreement, andattempts to broker a lasting ceasefire broke down last week at a summit in Moscow. The role of foreign states in the conflict has come into focus in recent months, withTurkey passing a controversial lawto deploy troops to help GNA forces in Tripoli. Gen Haftar's LNA has the backing of Russia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Jordan. Mr SalamÃ© said foreign intervention has created a ""vicious cycle"" of violence in Libya On Saturday, UN Special Envoy to Libya Ghassan SalamÃ© told the BBC's Radio 4 Today Programme that a political solution to the conflict was best for all parties involved because Libya - with its vast geography, strong local identities, heavily armed population and weakened government infrastructure - was a difficult country for one group to control.

He started queuing outside the venue at 10am and left, without getting inside, at 2pm and believes organisers may have underestimated how popular the event was going to be. He'd travelled down from Manchester with friends and with the cost of tickets, travel and a hotel, reckons he spent around Â£400 on the weekend.

"Former employees of new MP Jamie Wallis say he worked in the same office that ran a ""sugar daddy"" website Conservative MP Jamie Wallis worked in the same office that ran a ""sugar daddy"" dating website, two former employees have told BBC Wales. The newly-elected Bridgend MP has distanced himself from Sugar-Daddy.net. A Labour MP has said this was ""clearly"" contradicted by company records. James Cleverly told Sky News' Sophy Ridge On Sunday it was not his job as the chairman of the Conservative Party to investigate any claims linked to ""business arrangements"". One ex-staffer said he ""was aware"" the site was being run from the office, while another said his denial ""totally lacks credibility"". BBC Wales tried to contact Mr Wallis for comment but was told ""he's not available"". Sugar-Daddy.net offered introductions to wealthy individuals, saying: ""We can introduce you to your very own sugar daddy and solve your money worries. ""Whether you're a boy, girl, straight or gay, there's a sugar daddy for you."" Call for whip to be removed from Bridgend MP Jamie Wallis Jamie Wallis: Bridgend MP 'misled press' over sugar daddy site Jamie Wallis' denial of link to dating site 'misleading' Labour's Tonia Antoniazzi raised the link between Jamie Wallis MP and the site in the House of Commons on Wednesday following reports by Buzzfeed News. The Gower MP claimed Mr Wallis had ""misled the press about his involvement"" in the website, which she called ""exploitative and demeaning"". Mr Wallis told BuzzFeed: ""Online queries indicate the Sugar-Daddy.net website was registered in 2004 and ceased to be operational in 2010."" ""The site appears to have been owned and operated by a company named SD Billing Services Limited. ""For the avoidance of any doubt, I have never had a financial interest, nor been a director of SD Billing Services Limited and cannot comment on its operational activities."" Jamie Wallis was elected as MP for Bridgend in December Jamie Wallis is listed at Companies House as a person with significant control of Fields Group Ltd. Fields Group Ltd is listed as sole shareholder of SD Billing Services between October 2007 and October 2010. Within that period Mr Wallis was a shareholder and director of Fields Group. The Fields Group has operated a number of businesses from an office in Pencoed, outside Bridgend. Two former employees of those, who worked in an office with Jamie Wallis, told the BBC's Politics Wales programme that Sugar-Daddy.net was also run from that office. One said: ""It's not believable to think he didn't know about the site because it was up there on the screen (in the office). ""He would be aware, he was always in the management meetings with everyone else and that's when they talk about how their businesses are going. ""It was just one main office, couple of smaller offices off it on one floor. ""It wasn't a big office, I would say there's about 20 people in it on the main floor. Everyone knew each other. Â Â ""It [Sugar-Daddy.net] was on screen. I saw it many times on screen."" They said he ""had to be aware"". Tonia Antoniazzi said the site was ""demeaning"" and ""exploitative"" ""I mean, just walking through the office he would see it on screen,"" they added. Â Â Another former employee said: ""Sugar Daddy was run from the Bridgend office. Jamie was aware of it and he was fine with it. ""He saw it as a good business model. He had no concerns and never raised any issues about the ethics of it."" BuzzFeed News reported that 10 companies where Mr Wallis was or is a director were subject to more than 800 complaints to trading standards between January 2008 and February 2017, according to Bridgend council. The council said the companies had been the subject of 20 enforcement visits. Mr Wallis told BuzzFeed the figures were ""nonsense"" and he is taking legal action against Bridgend council. A Bridgend council spokesman confirmed they had received a ""letter-before-action"" from Fields Group Limited but could not comment further ""due to the possibility of ongoing proceedings"". Mr Cleverly told Sky News: ""The activities of that website is not something I am at all comfortable with but, ultimately, the relationship between that company and any companies that Jamie might have been involved in is something I am not in a position to look into. Business arrangements are separate. ""If he has done anything wrong that will be looked at by the whips but, at this stage, I don't know he has done anything wrong and the exact relationship between him and various businesses I don't have full details of that.""

"Leaked documents reveal how Africa's richest woman made her fortune through exploiting her own country, and corruption. Isabel dos Santos got access to lucrative deals involving land, oil, diamonds and telecoms when her father was president of Angola, a southern African country rich in natural resources. The documents show how she and her husband were allowed to buy valuable state assets in a series of suspicious deals. Ms Dos Santos says the allegations against her are entirely false and that there is a politically motivated witch-hunt by the Angolan government. The former president's daughter has made the UK her home and owns expensive properties in central London. She is already under criminal investigation by the authorities in Angola for corruption and her assets in the country have been frozen. Now BBC Panorama has been given access to more than 700,000 leaked documents about the billionaire's business empire. Most were obtained by the Platform to Protect Whistle-blowers in Africa and shared with theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists,external(ICIJ). They've been investigated by 37 media organisations including the Guardian and Portugal's Expresso newspaper. Thirty per cent of Angolans live in poverty on less than $2 a day Andrew Feinstein, the head of Corruption Watch, says the documents show how Ms Dos Santos exploited her country at the expense of ordinary Angolans. ""Every time she appears on the cover of some glossy magazine somewhere in the world, every time that she hosts one of her glamorous parties in the south of France, she is doing so by trampling on the aspirations of the citizens of Angola."" The ICIJ have called the documents the Luanda Leaks. One of the most suspicious deals was run from London through a UK subsidiary of the Angolan state oil company Sonangol. Ms Dos Santos had been put in charge of the struggling Sonangol in 2016, thanks to a presidential decree from her father Jose Eduardo dos Santos, who kept a tight grip on his country for the 38 years he was in power. But when he retired as president in September 2017 her position was soon under threat, even though his hand-picked successor came from the same party. Ms Dos Santos was sacked two months later. Many Angolans have been surprised at the way that President JoÃ£o LourenÃ§o has gone after the business interests of his predecessor's family.  29 millionpopulation 27-yearcivil war, fought from independence to 2002 $4,170average income, but this masks big disparities 30%of population live in poverty - less than $1.90/day 2ndbiggest oil producer in Africa. Also major diamond producer The leaked documents show that as she left Sonangol, Ms Dos Santos approved $58m of suspicious payments to a consultancy company in Dubai called Matter Business Solutions. She says she has no financial interest in Matter, but the leaked documents reveal it was run by her business manager and owned by a friend. Panorama understands that Matter sent more than 50 invoices to Sonangol in London on the day that she was fired. Ms Dos Santos appears to have approved payments to her friend's company after she was sacked. Although some consultancy work had been carried out by Matter, there's very little detail on the invoices to justify such large bills. One asks for â¬472,196 for unspecified expenses - another asks for $928,517 for unspecified legal services. Two of the invoices - each for â¬676,339.97  - are for exactly the same work on the same date and Ms Dos Santos signed them both off anyway. These are some of the invoices Isabel dos Santos signed off in her last week at Sonangol Lawyers for Matter Business Solutions say it was brought in to help restructure the oil industry in Angola, and that the invoices were for work that had already been carried out by other consultancy companies it had hired. ""Regarding the invoices related with expenses, it is common for consultancy companies to add expenses to invoices as a general item. This is often due to those expenses involving large amounts of paperwork... Matter can produce documentary evidence to confirm all expenses incurred."" Ms Dos Santos's lawyers said her actions with regard to the Matter payments were entirely lawful and that she had not authorised payments after she had been dismissed from Sonangol. They said: ""All invoices paid were in relation to services contracted and agreed between the two parties, under a contract that was approved with the full knowledge and approval of the Sonangol Board of Directors."" This video can not be played Isabel dos Santos: ""I regret that Angola has chosen this path"" The ICIJ and Panorama have also uncovered new details about the business deals that made Ms Dos Santos rich. Much of her fortune is based on her ownership of a stake in the Portuguese energy company Galp, which one of her companies bought from Sonangol in 2006. The documents show it only had to pay 15% of the price upfront and that the remaining â¬63m ($70m) was turned into a low-interest loan from Sonangol. Under the generous terms of the loan, her debt to the Angolan people didn't have to be repaid for 11 years. Her stake in Galp is now worth more than â¬750m. Ms Dos Santos's company did offer to repay the Sonangol loan in 2017. The repayment offer should have been rejected because it didn't include almost â¬9m of interest owing. Bank orders signed by Isabel dos Santos transferred almost $58m out of the Angolan state oil company But Ms Dos Santos was in charge of Sonangol at the time and she accepted the money as full payment of her own debt. She was fired six days later and the payment was returned by the new Sonangol management. Ms Dos Santos says she initiated the purchase of the stake in Galp, and that Sonangol made money from the deal as well. ""There's absolutely no wrongdoing in any of those transactions. This investment is the investment that in history has generated the most benefit for the national oil company and all the contracts that were drafted are perfectly legal contracts, there are no wrongdoings."" Her lawyers say the repayment offer in 2017 covered what Sonangol had indicated was owed. It's a similar story in the diamond industry. Ms Dos Santos's husband, Sindika Dokolo, signed a one-sided agreement in 2012 with Angolan state diamond company Sodiam. They were supposed to be 50-50 partners in a deal to buy a stake in the Swiss luxury jeweller De Grisogono. But it was funded by the state company. The documents show that 18 months after the deal, Sodiam had put $79m into the partnership, while Mr Dokolo had only invested $4m. Sodiam also awarded him a â¬5m success fee for brokering the deal, so he didn't have to use any of his own money. Isabel dos Santos and her husband Sindika Dokolo can often be seen at film premieres and festivals with the world's stars The diamond deal gets even worse for the Angolan people. The documents reveal how Sodiam borrowed all the cash from a private bank in which Ms Dos Santos is the biggest shareholder. Sodiam has to pay 9% interest and the loan was guaranteed by a presidential decree from her father, so Ms Dos Santos's bank cannot lose out. Bravo da Rosa, the new chief executive of Sodiam, told Panorama that the Angolan people hadn't got a single dollar back from the deal: ""In the end, when we have finished paying back this loan, Sodiam will have lost more than $200m."" The former president also gave Ms Dos Santos's husband the right to buy some of Angola's raw diamonds. Eldest daughter of ex-President Jose Eduardo dos Santos Married to Congolese art collector and businessman Sindika Dokolo Educated in UK, where she currently lives Reported to be Africa's richest woman, with a fortune of some $2bn Has stakes in oil and mobile phone companies and banks, mostly in Angola and Portugal Source: Forbes magazine and others Read more:Africa's richest woman eyes Angolan presidency The Angolan government says the diamonds were sold at a knockdown price and sources have told Panorama that almost $1bn may have been lost. Ms Dos Santos told the BBC she couldn't comment because she was not a shareholder of De Grisogono. But the leaked documents show that she is described as a shareholder of De Grisogono by her own financial advisers. Mr Dokolo did put in some money later. His lawyers say he invested $115m and that the takeover of De Grisogono was his idea. They say his company paid above the market rate for the raw diamonds. The leaked documents also reveal how Ms Dos Santos bought land from the state in September 2017. Once again she only had to pay a small up-front fee. Her company bought a square kilometre of prime beachfront land in the capital Luanda with the help of presidential decrees signed by her father. Angolan state oil company Sonangol has a subsidiary in London where suspicious deals took place The contract says the land was worth $96m, but the documents show her company paid only 5% of that after agreeing to invest the rest in the development. Panorama traced some of the ordinary Angolans who were evicted to make way for the Futungo development. This video can not be played Albertina de Fatima describes living next to an open sewer in Angola They've been moved from the Luandan seafront to an isolated housing development 30 miles (50km) from the capital. Teresa Vissapa lost her business to Ms Dos Santos' development and is now struggling to bring up her seven children. She said: ""I only ask God to make her think a little more about our situation. Maybe she doesn't even know it, but we are suffering."" Ms Dos Santos declined to comment on the Futungo development. But it was not the only land deal involving Ms Dos Santos that displaced the local population. About 500 families were evicted from another stretch of the Luandan seafront after Isabel dos Santos got involved in another major redevelopment project. The families are now living in desperate conditions next to an open sewer. Some of their shacks are flooded with sewage whenever the tide rises. Ms Dos Santos says there weren't any evictions linked to her project and that her companies were never paid because the development was cancelled. The billionaire has also made big profits from the telecoms industry in Angola. She acquired a 25% stake in the country's biggest mobile phone provider, Unitel. It was granted a telecoms licence by her father in 1999 and she bought her stake the following year from a high ranking government official. Unitel has already paid her $1bn in dividends and her stake is worth another $1bn. But that's not the only way she got cash from the private company. She arranged for Unitel to lend â¬350m to a new company she set up, called Unitel International Holdings. The leaked documents show Isabel dos Santos signed off on loans from Unitel as both the borrower and the lender The company name was misleading because it wasn't connected to Unitel and Ms Dos Santos was the owner. The documents show Ms Dos Santos signed off on the loans as both lender and borrower, which is a blatant conflict of interest. Ms Dos Santos denied that the loans were corrupt. She said: ""This loan had both directors' approval and shareholders' approval, and it's a loan that will generate, and has generated, benefit for Unitel."" Her lawyers say the loans protected Unitel from currency fluctuations. Most of the companies involved in the dodgy deals were overseen by accountants working for the financial services company, Price Waterhouse Coopers (PWC). It's made millions providing auditing, consultancy and tax advice to her companies. But PWC has terminated its relationship with the billionaire and her family, after Panorama questioned the way the company had assisted Ms Dos Santos in the deals that had made her rich. PWC says it is holding an inquiry into the ""very serious and concerning allegations"". Tom Keatinge, director of the Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies, criticised PWC for giving the corruption a ""veneer of respectability"" Tom Keatinge, director of the Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies, told Panorama that PWC had given legitimacy to Ms Dos Santos and her companies. ""PWC, if not facilitating the corruption, are providing a veneer of respectability that makes what's happening acceptable or more acceptable than it might otherwise be. ""So if I was at PWC I'd be conducting a pretty thorough audit of what decisions were made, and in hindsight actually: 'Did we make the wrong decision to accept this business and should we have reported what we had been presented with?'"" PWC says it strives to maintain the highest professional standards and has set expectations for consistent ethical behaviour across its global network. ""In response to the very serious and concerning allegations that have been raised, we immediately initiated an investigation and are working to thoroughly evaluate the facts and conclude our inquiry. ""We will not hesitate to take appropriate actions to ensure that we always stand for the very highest standards of behaviour, wherever we operate in the world.""

"Isabel dos Santos is one of the wealthiest women in the world Angolan billionaire Isabel dos Santos, who is embroiled in a huge financial scandal, has suggested that she may seek to become the country's president. In a BBC interview, Ms Dos Santos pointedly declined four times to rule out running for the presidency. Her father JosÃ© Eduardo dos Santos ruled Angola for 38 years. Prosecutors are seeking to recover $1bn (Â£760m) Ms Dos Santos and her associates are alleged to owe the state. She has denied any wrongdoing. Ms Dos Santos, 46, is one of the world's richest women, with Forbes magazine estimating her fortune to be worth $2.2bn, making her the richest woman in Africa. Africa Live: Updates on this and other stories Find out more about Angola Her father controversially appointed her as the head of Angola's state-owned oil firm Sonangol in 2016. She was sacked from the post in 2017 by President Joao LourenÃ§o, her father's handpicked successor. In an interview in London, she repeatedly stressed that her life was at risk if she returned to Angola in the current circumstances. Refusing to rule out the possibility of running for president, she said she had a strong sense of patriotism and duty to her country. ""To lead is to serve, so I will do whatever my life takes me,"" she said. Ms Dos Santos later told a Portuguese television channel that ""it's possible"" she might run for the presidency in 2022. The announcement marks a dramatic shift for a woman who has consistently portrayed herself as an entrepreneur with no interest in politics. JosÃ© Eduardo dos Santos (l) handed power to Joao LourenÃ§o in 2017 A court in the Angolan capital, Luanda, last month ordered the freezing of her bank accounts and of her vast business empire in the oil-rich country, following a string of investigations into alleged corruption by the Dos Santos family which prosecutors say has robbed the state of more than $2bn. ""These are false allegations and this is part ofâ¦ an orchestrated attack by the current government that is completely politically motivated,"" she said. Her half-brother, JosÃ© Filomeno dos Santos, is on trial in Angola on charges of corruption. The prosecution alleges that he and his co-accused helped spirit $500m out of the country during his time as head of Angola's Sovereign Wealth Fund. They have pleaded not guilty.

Despite coming from the same party, the MPLA, he has since stunned many Angolans by appearing to target the Dos Santos family as part of a broader anti-corruption drive. ""President LourenÃ§o is fighting for absolute power. There's a strong wish to neutralise any influence that [former] President Dos Santos might still have in the MPLA,"" Ms Dos Santos said. ""If a different candidate would appear [ahead of the 2022 presidential election] supported by former President Dos Santos or allies linked to him, that would really challenge [Mr LourenÃ§o's] position because his current track record is very, very poor,"" she added, citing rising unemployment, a stagnant economy and a wave of strikes. But the allegations of corruption aimed at Ms Dos Santos and her half-brother have been given new weight by the criminal investigations launched against her in Angola. ""The reality is that there is more than enough evidence against her. She's a key figure in the Dos Santos family and a credible threat to LourenÃ§o,"" said Darias Jonker, a regional analyst for the Eurasia Group, who said that legitimate allegations of corruption were being wielded by the state as part of a vicious power struggle within the MPLA. ""LourenÃ§o is sending a signal that there's a new sheriff in town, with new rules,"" Mr Jonker added. ""He needs his own patronage network, but his model is much more modest - he won't allow the multi-billion-dollar patronage deals that were a hallmark of the Dos Santos era. Would Isabel support some sort of palace coup? I think it's something she'd certainly consider."" JosÃ© Filomeno dos Santos is on trial for corruption Ms Dos Santos insisted she was being used as a ""scapegoat"" by President LourenÃ§o, and lashed out at the justice system in Angola, accusing the attorney general of ""lying"" and of refusing to allow her lawyers to see the evidence against her. ""I regret that Angola has chosen this path. I think that we all stand to lose a lot. A good leader is a prudent leader,"" she said, calling for a negotiated political solution to end her current legal battles and any further damage to the Angolan economy. But could she, or perhaps a proxy or ally, oust the current president and pave the way for a triumphant homecoming? ""I am a businesswoman. A lot of peopleâ¦ do like me and do understand what I do and do believe in what I do. ""There are thousands of people whom we gave their first job,"" she said, highlighting her business credentials, and rejecting the widespread perception that she owes much of her fortune to her father's long presidency as ""voices that come from the political opposition"". Angola's economy has boomed because of oil But some observers have been quick to play down the idea of a Dos Santos dynasty with Isabel - derided, for years, as ""The Princess"" in Angola - filling her father's shoes. ""Isabel doesn't have a strong constituency in her favour inside the party. For now, the party is behind LourenÃ§o, at least when it comes to the targeting of Isabel,"" said Ricardo Soares de Oliveira, an Oxford professor and expert on African politics. ""If he turns what is still a focused vendetta against the Dos Santos family into a systemic clean-up, the MPLA would not accept it and might even rediscover Dos Santos as the guy who enabled all of them to get rich. But there is no sign of this,"" the Oxford professor added. ""Dos Santos and Isabel remain deeply unpopular in the country and the party alike. I am not writing her off entirely but she is genuinely weakened by these ongoing revelations and her international standing is deteriorating fast."" With much of her fortune still thought to be intact outside Angola, Ms Dos Santos remains a formidable force. If she were to seek the presidency - and in the interview, she stressed that her commercial battles were not necessarily best resolved by political manoeuvres - she would first need the law to change in Angola as she is currently ineligible to stand because her mother is Russian. But those who have watched her remarkable business career, and her furious public assault on Angola's current political elites, agree that such an obstacle is unlikely to prove insurmountable.

"Isabel dos Santos, 46, currently lives abroad An Angolan court has ordered the seizure of the assets and bank accounts of the billionaire daughter of ex-President JosÃ© Eduardo dos Santos. The seizure appears to be part of an anti-corruption drive by the current government in oil-rich Angola. The administration of President Joao LourenÃ§o is seeking to recover $1bn (Â£760m) it says it is owed by Isabel dos Santos and her associates. She has repeatedly denied wrongdoing during her father's term in office. Often described as Africa's richest woman, Ms Dos Santos is estimated by Forbes magazine to have a fortune of $2.2bn. The 46-year-old lives abroad, saying she moved from Angola because her life had been threatened. She runs a huge business empire with stakes in companies in Angola and Portugal, where she has shares in cable television firm Nos SGPS. Find out more about Angola The court ordered the freezing of Ms Dos Santos' Angolan bank accounts and the seizure of her stake in local companies, including telecoms giant Unitel and bank Fomento de Angola (BFA), the state-owned news agency reported. In a statement, she said she condemned what she described as a ""politically motivated attack"" against her. ""I discovered that a trial had been held in total secrecy in Angola and the decision taken to issue a freezing order on my assets. There were no lawyers from my side present, nor the directors of my companies. We were only informed about it after the decision had been taken behind our backs. ""I have spent the last 24 hours trying to give assurances to my staff and all the families affected by this order that we must not give in. I will use all the instruments of Angolan and international law at my disposal to fight this order and ensure the truth comes out.""

She was sacked from the post in 2017 by Mr LourenÃ§o, her father's handpicked successor. Her brother, JosÃ© Filomeno dos Santos, is on trial in Angola on charges of corruption. The prosecution alleges that he and his co-accused helped spirit $500m out of the country during his time as head of Angola's Sovereign Wealth Fund. They have pleaded not guilty. By Andrew Harding, BBC Africa correspondent The court order was read out on state television - a powerful gesture in a country where, for decades, the Dos Santos family had seemed untouchable. Now, the fate of the vast business empire of Isabel dos Santos, the eldest daughter of the former president, is in doubt. Two years ago, Mr Dos Santos stepped down after 38 years in power. And to the surprise of many, his successor turned against the family, promising a major crackdown on corruption. Since then, billions of dollars in stolen assets have been recovered from abroad. Angolans are waiting to see if one alleged kleptocracy will simply be replaced by another or whether, as many hope, this vast oil-rich but impoverished nation is now serious about reforms and justice.

"Hope Street in Glasgow is the most polluted street in Scotland Campaigners have described Scotland's air quality as ""shameful"" despite an improvement in the country's most polluted street. Friends of the Earth Scotland said many areas suffered from higher pollution levels in 2019 than in previous years. But nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels on Hope Street in Glasgow averaged 55.6 micrograms per cubic metre (mcg/m3)last yearcompared with 60 in 2018. The Scottish government said it is working to address the problem. FoE Scotland said politicians at a local and national level had been too slow in reducing car traffic in urban areas and in making public transport both reliable and affordable. The environmental campaign group analysed official air pollution data for 2019, looking at two toxic pollutants which are primarily produced by transport. NO2 and particulate matter (PM10) are both caused by fossil-fuel engines. Glasgow Kerbside (Hope Street) - 55.63 Edinburgh Nicolson Street - 48.81 Dundee Seagate - 43.90 Inverness Academy Street - 43.32 Dundee Lochee Road - 42.50 Edinburgh St John's Road -41.93 Figures in mcg/m3. The European Ambient Air Quality Directive set a limit for NO2 of 40 mcg/m3. The deadline for compliance was 1 January 2010. FoE Scotland said the provisional data also indicates Salamander Street in Edinburgh has breached the legal limit for PM10, recording a figure of 19.44 mcg/m3. The Scottish annual statutory standard for PM10 is 18 mcg/m3. The deadline for this standard to have been met was 31 December 2010. The information indicated legal air safety standards, which should have been met a decade ago, are being breached at seven areas across Scotland. In Inverness the data shows increases on 2018 levels of pollution and the Highland capital has now breached the legal limit for NO2. Significant increases in pollution were also recorded in Falkirk, Perth, Bearsden, Broughty Ferry and Byres Road, in Glasgow's west end. Gavin Thomson, FoE Scotland's air pollution campaigner, said: ""These figures are shameful. They show air pollution is failing to improve across Scotland, which means millions of us are at risk of serious health conditions, like asthma, heart attacks, and strokes. ""In many areas, pollution problems appear to be getting worse. This is dangerous for our health, and is a failure of government to protect its most vulnerable citizens."" Mr Thomson said theCOP26 UN climate negotiations, which will be held in Glasgow in November, should act as a wake-up call. He added: ""Our transport system is unsustainable. It is harming our lungs, and causing climate change. ""Transport is the largest source of climate emissions in Scotland, with levels remaining pretty much the same for the last 30 years."" FoE said the billions traditionally earmarked for new road projects should instead be invested in public transport, walking and cycling. A Scottish government spokesman said: ""We are working hard to improve air quality across Scotland and we have seen significant reductions in pollution emissions in recent decades through tighter industrial regulation, improved fuel quality, cleaner vehicles and an increased focus on sustainable transport. ""Scotland enjoys a high level of air quality compared to the rest of the UK and other parts of Europe and we have set more stringent air quality targets."" The spokesman saidLow Emission Zoneswill help further improve air quality in towns and cities by preventing access to the most polluting vehicles. He also said practical and financial support, including Â£4.5m in annual funding, is being provided to local authorities to address local air pollution hotspots.

"German Chancellor Angela Merkel welcomed Russian President Vladimir Putin and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said that major powers are ""fully committed"" to a peaceful resolution in Libya after a summit in Berlin. World leaders have pledged not to interfere in Libya's ongoing civil conflict, and have vowed to uphold a UN arms embargo. The conflict pits powerful General Khalifa Haftar against the UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA). But although both Libyan warring sides were present, they did not meet. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the two sides were briefed and consulted by the other parties. Alongside Mrs Merkel, attendees included Russia's President Vladimir Putin, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. This video can not be played What's behind the fight for Libya? Before the meeting, Mr Johnson said the aim of the conference was to ""stop this jockeying for position"". ""The people of Libya have suffered enough,"" he said as he arrived on Sunday. ""It's time for the country to move forward."" Leaders from the EU, Russia and Turkey were among those who committed to an end to foreign intervention in Libya's war, and to uphold a UN arms embargo. After the conference, German leader Mrs Merkel stressed there was no military way to end the conflict,  ""only a political solution"". Who is Gen Khalifa Haftar? A migrant's tale: Jailed and ransomed in Libya Mr Guterres meanwhile said all the major powers present shared ""a strong commitment to stop"" any further escalation in the region. He did however say he was ""very worried"" about reports that forces loyal to Gen Hafter had closed several key ports and a major oil pipeline in the country. Tripoli-based Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj (left) and General Khalifa Haftar did not meet face to face Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov also expressed concerns. He said afterwards the major powers ""have not yet succeeded in launching a serious and stable dialogue"" between the warring parties. And there were questions about whether there could be a lasting ceasefire, and how this could be maintained. Nevertheless, Mr Lavrov said both sides had taken ""a small step"" forward. A ceasefirestill looks far-fetched By Rana Jawad, BBC North Africa correspondent The commitment by foreign backers of the conflict - which include Russia, Egypt and Turkey - to respect the UN arms embargo on Libya will only be taken seriously if the UN Security Council acts on violations. This is something it has failed to do in years of conflict. For any progress to be made in the long term, Libya's warring sides will need to declare and commit to a ceasefire, which still looks far-fetched. If there is eventually a long-enough ceasefire in place, it would allow the UN to go back to the political drawing board, and design a fresh political process for the country. Europe is trying to jostle its way back into a complex scene, which it all but abandoned over the past year because of its own divisions over a solution. If nothing else, the Berlin summit may have enabled it  to elbow its way back into a position with more leverage over stabilising Libya. Libya has been wracked by conflict since the 2011 uprising which ousted long-time strongman Muammar Gaddafi. Gen Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) controls much of eastern Libya, and last April he launched an offensive against the country's rival Government of National Accord (GNA) in the capital, Tripoli. His forces have so far been unable to take the city, but earlier this month the LNAcaptured the country's third-biggest city, Sirte. According to the UN, the fighting has killed hundreds of people and displaced thousands more from their homes. A truce was announced earlier this month between Gen Haftar and the GNA, led by Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj. But both sides blame each other for reported breaches of the agreement, andattempts to broker a lasting ceasefire broke down last week at a summit in Moscow. The role of foreign states in the conflict has come into focus in recent months, withTurkey passing a controversial lawto deploy troops to help GNA forces in Tripoli. Gen Haftar's LNA has the backing of Russia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Jordan. Mr SalamÃ© said foreign intervention has created a ""vicious cycle"" of violence in Libya On Saturday, UN Special Envoy to Libya Ghassan SalamÃ© told the BBC's Radio 4 Today Programme that a political solution to the conflict was best for all parties involved because Libya - with its vast geography, strong local identities, heavily armed population and weakened government infrastructure - was a difficult country for one group to control.

"Leaked documents reveal how Africa's richest woman made her fortune through exploiting her own country, and corruption. Isabel dos Santos got access to lucrative deals involving land, oil, diamonds and telecoms when her father was president of Angola, a southern African country rich in natural resources. The documents show how she and her husband were allowed to buy valuable state assets in a series of suspicious deals. Ms Dos Santos says the allegations against her are entirely false and that there is a politically motivated witch-hunt by the Angolan government. The former president's daughter has made the UK her home and owns expensive properties in central London. She is already under criminal investigation by the authorities in Angola for corruption and her assets in the country have been frozen. Now BBC Panorama has been given access to more than 700,000 leaked documents about the billionaire's business empire. Most were obtained by the Platform to Protect Whistle-blowers in Africa and shared with theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists,external(ICIJ). They've been investigated by 37 media organisations including the Guardian and Portugal's Expresso newspaper. Thirty per cent of Angolans live in poverty on less than $2 a day Andrew Feinstein, the head of Corruption Watch, says the documents show how Ms Dos Santos exploited her country at the expense of ordinary Angolans. ""Every time she appears on the cover of some glossy magazine somewhere in the world, every time that she hosts one of her glamorous parties in the south of France, she is doing so by trampling on the aspirations of the citizens of Angola."" The ICIJ have called the documents the Luanda Leaks. One of the most suspicious deals was run from London through a UK subsidiary of the Angolan state oil company Sonangol. Ms Dos Santos had been put in charge of the struggling Sonangol in 2016, thanks to a presidential decree from her father Jose Eduardo dos Santos, who kept a tight grip on his country for the 38 years he was in power. But when he retired as president in September 2017 her position was soon under threat, even though his hand-picked successor came from the same party. Ms Dos Santos was sacked two months later. Many Angolans have been surprised at the way that President JoÃ£o LourenÃ§o has gone after the business interests of his predecessor's family.  29 millionpopulation 27-yearcivil war, fought from independence to 2002 $4,170average income, but this masks big disparities 30%of population live in poverty - less than $1.90/day 2ndbiggest oil producer in Africa. Also major diamond producer The leaked documents show that as she left Sonangol, Ms Dos Santos approved $58m of suspicious payments to a consultancy company in Dubai called Matter Business Solutions. She says she has no financial interest in Matter, but the leaked documents reveal it was run by her business manager and owned by a friend. Panorama understands that Matter sent more than 50 invoices to Sonangol in London on the day that she was fired. Ms Dos Santos appears to have approved payments to her friend's company after she was sacked. Although some consultancy work had been carried out by Matter, there's very little detail on the invoices to justify such large bills. One asks for â¬472,196 for unspecified expenses - another asks for $928,517 for unspecified legal services. Two of the invoices - each for â¬676,339.97  - are for exactly the same work on the same date and Ms Dos Santos signed them both off anyway. These are some of the invoices Isabel dos Santos signed off in her last week at Sonangol Lawyers for Matter Business Solutions say it was brought in to help restructure the oil industry in Angola, and that the invoices were for work that had already been carried out by other consultancy companies it had hired. ""Regarding the invoices related with expenses, it is common for consultancy companies to add expenses to invoices as a general item. This is often due to those expenses involving large amounts of paperwork... Matter can produce documentary evidence to confirm all expenses incurred."" Ms Dos Santos's lawyers said her actions with regard to the Matter payments were entirely lawful and that she had not authorised payments after she had been dismissed from Sonangol. They said: ""All invoices paid were in relation to services contracted and agreed between the two parties, under a contract that was approved with the full knowledge and approval of the Sonangol Board of Directors."" This video can not be played Isabel dos Santos: ""I regret that Angola has chosen this path"" The ICIJ and Panorama have also uncovered new details about the business deals that made Ms Dos Santos rich. Much of her fortune is based on her ownership of a stake in the Portuguese energy company Galp, which one of her companies bought from Sonangol in 2006. The documents show it only had to pay 15% of the price upfront and that the remaining â¬63m ($70m) was turned into a low-interest loan from Sonangol. Under the generous terms of the loan, her debt to the Angolan people didn't have to be repaid for 11 years. Her stake in Galp is now worth more than â¬750m. Ms Dos Santos's company did offer to repay the Sonangol loan in 2017. The repayment offer should have been rejected because it didn't include almost â¬9m of interest owing. Bank orders signed by Isabel dos Santos transferred almost $58m out of the Angolan state oil company But Ms Dos Santos was in charge of Sonangol at the time and she accepted the money as full payment of her own debt. She was fired six days later and the payment was returned by the new Sonangol management. Ms Dos Santos says she initiated the purchase of the stake in Galp, and that Sonangol made money from the deal as well. ""There's absolutely no wrongdoing in any of those transactions. This investment is the investment that in history has generated the most benefit for the national oil company and all the contracts that were drafted are perfectly legal contracts, there are no wrongdoings."" Her lawyers say the repayment offer in 2017 covered what Sonangol had indicated was owed. It's a similar story in the diamond industry. Ms Dos Santos's husband, Sindika Dokolo, signed a one-sided agreement in 2012 with Angolan state diamond company Sodiam. They were supposed to be 50-50 partners in a deal to buy a stake in the Swiss luxury jeweller De Grisogono. But it was funded by the state company. The documents show that 18 months after the deal, Sodiam had put $79m into the partnership, while Mr Dokolo had only invested $4m. Sodiam also awarded him a â¬5m success fee for brokering the deal, so he didn't have to use any of his own money. Isabel dos Santos and her husband Sindika Dokolo can often be seen at film premieres and festivals with the world's stars The diamond deal gets even worse for the Angolan people. The documents reveal how Sodiam borrowed all the cash from a private bank in which Ms Dos Santos is the biggest shareholder. Sodiam has to pay 9% interest and the loan was guaranteed by a presidential decree from her father, so Ms Dos Santos's bank cannot lose out. Bravo da Rosa, the new chief executive of Sodiam, told Panorama that the Angolan people hadn't got a single dollar back from the deal: ""In the end, when we have finished paying back this loan, Sodiam will have lost more than $200m."" The former president also gave Ms Dos Santos's husband the right to buy some of Angola's raw diamonds. Eldest daughter of ex-President Jose Eduardo dos Santos Married to Congolese art collector and businessman Sindika Dokolo Educated in UK, where she currently lives Reported to be Africa's richest woman, with a fortune of some $2bn Has stakes in oil and mobile phone companies and banks, mostly in Angola and Portugal Source: Forbes magazine and others Read more:Africa's richest woman eyes Angolan presidency The Angolan government says the diamonds were sold at a knockdown price and sources have told Panorama that almost $1bn may have been lost. Ms Dos Santos told the BBC she couldn't comment because she was not a shareholder of De Grisogono. But the leaked documents show that she is described as a shareholder of De Grisogono by her own financial advisers. Mr Dokolo did put in some money later. His lawyers say he invested $115m and that the takeover of De Grisogono was his idea. They say his company paid above the market rate for the raw diamonds. The leaked documents also reveal how Ms Dos Santos bought land from the state in September 2017. Once again she only had to pay a small up-front fee. Her company bought a square kilometre of prime beachfront land in the capital Luanda with the help of presidential decrees signed by her father. Angolan state oil company Sonangol has a subsidiary in London where suspicious deals took place The contract says the land was worth $96m, but the documents show her company paid only 5% of that after agreeing to invest the rest in the development. Panorama traced some of the ordinary Angolans who were evicted to make way for the Futungo development. This video can not be played Albertina de Fatima describes living next to an open sewer in Angola They've been moved from the Luandan seafront to an isolated housing development 30 miles (50km) from the capital. Teresa Vissapa lost her business to Ms Dos Santos' development and is now struggling to bring up her seven children. She said: ""I only ask God to make her think a little more about our situation. Maybe she doesn't even know it, but we are suffering."" Ms Dos Santos declined to comment on the Futungo development. But it was not the only land deal involving Ms Dos Santos that displaced the local population. About 500 families were evicted from another stretch of the Luandan seafront after Isabel dos Santos got involved in another major redevelopment project. The families are now living in desperate conditions next to an open sewer. Some of their shacks are flooded with sewage whenever the tide rises. Ms Dos Santos says there weren't any evictions linked to her project and that her companies were never paid because the development was cancelled. The billionaire has also made big profits from the telecoms industry in Angola. She acquired a 25% stake in the country's biggest mobile phone provider, Unitel. It was granted a telecoms licence by her father in 1999 and she bought her stake the following year from a high ranking government official. Unitel has already paid her $1bn in dividends and her stake is worth another $1bn. But that's not the only way she got cash from the private company. She arranged for Unitel to lend â¬350m to a new company she set up, called Unitel International Holdings. The leaked documents show Isabel dos Santos signed off on loans from Unitel as both the borrower and the lender The company name was misleading because it wasn't connected to Unitel and Ms Dos Santos was the owner. The documents show Ms Dos Santos signed off on the loans as both lender and borrower, which is a blatant conflict of interest. Ms Dos Santos denied that the loans were corrupt. She said: ""This loan had both directors' approval and shareholders' approval, and it's a loan that will generate, and has generated, benefit for Unitel."" Her lawyers say the loans protected Unitel from currency fluctuations. Most of the companies involved in the dodgy deals were overseen by accountants working for the financial services company, Price Waterhouse Coopers (PWC). It's made millions providing auditing, consultancy and tax advice to her companies. But PWC has terminated its relationship with the billionaire and her family, after Panorama questioned the way the company had assisted Ms Dos Santos in the deals that had made her rich. PWC says it is holding an inquiry into the ""very serious and concerning allegations"". Tom Keatinge, director of the Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies, criticised PWC for giving the corruption a ""veneer of respectability"" Tom Keatinge, director of the Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies, told Panorama that PWC had given legitimacy to Ms Dos Santos and her companies. ""PWC, if not facilitating the corruption, are providing a veneer of respectability that makes what's happening acceptable or more acceptable than it might otherwise be. ""So if I was at PWC I'd be conducting a pretty thorough audit of what decisions were made, and in hindsight actually: 'Did we make the wrong decision to accept this business and should we have reported what we had been presented with?'"" PWC says it strives to maintain the highest professional standards and has set expectations for consistent ethical behaviour across its global network. ""In response to the very serious and concerning allegations that have been raised, we immediately initiated an investigation and are working to thoroughly evaluate the facts and conclude our inquiry. ""We will not hesitate to take appropriate actions to ensure that we always stand for the very highest standards of behaviour, wherever we operate in the world.""

"The olive ridley turtle is normally found off the warmer shores of Mexico A rare turtle has been rescued off the south coast by two women who were out swimming. The injured olive ridley turtle, usually found in Mexico or the Canaries, was spotted 20m off Seaford beach in East Sussex. Emma Holter and Lisa Glandfield brought the reptile to shore and saw it had injuries to its face and shell. They called the British Divers Marine Life Rescue, which took the turtle to Brighton Sea Life centre for treatment. This vulnerable species of turtle was also found in British waters in 2016,off the north coast of Wales. Emma Holter (left) and Lisa Glandfield pulled the turtle to shore Corinne Gordon, a marine medic, said: ""She does have some damage but her injuries are not life threatening. ""However, it is a big concern that she only had a temperature of 10.8C when picked up. She is in cold shock. ""We are really hoping she survives."" The turtle weights 2.5kg and is less than half a metre in length - olive ridleys usually grow to about 1m Once the juvenile turtle is at a more natural temperature for her breed, it is hoped she will be able to feed, Ms Gordon added. Nettie Glandfield was with her mother Lisa when the reptile was brought to shore. ""We thought she may be dead, but every now and then she would make a small movement,"" she said. ""The beach was windy, so we wrapped her in a wet towel to keep her a bit warmer, and sheltered, until the vet arrived. ""She wasn't very big, about the size of a Jack Russell, and she's so far from home."" The name of the olive ridley derives from the generally greenish colour of its skin and shell Dr Sky Yates, a vet who helped with the rescue and confirmed the markings and colour were consistent with the olive ridley breed, said: ""It was so bizarre seeing this turtle on Seaford beach.

"Former employees of new MP Jamie Wallis say he worked in the same office that ran a ""sugar daddy"" website Conservative MP Jamie Wallis worked in the same office that ran a ""sugar daddy"" dating website, two former employees have told BBC Wales. The newly-elected Bridgend MP has distanced himself from Sugar-Daddy.net. A Labour MP has said this was ""clearly"" contradicted by company records. James Cleverly told Sky News' Sophy Ridge On Sunday it was not his job as the chairman of the Conservative Party to investigate any claims linked to ""business arrangements"". One ex-staffer said he ""was aware"" the site was being run from the office, while another said his denial ""totally lacks credibility"". BBC Wales tried to contact Mr Wallis for comment but was told ""he's not available"". Sugar-Daddy.net offered introductions to wealthy individuals, saying: ""We can introduce you to your very own sugar daddy and solve your money worries. ""Whether you're a boy, girl, straight or gay, there's a sugar daddy for you."" Call for whip to be removed from Bridgend MP Jamie Wallis Jamie Wallis: Bridgend MP 'misled press' over sugar daddy site Jamie Wallis' denial of link to dating site 'misleading' Labour's Tonia Antoniazzi raised the link between Jamie Wallis MP and the site in the House of Commons on Wednesday following reports by Buzzfeed News. The Gower MP claimed Mr Wallis had ""misled the press about his involvement"" in the website, which she called ""exploitative and demeaning"". Mr Wallis told BuzzFeed: ""Online queries indicate the Sugar-Daddy.net website was registered in 2004 and ceased to be operational in 2010."" ""The site appears to have been owned and operated by a company named SD Billing Services Limited. ""For the avoidance of any doubt, I have never had a financial interest, nor been a director of SD Billing Services Limited and cannot comment on its operational activities."" Jamie Wallis was elected as MP for Bridgend in December Jamie Wallis is listed at Companies House as a person with significant control of Fields Group Ltd. Fields Group Ltd is listed as sole shareholder of SD Billing Services between October 2007 and October 2010. Within that period Mr Wallis was a shareholder and director of Fields Group. The Fields Group has operated a number of businesses from an office in Pencoed, outside Bridgend. Two former employees of those, who worked in an office with Jamie Wallis, told the BBC's Politics Wales programme that Sugar-Daddy.net was also run from that office. One said: ""It's not believable to think he didn't know about the site because it was up there on the screen (in the office). ""He would be aware, he was always in the management meetings with everyone else and that's when they talk about how their businesses are going. ""It was just one main office, couple of smaller offices off it on one floor. ""It wasn't a big office, I would say there's about 20 people in it on the main floor. Everyone knew each other. Â Â ""It [Sugar-Daddy.net] was on screen. I saw it many times on screen."" They said he ""had to be aware"". Tonia Antoniazzi said the site was ""demeaning"" and ""exploitative"" ""I mean, just walking through the office he would see it on screen,"" they added. Â Â Another former employee said: ""Sugar Daddy was run from the Bridgend office. Jamie was aware of it and he was fine with it. ""He saw it as a good business model. He had no concerns and never raised any issues about the ethics of it."" BuzzFeed News reported that 10 companies where Mr Wallis was or is a director were subject to more than 800 complaints to trading standards between January 2008 and February 2017, according to Bridgend council. The council said the companies had been the subject of 20 enforcement visits. Mr Wallis told BuzzFeed the figures were ""nonsense"" and he is taking legal action against Bridgend council. A Bridgend council spokesman confirmed they had received a ""letter-before-action"" from Fields Group Limited but could not comment further ""due to the possibility of ongoing proceedings"". Mr Cleverly told Sky News: ""The activities of that website is not something I am at all comfortable with but, ultimately, the relationship between that company and any companies that Jamie might have been involved in is something I am not in a position to look into. Business arrangements are separate. ""If he has done anything wrong that will be looked at by the whips but, at this stage, I don't know he has done anything wrong and the exact relationship between him and various businesses I don't have full details of that.""

"German Chancellor Angela Merkel welcomed Russian President Vladimir Putin and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said that major powers are ""fully committed"" to a peaceful resolution in Libya after a summit in Berlin. World leaders have pledged not to interfere in Libya's ongoing civil conflict, and have vowed to uphold a UN arms embargo. The conflict pits powerful General Khalifa Haftar against the UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA). But although both Libyan warring sides were present, they did not meet. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the two sides were briefed and consulted by the other parties. Alongside Mrs Merkel, attendees included Russia's President Vladimir Putin, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. This video can not be played What's behind the fight for Libya? Before the meeting, Mr Johnson said the aim of the conference was to ""stop this jockeying for position"". ""The people of Libya have suffered enough,"" he said as he arrived on Sunday. ""It's time for the country to move forward."" Leaders from the EU, Russia and Turkey were among those who committed to an end to foreign intervention in Libya's war, and to uphold a UN arms embargo. After the conference, German leader Mrs Merkel stressed there was no military way to end the conflict,  ""only a political solution"". Who is Gen Khalifa Haftar? A migrant's tale: Jailed and ransomed in Libya Mr Guterres meanwhile said all the major powers present shared ""a strong commitment to stop"" any further escalation in the region. He did however say he was ""very worried"" about reports that forces loyal to Gen Hafter had closed several key ports and a major oil pipeline in the country. Tripoli-based Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj (left) and General Khalifa Haftar did not meet face to face Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov also expressed concerns. He said afterwards the major powers ""have not yet succeeded in launching a serious and stable dialogue"" between the warring parties. And there were questions about whether there could be a lasting ceasefire, and how this could be maintained. Nevertheless, Mr Lavrov said both sides had taken ""a small step"" forward. A ceasefirestill looks far-fetched By Rana Jawad, BBC North Africa correspondent The commitment by foreign backers of the conflict - which include Russia, Egypt and Turkey - to respect the UN arms embargo on Libya will only be taken seriously if the UN Security Council acts on violations. This is something it has failed to do in years of conflict. For any progress to be made in the long term, Libya's warring sides will need to declare and commit to a ceasefire, which still looks far-fetched. If there is eventually a long-enough ceasefire in place, it would allow the UN to go back to the political drawing board, and design a fresh political process for the country. Europe is trying to jostle its way back into a complex scene, which it all but abandoned over the past year because of its own divisions over a solution. If nothing else, the Berlin summit may have enabled it  to elbow its way back into a position with more leverage over stabilising Libya. Libya has been wracked by conflict since the 2011 uprising which ousted long-time strongman Muammar Gaddafi. Gen Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) controls much of eastern Libya, and last April he launched an offensive against the country's rival Government of National Accord (GNA) in the capital, Tripoli. His forces have so far been unable to take the city, but earlier this month the LNAcaptured the country's third-biggest city, Sirte. According to the UN, the fighting has killed hundreds of people and displaced thousands more from their homes. A truce was announced earlier this month between Gen Haftar and the GNA, led by Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj. But both sides blame each other for reported breaches of the agreement, andattempts to broker a lasting ceasefire broke down last week at a summit in Moscow. The role of foreign states in the conflict has come into focus in recent months, withTurkey passing a controversial lawto deploy troops to help GNA forces in Tripoli. Gen Haftar's LNA has the backing of Russia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Jordan. Mr SalamÃ© said foreign intervention has created a ""vicious cycle"" of violence in Libya On Saturday, UN Special Envoy to Libya Ghassan SalamÃ© told the BBC's Radio 4 Today Programme that a political solution to the conflict was best for all parties involved because Libya - with its vast geography, strong local identities, heavily armed population and weakened government infrastructure - was a difficult country for one group to control.

"This video can not be played Victims of stalking behaviour, Clive Ruggles and Zoe Dronfield, said they welcomed the new police powers A court order to stop suspected stalkers under police investigation contacting victims could have made a ""critical difference"" to a woman killed by her ex-boyfriend, her father says. Powers designed to help police act at ""the earliest opportunity"" come into force in England and Wales on Monday. Those who breach the civil order could end up with five years in prison. Clive Ruggles, whose daughter Alice was murdered, said the new orders ""have teeth"" but must be properly enforced. From Monday, police will be able to apply to magistrates for aStalking Protection Order (SPO),external, which will usually remain in place for two years. Courts will also have the power to impose an interim SPO to provide immediate protection for victims while a decision is being made. The orders will also be able to force stalkers to seek professional help. Stalked murder victim 'failed by police' Stalkers 'act 100 times before police told' Police ordered to improve stalking probes Mr Ruggles, of the Alice Ruggles Trust, said the existence of the orders could have made a ""critical difference"" for his 24-year-old daughter,who was killed by her former partner. Almost one in five women and almost one in 10 men aged 16 and over have experienced some form of stalking, according to the crime survey for England and Wales. Stalking was made a specific criminal offence in England and Wales in 2012. In Scotland, stalking is illegal under the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010 and in Northern Ireland it is prohibited under the Protection from Harassment Order (NI) 1997. Mr Ruggles said: ""The new stalking orders have teeth, breaching them will be a criminal offence."" But he added they ""absolutely"" have to be properly applied. Professor Jane Monckton-Smith, who specialises in researching homicide, stalking and coercive control at the University of Gloucestershire, said: ""I think the orders could be really useful if they are used correctly"". But breaches could put victims in danger and must be taken seriously by the courts, she added. ""Stalkers by their nature are obsessive and will keep going and going until they are stopped."" Plans to introduce the new civil orders were first floated in 2015, when Theresa May was home secretary. In 2016, then-Home Secretary Amber Rudd promised to introduce themas soon as parliamentary time allowed. Campaigner Sam Taylor, who runs a victim support group in Sussex, said the orders could give victims ""respite"" from being relentlessly pursued. But she said they must be followed by a ""significant investment in training"" because there was still a ""fundamental misunderstanding"" in the criminal justice system of what stalking means.

"The olive ridley turtle is normally found off the warmer shores of Mexico A rare turtle has been rescued off the south coast by two women who were out swimming. The injured olive ridley turtle, usually found in Mexico or the Canaries, was spotted 20m off Seaford beach in East Sussex. Emma Holter and Lisa Glandfield brought the reptile to shore and saw it had injuries to its face and shell. They called the British Divers Marine Life Rescue, which took the turtle to Brighton Sea Life centre for treatment. This vulnerable species of turtle was also found in British waters in 2016,off the north coast of Wales. Emma Holter (left) and Lisa Glandfield pulled the turtle to shore Corinne Gordon, a marine medic, said: ""She does have some damage but her injuries are not life threatening. ""However, it is a big concern that she only had a temperature of 10.8C when picked up. She is in cold shock. ""We are really hoping she survives."" The turtle weights 2.5kg and is less than half a metre in length - olive ridleys usually grow to about 1m Once the juvenile turtle is at a more natural temperature for her breed, it is hoped she will be able to feed, Ms Gordon added. Nettie Glandfield was with her mother Lisa when the reptile was brought to shore. ""We thought she may be dead, but every now and then she would make a small movement,"" she said. ""The beach was windy, so we wrapped her in a wet towel to keep her a bit warmer, and sheltered, until the vet arrived. ""She wasn't very big, about the size of a Jack Russell, and she's so far from home."" The name of the olive ridley derives from the generally greenish colour of its skin and shell Dr Sky Yates, a vet who helped with the rescue and confirmed the markings and colour were consistent with the olive ridley breed, said: ""It was so bizarre seeing this turtle on Seaford beach. ""She's got a long way to go with recovery, but the ladies who pulled her from the water did a great job.""

"The government is examining whether to move the House of Lords out of London, the Conservative Party chairman has said.

According to the Sunday Times,external, York and Birmingham have emerged as contenders to permanently host the upper chamber. But Labour MP Nadia Whittome described the idea as ""superficial"". According to the newspaper, a decision on whether to relocate the chamber will be determined as part of a constitutional review being launched in the spring.

How stand-in Commons chamber will look What is the House of Lords? House of Lords 'should lose 200 peers' The House of Lords is already due to temporarily relocate out of the Palace of Westminster as part of refurbishment plans due to begin in around 2025. A parliamentary committee haspreviously recommended,externalthe chamber should move to the government-owned Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre in Westminster whilst works are under way. The venue would only be a short walk from Richmond House, the former home of the Department of Health, which has been proposed as a temporary home for the House of Commons. Asked to comment on the proposals in the Sunday Times report, Mr Cleverly told Sky's Sophy Ridge: ""It's one of a range of things that we are looking into.

""Fundamentally what this is about is demonstrating to the people that we are going to do things differently."" Analysis by Peter Saull, BBC political reporter For many reasons, 'The Lords of the North,' as some are calling it, appears far-fetched.

Large swathes of the Midlands and the north of England turned Conservative in the election - and the government wants to bring Westminster closer to the voters it represents; perhaps literally. Whether or not it actually comes to pass, the idea of moving the second chamber north fits in nicely with Downing Street's ""levelling up"" agenda.

""I think it's absolutely right that if you want to be a government of the people, you must reach out to people across the country."" But Nadia Whittome, the newly-elected MP for Nottingham East, told the programme: ""Working class people whether in the North, the Midlands or the South don't care about the unelected House of Lords."" ""We want jobs, we want proper investment and meaningful decentralisation of power,"" she said. ""Replace the House of Lords with an elected chamber and move it to the North and then we're talking - but this is superficial, it's tinkering around the edges."" What is the House of Lords?

"Prince Harry and Meghan will no longer use their HRH titles and will not receive public funds for royal duties, Buckingham Palace has announced. The couple will also no longer formally represent the Queen. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex intend to repay Â£2.4m of taxpayer money for the refurbishment of Frogmore Cottage, which will remain their UK family home, the statement added. The new arrangement comes into effect in spring this year, the palace said. The statement comes after the Queen held talks with the couple on Monday about their future, following their announcement that they wanted to""step back"" as senior royalsand divide their time between the UK and Canada. Queen's statement on Harry and Meghan in full The Harry and Meghan story Their future: Your questions answered The Queen said following ""many months of conversations and more recent discussions"" she was ""pleased that together we have found a constructive and supportive way forward for my grandson and his family"". ""Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much loved members of my family,"" the statement continued. She thanked them for their ""dedicated work"", adding that she was ""particularly proud of how Meghan has so quickly become one of the family."" On Sunday, the Queen made her first public appearance since the announcement, arriving at church with the Duke of York. The Queen smiled broadly as she was greeted at St Mary the Virgin Church in Norfolk In a separate statement, Buckingham Palace said: ""The Sussexes will not use their HRH titles as they are no longer working members of the Royal Family."" HRH, an abbreviation of His/Her Royal Highness, is used as part of the title of some members of the royal family. BBC royal correspondent Daniela Relph told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""When they first issued that statement about what they wanted, they talked about forging this progressive role within the Royal Family, about stepping back from royal duties. This isn't stepping back, it's stepping away entirely."" She said the question that will ""hang over them"" for the next year is what their commercial life will look like. ""This will be a test of the integrity of Harry and Meghan,"" she said. This video can not be played ""Nothing like this has ever happened before"" â royal correspondent Daniela Relph explains As well as repaying the cost of refurbishing Frogmore Cottage, the couple will pay a ""commercial rent"" for the property. Buckingham Palace said the duke and duchess understood they were required to withdraw from royal duties, including official military appointments. ""While they can no longer formally represent the Queen, the Sussexes have made clear that everything they do will continue to uphold the values of Her Majesty,"" it said. The statement added that the pair would continue to maintain their private patronages and associations. The Rugby Football League said it was ""delighted"" to continue to have the duke as patron, praising his ""genuine commitment"". Map Ives, director and founder of Rhino Conservation Botswana, said he had already been told by an official in Harry's office that the duke ""wants to continue"" his patronage of the organisation. ""If anything our relationship should get stronger,"" Mr Ives said. There has been much speculation on who will provide security arrangements for the couple and how much it will cost, but the palace said it would not comment on such matters. Prince Harry hosted the Rugby League World Cup draw at Buckingham Palace on Thursday Harry and Meghan's new website, sussexroyal.com, was updated following the Queen's statement to say: ""Information on the roles and work of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will be updated on this website in due course."" The party prince who carved his own path Your questions answered: Tax, titles and trademarks Earlier this month, Harry and Meghan said they wanted to create a ""progressive new role"" within the institution, where they would be financially independent and divide their time between the UK and North America. Last year, they both spoke about the difficulties of royal life and media attention. The duke said he feared his wife would fall victim to""the same powerful forces"" that led to his mother's death. A legal case against the Mail on Sunday for publishing what the duchess says was a private letter has also raised the prospect ofher father testifying against her. In comments for a forthcoming Channel 5 documentary, Thomas Markle accused the couple of ""cheapening"" the Royal Family and ""making it shabby"". ""Every young girl wants to become a princess and she got that and now she's tossing that away,"" he said. ""It looks like she's tossing that away for money."" They will always be, the Queen writes, ""much loved members of my family"". But that's about it. No royal title, no royal duties, no military appointments, no tours, most of their time spent in Canada, no public money. It is harder to think of a much cleaner break than this. Harry and Meghan are still members of the Royal Family, but they are effectively no longer royal. The early talk was of a much more mixed life - one where perhaps Harry and Meghan continued with some royal duties, dividing their time equally between the UK and Canada. But the contradictions and conflicts of interest were too many. There are still lots of details to thrash out. And the whole thing will be reviewed after a year. But a new life awaits Harry and Meghan - celebrities, certainly, but a different kind of royalty. Some questions about the couple's future status remain unanswered, including what their tax and immigration status will be in the UK and Canada. It is not yet known whether Meghan still intends to gain British citizenship, which would entail her spending a certain amount of time in the UK. While the couple intend to divide their time between the UK and Canada, it is expected that they will spend the majority of their time in Canada. Former press secretary to the Queen Dickie Arbiter said the new arrangement brings a crisis for the Royal Family to an acceptable conclusion. ""It's a win-win situation. It's the best sort of deal that they could have come up with, without totally upsetting the apple cart - although Harry and Meghan made a pretty good job of that with their bombshell announcement,"" he said. ""It's a workable situation and it's a situation that is going to be reviewed after a year which kind of indicates that the door might be just left ajar."" But Katie Nicholl, Vanity Fair royal correspondent, said Harry and Meghan stepping away from royal duties was a loss for the institution. ""The Sussexes have won because they've got what they want, which is independence from the Royal Family. I do think the Royal Family will have lost out. Harry and Meghan brought a very magical and unique brand to the Royal Family,"" she said. She said that the agreement could also pave the way for younger royals, however. ""Prince Charles wants a slimmed-down monarchy. Maybe this is all in keeping with how the monarchy sees itself moving forward. If this works, if it's seen as a success, I think it could be a blueprint for future generations,"" she said. One question that still needs to be resolved is the issue of their security bill when they are in Canada, said David McClure, an expert on royal finances. He told BBC Breakfast that the overall royal security bill was estimated at more than Â£100m a year, and that one Canadian security company believed it would cost about Â£7m a year to protect Harry and Meghan when they are out of the UK. ""The Canadians are not keen on picking up the tab, so I'm sure there will be quite heated discussions between the Canadian government and the British government as to who pays for it,"" he said. If they plan to ""maximise the commercial opportunities"", the Sussexes may come under pressure to contribute to that cost, Mr McClure added. Megan this week visited a girls' charity in Vancouver Meghan and Harry have already begun a transition phase of living in Canada and the UK. The move was agreed by the Queen, Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge. The duchess is in the Commonwealth country with son Archie, where the Sussexes spent six weeks over the festive period.

"The Queen, accompanied by the Duke of York, was greeted by well-wishers at St Mary the Virgin Church in Norfolk Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the whole country will want to wish the Duke and Duchess of Sussex well for the future as they give up royal duties. It came as the Queen went to church near Sandringham, in her first public appearance since it was announced the couple were giving up their HRH titles. In her statement yesterday she wished them ""a happy and peaceful new life"". But Thomas Markle, Meghan's father, accused them of ""cheapening"" the Royal Family. Earlier this month, Prince Harry and Meghan announcedtheir intention ""to step back as 'senior' members of the Royal Familyand work to become financially independent"". It prompted intensive discussions between the prince and other senior royals, led by the Queen. On Saturday, the Queen and Buckingham Palace announced that they had reached a new arrangement - that the couple would no longer use their HRH titles, receive public funds for royal duties or formally represent the Queen from spring. Queen's statement on Harry and Meghan in full Harry and Meghan's future: Your questions answered This video can not be played ""Nothing like this has ever happened before"" â royal correspondent Daniela Relph explains Speaking briefly to reporters at a summit in Berlin, Mr Johnson said he had been confident the Royal Family would find a way forward for Prince Harry and Meghan, adding: ""I think the whole country will want to join in wishing them the very best for the future.""

Diana Pearl, a former Royal reporter at People, agreed, saying perception of the Royal Family would not ultimately be damaged. She said the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge ""look very solid and drama-free after this whole experience - and they really are the future of the family."" However Katie Nicholl, Vanity Fair royal correspondent, said Harry and Meghan have won their independence, but the Royal Family has lost their ""very magical and unique brand"". The party prince who carved his own path The Harry and Meghan story Who has won?, some ask. Harry and Meghan have got what they want. And for some that is enough. Round one to the Sussexes. But the price is high, much higher than it was originally thought. The Sussexes and the palace first hoped there might be a way to keep the couple half-in half-out, perhaps with select but high visibility royal duties in and out of the UK. That's not happening. Royal through blood and marriage they will always be.  But professionally Royal, publicly Royal, they no longer are. They will carry out no duties, no tours, use no royal title. That Royal part their life - all of Harry's life - is over. It is a huge step. Only Edward VIII went further, and his is a bitter example. No one has won. Everyone - family, Crown and country - has lost. Last year, Prince Harry and Meghan spoke of the difficulties of royal life and media scrutiny, with the duke saying he feared his wife would fall victim to ""the same powerful forces"" that led to his mother's death. In her statement on Saturday, the Queen said she was pleased that a ""constructive and supportive way forward for [her] grandson and his family"" had been found.

The duke and duchess intend to repay Â£2.4m of taxpayer money used for the refurbishment of Frogmore Cottage, the statement said. The house in Windsor, for which they will pay rent, will remain their family home as they divide their time between the UK and Canada. The pair will continue to maintain their private patronages and associations - the duke currently holds 16 patronages, including the Invictus Games Foundation, the Royal Marines and the Rugby Football League; and the duchess four - the National Theatre, the Association of Commonwealth Universities, London-based animal charity Mayhew, and women's charity Smart Works.

"Heavy rains have doused many of the country's bushfires Forecasters have warned of severe storms in Australia's fire-hit state of Victoria, which could lead to flooding. Recent heavy rains have dampened many of the country's bushfires, but also led to power cuts and road closures. The fires, which began in September, have claimed at least 28 lives, destroyed thousands of homes and scorched millions of acres of land. As wet weather helped to ease the crisis, the government announced a major package to aid tourism recovery.

"The olive ridley turtle is normally found off the warmer shores of Mexico A rare turtle has been rescued off the south coast by two women who were out swimming. The injured olive ridley turtle, usually found in Mexico or the Canaries, was spotted 20m off Seaford beach in East Sussex. Emma Holter and Lisa Glandfield brought the reptile to shore and saw it had injuries to its face and shell. They called the British Divers Marine Life Rescue, which took the turtle to Brighton Sea Life centre for treatment. This vulnerable species of turtle was also found in British waters in 2016,off the north coast of Wales. Emma Holter (left) and Lisa Glandfield pulled the turtle to shore Corinne Gordon, a marine medic, said: ""She does have some damage but her injuries are not life threatening. ""However, it is a big concern that she only had a temperature of 10.8C when picked up. She is in cold shock. ""We are really hoping she survives."" The turtle weights 2.5kg and is less than half a metre in length - olive ridleys usually grow to about 1m Once the juvenile turtle is at a more natural temperature for her breed, it is hoped she will be able to feed, Ms Gordon added. Nettie Glandfield was with her mother Lisa when the reptile was brought to shore. ""We thought she may be dead, but every now and then she would make a small movement,"" she said. ""The beach was windy, so we wrapped her in a wet towel to keep her a bit warmer, and sheltered, until the vet arrived. ""She wasn't very big, about the size of a Jack Russell, and she's so far from home."" The name of the olive ridley derives from the generally greenish colour of its skin and shell Dr Sky Yates, a vet who helped with the rescue and confirmed the markings and colour were consistent with the olive ridley breed, said: ""It was so bizarre seeing this turtle on Seaford beach. ""She's got a long way to go with recovery, but the ladies who pulled her from the water did a great job.""

"German Chancellor Angela Merkel welcomed Russian President Vladimir Putin and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said that major powers are ""fully committed"" to a peaceful resolution in Libya after a summit in Berlin. World leaders have pledged not to interfere in Libya's ongoing civil conflict, and have vowed to uphold a UN arms embargo. The conflict pits powerful General Khalifa Haftar against the UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA). But although both Libyan warring sides were present, they did not meet. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the two sides were briefed and consulted by the other parties. Alongside Mrs Merkel, attendees included Russia's President Vladimir Putin, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. This video can not be played What's behind the fight for Libya? Before the meeting, Mr Johnson said the aim of the conference was to ""stop this jockeying for position"". ""The people of Libya have suffered enough,"" he said as he arrived on Sunday. ""It's time for the country to move forward."" Leaders from the EU, Russia and Turkey were among those who committed to an end to foreign intervention in Libya's war, and to uphold a UN arms embargo. After the conference, German leader Mrs Merkel stressed there was no military way to end the conflict,  ""only a political solution"". Who is Gen Khalifa Haftar? A migrant's tale: Jailed and ransomed in Libya Mr Guterres meanwhile said all the major powers present shared ""a strong commitment to stop"" any further escalation in the region. He did however say he was ""very worried"" about reports that forces loyal to Gen Hafter had closed several key ports and a major oil pipeline in the country. Tripoli-based Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj (left) and General Khalifa Haftar did not meet face to face Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov also expressed concerns. He said afterwards the major powers ""have not yet succeeded in launching a serious and stable dialogue"" between the warring parties. And there were questions about whether there could be a lasting ceasefire, and how this could be maintained. Nevertheless, Mr Lavrov said both sides had taken ""a small step"" forward. A ceasefirestill looks far-fetched By Rana Jawad, BBC North Africa correspondent The commitment by foreign backers of the conflict - which include Russia, Egypt and Turkey - to respect the UN arms embargo on Libya will only be taken seriously if the UN Security Council acts on violations. This is something it has failed to do in years of conflict. For any progress to be made in the long term, Libya's warring sides will need to declare and commit to a ceasefire, which still looks far-fetched. If there is eventually a long-enough ceasefire in place, it would allow the UN to go back to the political drawing board, and design a fresh political process for the country. Europe is trying to jostle its way back into a complex scene, which it all but abandoned over the past year because of its own divisions over a solution. If nothing else, the Berlin summit may have enabled it  to elbow its way back into a position with more leverage over stabilising Libya. Libya has been wracked by conflict since the 2011 uprising which ousted long-time strongman Muammar Gaddafi. Gen Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) controls much of eastern Libya, and last April he launched an offensive against the country's rival Government of National Accord (GNA) in the capital, Tripoli. His forces have so far been unable to take the city, but earlier this month the LNAcaptured the country's third-biggest city, Sirte. According to the UN, the fighting has killed hundreds of people and displaced thousands more from their homes. A truce was announced earlier this month between Gen Haftar and the GNA, led by Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj. But both sides blame each other for reported breaches of the agreement, andattempts to broker a lasting ceasefire broke down last week at a summit in Moscow. The role of foreign states in the conflict has come into focus in recent months, withTurkey passing a controversial lawto deploy troops to help GNA forces in Tripoli.

"Hope Street in Glasgow is the most polluted street in Scotland Campaigners have described Scotland's air quality as ""shameful"" despite an improvement in the country's most polluted street. Friends of the Earth Scotland said many areas suffered from higher pollution levels in 2019 than in previous years. But nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels on Hope Street in Glasgow averaged 55.6 micrograms per cubic metre (mcg/m3)last yearcompared with 60 in 2018. The Scottish government said it is working to address the problem. FoE Scotland said politicians at a local and national level had been too slow in reducing car traffic in urban areas and in making public transport both reliable and affordable. The environmental campaign group analysed official air pollution data for 2019, looking at two toxic pollutants which are primarily produced by transport. NO2 and particulate matter (PM10) are both caused by fossil-fuel engines. Glasgow Kerbside (Hope Street) - 55.63 Edinburgh Nicolson Street - 48.81 Dundee Seagate - 43.90 Inverness Academy Street - 43.32 Dundee Lochee Road - 42.50 Edinburgh St John's Road -41.93 Figures in mcg/m3. The European Ambient Air Quality Directive set a limit for NO2 of 40 mcg/m3. The deadline for compliance was 1 January 2010. FoE Scotland said the provisional data also indicates Salamander Street in Edinburgh has breached the legal limit for PM10, recording a figure of 19.44 mcg/m3. The Scottish annual statutory standard for PM10 is 18 mcg/m3. The deadline for this standard to have been met was 31 December 2010. The information indicated legal air safety standards, which should have been met a decade ago, are being breached at seven areas across Scotland. In Inverness the data shows increases on 2018 levels of pollution and the Highland capital has now breached the legal limit for NO2. Significant increases in pollution were also recorded in Falkirk, Perth, Bearsden, Broughty Ferry and Byres Road, in Glasgow's west end. Gavin Thomson, FoE Scotland's air pollution campaigner, said: ""These figures are shameful. They show air pollution is failing to improve across Scotland, which means millions of us are at risk of serious health conditions, like asthma, heart attacks, and strokes. ""In many areas, pollution problems appear to be getting worse. This is dangerous for our health, and is a failure of government to protect its most vulnerable citizens."" Mr Thomson said theCOP26 UN climate negotiations, which will be held in Glasgow in November, should act as a wake-up call. He added: ""Our transport system is unsustainable. It is harming our lungs, and causing climate change. ""Transport is the largest source of climate emissions in Scotland, with levels remaining pretty much the same for the last 30 years."" FoE said the billions traditionally earmarked for new road projects should instead be invested in public transport, walking and cycling. A Scottish government spokesman said: ""We are working hard to improve air quality across Scotland and we have seen significant reductions in pollution emissions in recent decades through tighter industrial regulation, improved fuel quality, cleaner vehicles and an increased focus on sustainable transport. ""Scotland enjoys a high level of air quality compared to the rest of the UK and other parts of Europe and we have set more stringent air quality targets."" The spokesman saidLow Emission Zoneswill help further improve air quality in towns and cities by preventing access to the most polluting vehicles. He also said practical and financial support, including Â£4.5m in annual funding, is being provided to local authorities to address local air pollution hotspots.

"The cordon has now been lifted Armed police were deployed in Shrewsbury after a report of a man with a firearm on the roof of a Tesco supermarket. West Mercia Police said it received a call at about 16:00 GMT that an armed man was on the Tesco Extra on Battlefield Road. The police helicopter was sent out and a cordon was in place while a search of the area was carried out. Police said no-one was found but the call was ""made in good faith"". Supt Jim Baker said they took ""all reports involving firearms incredibly seriously"" and armed officers were deployed to carry out a search of the area. ""An extensive search has been carried out by officers on the ground, the police helicopter and a fire and rescue service drone and we're satisfied the call was made in good faith and have been able to discount the information we initially acted on,"" he said. He thanked the public for their patience during the disruption the search caused. Writing on Twitter, Paul Fulgoni said he saw""at least 10 armed police,external"" as well as a helicopter. He said all of Battlefield had been cordoned off, including McDonald's, Frankie & Benny's and the residential estates. The supermarket, which was sealed off for about three hours, has since reopened.

"This video can not be played Victims of stalking behaviour, Clive Ruggles and Zoe Dronfield, said they welcomed the new police powers A court order to stop suspected stalkers under police investigation contacting victims could have made a ""critical difference"" to a woman killed by her ex-boyfriend, her father says. Powers designed to help police act at ""the earliest opportunity"" come into force in England and Wales on Monday. Those who breach the civil order could end up with five years in prison. Clive Ruggles, whose daughter Alice was murdered, said the new orders ""have teeth"" but must be properly enforced. From Monday, police will be able to apply to magistrates for aStalking Protection Order (SPO),external, which will usually remain in place for two years. Courts will also have the power to impose an interim SPO to provide immediate protection for victims while a decision is being made. The orders will also be able to force stalkers to seek professional help. Stalked murder victim 'failed by police' Stalkers 'act 100 times before police told' Police ordered to improve stalking probes Mr Ruggles, of the Alice Ruggles Trust, said the existence of the orders could have made a ""critical difference"" for his 24-year-old daughter,who was killed by her former partner. Almost one in five women and almost one in 10 men aged 16 and over have experienced some form of stalking, according to the crime survey for England and Wales. Stalking was made a specific criminal offence in England and Wales in 2012. In Scotland, stalking is illegal under the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010 and in Northern Ireland it is prohibited under the Protection from Harassment Order (NI) 1997. Mr Ruggles said: ""The new stalking orders have teeth, breaching them will be a criminal offence."" But he added they ""absolutely"" have to be properly applied. Professor Jane Monckton-Smith, who specialises in researching homicide, stalking and coercive control at the University of Gloucestershire, said: ""I think the orders could be really useful if they are used correctly"". But breaches could put victims in danger and must be taken seriously by the courts, she added. ""Stalkers by their nature are obsessive and will keep going and going until they are stopped."" Plans to introduce the new civil orders were first floated in 2015, when Theresa May was home secretary. In 2016, then-Home Secretary Amber Rudd promised to introduce themas soon as parliamentary time allowed. Campaigner Sam Taylor, who runs a victim support group in Sussex, said the orders could give victims ""respite"" from being relentlessly pursued. But she said they must be followed by a ""significant investment in training"" because there was still a ""fundamental misunderstanding"" in the criminal justice system of what stalking means.

"Heavy rains have doused many of the country's bushfires Forecasters have warned of severe storms in Australia's fire-hit state of Victoria, which could lead to flooding. Recent heavy rains have dampened many of the country's bushfires, but also led to power cuts and road closures. The fires, which began in September, have claimed at least 28 lives, destroyed thousands of homes and scorched millions of acres of land. As wet weather helped to ease the crisis, the government announced a major package to aid tourism recovery. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the government would channel some A$76m ($52m; Â£40m) from the national bushfire recovery fund into the industry. Have Australia's trees made the fires worse? How the world has responded to Australia's fires Are most fires in Australia caused by arson? He described the package on Sunday as an ""urgent injection"" of funds for affected businesses, and said tourism in the country was facing ""its biggest challenge in living memory"". The Australian Tourism Industry Council told Reuters news agency that damages to the industry were approaching A$1 billion. The Australian Tourism Export Council told the Australian Financial Review that the losses may go above A$4.5 billion by the end of the year. The Bureau of Meteorology in Victoria issued severe thunderstorm warnings for parts of the state on Sunday, saying damaging winds and heavy rainfall were expected. It said storms and widespread rainfall were forecast in the state for the next three days. This video can not be played BBC Weather's Susan Powell looks at the week ahead One forecaster from the bureau said the state was ""about to see its wettest two-day period in many, many months"", according to ABC News. At least 14 fires were still burning in Victoria as of Sunday. In NSW, where 69 fires were burning on Sunday, forecasters said widespread heavy rainfall in the north of the state would ease, as it withdrew flood warnings for the Bellinger and Orara rivers. This video can not be played Some, such as this thirsty koala, have been making the most of the wet conditions Officials in Queensland urged people to ""exercise caution"" on Gold Coast beaches, where ""large water movement and significant debris"" were expected after heavy rainfall on Saturday.

"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will not return as working members of the Royal Family, Buckingham Palace has said. The couple said last year that they would step back as ""senior"" royals, and work to become financially independent. In 2016, Kensington Palace released a statement confirming Harry had been dating US actress Meghan Markle ""for a few months"". They were pictured in public for the first time in Toronto, attending a wheelchair tennis match during the 2017 Invictus Games. They announced their engagement a few weeks after being first pictured together. Meghan told BBC News that Harry's proposal was ""just an amazing surprise, it was so sweet and natural and very romantic"". In February 2018, the couple took part in their first joint engagement with Prince Harry's brother and sister-in-law, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. As Meghan joined their Royal Foundation charity, Harry joked the foursome were now ""stuck together"". The couple were married at Windsor Castle, on 19 May 2018, with 1,200 public invitations to the grounds of the castle. They travelled through the town in a horse-drawn carriage. Up to 100,000 well-wishers lined the route as the duke and duchess travelled through Windsor. The couple exchanged vows and rings before the Queen and 600 guests at St George's Chapel. The couple kissed on the steps of St George's Chapel. The Queen, Duke of Edinburgh and other members of the Royal Family attended the wedding. The newlyweds held hands after the ceremony. In June 2018, the Queen and the duchess were seen at their first royal engagement together, as they officially opened the Mersey Gateway Bridge and Chester's Storyhouse Theatre. That autumn, Kensington Palace revealed the duchess was pregnant and the couple's baby was due in the spring. Shortly after the announcement, they embarked on their first official overseas tour, visiting Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga. On one of their engagements, the couple posed with OneWave, a surfing community group that raises awareness of mental health and wellbeing, at Bondi Beach, in Sydney, Australia On 6 May, 2019, Meghan gave birth to a boy, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, who became seventh in line to the throne. Harry told reporters: ""It's been the most amazing experience I could ever possibly imagine"". In June 2019, the couple announced they were splitting from the charity they shared with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, to set up their own foundation. Last autumn, Archie travelled with the couple to southern Africa on their first royal tour as a family, and was a big hit with Archbishop Desmond Tutu. An image of a beaming Prince Harry holding his son while on an extended stay in Canada was released by the couple as part of an Instagram compilation summing up their year. Following their trip, the couple were pictured in January on a visit to Canada House. In February, the couple announced that they are expecting their second child.

"The Duke of Sussex grew up in the media spotlight - from a young royal dealing with his mother's death, through his partying teenage years, to his career in the military. Since then Harry has followed in his mother's footsteps, doing charity work across the globe. He has got married and become a father. Now he and the Duchess of Sussex have begun a new chapter:giving up their royal duties, HRH titles and public fundingand living in California. Harry has tried to balance his public and private lives. At times, the publicity that comes with being sixth in line to the throne has helped him to bolster support for his charitable endeavours. But there have also been times when that attention has become too much, and he has fought fiercely for his family's privacy. Prince Harry was born in 1984, the second child of the Prince and Princess of Wales Born at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, on 15 September 1984, the prince was christened Henry Charles Albert David by the Archbishop of Canterbury in December of that year in St George's Chapel, Windsor. But it was officially announced from the start of his life that he would be known as Harry. Although christened Henry, he has always been known as Harry Harry with his mother and brother on a trip to Thorpe Park in 1993 The prince's childhood was cut short when his mother died in 1997. Princess Diana was killed in a crash in Paris, aged 36, as the car she was in sped through a tunnel followed by paparazzi photographers. Her death shook royal fans the world over, but it was 12-year-old Harry and 15-year-old William whose lives changed forever. The funeral, which featured the image of the boys walking behind their mother's hearse to attend the service at Westminster Abbey, remainsone of the most-watched programmes on the BBC. Prince Harry stood between his father, Prince Charles, and his older brother, Prince William, as they watched the hearse carry Diana's coffin ""I can safely say that losing my mum at the age of 12, and therefore shutting down all of my emotions for the last 20 years, has had a quite serious effect on not only my personal life but my work as well,"" the prince said in aninterview with the Daily Telegraph,externalin 2017. He added: ""I have probably been very close to a complete breakdown on numerous occasions when all sorts of grief and all sorts of lies and misconceptions and everything are coming to you from every angle."" The prince followed the educational path of his older brother William, at Wetherby School in Notting Hill, before entering Eton in 1998. Harry, five, on his first day at Wetherby School, Notting Hill Prince Harry watching his brother sign the Eton College entrance book in 1995 - he would follow in his footsteps, joining the school three years later After leaving Eton with two A-levels in 2003, Harry took a gap year. He worked on a sheep farm in Australia and with Aids orphans in Lesotho, paving the way for the charity he later set up there. Prince Charles took his sons on annual skiing holidays to Switzerland Attention from the press has been a constant in Harry's life. The front page of a 2002 edition of the (now defunct) News of the World roared: ""Harry's drugs shame"",  and claimed Prince Charles sent his son to visit a rehab clinic as punishment for smoking cannabis. St James's Palace confirmed the then 17-year-old had ""experimented with the drug on several occasions"" but said the use was not ""regular"". Then in October 2004, there was a scuffle with a photographer outside a club. A royal spokesman said at the time the 20-year-old prince was hit in the face by a camera ""when photographers crowded around him"". As part of his gap year, Prince Harry spent time at an orphanage in Lesotho, in southern Africa When Harry pushed the camera away, ""it's understood that a photographer's lip was cut"", the spokesman added. The following year, an image of the prince dressed as a Nazi at a fancy dress party sparked outrage. Clarence House later said the prince had apologised for any ""offence or embarrassment"" caused and had realised ""it was a poor choice of costume"". And in 2009, video footage emerged of Harry using offensive language to describe an Asian member of his Army platoon. St James's Palace said the prince was ""extremely sorry for any offence his words might cause"" but said he had ""used the term without any malice and as a nickname about a highly popular member of his platoon"". Harry enjoyed lighter-hearted press coverage during the London 2012 Olympic Games, in his role as an Olympic ambassador. The prince was an Olympic ambassador at the London 2012 Games In the same year he spent a lot of time in front of the cameras for the Queen's Jubilee. As part of those celebrations Harry completed his first royal solo tour overseas with visits to Belize, the Bahamas, Brazil and Jamaica. However, that August, photos emerged of the prince and a young woman naked in a Las Vegas hotel room. The two photos,published on US gossip website TMZ and later in the Sun newspaper, were taken on a private break with friends, with the site reporting the prince was in a group playing ""strip billiards"". He later said he had ""probably let myself down"" but added: ""I was in a private area and there should have been a certain amount of privacy that one should expect."" There is, however, a saving grace to the scrapes Harry has found himself in. As the younger brother to the expected future king, Harry has relatively little responsibility. Like the Queen's sister, Princess Margaret, and Prince Charles's younger siblings, Harry is a ""spare to the heir"" - and a world away from the throne. So Harry's indiscretions have done little to dent public opinion of him. And he has perhaps had a freer existence because of it; security worries would have made active service in Afghanistan impossible for his older brother, for example. Harry served a tour in Afghanistan as an Apache helicopter pilot Harry spent 10 years in the armed forces, becoming the first royal in more than 25 years to serve in a war zone. He was left disappointed in 2007 when Army chiefs decided not to send him to Iraq because of ""unacceptable risks"", but later spent 10 weeks serving in Afghanistan in 2008. Harry returned to the country as an Apache helicopter pilot from September 2012 to January 2013, before qualifying as an Apache commander in July 2013. He later describedhow he had shot at Taliban insurgents, and said that being in Afghanistan was ""as normal as it's going to get"" for him. The prince said quitting the Army had been a ""really tough decision"" When heannounced he would be leaving the Army in 2015, the prince said his time in the military would ""stay with me for the rest of my life"". This is reflected in his charity work, which mostly concentrates on mental health and helping service veterans. Harry's most notable charity work so far is his founding and chairing of the Invictus Games in 2014. The Paralympic-style international competition for injured ex-service personnel has been held in London, Orlando, Toronto and Sydney. The prince has been the driving force behind the Invictus Games He has also supported the charity Walking With the Wounded, for injured veterans. The prince's other charity work includes supporting conservation projects in Africa and jointly founding Sentebale, a charity to help orphans in Lesotho. On his visit to Angola in September, Harry said landmines are ""an unhealed scar of war"" Harry and his brother William have worked together on various charity initiatives He has continued his mother's work helping children affected by HIV and Aids, and supporting the Halo Trust's work in clearing landmines. Diana captured global attention when she walked through a live minefield in central Angola in 1997. She died in Paris later that year, before seeing the full impact of her visit - such as the signing of an international treaty to outlaw the weapons - but Harry highlighted her achievements whenhe retraced her stepsin September 2019. Prince Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge supported Heads Together runners at the London Marathon in 2017 In later years, Harry has had counselling to help him deal with his mother's death. He was best man at his brother William's wedding in April 2011, and has since spoken of how hard it was not to have Diana there. In acandid interview with the Daily Telegraph,external, he described shutting down all of his emotions for nearly 20 years and refusing to thinking about his mother. This, he said, had a ""quite serious effect"" on his personal life and his work, and brought him close to a breakdown ""on numerous occasions"". He also said he would probably regret""for the rest of his life"" how brief his last phone call with his mother was, and spoke of her ""fun"" parenting. She was a ""total kid through and through"", he said. Harry, William and the Duchess of Cambridge joined forces to focus their campaigning efforts on mental health. They founded Heads Together, which aims to tackle stigma and fundraise for new support services. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were first pictured together at the Invictus Games in 2017 As one of the world's most high-profile bachelors, Harry's love life has drawn much interest over the years. In late 2016, he confirmed a new relationship with US actor, Meghan Markle,while issuing a statement,externalaccusing journalists of harassing her. He described ""nightly legal battles to keep defamatory stories out of papers"", attempts by reporters and photographers to get into her home and the ""bombardment"" of nearly every friend and loved one in her life. The pair had met on a blind date, organised by a mutual friend. Then after just two dates, they went on holiday together to Botswana. Profile: Duchess of Sussex In September 2017, the year before their wedding, Meghan told Vanity Fair magazine she and Harry were ""two people who are really happy and in love,external"". Andin an interview that November, when their engagement was announced, Harry admitted he had never heard of Meghan before his friend introduced them, and was ""beautifully surprised"". He designed the engagement ring for Meghan, including two diamonds from his mother's jewellery collection. The couple married in May 2018at a ceremony at St George's Chapel in Windsor, and consequently became known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. On a 16-day tour of Australia that October, the duke and duchess announced they were expecting their first child, adding that they were happy to share the ""personal joy"" of their news. Baby Archie, described by Harry as ""our own little bundle of joy"", was born on 6 May 2019. Prince Harry said he was ""absolutely thrilled"" with the birth of his first child, Archie The duke's past few years have been a rollercoaster ride of highs and lows. In 2019, he and his wife split their household office from that of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the subsequent launch of the Sussexes' Instagram account amassed more than one million followers in record-breaking time (five hours and 45 minutes). The joy of becoming parents was followed days later by news Harry had accepted damages and an apology from a paparazzi agency that had used a helicopter to take photographs of his home in the Cotswolds. In June, the Sussexes announced they would split from the charity they shared with the Cambridges - fuelling speculation of a rift between brothers Harry and William. This video can not be played Prince Harry on his brother, William in 2019: ""We are certainly on different paths at the moment"" A 10-day tour of Africa at the end of September 2019 started well. Harry raised awareness for causes close to his heart, and the couple introduced Archie to anti-apartheid campaigner Archbishop Desmond Tutu. But during the tour, the Duchess of Sussex launched legal action against the Mail on Sunday over a claim that it unlawfully published one of her private letters. The duke and duchess went on a 10-day tour of Africa in September 2019 In a lengthy statement Harry said ""positive"" coverage of the tour of Africa had exposed the ""double standards"" of the ""press pack that has vilified [the duchess] almost daily for the past nine months"". And in an ITV documentary, filmed during the tour and broadcast the following month, the duchess admitted she was struggling to adjust to royal life, while the duke said his mental health was a matter of ""constant management"". Then, at the start of 2020, the couplemade a bombshell announcementthat they would be stepping back as senior royals. Later, Harry would tell host James Corden that the decision to step back was taken to protect himself and his family from the ""toxic"" situation created by the UK press. Their difficult relationship with the UK press saw both Harry and Meghan take legal action against publishers, as well ascutting ties with tabloid newspapers. After a brief stint in Canada, the couple now lives in California and are expecting their second child. The duke has since spoken out on several issues, includingon structural racism,human rightsandunconscious bias. The duke and duchess gave an interview with Oprah, who went to their wedding And the couple have signed deals to make shows and podcasts with Netflix and Spotify. His charity work continues - although he has returned his military appointments and royal patronages. Buckingham Palace said he and Meghan will keep their ""private patronages and associations"". He told interviewer Corden that his ""life is always going to be about public service"". But much of the rest of his future - including how he will continue to carve his own path - remains unclear.

"This video can not be played How did we get here? The US House of Representatives has impeached President Donald Trump, and the Republican leader now faces a trial in the Senate. Members of the upper house will decide whether to remove Mr Trump from office. As the Republican party hold a Senate majority, he will likely be acquitted. But House impeachment managers - in essence, the prosecutors - will try to convince senators that the president should be ousted from the White House, for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. It is the third time an impeachment trial has happened in the Senate. Trump impeachment trial: All you need to know A very simple guide to the Senate trial The case for and against impeaching Trump Here is our guide to the cast of characters, including the lawyers who will defend Mr Trump and those who will seek to have him removed from office. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell This is not the first impeachment for some of the key players in this political drama. Mr McConnell took part in impeachment and Senate trial of President Bill Clinton in 1999. Mitch McConnell (left) is setting out the rules of the trial with Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer Back then, he was the chair of the Senate Rules Committee, and a member of the ""Conservative Coalition"" - a bi-partisan group of senators representing southern states. Mr McConnell is currently setting out the rules of the trial with the minority leader, Democratic memberChuck Schumer- although as majority leader, Mr McConnell will have the final say. The Republican senator drew fire after he said there would be ""total co-ordination"" with the White House in the process. Senators are expected to act as impartial jurors in the process. Currently, he is battling with Democratic leaders overwhether or not witnesses and documents will be allowedin the trial. Chief Justice John Roberts Mr Roberts is the youngest chief justice of the US in more than 200 years, taking the position in 2005 at the age of 50. He made his older colleagues laugh recently whenhe referenced the phrase ""OK Boomer"" in a Supreme Court session. Mr Roberts will preside over the impeachment trial, making sure all sides stick to the rules. He swore in senators as jurors early in January. John Roberts is the youngest US chief justice in more than 200 years He is ideologically conservative, although he has worked with liberal judges on the Supreme Court before and has repeatedly stated his belief that the body should be non-political. Why US top court is more political than UK's Confidence in US judiciary 'diminishing' Mr Roberts rebuked Mr Trump two years agowhen the president criticised a jurist who did not back his immigration policies as an ""Obama judge"". ""We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges,"" Mr Robert said. ""What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them."" Congressman Adam Schiff, Democrat Mr Schiff is the leader of the seven House impeachment managers: he and Jerry Nadler, as well as House of Representatives membersJason Crow,Val Demings,Hakeem Jeffries,Zoe LofgrenandSylvia Garcia. Adam Schiff, right, will lead the team with the help of Jerry Nadler, left These Democrats will lay out the case against the president in a bid to have him removed from office. Who is Adam Schiff? Pelosi's 32 pens, and other impeachment oddities Mr Schiff represents California's 28th congressional district and is chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. As such, he has become the face of the impeachment proceedings, and a hate figure for Mr Trump and his supporters. The president has launched furious attacks against the Massachusetts-born 59-year-old. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Schiff said he was ""humbled"" by his appointment as lead prosecutor. Admirers see him as the man with extensive knowledge of the impeachment case, best suited to present it to the Senate. Congressman Jerry Nadler, Democrat Another key figure in the Democratic impeachment process is Mr Nadler, the head of the House Judiciary Committee. A New Yorker, the 72-year-old has served as a congressman since 1992, and has a reputation as a passionate defender of civil liberties with a very liberal voting record. This video can not be played Democrat Jerry Nadler announces the articles of impeachment Like Mr McConnell, he was also in politics during the last impeachment. The Congressional record showshe referred to President Clinton's impeachment as a ""partisan railroad job"",externalin 1998. White House counsel Pat Cipollone Mr Cipollone will lead Mr Trump's defence, alongside the president's personal lawyerJay Sekulow. Pat Cipollone has served as White House counsel since December 2018 Before now, his biggest role in the impeachment proceedings were letters he sent to Mr Nadler, declaring that the White House would not take part in the inquiry and describing the process as a ""charade"". White House dismisses impeachment hearings What Trump supporters think of impeachment Mr Trump named Mr Cipollone as White House counsel in December 2018. He also advised the president during Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Jay Sekulow, personal lawyer to the president The New York lawyer is the chief counsel at the American Center for Law & Justice, a conservative organisation. He is known to have deep ties to the evangelical community. Mr Sekulow is also in the Jay Sekulow Band, a rock group which features former Kansas member John Elefante He has argued in front of the US Supreme Court a number of times - including staunch defences of religious freedoms. For the president, Mr Sekulow served as a key figure in Mr Trump's legal team during the Mueller inquiry. Ken Starr Ken Starr, Pam Bondi and Alan Dershowitz have joined the president's defence team Mr Starr is best known for his work as the independent counsel for the Whitewater controversy, an investigation into real estate investments by Bill and Hillary Clinton. This eventually widened into an investigation into President Clinton's affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. The Starr Report, published in 1998, led to Mr Clinton's impeachment. He was succeeded as independent counsel in 2002 byRobert Ray- another member of Mr Trump's Senate trial defence team. This video can not be played Trump and Clinton's impeachment - what's different? A Republican originally from Texas, Mr Starr has argued 36 cases before the Supreme Court. Alan Dershowitz The retired Harvard University professor is an expert on US constitutional law. Mr Dershowitz has served on a number of famous cases. He defended OJ Simpson as a member of the so-called ""Dream Team"" during the American football star's murder trial, and has represented celebrities like Mike Tyson and Patty Hearst. Alan Dershowitz defended OJ Simpson in 1995 Speaking to CBS News, the lawyer said he was ""very, very concerned"" about the precedent this impeachment could establish, and said he agreed to serve Mr Trump ""as an independent constitutional scholar"". ""I take no position on the politics - just on the constitution."" Other members of the team includePam Bondi, former Florida Attorney General, and lawyersEric HershmannandJane Raskin. Senators are supposed to be impartial jurors during the impeachment trial. But the expectation is that this will be a highly partisan vote. The Senate needs a two-thirds majority to remove Mr Trump from power. Given that Republicans hold 53 seats in the upper house, it is likely the president will be acquitted. But Mr Trump has critics within his own party. Republican SenatorLisa Murkowski said she was ""disturbed"" by her party's stancein the wake of Mr McConnell's comments about ""total co-operation"", given the need for impartiality during the trial. Lisa Murkoswki, left, is a senator for Alaska while Mitt Romney is a senator for Utah US media suggest,externalthatformer presidential candidate Mitt Romney, as well asBen SasseandSusan Collins,are also important Republican senators to watch as the trial continues to see exactly how they react to the evidence. However, media outlets also say two Democratic senators -Doug JonesandJoe Manchin- could even be persuaded to side with the Republicans and vote no, under pressure from their constituents. While it is likely a foregone conclusion, these are the senators to watch.

"Saracens have won four of the last five Premiership titles Reigning champions Saracens will be relegated from rugby union's top flight at the end of this season following persistent salary cap breaches, Premiership Rugby has confirmed. Sarries had already been deducted 35 points for the current Premiership campaign and fined Â£5.4m for three seasons' spending above the cap. Proof of immediate cap compliance was required to avoid further sanctions. Saracens ""accept"" the relegation and ""apologise for the mistakes made"". In a statement, the club added: ""Our goal is to rebuild confidence and trust. We have accepted the unprecedented measure of automatic relegation from the Premiership at the end of the 2019-2020 season. ""The board must embody the values of the club, learn from its mistakes so the club can come back stronger. ""It is in the wider interests of the Premiership and English rugby to take this decisive step, to ensure everybody is able once again to focus on the game of rugby, which we all love."" Saracens will finish this season before entering the Championship for 2020-21. 'The most remarkable scandal in the domestic game' Saracens Q&A: Why are Saracens being relegated and what happens next? Stars can still play for England despite relegation ""Premiership Rugby is prepared to take strong action to enforce the regulations governing fair competition between our clubs,"" chief executive Darren Childs said. ""At the conclusion of dialogue with Saracens about their compliance with the Salary Cap Regulations, it has been decided that Saracens will be relegated at the end of this season. ""At the same time as enforcing the existing regulations, we want to ensure a level playing field for all clubs in the future, which is why we have asked Lord Myners to carry out an independently-led review of the salary cap."" In the past five years Saracens have dominated both domestically and in Europe, winning four Premiership titles and three European crowns. This decision also means that should the club successfully retain its European Champions Cup crown, they would not be permitted to defend the title next season. Their cup campaign continues on Sunday, when they welcome Pool Four leaders Racing 92 to Allianz Park, hoping to better Munster's result and qualify for the knockout phase. Neil Golding, whotook over from Nigel Wrayas Saracens chairman earlier this month, said: ""I acknowledge the club has made errors in the past and we unreservedly apologise for those mistakes. ""I and the rest of the board are committed to overseeing stringent new governance measures to ensure regulatory compliance going forward."" Premiership Rugby introduced the salary cap in 1999 to ensure the financial viability of all clubs and the competition. Exeter's frustrations were highlighted by back-to-back Twickenham defeats by Saracens Although Saracens' relegation is the punishment some clubs were seeking, there is still a sense of dissatisfaction with the outcome among their fiercest critics. Exeter Chiefs were beaten by Sarries two years in succession in the Premiership's showpiece final, and their chief executive Tony Rowe is still bitter about how long it has taken the game's authorities to take firm action. ""They've taken relegation,"" Rowe told BBC Radio Devon following the news. ""Let's be very honest about this before people have sympathy with Saracens. ""They had two choices: they could either open up their books so that Premiership Rugby could do a forensic audit of exactly what has gone on, or they could take relegation. So it was their choice not to open up their books. ""Premiership Rugby - all the chairmen - we just want to move on. It was their opportunity to open up everything to the salary cap people, or take relegation. They have decided to take relegation."" He added: ""We just want to move on. They have cheated. And I'm just a bit upset it has taken so long to do this. At the moment they are still picking their team each week largely from the squad they had last year which is still in breach of the salary cap. They have been asked by the rest of the Premiership clubs to reduce that (the squad) back as well. ""Everybody has had their suspicions for a long time. Five years ago they were hauled over the coals for similar offences. We just want a level playing field. Every club just wants the same opportunity and chances and let's hope we get back to that."" Asked whether Saracens should be allowed to keep their titles, he replied: ""I'm not sure about that. There is still some more to come out and I'm not privy to talk about that at the moment."" The move calls into question the futures of the club's international stars, such as England players Owen Farrell, Mako Vunipola and Maro Itoje, given the need to trim the wage bill and the fact the club will no longer be competing in elite competition, both domestically and continentally. While the Rugby Football Union have confirmed that players operating in the Championship will be eligible for England duty, financial constraints could make it difficult for the club to retain the services of their elite personnel. One issue the players themselves may find is that potential suitors among other clubs have already put much of their recruitment for next season in place and already spent a large extent of their cap. The other concern is that a move to France's Top 14, a regular destination for top-level southern hemisphere talent and rugby league converts from the Australasian National Rugby League, may be a potentially lucrative option. Such a move would guarantee elite-level competition but would also rule out international representative rugby as the RFU will only select home-based talent. Thus far, Scarlets-bound full-backLiam Williams is the only confirmed departurefrom the club, and the Wales international was due to end his contract at Saracens at the end of the season in any event. BBC Rugby Union correspondent Chris Jones This is an extraordinary story - the biggest in English club rugby history - as the Saracens dynasty dramatically crumbles. Who knows what would have happened if the club had taken a different approach back in November, when they met the initial punishment with indignation rather than contrition - a stance that infuriated their rivals. But with the club still breaching the cap in January, Saracens and Premiership Rugby have come to what appears to be a negotiated settlement, with the club accepting relegation. However, while there is finally confirmation of their fate, the questions still come thick and fast: namely, what on earth happens to this star-studded squad between now and next season?
