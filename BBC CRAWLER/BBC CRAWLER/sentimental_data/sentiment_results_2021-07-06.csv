"Bibaa Henry, 46, and Nicole Smallman, 27, were found by a search party of loved ones, two days after a gathering to celebrate the older sister's birthday A man who stabbed two sisters at random in a supposed demonic pact - a ""sacrifice"" he seemingly believed would enable him to win the lottery - has been found guilty of their murder. Danyal Hussein, 19, killed Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman at Fryent Country Park in Wembley on 6 June 2020. He repeatedly stabbed them after a birthday party for Ms Henry. Their bodies were found there by Ms Smallman's boyfriend the day after they had been reported missing to police. This video can not be played Mina Smallman: ""We hope that some good will come out of this horrible story"" The Old Bailey heard how the sisters had been with a small group of friends to celebrate Ms Henry's 46th birthday. When the others left they decided to stay as they were enjoying themselves. They lit fairy lights, listened to music and danced, the trial heard. After they failed to make it home, loved ones went back to the park to search for them and two days later found the women's sunglasses and a knife. Adam Stone, 27-year-old Ms Smallman's partner, then discovered the two bodies intertwined in the undergrowth while he was on the phone to the police. Bibaa and Nicole: The life after death of two sisters Danyal Hussein: A teenage murderer with far-right links In a victim impact statement read out in court, the sisters' mother Mina Smallman said: ""No-one expects their children to die before them but to have two of your three children murdered overnight is just incomprehensible. ""If any good comes out of this, at least another four women will not meet a similar end in a so-called pact with a so-called demon."" Danyal Hussein had a long-standing interest in mythology, Satanism, and the occult It can be reported for the first time that Hussein had previously been referred by his school to the government's counter-extremism programme, Prevent. In October 2017, aged 15, he was referred to the de-radicalisation scheme because of content he had accessed on school computers, including far-right material. Hussein had a long-standing interest in mythology, Satanism, and the occult. He was put on the ""Channel programme"" - for the most concerning Prevent cases - which discharged him in 2018, although he was seen again six and 12 months later. Channel involves a multi-agency panel responsible for assessing the risk posed by a referred person. The programme is then charged with developing a support plan for the individual concerned. The sisters had been with a small group of friends in Fryent Country Park and stayed on after others left During the trial, the jury heard Ms Henry had been stabbed eight times and Ms Smallman 28 times. Hussein also cut himself during the attack and it was DNA evidence found at the crime scene that connected him to the murders. Nearly a month after the deaths, a DNA familial link was made by police to Hussein's father, who had a past caution, and officers raided the defendant's home. In his bedroom, they found three lottery tickets folded inside a letter signed in blood. In it, Hussein promised to sacrifice six women every six months in exchange for winning the Mega Millions Super Jackpot. A document found signed in Hussein's blood, in which he promised to sacrifice women, was found in his bedroom Over the 10 days following the killings, he spent more than Â£160 on lottery tickets and bets, all without success. In another note found in his room, Hussein offered blood to ""demon Queen Byleth"" in exchange for making a girl at his school fall in love with him. The jury heard blood found in the park was a billion times more likely to have come from the teenage suspect than anyone else, while CCTV footage showed him buying a set of knives from Asda the day before the killings. The sisters' mobile phones were found dumped in a pond in the park Following his arrest he told police he had Asperger's syndrome and trouble with his memory, but then refused to answer any questions. Hussein did not give evidence during the trial but denied he was the person who carried out the killings. As well as being convicted of two counts of murder, he was found guilty of possessing an offensive weapon. The 19-year-old is due to be sentenced on 22 September. Mrs Justice Whipple ordered psychiatric reports to be carried out ahead of sentencing. She told the defendant he faced a long prison term. On the night of the attack, Ms Smallman and Ms Henry took multiple images of themselves dancing Det Ch Insp Simon Harding, the senior investigating officer, described the case as ""one of the most shocking and chilling"" he had dealt with. He said the two victims ""had lots of friends and lived life to the full"", while footage taken by them on the night they died showed ""their bond and shared pleasure in being in each other's company"". The senior officer also described Hussein as an ""arrogant"" and ""evil"" killer who had acted as a ""belligerent child"" in court. ""He has behaved like a teenage boy but he has committed some of the most savage crimes we have seen for many years,"" he said. A book of spells, handwritten demon symbols and the two blood pacts were found by police in Hussein's bedroom Two Met Police officers, PC Deniz Jaffer, 47, and PC Jamie Lewis, 32, have been charged with misconduct in public office for taking ""non-official and inappropriate photographs"" of the murder scene. The pair, who are both suspended from duty, are due to appear at the Old Bailey on 13 July to enter a plea formally. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) is carrying out a separate inquiry into how the Met handled calls from worried relatives and friends of Ms Smallman and Ms Henry before their bodies were discovered.

"Peter R de Vries is well known for his coverage of high profile crime cases A prominent Dutch journalist known for investigating the criminal underworld has been shot and seriously wounded on a street in central Amsterdam. Peter R de Vries, 64, was shot minutes after leaving a TV studio, where he had appeared on a chat show. Mr de Vries is famed for his work on exposing mobsters and drug lords, and has helped police solve a number of high-profile cases. Three men were arrested, but police say one is no longer a suspect. Hours after the attack, two men were arrested in a car on the A4 motorway at Leidschendam - a 35-year-old Polish national living in Maurik and a 21-year-old man living in Rotterdam. They will face court on Friday. An 18-year-old was arrested in Amsterdam, but will be released. The mayor of Amsterdam, Femke Halsema, described Mr de Vries as ""a national hero to us all"" and as ""a rare, courageous journalist who tirelessly sought justice"". The attack happened just after 19:30 (17:30 GMT), as the journalist was walking away from the studio on the Lange Leidsedwarsstraat. Five shots were fired at close range and Mr de Vries, 64, was hit in the head, local media report. Mr de Vries was previously given police protection after receiving threats for his involvement in criminal cases as an investigative journalist. In 2019 he tweeted that police had told him he was on the hit list of the Netherlands' most wanted criminal. Mayor Halsema said the journalist was fighting for his life, and condemned the shooting as a ""cruel, heartless attack"". Mr de Vries was shot minutes after leaving a TV studio in central Amsterdam Police are appealing for witnesses and CCTV footage of the shooting but are asking people not to share the material on social media. YouTube said it had removed hundreds of videos from its platform. The attack has shaken the Netherlands, with messages of support for Mr de Vries and the safety of all journalists coming from leading figures across the country. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte described the shooting as ""shocking and incomprehensible,"" adding it was an attack on a ""courageous journalist"" and on the freedom on the press. Justice Minister Ferd Grapperhaus paid tribute to an ""extraordinary journalist"", calling Mr de Vries an ""admirable warrior against injustice for the underdog"". King Willem-Alexander and Queen MÃ¡xima said they were ""deeply shocked"" and that ""journalists must be free to carry out their important work without threats."" There have also been strong reactions from outside the Netherlands. The President of the European Council, Charles Michel called the attack a crime against journalism. ""We will relentlessly continue to defend the freedom of the press,"" he wrote on Twitter. Peter R de Vries has covered numerous high-profile crimes, including the 1983 kidnapping of beer magnate Freddy Heineken. In 2013 Heineken's kidnapper, Willem Holleeder, was convicted of making threats against Mr de Vries. One of the Netherlands' most notorious gangsters,Holleeder was given a life sentence in 2019 for his involvement in five murders. A novel Mr de Vries wrote about the case was later adapted into the movie Kidnapping Freddy Heineken starring Anthony Hopkins. The journalist also won an Emmy Award for a television show he made about Natalee Holloway, a US teenager who disappeared on the Caribbean island of Aruba in 2005. Mr de Vries had been acting as an adviser to a former gang member, Nabil B, who was testifying in the case against Ridouan Taghi, who is currently on trial in the Netherlands for murder and drug trafficking. What journalist-haters get wrong Why journalists in India are under attack The journalist who vanished into a consulate The case has already sent shock waves through Netherlands after Nabil B's previous lawyer Derk Wiersum was assassinated in front of his Amsterdam home in September 2019. Peter R de Vries rose to prominence reporting on the types of crimes he appears to have fallen victim to. The attempt on his life has stunned Dutch society, particularly those in the professions where he has played such a critical role - journalism and criminal justice. Mayor Femke Halsema described Mr de Vries as a national hero, ""brave, looking for justice, free spirit, helping people in distress, parents of murdered children"". He was immersed in the job and his involvement in numerous high-profile cases resulted in repeated calls from the underworld for his ""liquidation"". The Dutch Bar Association has released a statement describing the ""brutal attack"" as having an enormous impact on the legal profession. Mr de Vries is a regular on Dutch chat shows.

"Ball and Lineker both had their pay reduced Gary Lineker remains the BBC's top earner despite agreeing to a pay cut of just under Â£400,000, the broadcaster has revealed in its annual report. Last year it was announcedthe Match of the Day host had agreed to his wages being reduced. Tuesday's report showed he earned Â£1.36m in the 2020/21 financial year, down from Â£1.75m. Radio 2's Zoe Ball, who also took a pay cut after offering to do so, is still the second-highest paid star on Â£1.13m. Last year she earned the same as Lineker's earnings in the latest financial year - Â£1.36m. Her current salary is actually Â£980,000, a reduction of 28% from 2019/2020 - the Â£1.13m figure takes into account her wages before she took the pay cut towards the end of last year. The wage bill for all on-air talent overall has been cut by 10% to Â£130m - down from Â£144m last year. Wages for broadcasters earning more than Â£150,000 have been reduced by Â£2.2m. The BBC's director general Tim Davie said most of the renegotiations about pay with top stars had been ""mutual and constructive"". Zoe Ball took over from Chris Evans as the host of the Radio 2 Breakfast Show in January 2019 ""Clearly, as a management team, we want to get more value and we're willing to make tough decisions to that extent,"" he said. ""But I think these conversations have all been constructive - as with Zoe Ball when she came forward and said she wanted to adjust her salary. I think everyone is absolutely with the programme on that one."" He added that ""we should maintain restraint in pay across the top talent"" and would ""continue to look for efficiency"" savings in the future. But Conservative MP Julian Knight, who is the chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee (DCMS), said: ""It's welcome that some of the BBC's top-earners have agreed to 'significant reductions' in their salaries this year. Yet despite taking a pay cut, Gary Lineker is still earning Â£1.36 million."" BBC pay: The 2020-2021 list of star salaries BBC annual report,external Five of the six top earners - including Steve Wright, Huw Edwards and Question Time anchor Fiona Bruce - now earn less than they did last year. Radio 5 Live presenter Stephen Nolan, in joint-fifth place, saw his salary increased by Â£15,000. Four women - Ball, Bruce, Radio 2's Vanessa Feltz and Lauren Laverne of 6 Music - make the top 10, the same number as last year. There are 31 women on the list and 40 men, a split of 44%/56%, despite the previous director general Tony Hall pledging that the gap would be closed by 2020. Again like last year, all of the top 10 earners are white. While 20% of all presenters earning over Â£150,000 are from ethnic minority backgrounds, up from 18% last year, the overall staff pay gap for minorities has widened slightly. Graham Norton, who left his Radio 2 show in December 2020, dropped out of the top 10 entirely. The star earned Â£150,000 in 2020/2021. Graham Norton had his own Radio 2 show until December, and is also the voice of the BBC's Eurovision coverage He also fronts the BBC's Eurovision coverage-although the event was cancelled last year due to the pandemic. Covid cancellations tell part of the story when it comes to savings - for example, Sue Barker and John McEnroe didn't cover Wimbledon after the event was pulled last year. Mr Davie said there had been ""quite a lot"" of ""little reductions"" because most major sporting, cultural and political events did not take place last year - but that most pay cuts were ""structural"". Since 2017, the BBC has been made to publish the names of those earning more than Â£150,000 each year, a move instigated by the government, and Lineker has topped the list on each occasion. However, many stars do not appear on the list because the corporation's commercial arm, BBC Studios, does not have to publish its talent spend. Norton's TV chat show, for instance, does not appear on the report for that reason. Claudia Winkelman also disappears from the list, as Strictly Come Dancing isn't counted either. She replaced Norton on Saturday mornings on Radio 2 in February, so that will be reflected in next year's list. The number of senior leaders at the BBC is down from 253 to 241, the report also says. This annual report covers an exceptional year. Despite the usual supply of controversy, from the Proms to Lord Dyson's report on the Princess Diana interview, there are deep trends within this pandemic year which show the BBC to be pursuing a clear strategy under its new leadership. First, reach: 6.1bn streams on iPlayer represents 28% growth, an extraordinary performance. Average time spent with the BBC each also grew. In the current global market, that is remarkable. Second, leanness: Tim Davie, director general since September, is a commercial creature, and wants efficiency. This has caused ructions and even distress within the BBC, with many staff leaving or having to re-apply for jobs. But it has also led to big reductions in overall public sector staff, and also the wage bill for on-air stars. Finally, education, the third pillar of the BBC's Reithian mission to ""inform, educate, and entertain"", has renewed its centrality to the corporation. Consumption of educational programming has soared, fortifying the connection between the BBC and young Britons. Will they pay for a licence fee? They might not, which means the pressure on the BBC's commercial arm, which has ambitious targets, will grow. But ahead of negotiations with the government next year, Davie and Richard Sharp, the chairman since February, can point to clear evidence of continued high demand for what the BBC does. Mr Knight called for the BBC to ""commit to full transparency on its talent bill and drop the smoke and mirrors approach"" following the publication of the report. ""There remains a concerning lack of transparency because a number of top-earning stars are paid through BBC Studios and their salaries don't appear here."" However, in an earlier press briefing, Mr Davie said it was ""absolutely appropriate"" that the broadcaster did not reveal BBC Studios pay and that he would ""defend robustly"" the current system. BBC chairman Richard Sharp pointed to the corporation's work during the Covid-19 pandemic, saying: ""During a profound trauma for the nation, almost overnight we reconfigured all the BBC's output around the most urgent needs of the country. The speed and the agility of the response was exceptional, and they continue to demonstrate very clearly the enduring importance of the BBC is core mission to inform, educate and entertain."" He warned about ""super inflation"" in production with competition from global giants, saying: ""The cost of some of our biggest series have more than doubled. ""Yet despite these pressures, the BBC has proved itself to be resilient and relevant and competitive."" Nine out of 10 adults use the BBC every week, and they spend an average of 18 hours and two minutes watching, listening or reading - up from 17 hours 45 minutes last year. However, those figures fall markedly for younger audiences. Overall, 80% of people aged between 16 and 34 used the BBC every week, falling to 77% for under-16s. Among the 16-34 age group, 51% watched BBC TV every week and 47% listened to BBC radio. The BBC's total workforce has reduced by over 1,200 - that's a 6% decrease. BBC Studios - the corporation's commercial arm - suffered a drop in sales of 10% and profits were down 17%, although those figures were due to production pauses and constraints during the pandemic.

"This video can not be played Health Secretary Sajid Javid outlines new rules for double-jabbed Fully vaccinated people in England will not have to self-isolate if a close contact tests positive for Covid from 16 August, the health secretary says. Sajid Javid told MPs the same policy would also apply to anyone under the age of 18 from that date. The government would give more details this week on self-isolation rules for international travel, he added. Meanwhile, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has announcedthe end of ""bubbles"" in schoolsfrom 19 July. This system has led to large numbers of pupils being sent home if a single child has a positive test. Covid-relatedpupil absence in England has hit a new highsince all students returned to school in March - with 640,000 pupils in England not in school due to Covid last week. On Monday, the prime minister confirmedhe intended to scrap most of the remaining restrictionsin England on 19 July, including the laws on mask wearing and rules on social distancing. A further 28,773 cases were reported across the UK on Tuesday, and there were another 37 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Some firms to insist people still wear face masks I'm fully vaccinated, but how can I prove it? Why it's time to think differently about Covid What next for the NHS Covid-19 contact tracing app? In a statement to the House of Commons, the health secretary said: ""From 16 August when even more people will have the protection of both doses, and when modelling suggests the risks from the virus will be even lower, anyone who is a close contact of a positive case will no longer have to self-isolate if they have been fully vaccinated. ""If someone gets their second dose just before or just after 16 August, they'll need to wait two weeks, after which their second jab can take effect and give them these new freedoms."" As under-18s are not routinely jabbed, he said a similar exemption from self-isolation rules would be extended to them. Mr Javid said adults who had been in close contact with a positive case would be ""advised"" to get a PCR test as soon as possible to make sure they had not been infected, while for children it would be dependent on their age. People identified as close contacts of a confirmed Covid case are currently required to self-isolate for up to 10 full days when contacted by NHS Test and Trace. He added that ""of course"" anyone that tested positive would have to self-isolate whether they have had the jab or not. The Department of Health and Social Care said the date for the changes was chosen to allow more people to become double jabbed and with rising case numbers ""it makes sense"" to keep protective measures in place until mid-August. It said if fully-vaccinated users of the NHS Covid-19 app are notified that a contact has tested positive after 16 August, they will be able to tell it they have had both jabs. Industry group UK Hospitality said Mr Javid's announcement ""doesn't go far enough, quickly enough"". Chief executive Kate Nicholls said it ""fails to recognise the carnage the current system"" is causing with pub and restaurant staff who ""have been told to isolate despite not having shared shifts with colleagues who tested positive"". The NHS Confederation, representing hospital leaders, said the move ""may act as an incentive for people to have both jabs, but we must also remember that no vaccine is 100% effective... it's still vital that people continue to get tested, and isolate if they have Covid"". The education secretary confirmed that the rules on pupils in England self-isolating would be ending Transport Secretary Grant Shapps will update MPs this week on international travel and removing ""the need for fully-vaccinated arrivals to isolate when they return from an amber list country"", Mr Javid said. Earlier, the health secretary told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he would expect cases numbers by 19 July to be ""at least double"" what they were now ""so around 50,000 new cases a day"". ""As we ease and go into the summer we expect them to rise significantly and they could go as high as 100,000 case numbers,"" he said. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Mr Javid had justified allowing infections to climb by pointing to the UK ""building a protective wall"" of vaccines. However, Mr Ashworth said the ""wall is only part built"", and data from Israel suggested that the infectious Delta variant could be transmitted through fully vaccinated people. He said he ""understood the rationale"" for Mr Javid's announcement but believed that the ""biggest barrier to an effective isolation policy"" was a ""lack of financial incentive to stay at home"". He also called for a U-turn on the decision to make mask-wearing voluntary, saying: ""Yes, let's have freedom but not a high-risk free-for-all - keep masks for now, fix sick pay, and let's unlock in a safe and sustainable way."" The Scottish government has said it maycontinue to require masksin certain settings even after 9 August, when it is hoped the final curbs will end. Ahead of a review on 15 July in Wales, ministers said peoplewould need to learn to livewith Covid. Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill saidthe prime minister's approach to ending coronavirus restrictions in England was reckless. She said Northern Ireland, which is due to review its rules on 8 July, would make its own decisions but would ""not be following that model"". Ireland's deputy prime minister Leo Varadkar called England's plan ""too risky"" and warned if things went wrong there would be a ""spillover effect"" into neighbouring countries. Asked about contingency planning for potential vaccine-resistant variants, Mr Javid told MPs: ""Reasonable experts will have different views on this... we are making some proportionate and balanced changes but border controls are staying in place. We are keeping the test, track and isolate policy in place."" The lifting of the remaining restrictions and now the ending of quarantining for the close contacts of people who are infected are bold moves. No other country in the world has tried this in the face of a rapidly increasing level of Covid infection driven by a more infectious variant. So, of course, it comes with risks. While the link between infections and serious illness has been weakened, it has not been broken altogether. If cases reach 100,000 a day, that could translate to close to 2,000 hospital admissions a day - twice what the NHS would see for all types of respiratory illness in the depths of winter. Soon afterwards, you would expect so see Covid deaths top 100 a day. And what if infection rates rise even further? Should we compare this to flu? In a bad winter those deaths can top 20,000. These are difficult questions to answer. The hope of government scientists is that the wall of immunity built up by the vaccination programme and natural infection will halt the rise in rates before we have to. Prof Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College - whose modelling helped lead to the first nationwide restrictions - said as restrictions eased there was the potential for the UK to have a very large numbers of cases - 150,000 to 200,000 a day - which could ""still cause some pressure to the health system"". However he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that although it was a ""slight gamble"" he thought it was ""justifiable"", adding ""I'm reasonably optimistic."" He said the vaccines would keep deaths far lower than in previous waves. ""The ratio which we saw in the past between case numbers and deaths has been reduced by more like eight to 10-fold."" In the worst-case scenario there ""may need to be a course correction later"", he added. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? Businesses have given mixed reactions to the plans to ease rules in England from 19 July. Melvin Benn, chief executive of Festival Republic, which runs the Reading and Leeds festivals, said the government had ""got this right"", adding that ""the country wants to reopen, we are tired of this, we want to reopen"". He also said he was not inclined to encourage festival guests to wear masks - even indoors. However, Jacinta Rowsell, manager of the Westfield shopping centre in London, said staff would still ""encourage guests"" to wear masks as they wanted people visiting to feel safe.

"Bibaa Henry, 46, and Nicole Smallman, 27, were found by a search party of loved ones, two days after a gathering to celebrate the older sister's birthday A man who stabbed two sisters at random in a supposed demonic pact - a ""sacrifice"" he seemingly believed would enable him to win the lottery - has been found guilty of their murder. Danyal Hussein, 19, killed Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman at Fryent Country Park in Wembley on 6 June 2020. He repeatedly stabbed them after a birthday party for Ms Henry. Their bodies were found there by Ms Smallman's boyfriend the day after they had been reported missing to police. This video can not be played Mina Smallman: ""We hope that some good will come out of this horrible story"" The Old Bailey heard how the sisters had been with a small group of friends to celebrate Ms Henry's 46th birthday. When the others left they decided to stay as they were enjoying themselves. They lit fairy lights, listened to music and danced, the trial heard. After they failed to make it home, loved ones went back to the park to search for them and two days later found the women's sunglasses and a knife. Adam Stone, 27-year-old Ms Smallman's partner, then discovered the two bodies intertwined in the undergrowth while he was on the phone to the police. Bibaa and Nicole: The life after death of two sisters Danyal Hussein: A teenage murderer with far-right links In a victim impact statement read out in court, the sisters' mother Mina Smallman said: ""No-one expects their children to die before them but to have two of your three children murdered overnight is just incomprehensible. ""If any good comes out of this, at least another four women will not meet a similar end in a so-called pact with a so-called demon."" Danyal Hussein had a long-standing interest in mythology, Satanism, and the occult It can be reported for the first time that Hussein had previously been referred by his school to the government's counter-extremism programme, Prevent. In October 2017, aged 15, he was referred to the de-radicalisation scheme because of content he had accessed on school computers, including far-right material. Hussein had a long-standing interest in mythology, Satanism, and the occult. He was put on the ""Channel programme"" - for the most concerning Prevent cases - which discharged him in 2018, although he was seen again six and 12 months later. Channel involves a multi-agency panel responsible for assessing the risk posed by a referred person. The programme is then charged with developing a support plan for the individual concerned. The sisters had been with a small group of friends in Fryent Country Park and stayed on after others left During the trial, the jury heard Ms Henry had been stabbed eight times and Ms Smallman 28 times. Hussein also cut himself during the attack and it was DNA evidence found at the crime scene that connected him to the murders. Nearly a month after the deaths, a DNA familial link was made by police to Hussein's father, who had a past caution, and officers raided the defendant's home. In his bedroom, they found three lottery tickets folded inside a letter signed in blood. In it, Hussein promised to sacrifice six women every six months in exchange for winning the Mega Millions Super Jackpot. A document found signed in Hussein's blood, in which he promised to sacrifice women, was found in his bedroom Over the 10 days following the killings, he spent more than Â£160 on lottery tickets and bets, all without success. In another note found in his room, Hussein offered blood to ""demon Queen Byleth"" in exchange for making a girl at his school fall in love with him. The jury heard blood found in the park was a billion times more likely to have come from the teenage suspect than anyone else, while CCTV footage showed him buying a set of knives from Asda the day before the killings. The sisters' mobile phones were found dumped in a pond in the park Following his arrest he told police he had Asperger's syndrome and trouble with his memory, but then refused to answer any questions. Hussein did not give evidence during the trial but denied he was the person who carried out the killings. As well as being convicted of two counts of murder, he was found guilty of possessing an offensive weapon. The 19-year-old is due to be sentenced on 22 September. Mrs Justice Whipple ordered psychiatric reports to be carried out ahead of sentencing. She told the defendant he faced a long prison term. On the night of the attack, Ms Smallman and Ms Henry took multiple images of themselves dancing Det Ch Insp Simon Harding, the senior investigating officer, described the case as ""one of the most shocking and chilling"" he had dealt with. He said the two victims ""had lots of friends and lived life to the full"", while footage taken by them on the night they died showed ""their bond and shared pleasure in being in each other's company"". The senior officer also described Hussein as an ""arrogant"" and ""evil"" killer who had acted as a ""belligerent child"" in court. ""He has behaved like a teenage boy but he has committed some of the most savage crimes we have seen for many years,"" he said. A book of spells, handwritten demon symbols and the two blood pacts were found by police in Hussein's bedroom Two Met Police officers, PC Deniz Jaffer, 47, and PC Jamie Lewis, 32, have been charged with misconduct in public office for taking ""non-official and inappropriate photographs"" of the murder scene. The pair, who are both suspended from duty, are due to appear at the Old Bailey on 13 July to enter a plea formally. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) is carrying out a separate inquiry into how the Met handled calls from worried relatives and friends of Ms Smallman and Ms Henry before their bodies were discovered.

"Dean Gray wrote the letter urging the first minister to intervene in his brother's case The mother of a boy who suffers life-threatening seizures says she is devastated at Nicola Sturgeon's response to her son's plea to make medicine available to his brother. Karen Gray's eight-year-old son Murray had hundreds of seizures a day before taking the cannabis-based drug Bedrolite, bought from the Netherlands. The drug costs Â£1,300 per month on private prescription. Murray's brother Dean, 13,wrote to Ms Sturgeonasking for help to pay for it. However, the first minister has now responded saying medication has to be proven to be safe before it will be available on the NHS. Boy's plea to FM for medical cannabis for his brother Scotland's first patients prescribed legal cannabis Mum scared of running out of cannabis oil for son Ms Gray, from Edinburgh, says the SNP leader's letter was disappointing and does not help Murray. Nicola Sturgeon replied to Dean's letter about his little brother She told BBC News: ""We are delighted and grateful that the first minister took the time to write to us - it did seem like a very personal letter. ""But it's infuriating because she is saying about safety and the NHS won't prescribe the medicine, but the NHS is prescribing the very same cannabis oil to two other children in the UK."" Murray suffers from a severe, complex epilepsy called Doose Syndrome. He had multiple seizures every day and his anti-epilepsy medication caused serious side-effects. Ms Gray said: ""Murray was basically dying in front of us in hospital and the NHS couldn't do anything. ""The only way to take the cannabis oil legally was to get a private neurologist. She writes the prescription because she knows it's safe for Murray. He hasn't had a seizure in two years and no side-effects."" Since legalisation in 2018, only three medical cannabis products have been licensed by the UK-wide Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). These are Sativex, which is used to treat severe spasticity in MS patients, Nabilone for chemotherapy-induced nausea, and Epidyolex for rare forms of childhood epilepsy. Only Epidyolex can be prescribed by the NHS in Scotland. Murray initially responded to Epidyolex but his mother said it eventually stopped working. She believes this is because it did not contain THC, the main psychoactive ingredient in cannabis. Ms Gray hoped the first minister would help the family get Bedrolite prescribed on the NHS or help to find funding for it. Murray Gray used to suffer hundreds of seizures a day - but now lives a normal life after taking medical cannabis But Ms Sturgeon replied: ""For doctors to make decisions about which medicines to prescribe for their patients, they need to know that the medicines they are prescribing are safe to use. ""In order to prescribe medicines like those Murray currently takes on the NHS in Scotland (which means they will be dispensed for free), we need stronger evidence on their safety and use than we currently have. ""Just now, specialist doctors in the NHS who treat children with epilepsy and similar medical conditions aren't confident about prescribing cannabis oils, including Bedrolite, until there is better evidence available following a clinical trial."" She said that the Scottish government had encouraged the manufacturer to take part in future clinical trials of these medicines. Murray in 2019 after taking Epidyolex - the only medical cannabis prescribed in Scotland Since taking Bedrolite, Murray's life has changed dramatically. His mother said: ""Before, we were constantly in hospital with him, he was in a wheelchair and he was wearing a protective helmet. ""Now, he is able to go to school full-time, he runs about. He is having no seizures and no side-effects, when he was having loads of side-effects with all the anti-epileptic drugs that he was given."" She added: ""It's just infuriating that there are children in the UK being prescribed the exact same cannabis oil that Murray takes through the NHS. It's just not fair at all."" Murray's private prescription costs the family Â£1,300 a month, which they rely on friends and family to raise. Ms Gray fears there will come a time when they cannot afford it. She said she planned to reply to the first minister to explain the situation further. Peter Carroll is director of the End Our Pain campaign which is lobbying MPs for financial help for families paying out thousands of pounds on private prescriptions. He said: ""It is touching the first minister replied to Dean's letter but frustrating that it didn't address the point. ""Families like Karen's have proved beyond doubt that the medication is life-transforming. If the issue is safety, then Karen has the best evidence it is safe. ""Our appeal is that now is the time to cut across the bureaucracy and give these families some money to pay for private prescriptions while they work on more widespread prescribing.""

"Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome is one of the most costly animal diseases in the world Pigs are to be genetically engineered to resist one of the world's most costly animal diseases. Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome costs about Â£1.8bn ($2.5bn) in lost revenue each year in the US and Europe. Researchers at Edinburgh University's Roslin Institute hope it will lead the way to the pigs being available to global pork-producing markets. The pig research, however, raises some animal welfare issues. Critics say creating disease-resistant animals will discourage farmers from improving the welfare of their livestock. Some believe the way the animals are kept can make them less prone to contracting the virus that causes the syndrome. The disease causes breathing problems and deaths in young animals and can result in pregnant sows losing their litters. Gene editing is GM, says European Court Gene-edited farm animals are on their way Twenty years on from Dolly the sheep Vaccines have mostly failed to stop the spread of the virus that causes the syndrome, which is endemic in most pig-producing countries worldwide. The Roslin Institute has produced pigs that can resist the disease by editing their genetic code. Prof Bruce Whitelaw, Roslin Institute interim director, said: ""Roslin is rightly recognised for pioneering animal biotechnology that enables genetic engineering of farmed animals.""

"Community Affairs policewomen at work New York has become the first US state to declare a disaster emergency order to address rising gun violence. New York state saw 51 shootings over the 4 July holiday weekend, Governor Andrew Cuomo said as he signed the executive order. The directive will funnel $138.7m (Â£100m) towards gun violence intervention and prevention programmes. It comes amid reports of a rise in gun deaths countrywide, including nearly 200 over the past weekend. In March, the FBI released preliminary 2020 statistics showing a significant jump - 25% - in murders from the year before. So far, the upward trend has continued into 2021. In the US, the majority of homicides are gun-related. US President Joe Biden unveiled a White House strategy to combat the rise in homicides in late June, which includes curtailing rogue gun dealers and firearms trafficking. It also delegates more funding for personnel - including law enforcement. Biden backs funding more police to fight crime wave Is the US seeing a surge in violent crime? America's gun culture in charts Governor Cuomo's state disaster declaration describes gun violence as a public health crisis, and made several comparisons to the Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting public health response. ""If you look at the recent numbers, more people are now dying from gun violence and crime than Covid,"" the Democratic governor said. ""Just like we did with Covid, New York is going to lead the nation once again with a comprehensive approach to combating and preventing gun violence."" Mr Cuomo's emergency declaration releases emergency funds that he will direct towards: Creating a gun violence prevention office, to be overseen by New York's department of health Requiring police departments to provide incident-level data on shootings Investing $57m in summer job programmes for at-risk youth Combating flow of out-of-state firearms As New York emerged as the epicentre of the US coronavirus outbreak last year, Mr Cuomo was widely hailed by US media for his handling of the pandemic. He has since faced accusations of a cover-up since it emerged his office undercounted Covid-19 deaths among its nursing home residents by thousands, after his administration issued a directive in March 2020 ordering those facilities to take in coronavirus patients. Scrutiny of the governor was compounded by multiple allegations of sexual misconduct, including those of current and former state employees - which he denies. A recent poll by Siena College found that just one-third of voters in the majority Democratic state want Mr Cuomo to run for re-election. Nearly a quarter of those polled said he should resign immediately.

"Ball and Lineker both had their pay reduced Gary Lineker remains the BBC's top earner despite agreeing to a pay cut of just under Â£400,000, the broadcaster has revealed in its annual report. Last year it was announcedthe Match of the Day host had agreed to his wages being reduced. Tuesday's report showed he earned Â£1.36m in the 2020/21 financial year, down from Â£1.75m. Radio 2's Zoe Ball, who also took a pay cut after offering to do so, is still the second-highest paid star on Â£1.13m. Last year she earned the same as Lineker's earnings in the latest financial year - Â£1.36m. Her current salary is actually Â£980,000, a reduction of 28% from 2019/2020 - the Â£1.13m figure takes into account her wages before she took the pay cut towards the end of last year. The wage bill for all on-air talent overall has been cut by 10% to Â£130m - down from Â£144m last year. Wages for broadcasters earning more than Â£150,000 have been reduced by Â£2.2m. The BBC's director general Tim Davie said most of the renegotiations about pay with top stars had been ""mutual and constructive"". Zoe Ball took over from Chris Evans as the host of the Radio 2 Breakfast Show in January 2019 ""Clearly, as a management team, we want to get more value and we're willing to make tough decisions to that extent,"" he said. ""But I think these conversations have all been constructive - as with Zoe Ball when she came forward and said she wanted to adjust her salary. I think everyone is absolutely with the programme on that one."" He added that ""we should maintain restraint in pay across the top talent"" and would ""continue to look for efficiency"" savings in the future. But Conservative MP Julian Knight, who is the chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee (DCMS), said: ""It's welcome that some of the BBC's top-earners have agreed to 'significant reductions' in their salaries this year. Yet despite taking a pay cut, Gary Lineker is still earning Â£1.36 million."" BBC pay: The 2020-2021 list of star salaries BBC annual report,external Five of the six top earners - including Steve Wright, Huw Edwards and Question Time anchor Fiona Bruce - now earn less than they did last year. Radio 5 Live presenter Stephen Nolan, in joint-fifth place, saw his salary increased by Â£15,000. Four women - Ball, Bruce, Radio 2's Vanessa Feltz and Lauren Laverne of 6 Music - make the top 10, the same number as last year. There are 31 women on the list and 40 men, a split of 44%/56%, despite the previous director general Tony Hall pledging that the gap would be closed by 2020. Again like last year, all of the top 10 earners are white. While 20% of all presenters earning over Â£150,000 are from ethnic minority backgrounds, up from 18% last year, the overall staff pay gap for minorities has widened slightly. Graham Norton, who left his Radio 2 show in December 2020, dropped out of the top 10 entirely. The star earned Â£150,000 in 2020/2021. Graham Norton had his own Radio 2 show until December, and is also the voice of the BBC's Eurovision coverage He also fronts the BBC's Eurovision coverage-although the event was cancelled last year due to the pandemic. Covid cancellations tell part of the story when it comes to savings - for example, Sue Barker and John McEnroe didn't cover Wimbledon after the event was pulled last year. Mr Davie said there had been ""quite a lot"" of ""little reductions"" because most major sporting, cultural and political events did not take place last year - but that most pay cuts were ""structural"". Since 2017, the BBC has been made to publish the names of those earning more than Â£150,000 each year, a move instigated by the government, and Lineker has topped the list on each occasion. However, many stars do not appear on the list because the corporation's commercial arm, BBC Studios, does not have to publish its talent spend. Norton's TV chat show, for instance, does not appear on the report for that reason. Claudia Winkelman also disappears from the list, as Strictly Come Dancing isn't counted either. She replaced Norton on Saturday mornings on Radio 2 in February, so that will be reflected in next year's list. The number of senior leaders at the BBC is down from 253 to 241, the report also says. This annual report covers an exceptional year. Despite the usual supply of controversy, from the Proms to Lord Dyson's report on the Princess Diana interview, there are deep trends within this pandemic year which show the BBC to be pursuing a clear strategy under its new leadership. First, reach: 6.1bn streams on iPlayer represents 28% growth, an extraordinary performance. Average time spent with the BBC each also grew. In the current global market, that is remarkable. Second, leanness: Tim Davie, director general since September, is a commercial creature, and wants efficiency. This has caused ructions and even distress within the BBC, with many staff leaving or having to re-apply for jobs. But it has also led to big reductions in overall public sector staff, and also the wage bill for on-air stars. Finally, education, the third pillar of the BBC's Reithian mission to ""inform, educate, and entertain"", has renewed its centrality to the corporation. Consumption of educational programming has soared, fortifying the connection between the BBC and young Britons. Will they pay for a licence fee? They might not, which means the pressure on the BBC's commercial arm, which has ambitious targets, will grow. But ahead of negotiations with the government next year, Davie and Richard Sharp, the chairman since February, can point to clear evidence of continued high demand for what the BBC does. Mr Knight called for the BBC to ""commit to full transparency on its talent bill and drop the smoke and mirrors approach"" following the publication of the report. ""There remains a concerning lack of transparency because a number of top-earning stars are paid through BBC Studios and their salaries don't appear here."" However, in an earlier press briefing, Mr Davie said it was ""absolutely appropriate"" that the broadcaster did not reveal BBC Studios pay and that he would ""defend robustly"" the current system. BBC chairman Richard Sharp pointed to the corporation's work during the Covid-19 pandemic, saying: ""During a profound trauma for the nation, almost overnight we reconfigured all the BBC's output around the most urgent needs of the country. The speed and the agility of the response was exceptional, and they continue to demonstrate very clearly the enduring importance of the BBC is core mission to inform, educate and entertain."" He warned about ""super inflation"" in production with competition from global giants, saying: ""The cost of some of our biggest series have more than doubled. ""Yet despite these pressures, the BBC has proved itself to be resilient and relevant and competitive."" Nine out of 10 adults use the BBC every week, and they spend an average of 18 hours and two minutes watching, listening or reading - up from 17 hours 45 minutes last year. However, those figures fall markedly for younger audiences. Overall, 80% of people aged between 16 and 34 used the BBC every week, falling to 77% for under-16s. Among the 16-34 age group, 51% watched BBC TV every week and 47% listened to BBC radio. The BBC's total workforce has reduced by over 1,200 - that's a 6% decrease. BBC Studios - the corporation's commercial arm - suffered a drop in sales of 10% and profits were down 17%, although those figures were due to production pauses and constraints during the pandemic.

"An Afghan army soldier surveys belongings left by the US military when it departed Bagram Airbase The US military left Bagram Airfield - its key base in Afghanistan - in the dead of night without notifying the Afghans, the base's new commander said. General Asadullah Kohistani told the BBC that the US left Bagram at 03:00 local time on Friday, and that the Afghan military found out hours later. Bagram also contains a prison, and there are reportedly up to 5,000 Taliban prisoners left in the facility. The Taliban have been advancing rapidly in Afghanistan as US troops withdraw. General Kohistani said on Monday that Afghan forces were expecting the Taliban to attack Bagram. Speaking to reporters at the airbase, he said he was already receiving reports the group was making ""movements in rural areas"" nearby. ""You know, if we compare ourselves with the Americans, it's a big difference,"" Gen Kohistani said. ""But according to our capabilities... we are trying to do the best and as much as possible secure and serve all the people."" An Afghan army soldier keeps watch at Bagram, the morning after US troops withdrew during the night The US announced on Friday that it had vacated Bagram, effectively completing its military campaign in Afghanistan ahead of the official end date of 11 September, announced by President Joe Biden earlier this year. The withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan is more than 90% completed, the Pentagon's Central Command said on Tuesday. The Americans left behind about 3.5 million items, Gen Kohistani said, including tens of thousands of bottles of water, energy drinks and military ready-made meals, known as MREs. They also left behind thousands of civilian vehicles, without keys, and hundreds of armoured vehicles, the Associated Press reported. They took heavy weapons with them and detonated some ammunition stocks, but left behind small weapons and ammunition for the Afghans, Gen Kohistani said. Asked by the Associated Press about the late-night withdrawal from the base, US military spokesman Colonel Sonny Leggett referred to a statement issued last week that said US forces had co-ordinated their departure from various bases with Afghan leaders. The US military left behind thousands of civilian vehicles and hundreds of armoured vehicles Within 20 minutes of the US's departure on Friday night the electricity was shut down and the base was plunged into darkness, the AP reported - a signal to looters who smashed through barriers and ransacked the abandoned buildings. Leftover items from the base have ended up in nearby scrap yards and second hand shops. At its height, Bagram base was home to tens of thousands of troops. It ballooned from a basic Afghan air base to a mini-city with swimming pools, cinemas, spas and imported fast food outlets Burger King and Pizza Hut. Echoes of 1989 as foreign forces leave Afghanistan The airfield was built by the Soviet Union in the 1950s, becoming its main base in the 1980s as it defended its occupation of Afghanistan. It was later occupied by the Moscow-backed Afghan government and then a mujahideen administration, before eventually winding up in Taliban hands when the group swept to power in the mid 1990s. When the US invaded in 2001, it deposed the Taliban and took control of the airbase, transforming it into a sprawling complex from which it fought its war against the group. A pair of military boots lie on the floor next to other abandoned equipment in a scrap yard near Bagram airbase The late-night withdrawal by the US hands control of the base to a much less well-equipped force that could struggle to defend it from the Taliban, which has made swift advances in recent weeks across the country, seizing rural districts and surrounding some larger cities. The group claims to have taken more than 10 new districts in the past 24 hours. Despite the movements on the ground, stalled peace talks were renewed last week between representatives of the Taliban and Afghan government in Doha, the capital of Qatar. This video can not be played Former Afghan president Hamid Karzai: Nato failed to defeat extremism Zabiullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, told the BBC that they would present a plan to the team negotiating on behalf of the Afghan government and both sides would discuss it. Gen Kohistani has roughly 3,000 troops under his command - significantly less than the tens of thousands of US and allied soldiers that once occupied Bagram airbase. About 1,000 Afghan soldiers fighting the Taliban in the north of the countryfled over the border into Tajikistan on Monday, according to officials, raising fears over the military's ability to stave off further advances by the group. On Tuesday, a diplomat said Germany had closed its consulate general in the city of Mazar-i-Sharif in northern Afghanistan. The last German troops left the country last week. From 9/11, to intense fighting on the ground, and now full withdrawal of US-led forces, hereâs what happened. 11 September 2001 Al-Qaeda, led by Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan, carries out the largest terror attack ever conducted on US soil. Four commercial airliners are hijacked. Two are flown into the World Trade Centre in New York, which collapses. One hits the Pentagon building in Washington, and one crashes into a field in Pennsylvania. Nearly 3,000 people are killed. 7 October 2001 A US-led coalition bombs Taliban and al-Qaeda facilities in Afghanistan. Targets include Kabul, Kandahar and Jalalabad. The Taliban, who took power after a decade-long Soviet occupation was followed by civil war, refuse to hand over Bin Laden. Their air defences and small fleet of fighter aircraft are destroyed. 13 November 2001 The Northern Alliance, a group of anti-Taliban rebels backed by coalition forces, enters Kabul as the Taliban flee the city. By the 13 November 2001, all Taliban have either fled or been neutralised. Other cities quickly fall. 26 January 2004 After protracted negotiations at a “loya jirga” or grand assembly, the new Afghan constitution is signed into law. The constitution paves the way for presidential elections in October 2004. 7 December 2004 Hamid Karzai, the leader of the Popalzai Durrani tribe, becomes the first president under the new constitution. He serves two five-year terms as president. May 2006 British troops arrive in Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold in the south of the country. Their initial mission is to support reconstruction projects, but they are quickly drawn into combat operations. More than 450 British troops lose their lives in Afghanistan over the course of the conflict. 17 February 2009 US President Barack Obama approves a major increase in the number of troops sent to Afghanistan. At their peak, they number about 140,000. The so-called “surge” is modelled on US strategy in Iraq where US forces focussed on protecting the civilian population as well as killing insurgent fighters. 2 May 2011 The leader of al-Qaeda is killed in an assault by US Navy Seals on a compound in Abbottabad in Pakistan. Bin Ladenâs body is removed and buried at sea. The operation ends a 10-year hunt led by the CIA. Â The confirmation that Bin Laden had been living on Pakistani soil fuels accusations in the US that Pakistan is an unreliable ally in the war on terror. 23 April 2013 The founder of the Taliban, Mullah Mohammed Omar, dies. His death is kept secret for more than two years. According to Afghan intelligence, Mullah Omar dies of health problems at a hospital in the Pakistani city of Karachi. Pakistan denies that he was in the country. 28 December 2014 At a ceremony in Kabul, Nato ends its combat operations in Afghanistan. With the surge now over, the US withdraws thousands of troops. Â Most of those who remain focus on training and supporting the Afghan security forces. 2015 The Taliban launch a series of suicide attacks, car bombings and other assaults. The parliament building in Kabul, and the city of Kunduz are attacked. Islamic State militants begin operations in Afghanistan. 25 January 2019 Afghan President Ashraf Ghani says more than 45,000 members of his countryâs security forces have been killed since he became leader in 2014. The figure is far higher than previously thought. 29 February 2020 The US and the Taliban sign an “agreement for bringing peace” to Afghanistan, in Doha, Qatar. The US and Nato allies agree to withdraw all troops within 14 months if the militants uphold the deal. 13 April 2021 US president Joe Biden announces that all US troops will leave Afghanistan by 11 September 2021. 16 August 2021 In just over a month, the Taliban sweep across Afghanistan, taking control of towns and cities all over the country, including Kabul. Afghan security forces collapse in the face of the Taliban advance. US troops must leave by deadline - Afghan Taliban âNato failed to defeat terrorism in Afghanistanâ Video, 00:02:53âNato failed to defeat terrorism in Afghanistanâ US army 'days away' from completing Afghan pull-out Biden says Afghans must decide their own future UN alarm at Taliban gains during US pullout Fierce winds threaten more fire destruction as LA struggles to contain blazes Powerful images of loss and heroism from LA Donald Trump spared prison or fine as judge sentences him in historic NY case What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"Bibaa Henry, 46, and Nicole Smallman, 27, were found by a search party of loved ones, two days after a gathering to celebrate the older sister's birthday A man who stabbed two sisters at random in a supposed demonic pact - a ""sacrifice"" he seemingly believed would enable him to win the lottery - has been found guilty of their murder. Danyal Hussein, 19, killed Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman at Fryent Country Park in Wembley on 6 June 2020. He repeatedly stabbed them after a birthday party for Ms Henry. Their bodies were found there by Ms Smallman's boyfriend the day after they had been reported missing to police. This video can not be played Mina Smallman: ""We hope that some good will come out of this horrible story"" The Old Bailey heard how the sisters had been with a small group of friends to celebrate Ms Henry's 46th birthday. When the others left they decided to stay as they were enjoying themselves. They lit fairy lights, listened to music and danced, the trial heard. After they failed to make it home, loved ones went back to the park to search for them and two days later found the women's sunglasses and a knife. Adam Stone, 27-year-old Ms Smallman's partner, then discovered the two bodies intertwined in the undergrowth while he was on the phone to the police. Bibaa and Nicole: The life after death of two sisters Danyal Hussein: A teenage murderer with far-right links In a victim impact statement read out in court, the sisters' mother Mina Smallman said: ""No-one expects their children to die before them but to have two of your three children murdered overnight is just incomprehensible. ""If any good comes out of this, at least another four women will not meet a similar end in a so-called pact with a so-called demon."" Danyal Hussein had a long-standing interest in mythology, Satanism, and the occult It can be reported for the first time that Hussein had previously been referred by his school to the government's counter-extremism programme, Prevent. In October 2017, aged 15, he was referred to the de-radicalisation scheme because of content he had accessed on school computers, including far-right material. Hussein had a long-standing interest in mythology, Satanism, and the occult. He was put on the ""Channel programme"" - for the most concerning Prevent cases - which discharged him in 2018, although he was seen again six and 12 months later. Channel involves a multi-agency panel responsible for assessing the risk posed by a referred person. The programme is then charged with developing a support plan for the individual concerned. The sisters had been with a small group of friends in Fryent Country Park and stayed on after others left During the trial, the jury heard Ms Henry had been stabbed eight times and Ms Smallman 28 times. Hussein also cut himself during the attack and it was DNA evidence found at the crime scene that connected him to the murders. Nearly a month after the deaths, a DNA familial link was made by police to Hussein's father, who had a past caution, and officers raided the defendant's home. In his bedroom, they found three lottery tickets folded inside a letter signed in blood. In it, Hussein promised to sacrifice six women every six months in exchange for winning the Mega Millions Super Jackpot. A document found signed in Hussein's blood, in which he promised to sacrifice women, was found in his bedroom Over the 10 days following the killings, he spent more than Â£160 on lottery tickets and bets, all without success. In another note found in his room, Hussein offered blood to ""demon Queen Byleth"" in exchange for making a girl at his school fall in love with him. The jury heard blood found in the park was a billion times more likely to have come from the teenage suspect than anyone else, while CCTV footage showed him buying a set of knives from Asda the day before the killings. The sisters' mobile phones were found dumped in a pond in the park Following his arrest he told police he had Asperger's syndrome and trouble with his memory, but then refused to answer any questions. Hussein did not give evidence during the trial but denied he was the person who carried out the killings. As well as being convicted of two counts of murder, he was found guilty of possessing an offensive weapon. The 19-year-old is due to be sentenced on 22 September. Mrs Justice Whipple ordered psychiatric reports to be carried out ahead of sentencing. She told the defendant he faced a long prison term. On the night of the attack, Ms Smallman and Ms Henry took multiple images of themselves dancing Det Ch Insp Simon Harding, the senior investigating officer, described the case as ""one of the most shocking and chilling"" he had dealt with. He said the two victims ""had lots of friends and lived life to the full"", while footage taken by them on the night they died showed ""their bond and shared pleasure in being in each other's company"". The senior officer also described Hussein as an ""arrogant"" and ""evil"" killer who had acted as a ""belligerent child"" in court. ""He has behaved like a teenage boy but he has committed some of the most savage crimes we have seen for many years,"" he said. A book of spells, handwritten demon symbols and the two blood pacts were found by police in Hussein's bedroom Two Met Police officers, PC Deniz Jaffer, 47, and PC Jamie Lewis, 32, have been charged with misconduct in public office for taking ""non-official and inappropriate photographs"" of the murder scene. The pair, who are both suspended from duty, are due to appear at the Old Bailey on 13 July to enter a plea formally. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) is carrying out a separate inquiry into how the Met handled calls from worried relatives and friends of Ms Smallman and Ms Henry before their bodies were discovered.

"Paul Green (left) and Cleveland Davidson said they felt vindicated after their convictions were quashed Three men jailed for allegedly attempting to rob a corrupt police officer nearly 50 years ago have had their convictions overturned. Courtney Harriot, Paul Green and Cleveland Davidson were arrested after leaving Stockwell station in 1972. The trio, part of the so-called ""Stockwell Six"", were jailed largely on evidence from British Transport Police (BTP) officer Derek Ridgewell. ""It's vindication... It was a total stitch-up"" Mr Davidson said. The men, all aged between 17 and 20 at the time, were accused of trying to rob Ridgewell, who was in plain clothes and had previously served in the South Rhodesian, now Zimbabwean, police force. They were travelling on the London Underground from Stockwell station in south London, when Ridgewell claimed they attempted to rob him, before he fought back and arrested them with a team of undercover officers. Although each of the six pleaded not guilty, five were convicted and sent to jail or borstal, a youth detention centre, despite telling jurors that police officers had lied and subjected them to violence and threats. The sixth member, Everet Mullins, was acquitted. The two remaining members of the Stockwell Six who were convicted, Texo Joseph Johnson and Ronald De'Souza, have not yet been traced. Speaking outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London, Mr Davidson revealed it had ""ruined"" his life. He said: ""It's vindication that we were innocent at the time. We were only young then, we did nothing."" Mr Davidson said Ridgewell was a ""corrupt and wicked and evil police officer"", adding: ""We don't know how many other people Ridgewell stitched up... it's just endless."" The Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), which referred the convictions to the Court of Appeal, said it was ""desperate to find other men who were part of this group of friends so many years ago"". Paul Green (left) and Cleveland Davidson had their convictions overturned at the Court of Appeal At a hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice in London on Tuesday, the Court of Appeal cleared Mr Harriot, Mr Green and Mr Davidson, nearly five decades after they were convicted. Quashing the convictions and allowing the appeal, Sir Julian Flaux, sitting with Mr Justice Linden and Mr Justice Wall, said: ""It is most unfortunate that it has taken nearly 50 years to rectify the injustice suffered by these appellants."" The Stockwell Six case is the third time Ridgewell's corruption has led to wrongful convictions being overturned by the Court of Appeal. Men 'framed by corrupt detective' to go to court Final conviction quashed in corrupt detective case Convictions quashed in corrupt detective case Ridgewell was involved in a number of high-profile and controversial cases in the early 1970s, culminating in the 1973 acquittals of the ""Tottenham Court Road Two"" - two young Jesuits studying at Oxford University. He was then moved into a department investigating mailbag theft, where he joined up with two criminals with whom he split the profits of stolen mailbags. Ridgewell was eventually caught and jailed for seven years, dying of a heart attack in prison in 1982 at the age of 37. In December 2019,three members of the ""Oval Four""- who were arrested at Oval Underground station in 1972 and accused of stealing handbags by Ridgewell's ""mugging squad"" - also had their convictions overturned. The final member was cleared in March 2020 prompting calls for a ""wholesale review"" of all cases linked to Ridgewell. BTP Deputy Chief Constable Adrian Hanstock said: ""It is wholly regrettable that the criminal actions of a discredited former officer of this force over four decades ago led to these unsound prosecutions. ""I apologise unreservedly for the distress, anxiety and impact this will have undoubtedly caused those who were wrongly convicted."" Mr Hanstock added that, having ""examined all available records"" of investigations where Ridgewell was the principal officer, the force ""have not identified any additional matters that we feel should be referred for external review"".

"Vauxhall owner Stellantis has announced plans to build electric vans at its Ellesmere Port plant in Cheshire. The Â£100m investment, which the UK government will contribute to, will safeguard more than 1,000 factory jobs. The future of the plant has been in doubt after Vauxhall's parent company scrapped plans to build its new Astra model there. The Ellesmere Port plant will also make electric passenger car models for Vauxhall, Opel, Peugeot and CitroÃ«n. Production of an all-electric van will start in 2022, the carmaker said. The government has held talks with Stellantis about options for the Cheshire factory and ministers are understood to have offered about Â£30m in financial support. Carlos Tavares, head of Stellantis, had previously warned that the company would no longer invest in pure diesel or petrol cars at the plant, and said a decision on where it would build electric vehicles would depend on the UK government's support of the car sector. Mr Tavares said: ""Performance is always the trigger for sustainability and this Â£100m investment demonstrates our commitment to the UK and to Ellesmere Port."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""It's a huge vote of confidence in our economy, in the people of Ellesmere Port, and in our fantastic post-Brexit trading relationships."" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said: ""Ellesmere Port's proud tradition in auto manufacturing will continue for many years to come thanks to today's investment."" He said that the investment will also ""secure thousands of jobs across the region in the supply chain"". ""In this global race to secure electric vehicle production, we are proud to support Britain's auto sector in this crucial transition as we work to build back better,"" Mr Kwarteng added. Mr Tavares said the fate of Ellesmere Port will depend on the UK government's commitment to the car industry Sales of vans have been booming during the pandemic,as a result of growing home delivery sales. Vauxhall's Luton plant is currently operating at full capacity so Stellantis wants to expand production at Ellesmere Port to serve the UK market. Like other manufacturers it is also preparing for an all-electric future. The UK will ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030, with other European countries setting similar targets. Last week, Japanese carmaker Nissan announced an expansion ofelectric vehicle production at its car plant in Sunderland which will create 1,650 new jobs. Hollie Hughes, 24, an engineer at the Ellesmere Port plant, who started as an apprentice nearly eight years ago, said the plans were ""so exciting"", especially the electric vehicle aspect. ""It's a massive highlight for Ellesmere Port,"" she said, adding that her team will be ""heavily involved"" in implementing the plans. Oliver Holden, 27, a manufacturing engineer at the plant, said the employees had waited a long time for the announcement. ""From today, everyone will be pleased - the mood will be lifted, I believe,"" he said. ""Everyone now can focus on the next challenges and move towards the future."" Professor David Bailey, an economist at Birmingham Business School, told the BBC's Today programme that Vauxhall's plans would support jobs in the short term, but there was a question over how sustainable they would make Ellesmere Port. ""There is there is no [Stellantis electric vehicle] battery plant being built in the UK... so if batteries are being brought in from France and elsewhere, that's going to add to costs and it's going leave Ellesmere Port as a relatively high-cost location,"" he said. ""[Building one in the UK] would really anchor vehicle production at Stellantis at Ellesmere Port and Luton in the UK. ""Longer term we're going to need a lot of batteries in the UK and we will need battery plants to keep mass car and vehicle production here."" Stellantis is currently building two battery plants, one in France and one in Germany, and is looking to establish a third, rumoured to be in Italy. The two ""gigafactories"" at Douvrin in France and Kaiserslautern in Germany will get French and German government support of â¬1.3bn (Â£1.1bn). The Ellesmere Port plant will have a new body shop and investment in general assembly and on site battery pack assembly. Work will begin on potential wind and solar farms at the site. Stellantis will also consult on the creation of a UK parts distribution centre which will require further investment. The outlook for the British automotive industry is certainly a lot rosier now than it was just a few months ago. Without investment in new products every few years, car plants die; and the ageing factory at Ellesmere Port has long been regarded as particularly vulnerable. Earlier this year Carlos Tavares, the acerbic chief executive of Vauxhall's parent company Stellantis, made it very clear that investment would only arrive if the government itself were prepared to support the industry. It appears the government has done just that, with both Nissan and Stellantis, pledging to spend serious amounts of money developing electric vehicles here as a result. But there's a long way to go to secure the future of car manufacturing, as it prepares for an all-electric future. After years of uncertainty over the outcome of Brexit, which made carmakers reluctant to commit to new plans, the UK is still playing catch-up. So while the news from Nissan and Vauxhall has been widely welcomed, people within the sector agree that much more is needed. Stellantis is the world's fifth-largest carmaker and also owns Peugeot, Fiat and Chrysler. Ellesmere Port, acquired by Vauxhall Motors in 1957 from the Royal Auxiliary Air Force, initially developed the site as a sub-assembly and engine production line for its Dunstable and Luton factories. It produced its first car, the Vauxhall Viva, in 1964, and produced the Viva, Chevette, and Vauxhall and Opel Astra. Employment peaked at the site in 1975, with 12,000 people on staff.

Reality Check Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth asked in Parliament about the numbers of people who could suffer from long term symptoms, generally known as long Covid, if cases rise as high as 100,000 cases a day - as the health secretary warned. âWith infections running at 100,000 a day that will translate into around 5,000 people a day developing long term chronic illness - long Covid,â he said. The difficulty with these figures is that there is not an agreed definition of what long Covid is. Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty said at the news conference on Monday that it was âseveral different syndromes, almost certainlyâ. Symptoms can range from fatigue and headaches to chest and muscle pain. Labour confirmed that Mr Ashworth was referring to research from October 2020 by Kingâs College London that found that one in 20 people with Covid were likely to suffer symptomsfor eight weeks or more,external. More recently, the React study at Imperial College London found that 37% of people who said they had had Covid reported having at least one symptom that lasted for 12 weeks or more,implying a total of more than two million people have suffered with it. The Office for National Statistics (ONS)has also been running a survey of people with ongoing symptoms,external. Its latest figures estimated that 962,000 people in the UK had experienced symptoms lasting for more than four weeks in the four weeks to 6 June 2021, which was down from 1.02 million the previous month. From 19 July, wearing a face mask will become a matter of ""personal choice"" says Prime Minister Boris Johnson. It seems, however, that companies intend to view these rules differently.

Professor Chris Whitty has urged the nation to ""push hell for leather"" to reduce coronavirus infection rates and roll out the vaccines to prevent a significant increase in long Covid. England's chief medical officer told the Local Government Association's annual conference: ""Since there's a lot of Covid at the moment and the rates are going up I regret to say I think we will get a significant amount more long Covid, particularly in the younger ages where the vaccination rates are currently much lower. ""Fundamentally the two ways to prevent long Covid in my view are to keep Covid rates right down and make sure everyone is vaccinated so they get very mild disease and I think we really just need to push hell for leather for those two. ""The deaths from Covid I think are mercifully going to be much lower in this wave compared to the previous ones as a proportion of cases but long Covid remains, I think, a worry. ""We don't know how big an issue it's going to be but I think we should assume it's not going to be trivial."" There have been a further 37 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK,according to the government's daily figures.,external That brings the total number of deaths in the 28 days following a positive Covid-19 test to 128,268.

Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst The China-Myanmar border gate has been closed In the past 48 hours, there has been a fresh outbreak of Covid-19
in the city of Ruili in southwestern China. Ruili, in Yunnan province, sits next to the border with Myanmar.
Three people tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday, and today a
further three symptomatic cases have been recorded, along with two asymptomatic
cases. The majority of those affected are Burmese nationals. Yesterday, a mass testing drive was launched in the city, which has a population of 210,000 people. The bridge that connects China
with Myanmar has been closed and the residential areas where
patients have tested positive have gone into lockdown. This is not the first time that Ruili has experienced an outbreak - the city has had four waves of the virus throughout the pandemic. The
most recent outbreak happened in March-April, affecting some 100 people. The national Global Times newspaper says that âthe long border and
the Delta virus strain that is widespread among South Asian countries may have
contributed to the epidemic resurgenceâ. Previous outbreaks
have largely been blamed on âillegalâ border crossings. However, since its last
major outbreak, Global Times notes that local officials and militias have been
mobilised to guard the villages at the border. BBC Radio 5 Live Cheryl Burns runs a bar in Netherton, Kirklees, and says despite the prime minister's announcement being a ""hallelujah"" moment for hospitality, she is still ""really anxious"" about opening on 19 July as case numbers are still high.

""People feel they now have the autonomy to do as they choose... it's nerve-racking,"" she says. ""We don't know whether the public will behave."" She says she is ready to get back to normal, adding: ""We need to learn to live with it, but it doesnât mean that I'm just going to open up my bar and go back to normal.

"This video can not be played Health Secretary Sajid Javid outlines new rules for double-jabbed Fully vaccinated people in England will not have to self-isolate if a close contact tests positive for Covid from 16 August, the health secretary says. Sajid Javid told MPs the same policy would also apply to anyone under the age of 18 from that date. The government would give more details this week on self-isolation rules for international travel, he added. Meanwhile, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has announcedthe end of ""bubbles"" in schoolsfrom 19 July. This system has led to large numbers of pupils being sent home if a single child has a positive test. Covid-relatedpupil absence in England has hit a new highsince all students returned to school in March - with 640,000 pupils in England not in school due to Covid last week. On Monday, the prime minister confirmedhe intended to scrap most of the remaining restrictionsin England on 19 July, including the laws on mask wearing and rules on social distancing. A further 28,773 cases were reported across the UK on Tuesday, and there were another 37 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Some firms to insist people still wear face masks I'm fully vaccinated, but how can I prove it? Why it's time to think differently about Covid What next for the NHS Covid-19 contact tracing app? In a statement to the House of Commons, the health secretary said: ""From 16 August when even more people will have the protection of both doses, and when modelling suggests the risks from the virus will be even lower, anyone who is a close contact of a positive case will no longer have to self-isolate if they have been fully vaccinated. ""If someone gets their second dose just before or just after 16 August, they'll need to wait two weeks, after which their second jab can take effect and give them these new freedoms."" As under-18s are not routinely jabbed, he said a similar exemption from self-isolation rules would be extended to them. Mr Javid said adults who had been in close contact with a positive case would be ""advised"" to get a PCR test as soon as possible to make sure they had not been infected, while for children it would be dependent on their age. People identified as close contacts of a confirmed Covid case are currently required to self-isolate for up to 10 full days when contacted by NHS Test and Trace. He added that ""of course"" anyone that tested positive would have to self-isolate whether they have had the jab or not. The Department of Health and Social Care said the date for the changes was chosen to allow more people to become double jabbed and with rising case numbers ""it makes sense"" to keep protective measures in place until mid-August. It said if fully-vaccinated users of the NHS Covid-19 app are notified that a contact has tested positive after 16 August, they will be able to tell it they have had both jabs. Industry group UK Hospitality said Mr Javid's announcement ""doesn't go far enough, quickly enough"". Chief executive Kate Nicholls said it ""fails to recognise the carnage the current system"" is causing with pub and restaurant staff who ""have been told to isolate despite not having shared shifts with colleagues who tested positive"". The NHS Confederation, representing hospital leaders, said the move ""may act as an incentive for people to have both jabs, but we must also remember that no vaccine is 100% effective... it's still vital that people continue to get tested, and isolate if they have Covid"". The education secretary confirmed that the rules on pupils in England self-isolating would be ending Transport Secretary Grant Shapps will update MPs this week on international travel and removing ""the need for fully-vaccinated arrivals to isolate when they return from an amber list country"", Mr Javid said. Earlier, the health secretary told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he would expect cases numbers by 19 July to be ""at least double"" what they were now ""so around 50,000 new cases a day"". ""As we ease and go into the summer we expect them to rise significantly and they could go as high as 100,000 case numbers,"" he said. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Mr Javid had justified allowing infections to climb by pointing to the UK ""building a protective wall"" of vaccines. However, Mr Ashworth said the ""wall is only part built"", and data from Israel suggested that the infectious Delta variant could be transmitted through fully vaccinated people. He said he ""understood the rationale"" for Mr Javid's announcement but believed that the ""biggest barrier to an effective isolation policy"" was a ""lack of financial incentive to stay at home"". He also called for a U-turn on the decision to make mask-wearing voluntary, saying: ""Yes, let's have freedom but not a high-risk free-for-all - keep masks for now, fix sick pay, and let's unlock in a safe and sustainable way."" The Scottish government has said it maycontinue to require masksin certain settings even after 9 August, when it is hoped the final curbs will end. Ahead of a review on 15 July in Wales, ministers said peoplewould need to learn to livewith Covid. Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill saidthe prime minister's approach to ending coronavirus restrictions in England was reckless. She said Northern Ireland, which is due to review its rules on 8 July, would make its own decisions but would ""not be following that model"". Ireland's deputy prime minister Leo Varadkar called England's plan ""too risky"" and warned if things went wrong there would be a ""spillover effect"" into neighbouring countries. Asked about contingency planning for potential vaccine-resistant variants, Mr Javid told MPs: ""Reasonable experts will have different views on this... we are making some proportionate and balanced changes but border controls are staying in place. We are keeping the test, track and isolate policy in place."" The lifting of the remaining restrictions and now the ending of quarantining for the close contacts of people who are infected are bold moves. No other country in the world has tried this in the face of a rapidly increasing level of Covid infection driven by a more infectious variant. So, of course, it comes with risks. While the link between infections and serious illness has been weakened, it has not been broken altogether. If cases reach 100,000 a day, that could translate to close to 2,000 hospital admissions a day - twice what the NHS would see for all types of respiratory illness in the depths of winter. Soon afterwards, you would expect so see Covid deaths top 100 a day. And what if infection rates rise even further? Should we compare this to flu? In a bad winter those deaths can top 20,000. These are difficult questions to answer. The hope of government scientists is that the wall of immunity built up by the vaccination programme and natural infection will halt the rise in rates before we have to. Prof Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College - whose modelling helped lead to the first nationwide restrictions - said as restrictions eased there was the potential for the UK to have a very large numbers of cases - 150,000 to 200,000 a day - which could ""still cause some pressure to the health system"". However he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that although it was a ""slight gamble"" he thought it was ""justifiable"", adding ""I'm reasonably optimistic."" He said the vaccines would keep deaths far lower than in previous waves. ""The ratio which we saw in the past between case numbers and deaths has been reduced by more like eight to 10-fold."" In the worst-case scenario there ""may need to be a course correction later"", he added. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? Businesses have given mixed reactions to the plans to ease rules in England from 19 July. Melvin Benn, chief executive of Festival Republic, which runs the Reading and Leeds festivals, said the government had ""got this right"", adding that ""the country wants to reopen, we are tired of this, we want to reopen"". He also said he was not inclined to encourage festival guests to wear masks - even indoors. However, Jacinta Rowsell, manager of the Westfield shopping centre in London, said staff would still ""encourage guests"" to wear masks as they wanted people visiting to feel safe.

A total of 79,302,857 jabs have been given, according to thegovernment's daily figures.,external That's 45,428,681 first doses and 33,874,176 second doses. The rules on self-isolation will soon change for those who have had both jabs -here's how to prove you've had yours. Professor Chris Whitty has urged the nation to ""push hell for leather"" to reduce coronavirus infection rates and roll out the vaccines to prevent a significant increase in long Covid. England's chief medical officer told the Local Government Association's annual conference: ""Since there's a lot of Covid at the moment and the rates are going up I regret to say I think we will get a significant amount more long Covid, particularly in the younger ages where the vaccination rates are currently much lower. ""Fundamentally the two ways to prevent long Covid in my view are to keep Covid rates right down and make sure everyone is vaccinated so they get very mild disease and I think we really just need to push hell for leather for those two. ""The deaths from Covid I think are mercifully going to be much lower in this wave compared to the previous ones as a proportion of cases but long Covid remains, I think, a worry. ""We don't know how big an issue it's going to be but I think we should assume it's not going to be trivial."" There have been a further 37 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK,according to the government's daily figures.,external That brings the total number of deaths in the 28 days following a positive Covid-19 test to 128,268. There have also been another 28,773 new infections recorded in the last 24 hours. The Bank of England is asking staff to come in to the office from September, starting with a minimum of once a week. Its cautious approach contrasts with other companies in the City of London and the wider country who are keener to return to pre-pandemic office hours. The government says people can return to the office after 19 July, if Covid restrictions in England are lifted as planned. Government guidance that people who can work from home should do so is set to end with other restrictions. Read more on this story.

Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst The China-Myanmar border gate has been closed In the past 48 hours, there has been a fresh outbreak of Covid-19
in the city of Ruili in southwestern China. Ruili, in Yunnan province, sits next to the border with Myanmar.
Three people tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday, and today a
further three symptomatic cases have been recorded, along with two asymptomatic
cases. The majority of those affected are Burmese nationals. Yesterday, a mass testing drive was launched in the city, which has a population of 210,000 people. The bridge that connects China
with Myanmar has been closed and the residential areas where
patients have tested positive have gone into lockdown. This is not the first time that Ruili has experienced an outbreak - the city has had four waves of the virus throughout the pandemic. The
most recent outbreak happened in March-April, affecting some 100 people. The national Global Times newspaper says that âthe long border and
the Delta virus strain that is widespread among South Asian countries may have
contributed to the epidemic resurgenceâ. Previous outbreaks
have largely been blamed on âillegalâ border crossings. However, since its last
major outbreak, Global Times notes that local officials and militias have been
mobilised to guard the villages at the border. BBC Radio 5 Live Cheryl Burns runs a bar in Netherton, Kirklees, and says despite the prime minister's announcement being a ""hallelujah"" moment for hospitality, she is still ""really anxious"" about opening on 19 July as case numbers are still high. Talking to Nicky Campbell on 5 Live Your Call, she describes her concerns around the responsibility being in the hands of the general public. ""People feel they now have the autonomy to do as they choose... it's nerve-racking,"" she says. ""We don't know whether the public will behave."" She says she is ready to get back to normal, adding: ""We need to learn to live with it, but it doesnât mean that I'm just going to open up my bar and go back to normal. ""We are risking our business and healthy people, and we want people to be safe."" Listen to 5 Live onBBC Sounds. Michelle O'Neill says Northern Ireland will not be following Boris Johnson's plan Boris Johnson's approach to ending Covid-19 restrictions in England is reckless and Northern Ireland won't be following it, NI's Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill has said. She says: ""I would be concerned for the people in England because of the route map set out by Boris Johnson. In my opinion, it's a reckless approach."" The PM says he expects face maskswill no longer be required and distancing rules scrappedfrom 19 July, following a review of health data on 12 July. O'Neill says the Northern Ireland Executive would take its own decisions, adding she hoped ministers could agree future steps at its meeting on Thursday. She says: ""We will probably be able to set out a direction of travel for what the next couple of months will look like, but certainly it will not be everything."" We've got more on this storyhere.

"Dean Gray wrote the letter urging the first minister to intervene in his brother's case The mother of a boy who suffers life-threatening seizures says she is devastated at Nicola Sturgeon's response to her son's plea to make medicine available to his brother. Karen Gray's eight-year-old son Murray had hundreds of seizures a day before taking the cannabis-based drug Bedrolite, bought from the Netherlands. The drug costs Â£1,300 per month on private prescription. Murray's brother Dean, 13,wrote to Ms Sturgeonasking for help to pay for it. However, the first minister has now responded saying medication has to be proven to be safe before it will be available on the NHS. Boy's plea to FM for medical cannabis for his brother Scotland's first patients prescribed legal cannabis Mum scared of running out of cannabis oil for son Ms Gray, from Edinburgh, says the SNP leader's letter was disappointing and does not help Murray. Nicola Sturgeon replied to Dean's letter about his little brother She told BBC News: ""We are delighted and grateful that the first minister took the time to write to us - it did seem like a very personal letter. ""But it's infuriating because she is saying about safety and the NHS won't prescribe the medicine, but the NHS is prescribing the very same cannabis oil to two other children in the UK."" Murray suffers from a severe, complex epilepsy called Doose Syndrome. He had multiple seizures every day and his anti-epilepsy medication caused serious side-effects. Ms Gray said: ""Murray was basically dying in front of us in hospital and the NHS couldn't do anything. ""The only way to take the cannabis oil legally was to get a private neurologist. She writes the prescription because she knows it's safe for Murray. He hasn't had a seizure in two years and no side-effects."" Since legalisation in 2018, only three medical cannabis products have been licensed by the UK-wide Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). These are Sativex, which is used to treat severe spasticity in MS patients, Nabilone for chemotherapy-induced nausea, and Epidyolex for rare forms of childhood epilepsy. Only Epidyolex can be prescribed by the NHS in Scotland. Murray initially responded to Epidyolex but his mother said it eventually stopped working. She believes this is because it did not contain THC, the main psychoactive ingredient in cannabis. Ms Gray hoped the first minister would help the family get Bedrolite prescribed on the NHS or help to find funding for it. Murray Gray used to suffer hundreds of seizures a day - but now lives a normal life after taking medical cannabis But Ms Sturgeon replied: ""For doctors to make decisions about which medicines to prescribe for their patients, they need to know that the medicines they are prescribing are safe to use. ""In order to prescribe medicines like those Murray currently takes on the NHS in Scotland (which means they will be dispensed for free), we need stronger evidence on their safety and use than we currently have. ""Just now, specialist doctors in the NHS who treat children with epilepsy and similar medical conditions aren't confident about prescribing cannabis oils, including Bedrolite, until there is better evidence available following a clinical trial."" She said that the Scottish government had encouraged the manufacturer to take part in future clinical trials of these medicines. Murray in 2019 after taking Epidyolex - the only medical cannabis prescribed in Scotland Since taking Bedrolite, Murray's life has changed dramatically. His mother said: ""Before, we were constantly in hospital with him, he was in a wheelchair and he was wearing a protective helmet. ""Now, he is able to go to school full-time, he runs about. He is having no seizures and no side-effects, when he was having loads of side-effects with all the anti-epileptic drugs that he was given."" She added: ""It's just infuriating that there are children in the UK being prescribed the exact same cannabis oil that Murray takes through the NHS. It's just not fair at all."" Murray's private prescription costs the family Â£1,300 a month, which they rely on friends and family to raise. Ms Gray fears there will come a time when they cannot afford it. She said she planned to reply to the first minister to explain the situation further. Peter Carroll is director of the End Our Pain campaign which is lobbying MPs for financial help for families paying out thousands of pounds on private prescriptions. He said: ""It is touching the first minister replied to Dean's letter but frustrating that it didn't address the point. ""Families like Karen's have proved beyond doubt that the medication is life-transforming. If the issue is safety, then Karen has the best evidence it is safe. ""Our appeal is that now is the time to cut across the bureaucracy and give these families some money to pay for private prescriptions while they work on more widespread prescribing.""

"Vauxhall owner Stellantis has announced plans to build electric vans at its Ellesmere Port plant in Cheshire. The Â£100m investment, which the UK government will contribute to, will safeguard more than 1,000 factory jobs. The future of the plant has been in doubt after Vauxhall's parent company scrapped plans to build its new Astra model there. The Ellesmere Port plant will also make electric passenger car models for Vauxhall, Opel, Peugeot and CitroÃ«n. Production of an all-electric van will start in 2022, the carmaker said. The government has held talks with Stellantis about options for the Cheshire factory and ministers are understood to have offered about Â£30m in financial support. Carlos Tavares, head of Stellantis, had previously warned that the company would no longer invest in pure diesel or petrol cars at the plant, and said a decision on where it would build electric vehicles would depend on the UK government's support of the car sector. Mr Tavares said: ""Performance is always the trigger for sustainability and this Â£100m investment demonstrates our commitment to the UK and to Ellesmere Port."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""It's a huge vote of confidence in our economy, in the people of Ellesmere Port, and in our fantastic post-Brexit trading relationships."" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said: ""Ellesmere Port's proud tradition in auto manufacturing will continue for many years to come thanks to today's investment."" He said that the investment will also ""secure thousands of jobs across the region in the supply chain"". ""In this global race to secure electric vehicle production, we are proud to support Britain's auto sector in this crucial transition as we work to build back better,"" Mr Kwarteng added. Mr Tavares said the fate of Ellesmere Port will depend on the UK government's commitment to the car industry Sales of vans have been booming during the pandemic,as a result of growing home delivery sales. Vauxhall's Luton plant is currently operating at full capacity so Stellantis wants to expand production at Ellesmere Port to serve the UK market. Like other manufacturers it is also preparing for an all-electric future. The UK will ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030, with other European countries setting similar targets. Last week, Japanese carmaker Nissan announced an expansion ofelectric vehicle production at its car plant in Sunderland which will create 1,650 new jobs. Hollie Hughes, 24, an engineer at the Ellesmere Port plant, who started as an apprentice nearly eight years ago, said the plans were ""so exciting"", especially the electric vehicle aspect. ""It's a massive highlight for Ellesmere Port,"" she said, adding that her team will be ""heavily involved"" in implementing the plans. Oliver Holden, 27, a manufacturing engineer at the plant, said the employees had waited a long time for the announcement. ""From today, everyone will be pleased - the mood will be lifted, I believe,"" he said. ""Everyone now can focus on the next challenges and move towards the future."" Professor David Bailey, an economist at Birmingham Business School, told the BBC's Today programme that Vauxhall's plans would support jobs in the short term, but there was a question over how sustainable they would make Ellesmere Port. ""There is there is no [Stellantis electric vehicle] battery plant being built in the UK... so if batteries are being brought in from France and elsewhere, that's going to add to costs and it's going leave Ellesmere Port as a relatively high-cost location,"" he said. ""[Building one in the UK] would really anchor vehicle production at Stellantis at Ellesmere Port and Luton in the UK. ""Longer term we're going to need a lot of batteries in the UK and we will need battery plants to keep mass car and vehicle production here."" Stellantis is currently building two battery plants, one in France and one in Germany, and is looking to establish a third, rumoured to be in Italy. The two ""gigafactories"" at Douvrin in France and Kaiserslautern in Germany will get French and German government support of â¬1.3bn (Â£1.1bn). The Ellesmere Port plant will have a new body shop and investment in general assembly and on site battery pack assembly. Work will begin on potential wind and solar farms at the site. Stellantis will also consult on the creation of a UK parts distribution centre which will require further investment. The outlook for the British automotive industry is certainly a lot rosier now than it was just a few months ago. Without investment in new products every few years, car plants die; and the ageing factory at Ellesmere Port has long been regarded as particularly vulnerable. Earlier this year Carlos Tavares, the acerbic chief executive of Vauxhall's parent company Stellantis, made it very clear that investment would only arrive if the government itself were prepared to support the industry. It appears the government has done just that, with both Nissan and Stellantis, pledging to spend serious amounts of money developing electric vehicles here as a result. But there's a long way to go to secure the future of car manufacturing, as it prepares for an all-electric future. After years of uncertainty over the outcome of Brexit, which made carmakers reluctant to commit to new plans, the UK is still playing catch-up. So while the news from Nissan and Vauxhall has been widely welcomed, people within the sector agree that much more is needed. Stellantis is the world's fifth-largest carmaker and also owns Peugeot, Fiat and Chrysler. Ellesmere Port, acquired by Vauxhall Motors in 1957 from the Royal Auxiliary Air Force, initially developed the site as a sub-assembly and engine production line for its Dunstable and Luton factories. It produced its first car, the Vauxhall Viva, in 1964, and produced the Viva, Chevette, and Vauxhall and Opel Astra. Employment peaked at the site in 1975, with 12,000 people on staff.

"An Afghan army soldier surveys belongings left by the US military when it departed Bagram Airbase The US military left Bagram Airfield - its key base in Afghanistan - in the dead of night without notifying the Afghans, the base's new commander said. General Asadullah Kohistani told the BBC that the US left Bagram at 03:00 local time on Friday, and that the Afghan military found out hours later. Bagram also contains a prison, and there are reportedly up to 5,000 Taliban prisoners left in the facility. The Taliban have been advancing rapidly in Afghanistan as US troops withdraw. General Kohistani said on Monday that Afghan forces were expecting the Taliban to attack Bagram. Speaking to reporters at the airbase, he said he was already receiving reports the group was making ""movements in rural areas"" nearby. ""You know, if we compare ourselves with the Americans, it's a big difference,"" Gen Kohistani said. ""But according to our capabilities... we are trying to do the best and as much as possible secure and serve all the people."" An Afghan army soldier keeps watch at Bagram, the morning after US troops withdrew during the night The US announced on Friday that it had vacated Bagram, effectively completing its military campaign in Afghanistan ahead of the official end date of 11 September, announced by President Joe Biden earlier this year. The withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan is more than 90% completed, the Pentagon's Central Command said on Tuesday. The Americans left behind about 3.5 million items, Gen Kohistani said, including tens of thousands of bottles of water, energy drinks and military ready-made meals, known as MREs. They also left behind thousands of civilian vehicles, without keys, and hundreds of armoured vehicles, the Associated Press reported. They took heavy weapons with them and detonated some ammunition stocks, but left behind small weapons and ammunition for the Afghans, Gen Kohistani said. Asked by the Associated Press about the late-night withdrawal from the base, US military spokesman Colonel Sonny Leggett referred to a statement issued last week that said US forces had co-ordinated their departure from various bases with Afghan leaders. The US military left behind thousands of civilian vehicles and hundreds of armoured vehicles Within 20 minutes of the US's departure on Friday night the electricity was shut down and the base was plunged into darkness, the AP reported - a signal to looters who smashed through barriers and ransacked the abandoned buildings. Leftover items from the base have ended up in nearby scrap yards and second hand shops. At its height, Bagram base was home to tens of thousands of troops. It ballooned from a basic Afghan air base to a mini-city with swimming pools, cinemas, spas and imported fast food outlets Burger King and Pizza Hut. Echoes of 1989 as foreign forces leave Afghanistan The airfield was built by the Soviet Union in the 1950s, becoming its main base in the 1980s as it defended its occupation of Afghanistan. It was later occupied by the Moscow-backed Afghan government and then a mujahideen administration, before eventually winding up in Taliban hands when the group swept to power in the mid 1990s. When the US invaded in 2001, it deposed the Taliban and took control of the airbase, transforming it into a sprawling complex from which it fought its war against the group. A pair of military boots lie on the floor next to other abandoned equipment in a scrap yard near Bagram airbase The late-night withdrawal by the US hands control of the base to a much less well-equipped force that could struggle to defend it from the Taliban, which has made swift advances in recent weeks across the country, seizing rural districts and surrounding some larger cities. The group claims to have taken more than 10 new districts in the past 24 hours. Despite the movements on the ground, stalled peace talks were renewed last week between representatives of the Taliban and Afghan government in Doha, the capital of Qatar. This video can not be played Former Afghan president Hamid Karzai: Nato failed to defeat extremism Zabiullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, told the BBC that they would present a plan to the team negotiating on behalf of the Afghan government and both sides would discuss it. Gen Kohistani has roughly 3,000 troops under his command - significantly less than the tens of thousands of US and allied soldiers that once occupied Bagram airbase. About 1,000 Afghan soldiers fighting the Taliban in the north of the countryfled over the border into Tajikistan on Monday, according to officials, raising fears over the military's ability to stave off further advances by the group. On Tuesday, a diplomat said Germany had closed its consulate general in the city of Mazar-i-Sharif in northern Afghanistan. The last German troops left the country last week. From 9/11, to intense fighting on the ground, and now full withdrawal of US-led forces, hereâs what happened. 11 September 2001 Al-Qaeda, led by Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan, carries out the largest terror attack ever conducted on US soil. Four commercial airliners are hijacked. Two are flown into the World Trade Centre in New York, which collapses. One hits the Pentagon building in Washington, and one crashes into a field in Pennsylvania. Nearly 3,000 people are killed. 7 October 2001 A US-led coalition bombs Taliban and al-Qaeda facilities in Afghanistan. Targets include Kabul, Kandahar and Jalalabad. The Taliban, who took power after a decade-long Soviet occupation was followed by civil war, refuse to hand over Bin Laden. Their air defences and small fleet of fighter aircraft are destroyed. 13 November 2001 The Northern Alliance, a group of anti-Taliban rebels backed by coalition forces, enters Kabul as the Taliban flee the city. By the 13 November 2001, all Taliban have either fled or been neutralised. Other cities quickly fall. 26 January 2004 After protracted negotiations at a “loya jirga” or grand assembly, the new Afghan constitution is signed into law. The constitution paves the way for presidential elections in October 2004. 7 December 2004 Hamid Karzai, the leader of the Popalzai Durrani tribe, becomes the first president under the new constitution. He serves two five-year terms as president. May 2006 British troops arrive in Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold in the south of the country. Their initial mission is to support reconstruction projects, but they are quickly drawn into combat operations. More than 450 British troops lose their lives in Afghanistan over the course of the conflict. 17 February 2009 US President Barack Obama approves a major increase in the number of troops sent to Afghanistan. At their peak, they number about 140,000. The so-called “surge” is modelled on US strategy in Iraq where US forces focussed on protecting the civilian population as well as killing insurgent fighters. 2 May 2011 The leader of al-Qaeda is killed in an assault by US Navy Seals on a compound in Abbottabad in Pakistan. Bin Ladenâs body is removed and buried at sea. The operation ends a 10-year hunt led by the CIA. Â The confirmation that Bin Laden had been living on Pakistani soil fuels accusations in the US that Pakistan is an unreliable ally in the war on terror. 23 April 2013 The founder of the Taliban, Mullah Mohammed Omar, dies. His death is kept secret for more than two years. According to Afghan intelligence, Mullah Omar dies of health problems at a hospital in the Pakistani city of Karachi. Pakistan denies that he was in the country. 28 December 2014 At a ceremony in Kabul, Nato ends its combat operations in Afghanistan. With the surge now over, the US withdraws thousands of troops. Â Most of those who remain focus on training and supporting the Afghan security forces. 2015 The Taliban launch a series of suicide attacks, car bombings and other assaults. The parliament building in Kabul, and the city of Kunduz are attacked. Islamic State militants begin operations in Afghanistan. 25 January 2019 Afghan President Ashraf Ghani says more than 45,000 members of his countryâs security forces have been killed since he became leader in 2014. The figure is far higher than previously thought. 29 February 2020 The US and the Taliban sign an “agreement for bringing peace” to Afghanistan, in Doha, Qatar. The US and Nato allies agree to withdraw all troops within 14 months if the militants uphold the deal. 13 April 2021 US president Joe Biden announces that all US troops will leave Afghanistan by 11 September 2021. 16 August 2021 In just over a month, the Taliban sweep across Afghanistan, taking control of towns and cities all over the country, including Kabul.

"The use of Covid bubbles in England's schools, colleges and early year settings will end on 19 July It is part of a whole range of relaxations in schools as the country moves towards lockdown easing From 16 August, under-18s in England will no longer need to self-isolate after being in close contact with a positive case Fully-vaccinated adults will also not have to self-isolate from then if they are a close contact of a case Those who test positive themselves will still have to self-isolate whether they are vaccinated or not, though The final lifting of England's restrictions is expected on 19 July, but it will be confirmed on 12 July after a review Health Secretary Sajid Javid said new coronavirus cases âcould go as high as 100,000â per day, after restrictions ease England's cricket authorities will name a new squad for their one-day series after three players and four staff test positive Germany is lifting a Covid-related travel ban on people from the UK and four other variant-hit countries Edited by Claire Heald There have been a flurry of announcements today - here are the main ones:  The live page writers today have been Tiffany Wertheimer, Emma Harrison, Jennifer Meierhans, Richard Morris and Ella Wills. It was edited by Claire Heald, Jenny Matthews and Lauren Turner. Thank you for joining us. Reality Check Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth asked in Parliament about the numbers of people who could suffer from long term symptoms, generally known as long Covid, if cases rise as high as 100,000 cases a day - as the health secretary warned. âWith infections running at 100,000 a day that will translate into around 5,000 people a day developing long term chronic illness - long Covid,â he said. The difficulty with these figures is that there is not an agreed definition of what long Covid is. Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty said at the news conference on Monday that it was âseveral different syndromes, almost certainlyâ. Symptoms can range from fatigue and headaches to chest and muscle pain. Labour confirmed that Mr Ashworth was referring to research from October 2020 by Kingâs College London that found that one in 20 people with Covid were likely to suffer symptomsfor eight weeks or more,external. More recently, the React study at Imperial College London found that 37% of people who said they had had Covid reported having at least one symptom that lasted for 12 weeks or more,implying a total of more than two million people have suffered with it. The Office for National Statistics (ONS)has also been running a survey of people with ongoing symptoms,external. Its latest figures estimated that 962,000 people in the UK had experienced symptoms lasting for more than four weeks in the four weeks to 6 June 2021, which was down from 1.02 million the previous month. From 19 July, wearing a face mask will become a matter of ""personal choice"" says Prime Minister Boris Johnson. It seems, however, that companies intend to view these rules differently. Some airlines have confirmed face masks will still be compulsory after 19 July, while shops, pubs and hairdressers are altering policies. The World Health Organization still advises masks continue to be mandatory on public transport, in shops and in crowded places. You can read more on plans from across companieshere. A loneliness network in Northern Ireland has installed ""chatty benches"" to combat loneliness and isolation during the pandemic. Childminder Janice Nelson meets her friend at a bright yellow bench in Carrickfergus, County Antrim most days. They say hello to strangers who walk by and often that turns into longer conversations. This video can not be played The bright seats bringing people together Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online Lots of people have been Googling to find out what this new(ish) variant of Covid is and what threat it might pose. Itâs yet another mutated version of the pandemic virus. Experts are certainly keeping an eye on it, but they are not worried enough just yet to move it onto the ""variant of concern"" list that Delta and Alpha belong to. Lambda, or C.37, was first identified in Peru in 2020. Itâs since been found elsewhere, including in the UK,which has recorded eight cases so far,external. Importantly, Lambda hasnât outcompeted other variants that are circulating, despite possessing some genetic changes that could potentially help ittransmit more easily than original Covid,external. New variants will keep emerging. Many will be of little or no consequence. But some could potentially threaten how well our vaccines work. Thatâs why it is so important to keep them in check. The Portuguese are being told to maintain hygiene and social distancing as the country battles a fourth wave of coronavirus. The more infectious Delta variant is now causing nearly 90% of new cases, the national health institute said. The infection rate jumped in mid-May when Portugal opened to visitors from the EU and Britain, and the cases are now back to the numbers seen in February, when the country was in lockdown. A night-time curfew was put in place last week
in 45 municipalities including Lisbon, Porto and Albufeira, and
restaurants and non-food shops must close earlier at the weekend
in some areas. Authorities in Spain's Catalonia region have also said restrictions will be imposed there to try to control a surge in cases. From this weekend, nightclubs will be closed and a negative Covid-19 test or proof of vaccination will be needed to take part in outdoor activities involving more than 500 people. ""We can't pretend to have defeated the virus,"" a spokeswoman for the regional government said. ""The pandemic has not ended, the new variants are very contagious and we still have significant segments of the population that are not vaccinated.""  Trade union Unite is seeking urgent meetings with London's mayor Sadiq Khan and Transport for London (TfL) over the rules on face masks. The union, which represents more than 20,000 London bus workers, wants passengers in the capital to continue to be required to wear face coverings even when England's coronavirus restrictions end, which is expected to be on 19 July. More than 50 bus workers in London have died after testing positive for coronavirus. Unite regional secretary for London Pete Kavanagh says bus workers are ""rightly worried for their safety following the government's reckless announcement"". On Monday, Khan said discussions were planned between TfL, the Department for Transport and other transport providers ""before we decide our next steps"". Read more:Unions warn workers at risk if face masks rules dropped. NHS Test and Trace are to take over notification of contact with a positive Covid case from nurseries, schools and colleges. The system of ""bubbles"" for school years will end, stopping the need for all children to isolate if there is a positive case. From mid-August, under 18s will only have to self-isolate if they themselves test positive for Covid-19. From 19 July, it'll no longer be required to wear masks in schools, and start times for different year groups will no longer be staggered. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, secondary school pupils must wear masks even in classrooms. In Wales, students must wear masks in areas where social distancing cannot be maintained. While the government has confirmed rules will be relaxed from 19 July, the current guidance remains the same. You must continue to follow the current guidance and rulesin order to stay safe while enjoying the football -including when England play Denmark in the Euro 2020semi-final tomorrow. Up tosix people from six households,external(or two households of any size) can meet in a pub in England, or 30 in a pub garden. Different groups must not mix. In England, guidance remains on using ""personal judgement"" on whether or not to hug friends and family. You can have friends over, but you must keep the room well ventilated and adhere to the six people from six households (or two households of any size) rule. There are special areas to watch matches outdoors in London, Manchester, Birmingham, Glasgow and other cities. What are the rules elsewhere? Captured in a timelapse video, festival crew expertly rolled out the enormous and iconic red carpet Organisers have rolled out the red carpet - literally - in preparation for the Cannes Film Festival's opening ceremony tonight. Film stars have started to arrive in the French Riviera town, and there are strict health measures and testing in place to keep the return of the iconic festival virus-free. The event was cancelled last year because of the pandemic, and its return is seen as symbolic of cinema's bounce back. The opening film is the musical Annette, starring Marion Cotillard and Adam Driver and directed by Leos Carax. Follow the latest on the Cannes Film Festivalhere. There are strict coronavirus measures in place, as France warns against a rise in the Delta variant In most places from 19 July,wearing a face mask will not be legally required. But England's chief medical officer Chris Whitty, and chief scientific advisor Sir Patrick Vallance have said they will continue to wear masks in crowded settings, if asked to, or as a common courtesy to those who are uncomfortable. The British Medical Association has said it makes no sense to stop wearing masks in enclosed spaces. Businesses can still refuse service if you will not wear a mask, if you do not have an exemption. And the legal requirement to wear masks will remain in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Nearly 80m vaccine doses have now been given in the UK. A total of 79,302,857 jabs have been given, according to thegovernment's daily figures.,external That's 45,428,681 first doses and 33,874,176 second doses. The rules on self-isolation will soon change for those who have had both jabs -here's how to prove you've had yours. Professor Chris Whitty has urged the nation to ""push hell for leather"" to reduce coronavirus infection rates and roll out the vaccines to prevent a significant increase in long Covid. England's chief medical officer told the Local Government Association's annual conference: ""Since there's a lot of Covid at the moment and the rates are going up I regret to say I think we will get a significant amount more long Covid, particularly in the younger ages where the vaccination rates are currently much lower. ""Fundamentally the two ways to prevent long Covid in my view are to keep Covid rates right down and make sure everyone is vaccinated so they get very mild disease and I think we really just need to push hell for leather for those two. ""The deaths from Covid I think are mercifully going to be much lower in this wave compared to the previous ones as a proportion of cases but long Covid remains, I think, a worry. ""We don't know how big an issue it's going to be but I think we should assume it's not going to be trivial."" There have been a further 37 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK,according to the government's daily figures.,external That brings the total number of deaths in the 28 days following a positive Covid-19 test to 128,268. There have also been another 28,773 new infections recorded in the last 24 hours. The Bank of England is asking staff to come in to the office from September, starting with a minimum of once a week. Its cautious approach contrasts with other companies in the City of London and the wider country who are keener to return to pre-pandemic office hours. The government says people can return to the office after 19 July, if Covid restrictions in England are lifted as planned. Government guidance that people who can work from home should do so is set to end with other restrictions. Read more on this story. Food chain Pret says it is now selling its Christmas sandwich - five months early, or seven months late, depending how you look at it - after it was closed over some of the festive period in 2020 because of the pandemic. Pret says the sandwich will be available to buy for one month. Just days before Christmas 2020, new restrictions to combat growing number of Covid cases were brought in in England and Wales. Measures included being told to stay at home, while non-essential shops and businesses had to close. We've had a quite a few coronavirus rule changes outlined to us today so here's a recap of what they mean: Schools  Self-isolation  For more details see our explainers onschool rulesandself-isolation. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst The China-Myanmar border gate has been closed In the past 48 hours, there has been a fresh outbreak of Covid-19
in the city of Ruili in southwestern China. Ruili, in Yunnan province, sits next to the border with Myanmar.
Three people tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday, and today a
further three symptomatic cases have been recorded, along with two asymptomatic
cases. The majority of those affected are Burmese nationals. Yesterday, a mass testing drive was launched in the city, which has a population of 210,000 people. The bridge that connects China
with Myanmar has been closed and the residential areas where
patients have tested positive have gone into lockdown. This is not the first time that Ruili has experienced an outbreak - the city has had four waves of the virus throughout the pandemic. The
most recent outbreak happened in March-April, affecting some 100 people. The national Global Times newspaper says that âthe long border and
the Delta virus strain that is widespread among South Asian countries may have
contributed to the epidemic resurgenceâ. Previous outbreaks
have largely been blamed on âillegalâ border crossings. However, since its last
major outbreak, Global Times notes that local officials and militias have been
mobilised to guard the villages at the border. BBC Radio 5 Live Cheryl Burns runs a bar in Netherton, Kirklees, and says despite the prime minister's announcement being a ""hallelujah"" moment for hospitality, she is still ""really anxious"" about opening on 19 July as case numbers are still high. Talking to Nicky Campbell on 5 Live Your Call, she describes her concerns around the responsibility being in the hands of the general public. ""People feel they now have the autonomy to do as they choose... it's nerve-racking,"" she says. ""We don't know whether the public will behave."" She says she is ready to get back to normal, adding: ""We need to learn to live with it, but it doesnât mean that I'm just going to open up my bar and go back to normal. ""We are risking our business and healthy people, and we want people to be safe."" Listen to 5 Live onBBC Sounds. Michelle O'Neill says Northern Ireland will not be following Boris Johnson's plan Boris Johnson's approach to ending Covid-19 restrictions in England is reckless and Northern Ireland won't be following it, NI's Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill has said. She says: ""I would be concerned for the people in England because of the route map set out by Boris Johnson. In my opinion, it's a reckless approach."" The PM says he expects face maskswill no longer be required and distancing rules scrappedfrom 19 July, following a review of health data on 12 July. O'Neill says the Northern Ireland Executive would take its own decisions, adding she hoped ministers could agree future steps at its meeting on Thursday. She says: ""We will probably be able to set out a direction of travel for what the next couple of months will look like, but certainly it will not be everything."" We've got more on this storyhere.

"Bibaa Henry, 46, and Nicole Smallman, 27, were found by a search party of loved ones, two days after a gathering to celebrate the older sister's birthday A man who stabbed two sisters at random in a supposed demonic pact - a ""sacrifice"" he seemingly believed would enable him to win the lottery - has been found guilty of their murder. Danyal Hussein, 19, killed Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman at Fryent Country Park in Wembley on 6 June 2020. He repeatedly stabbed them after a birthday party for Ms Henry. Their bodies were found there by Ms Smallman's boyfriend the day after they had been reported missing to police. This video can not be played Mina Smallman: ""We hope that some good will come out of this horrible story"" The Old Bailey heard how the sisters had been with a small group of friends to celebrate Ms Henry's 46th birthday. When the others left they decided to stay as they were enjoying themselves. They lit fairy lights, listened to music and danced, the trial heard. After they failed to make it home, loved ones went back to the park to search for them and two days later found the women's sunglasses and a knife. Adam Stone, 27-year-old Ms Smallman's partner, then discovered the two bodies intertwined in the undergrowth while he was on the phone to the police. Bibaa and Nicole: The life after death of two sisters Danyal Hussein: A teenage murderer with far-right links In a victim impact statement read out in court, the sisters' mother Mina Smallman said: ""No-one expects their children to die before them but to have two of your three children murdered overnight is just incomprehensible. ""If any good comes out of this, at least another four women will not meet a similar end in a so-called pact with a so-called demon."" Danyal Hussein had a long-standing interest in mythology, Satanism, and the occult It can be reported for the first time that Hussein had previously been referred by his school to the government's counter-extremism programme, Prevent. In October 2017, aged 15, he was referred to the de-radicalisation scheme because of content he had accessed on school computers, including far-right material. Hussein had a long-standing interest in mythology, Satanism, and the occult. He was put on the ""Channel programme"" - for the most concerning Prevent cases - which discharged him in 2018, although he was seen again six and 12 months later. Channel involves a multi-agency panel responsible for assessing the risk posed by a referred person. The programme is then charged with developing a support plan for the individual concerned. The sisters had been with a small group of friends in Fryent Country Park and stayed on after others left During the trial, the jury heard Ms Henry had been stabbed eight times and Ms Smallman 28 times. Hussein also cut himself during the attack and it was DNA evidence found at the crime scene that connected him to the murders. Nearly a month after the deaths, a DNA familial link was made by police to Hussein's father, who had a past caution, and officers raided the defendant's home. In his bedroom, they found three lottery tickets folded inside a letter signed in blood. In it, Hussein promised to sacrifice six women every six months in exchange for winning the Mega Millions Super Jackpot. A document found signed in Hussein's blood, in which he promised to sacrifice women, was found in his bedroom Over the 10 days following the killings, he spent more than Â£160 on lottery tickets and bets, all without success. In another note found in his room, Hussein offered blood to ""demon Queen Byleth"" in exchange for making a girl at his school fall in love with him. The jury heard blood found in the park was a billion times more likely to have come from the teenage suspect than anyone else, while CCTV footage showed him buying a set of knives from Asda the day before the killings. The sisters' mobile phones were found dumped in a pond in the park Following his arrest he told police he had Asperger's syndrome and trouble with his memory, but then refused to answer any questions. Hussein did not give evidence during the trial but denied he was the person who carried out the killings. As well as being convicted of two counts of murder, he was found guilty of possessing an offensive weapon. The 19-year-old is due to be sentenced on 22 September. Mrs Justice Whipple ordered psychiatric reports to be carried out ahead of sentencing. She told the defendant he faced a long prison term. On the night of the attack, Ms Smallman and Ms Henry took multiple images of themselves dancing Det Ch Insp Simon Harding, the senior investigating officer, described the case as ""one of the most shocking and chilling"" he had dealt with. He said the two victims ""had lots of friends and lived life to the full"", while footage taken by them on the night they died showed ""their bond and shared pleasure in being in each other's company"". The senior officer also described Hussein as an ""arrogant"" and ""evil"" killer who had acted as a ""belligerent child"" in court. ""He has behaved like a teenage boy but he has committed some of the most savage crimes we have seen for many years,"" he said. A book of spells, handwritten demon symbols and the two blood pacts were found by police in Hussein's bedroom Two Met Police officers, PC Deniz Jaffer, 47, and PC Jamie Lewis, 32, have been charged with misconduct in public office for taking ""non-official and inappropriate photographs"" of the murder scene. The pair, who are both suspended from duty, are due to appear at the Old Bailey on 13 July to enter a plea formally. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) is carrying out a separate inquiry into how the Met handled calls from worried relatives and friends of Ms Smallman and Ms Henry before their bodies were discovered.

"England's schools will find out later how the government plans to relax rules that have led to large numbers of pupils being sent home if a single child has a positive Covid test. Last week the ""bubble"" system saw more than 375,000 children sent home. It has meant missed days of lessons for thousands of pupils and frustration for parents juggling work and childcare. The announcement will come amid a backlash to government plans to ditch rules on the wearing of face masks. Labour, trade unions and some scientists have said now is not the time to change the rules on masks as case numbers continue to rise rapidly, driven by the new, more infectious Delta variant. Meanwhile, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said he would make an announcement to MPs later on self-isolation changes for those who have had been fully vaccinated. He told BBC Breakfast: ""We will have a more proportionate system of test, trace and isolate and it is absolutely right that those that have been double jabbed, that we can take a different approach than the one we can take today."" He said the UK was now entering ""uncharted territory"" as it moved to lift legal restrictions aimed at controlling the spread of coronavirus but he said the decision had to be made because of the ""other health problems"" millions of people were facing. At a Downing Street press conference on Monday, Boris Johnson confirmed he intended to scrap the laws on mask wearing and social distancing in the final stage of England's Covid lockdown roadmap on 19 July. The date will be confirmed on 12 July after a review of the latest data. Most Covid rules set to end in England, says PM Workers can return to office in two weeks' time, says PM Crowds to return to sport from 19 July When can we stop wearing face coverings? Other changes announced on Monday include the planned reopening of nightclubs for the first time since the pandemic began, an end to all legal limits on the number of people who can attend events and the scrapping of guidance to work from home. On schools, Mr Johnson said Education Secretary Gavin Williamson would outline a move away from sending ""bubbles"" home and from contact isolation for pupils so as to ""greatly reduce the impact on schools of Covid outbreaks"". ""And obviously the way forward is with testing rather than by sending the bubbles home,"" he added. There has been widespread concern that thousands of pupils are missing school unnecessarily. Last month the number sent home from school for Covid-related reasons quadrupled - but only about 4% were confirmed cases, with most pupils sent home because of a potential contact at school. Mr Williamson is expected to say the changes will come into effect on 19 July, alongside the lifting of other Covid restrictions. The PM's message on Monday was it was ""now or never"" to lift the restrictions. He said the success of the vaccine rollout had weakened the link between cases and deaths. This video can not be played PM Boris Johnson: ""If we can't reopen in next few weeks, when will we?"" ""If we don't go ahead now, when we've clearly done so much with the vaccination programme to break the link... when would we go ahead?"" He added: ""We run the risk of either opening up at a very difficult time when the virus has an edge, has an advantage, in the cold months, or again putting everything off to next year."" On Monday, a further 27,334 cases were reported across the UK - and another nine deaths within 28 days of a positive test. In a sombre warning, Mr Johnson warned cases were predicted to rise to 50,000 a day later this month - and more people would die. Prof Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College, whose modelling led to the first nationwide restrictions, said there was the potential for the UK to have a very large numbers of cases - 150,000 to 200,000 a day - which could ""still cause some pressure to the health system"". However he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that although it was a ""slight gamble"" he thought it was ""justifiable"", adding ""I'm reasonably optimistic"". He said that in the worst-case scenario there ""may need to be a course correction later"". This video can not be played Keir Starmer: ""Lifting all protections, in one go, when the infection rate is going up, is reckless"" Labour politicians, as well as some doctors and trade unions, have expressed concern that the lifting of the restrictions may be premature. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the government's plan was ""reckless"" and urged a more ""balanced approach"" to keep protections in place. He suggested the compulsory use of masks in enclosed spaces and on public transport. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham, who is opposed to the lifting of the face-covering rule, said that while he had the power to continue to make them mandatory on Manchester's tram network, he would not do so as ""I just don't see how we would be able to enforce it"". And Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said discussions were planned between Transport for London, the Department for Transport and other transport providers ""before we decide our next steps"". West End musical closes for 10 days after Covid case Who could get a third jab in September? Check the latest cases in your area Trade union Unite, which represents tens of thousands of public transport workers, said it would be ""an act of gross negligence by the government"" to end the requirement to wear face coverings on public transport in two weeks. Dr Nathalie MacDermott, an infectious diseases expert at Kings College London, said that now was not the right time to lift all restrictions. ""If we give the virus a foothold now by removing restrictions, we're probably just setting ourselves up for a bigger problem in the autumn,"" she told BBC's Newsnight. ""We should be waiting until all of our adult population - and possibly some of our younger adult population, or children and young people - are immunised, fully immunised, before we reduce our restrictions."" Speaking alongside Mr Johnson on Monday, England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty warned this coming winter ""may be very difficult for the NHS"". Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said the link between cases, hospital admission and death had been ""weakened, not broken"" by the vaccines. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? At the press conference, there was also a suggestion that a new tracing system would be introduced for fully vaccinated people, with an announcement expected this week. Mr Johnson said a test, trace and isolate system that is ""proportionate to the pandemic"" would continue to be used. ""You will have to self-isolate if you test positive or are told to do so by NHS test and trace,"" he said. ""We are looking to move to a different regime for fully vaccinated contacts of those testing positive, and also for children."" Mr Johnson also ruled out making domestic vaccine passports mandatory at this stage in the pandemic. He said Covid status certificates would not be needed for entry to venues or events, but he said businesses might choose to employ checks of an individual's NHS app to see their status. On the vaccine roll-out, Mr Johnson said the gap between first and second vaccine jabs for the under-40s would be shortened from 12 weeks to eight. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are in charge of their own coronavirus rules. The Scottish government has said it maycontinue to require masksin certain settings even after 9 August, when it is hoped the final curbs will end. Ahead of a review on 15 July in Wales, ministers said peoplewould need to learn to livewith Covid. Rules in Northern Irelandhave just eased, with another review due on 8 July.

The Â£100m investment, which the UK government will contribute to, will safeguard more than 1,000 factory jobs. The future of the plant has been in doubt after Vauxhall's parent company scrapped plans to build its new Astra model there. The Ellesmere Port plant will also make electric passenger car models for Vauxhall, Opel, Peugeot and CitroÃ«n. Production of an all-electric van will start in 2022, the carmaker said. The government has held talks with Stellantis about options for the Cheshire factory and ministers are understood to have offered about Â£30m in financial support. Carlos Tavares, head of Stellantis, had previously warned that the company would no longer invest in pure diesel or petrol cars at the plant, and said a decision on where it would build electric vehicles would depend on the UK government's support of the car sector. Mr Tavares said: ""Performance is always the trigger for sustainability and this Â£100m investment demonstrates our commitment to the UK and to Ellesmere Port."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""It's a huge vote of confidence in our economy, in the people of Ellesmere Port, and in our fantastic post-Brexit trading relationships."" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said: ""Ellesmere Port's proud tradition in auto manufacturing will continue for many years to come thanks to today's investment."" He said that the investment will also ""secure thousands of jobs across the region in the supply chain"". ""In this global race to secure electric vehicle production, we are proud to support Britain's auto sector in this crucial transition as we work to build back better,"" Mr Kwarteng added. Mr Tavares said the fate of Ellesmere Port will depend on the UK government's commitment to the car industry Sales of vans have been booming during the pandemic,as a result of growing home delivery sales. Vauxhall's Luton plant is currently operating at full capacity so Stellantis wants to expand production at Ellesmere Port to serve the UK market. Like other manufacturers it is also preparing for an all-electric future. The UK will ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030, with other European countries setting similar targets. Last week, Japanese carmaker Nissan announced an expansion ofelectric vehicle production at its car plant in Sunderland which will create 1,650 new jobs. Hollie Hughes, 24, an engineer at the Ellesmere Port plant, who started as an apprentice nearly eight years ago, said the plans were ""so exciting"", especially the electric vehicle aspect. ""It's a massive highlight for Ellesmere Port,"" she said, adding that her team will be ""heavily involved"" in implementing the plans. Oliver Holden, 27, a manufacturing engineer at the plant, said the employees had waited a long time for the announcement. ""From today, everyone will be pleased - the mood will be lifted, I believe,"" he said. ""Everyone now can focus on the next challenges and move towards the future."" Professor David Bailey, an economist at Birmingham Business School, told the BBC's Today programme that Vauxhall's plans would support jobs in the short term, but there was a question over how sustainable they would make Ellesmere Port. ""There is there is no [Stellantis electric vehicle] battery plant being built in the UK... so if batteries are being brought in from France and elsewhere, that's going to add to costs and it's going leave Ellesmere Port as a relatively high-cost location,"" he said. ""[Building one in the UK] would really anchor vehicle production at Stellantis at Ellesmere Port and Luton in the UK. ""Longer term we're going to need a lot of batteries in the UK and we will need battery plants to keep mass car and vehicle production here."" Stellantis is currently building two battery plants, one in France and one in Germany, and is looking to establish a third, rumoured to be in Italy. The two ""gigafactories"" at Douvrin in France and Kaiserslautern in Germany will get French and German government support of â¬1.3bn (Â£1.1bn). The Ellesmere Port plant will have a new body shop and investment in general assembly and on site battery pack assembly. Work will begin on potential wind and solar farms at the site. Stellantis will also consult on the creation of a UK parts distribution centre which will require further investment. The outlook for the British automotive industry is certainly a lot rosier now than it was just a few months ago. Without investment in new products every few years, car plants die; and the ageing factory at Ellesmere Port has long been regarded as particularly vulnerable. Earlier this year Carlos Tavares, the acerbic chief executive of Vauxhall's parent company Stellantis, made it very clear that investment would only arrive if the government itself were prepared to support the industry. It appears the government has done just that, with both Nissan and Stellantis, pledging to spend serious amounts of money developing electric vehicles here as a result. But there's a long way to go to secure the future of car manufacturing, as it prepares for an all-electric future. After years of uncertainty over the outcome of Brexit, which made carmakers reluctant to commit to new plans, the UK is still playing catch-up. So while the news from Nissan and Vauxhall has been widely welcomed, people within the sector agree that much more is needed. Stellantis is the world's fifth-largest carmaker and also owns Peugeot, Fiat and Chrysler. Ellesmere Port, acquired by Vauxhall Motors in 1957 from the Royal Auxiliary Air Force, initially developed the site as a sub-assembly and engine production line for its Dunstable and Luton factories. It produced its first car, the Vauxhall Viva, in 1964, and produced the Viva, Chevette, and Vauxhall and Opel Astra. Employment peaked at the site in 1975, with 12,000 people on staff.

"For more than a year, personal freedoms have been curtailed to keep Covid at bay. That looks likely to change, with ministers proposing to lift many of the remaining restrictions in England on 19 July. The details, set out on Monday, have sparked intense debate. Prof Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London, whose modelling led to the first lockdown, has said it is a gamble, but one worth taking. What is unarguable is that the nature of the pandemic in the UK has changed - and with it so should many of our assumptions. The rollout of the vaccination programme has altered everything, reducing both the individual risk and the wider one to the health system. Back in January, about one in 10 infections could be expected to translate into a hospital admission 10 days later. Now that figure appears to be somewhere between one in 40 and one in 50. What is more, those ending up in hospital seem to be less sick, and need less intensive treatment. The risk of death, as a result, has reduced even further. In January about one in 60 cases resulted in someone dying. Today it's fewer than one in 1,000. But this does not mean England - and the rest of the UK for that matter - is not heading for a significant third wave. As the charts above show, infection rates are rising. If they rise enough, that has the potential to cause a significant number of hospitalisations, possibly 1,000 a day before summer is out. Covid: Most rules set to end in England, says PM Covid: Doctors want to keep some measures after 19 July Many may wonder how this can happen given how effective the vaccines are. Individually, those who have had two doses are at a very tiny risk of getting seriously ill, but with infection rates high it means many people are taking that tiny risk at the same time. Add to that those who are unvaccinated or for whom the vaccines do not work as well and you can get a lot of admissions to hospital. But serious illness happens all the time. In the depths of winter there can be 1,000 admissions a day for respiratory infections. Flu alone killed more than 20,000 people in England in the winter of 2017-18. There was no talk of the need to introduce restrictions or curtail freedoms then. ""That is the context we need to start seeing Covid in,"" says Prof Robert Dingwall, a sociologist at Nottingham Trent University. But why even take the risk? Why not - as scientists on Independent Sage have suggested -wait until the adult vaccination rollout is complete in September? There was always going to be an ""exit wave"" once restrictions were lifted. And government scientists are hopeful the wall of immunity built up by natural infection and the vaccine rollout so far will soon kick in and flatten the wave. The fact remains interventions are not harm-free, so in the end it comes down to difficult judgements about trade-offs. As the virus presents less of a risk, that in turn shifts the balance on what can be considered proportionate. Perhaps the clearest example of this is what is happening with schools where there are currently more than 500,000 children at home self-isolating in England because they were deemed to have close contact with an infected person at school. That's 20 children out of school for every positive case. This approach started in September, before vaccines had even completed their clinical trials. The idea was to contain spread of the virus to protect vulnerable adults - children are at incredibly low risk from Covid. Now that all over-50s have had the chance of a second jab - these are the age groups where 99% of Covid deaths have occurred - the benefits of quarantining children like this is hugely reduced, while the costs in terms of disruption to education are clear to see. Ministers say they will change this approach in time for September, but should this have been avoided given how much school has been disrupted already? There are other arguments for why it should be now. ""Covid will never go away,"" says Prof Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia. ""It's inevitable that we're going to catch it repeatedly for the rest of our lives, whether we have had the vaccine or not. ""The issues becomes not whether it is safe to lift all restrictions, but when would it be safest to do so."" Waiting any longer could make the situation worse, he believes, extending the exit wave into the autumn when schools are back and the flu season is getting under way. It was a view echoed by England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty, who said it had his personal backing when the government unveiled its plans on Monday. But the idea of letting a virus spread when we have spent so long trying to do the opposite requires a psychological shift. Dr Muge Cevik, an infectious disease expert at University of St Andrews, says this will take time. ""We need to accept Covid is here. We won't be able to completely stop the spread. We are now at the stage of managing the virus."" She would like to see more emphasis now on recovery, tackling the backlog in hospital care for non-Covid treatments, dealing with the economic fallout and loss of jobs and the emotional and mental health toll the pandemic has had. But none of this is without risks. What if infection rates keep rising and that wall of immunity is slow to kick in? Understandable concerns have also been raised about those who are at risk because they have conditions such as blood cancer which mean the vaccines do not work as well or who have a higher chance of exposure because of their jobs, such as shop or factory workers. There is also Long Covid to contend with - although the risks of this are far from fully understood. We are, perhaps, the first country to find ourselves in this situation, where we are attempting to return to normal in the face of a rapidly rising rate of infection and a more infectious variant, Delta. Others will soon face similar dilemmas. It's why the world will be watching what happens on these shores. Most Covid rules set to end in England, says PM How many cases are there in your area?

"Shoppers are starting to return to pre-pandemic habits when it comes to buying food, according to two leading grocers. Sainsbury's says demand for online sales has fallen from peak levels as people return to shopping in stores. Boss Simon Roberts also said mask wearing in stores would be a matter of ""personal choice"" after Covid rules are lifted in England on 19 July. Meanwhile online grocer Ocado said average order sizes have been falling as people start to eat out more often. However, both Sainsbury's and Ocado said online sales were way above pre-pandemic levels. Sainsbury's says 18% of its sales are online, compared with 8% in 2019-20. Sainsbury's - the UK's second largest supermarket chain - also said online sales jumped 29% in the first quarter of its financial year compared with last year, and were 142% higher than before coronavirus struck. However, it added: ""As restrictions continue to ease, customers are beginning to return to more normal shopping patterns, with online demand reducing gradually from peak levels and transaction numbers increasing in stores."" Retail sales fall in May as shoppers dine out Shopping in 10 minutes: The new supermarket battle Trading overall at Sainsbury's was stronger than expected in the 16 weeks to 26 June. with sales up by 1.6% from a year earlier. The retailer said there were a number of areas of concern, however, including potential price pressures from rising commodity prices and freight costs. Mr Roberts also said the business was facing challenges from a shortage of HGV drivers and there had been an increase in staff absence because of Covid. He said he would consult staff on their views on face masks, but said the decision to wear one would be down to individual choice. ""There are two very distinct points of view. One is customers and colleagues who can't wait for the restrictions to lift and not to have to wear a mask for example, and others who are keen to continue to do that,"" Mr Roberts said. ""I think in the end it will come down to the choices that individual customers and colleagues want to make. It is going to be driven by customer and by colleague choice."" Ocado said its retail revenues - which covers its joint venture with Marks and Spencer - had grown 19.8% to Â£1.2bn in the six months to 30 May. However, it added: ""With the easing of social distancing restrictions meaning fewer meals consumed at home, basket sizes in the second quarter have begun to move toward pre-Covid-19 levels, exiting the period 10% lower than the average for the half.""

"An Afghan army soldier surveys belongings left by the US military when it departed Bagram Airbase The US military left Bagram Airfield - its key base in Afghanistan - in the dead of night without notifying the Afghans, the base's new commander said. General Asadullah Kohistani told the BBC that the US left Bagram at 03:00 local time on Friday, and that the Afghan military found out hours later. Bagram also contains a prison, and there are reportedly up to 5,000 Taliban prisoners left in the facility. The Taliban have been advancing rapidly in Afghanistan as US troops withdraw. General Kohistani said on Monday that Afghan forces were expecting the Taliban to attack Bagram. Speaking to reporters at the airbase, he said he was already receiving reports the group was making ""movements in rural areas"" nearby. ""You know, if we compare ourselves with the Americans, it's a big difference,"" Gen Kohistani said. ""But according to our capabilities... we are trying to do the best and as much as possible secure and serve all the people."" An Afghan army soldier keeps watch at Bagram, the morning after US troops withdrew during the night The US announced on Friday that it had vacated Bagram, effectively completing its military campaign in Afghanistan ahead of the official end date of 11 September, announced by President Joe Biden earlier this year. The withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan is more than 90% completed, the Pentagon's Central Command said on Tuesday. The Americans left behind about 3.5 million items, Gen Kohistani said, including tens of thousands of bottles of water, energy drinks and military ready-made meals, known as MREs. They also left behind thousands of civilian vehicles, without keys, and hundreds of armoured vehicles, the Associated Press reported. They took heavy weapons with them and detonated some ammunition stocks, but left behind small weapons and ammunition for the Afghans, Gen Kohistani said. Asked by the Associated Press about the late-night withdrawal from the base, US military spokesman Colonel Sonny Leggett referred to a statement issued last week that said US forces had co-ordinated their departure from various bases with Afghan leaders. The US military left behind thousands of civilian vehicles and hundreds of armoured vehicles Within 20 minutes of the US's departure on Friday night the electricity was shut down and the base was plunged into darkness, the AP reported - a signal to looters who smashed through barriers and ransacked the abandoned buildings. Leftover items from the base have ended up in nearby scrap yards and second hand shops. At its height, Bagram base was home to tens of thousands of troops. It ballooned from a basic Afghan air base to a mini-city with swimming pools, cinemas, spas and imported fast food outlets Burger King and Pizza Hut. Echoes of 1989 as foreign forces leave Afghanistan The airfield was built by the Soviet Union in the 1950s, becoming its main base in the 1980s as it defended its occupation of Afghanistan. It was later occupied by the Moscow-backed Afghan government and then a mujahideen administration, before eventually winding up in Taliban hands when the group swept to power in the mid 1990s. When the US invaded in 2001, it deposed the Taliban and took control of the airbase, transforming it into a sprawling complex from which it fought its war against the group. A pair of military boots lie on the floor next to other abandoned equipment in a scrap yard near Bagram airbase The late-night withdrawal by the US hands control of the base to a much less well-equipped force that could struggle to defend it from the Taliban, which has made swift advances in recent weeks across the country, seizing rural districts and surrounding some larger cities. The group claims to have taken more than 10 new districts in the past 24 hours. Despite the movements on the ground, stalled peace talks were renewed last week between representatives of the Taliban and Afghan government in Doha, the capital of Qatar. This video can not be played Former Afghan president Hamid Karzai: Nato failed to defeat extremism Zabiullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, told the BBC that they would present a plan to the team negotiating on behalf of the Afghan government and both sides would discuss it. Gen Kohistani has roughly 3,000 troops under his command - significantly less than the tens of thousands of US and allied soldiers that once occupied Bagram airbase. About 1,000 Afghan soldiers fighting the Taliban in the north of the countryfled over the border into Tajikistan on Monday, according to officials, raising fears over the military's ability to stave off further advances by the group. On Tuesday, a diplomat said Germany had closed its consulate general in the city of Mazar-i-Sharif in northern Afghanistan. The last German troops left the country last week. From 9/11, to intense fighting on the ground, and now full withdrawal of US-led forces, hereâs what happened. 11 September 2001 Al-Qaeda, led by Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan, carries out the largest terror attack ever conducted on US soil. Four commercial airliners are hijacked. Two are flown into the World Trade Centre in New York, which collapses. One hits the Pentagon building in Washington, and one crashes into a field in Pennsylvania. Nearly 3,000 people are killed. 7 October 2001 A US-led coalition bombs Taliban and al-Qaeda facilities in Afghanistan. Targets include Kabul, Kandahar and Jalalabad. The Taliban, who took power after a decade-long Soviet occupation was followed by civil war, refuse to hand over Bin Laden. Their air defences and small fleet of fighter aircraft are destroyed. 13 November 2001 The Northern Alliance, a group of anti-Taliban rebels backed by coalition forces, enters Kabul as the Taliban flee the city. By the 13 November 2001, all Taliban have either fled or been neutralised. Other cities quickly fall. 26 January 2004 After protracted negotiations at a “loya jirga” or grand assembly, the new Afghan constitution is signed into law. The constitution paves the way for presidential elections in October 2004. 7 December 2004 Hamid Karzai, the leader of the Popalzai Durrani tribe, becomes the first president under the new constitution. He serves two five-year terms as president. May 2006 British troops arrive in Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold in the south of the country. Their initial mission is to support reconstruction projects, but they are quickly drawn into combat operations. More than 450 British troops lose their lives in Afghanistan over the course of the conflict. 17 February 2009 US President Barack Obama approves a major increase in the number of troops sent to Afghanistan. At their peak, they number about 140,000. The so-called “surge” is modelled on US strategy in Iraq where US forces focussed on protecting the civilian population as well as killing insurgent fighters. 2 May 2011 The leader of al-Qaeda is killed in an assault by US Navy Seals on a compound in Abbottabad in Pakistan. Bin Ladenâs body is removed and buried at sea. The operation ends a 10-year hunt led by the CIA. Â The confirmation that Bin Laden had been living on Pakistani soil fuels accusations in the US that Pakistan is an unreliable ally in the war on terror. 23 April 2013 The founder of the Taliban, Mullah Mohammed Omar, dies. His death is kept secret for more than two years. According to Afghan intelligence, Mullah Omar dies of health problems at a hospital in the Pakistani city of Karachi. Pakistan denies that he was in the country. 28 December 2014 At a ceremony in Kabul, Nato ends its combat operations in Afghanistan. With the surge now over, the US withdraws thousands of troops. Â Most of those who remain focus on training and supporting the Afghan security forces. 2015 The Taliban launch a series of suicide attacks, car bombings and other assaults. The parliament building in Kabul, and the city of Kunduz are attacked. Islamic State militants begin operations in Afghanistan. 25 January 2019 Afghan President Ashraf Ghani says more than 45,000 members of his countryâs security forces have been killed since he became leader in 2014. The figure is far higher than previously thought. 29 February 2020 The US and the Taliban sign an “agreement for bringing peace” to Afghanistan, in Doha, Qatar. The US and Nato allies agree to withdraw all troops within 14 months if the militants uphold the deal. 13 April 2021 US president Joe Biden announces that all US troops will leave Afghanistan by 11 September 2021. 16 August 2021 In just over a month, the Taliban sweep across Afghanistan, taking control of towns and cities all over the country, including Kabul. Afghan security forces collapse in the face of the Taliban advance.

"Women will be rehabilitated closer to their children and family A residential centre for women will be created in Wales, as an alternative to custody for those convicted of low-level crimes. It will be the first of its kind in Wales or England and will focus on rehabilitation. The announcement was made along with Â£2.5m being made available to community services supporting women at risk of being drawn into crime. It will be awarded later this year and cover costs such as wages and rent. The investment is part of the the UK government's female offender strategy which looks to tackle the root causes of offending and divert women away from criminality and prison. Are too many women being jailed in Wales? Sharp rise in women caught carrying knives ""Residential women centres will offer a robust alternative to short prison sentences and directly tackle the issues which often underlie offending, like substance misuse and mental health problems,"" said Justice Minister Lucy Frazer. It will enable Welsh women to stay closer to home and maintain close ties with children and wider family - something the UK government believes is key in reducing offending. ""Having the first residential women's centre in Wales will mean more women being supported through rehabilitation closer to home, helping them adjust back to life in their communities,"" said Secretary of State for Wales Simon Hart. The Welsh Government also welcomed the move, with chief whip Jane Hutt saying: ""Welsh women need a safe and secure facility that is fit for purpose, while allowing them to maintain contact with their families, particularly children. The current Covid-19 outbreak has highlighted this even further."" The two governments will now work together to identify a provider and site, with the aim of opening the centre by the end of 2021. Funding of Â£2.5m will also be given to groups involved in tackling issues such as domestic abuse, drug and alcohol rehabilitation. Many within the criminal justice system in Wales have been waiting for this news for years. On average, there are fewer than 300 Welsh women in prison, but those numbers have been going up. Over the last decade, more than three quarters of them were given a sentence of less than a year - in fact, a quarter of them were sent to prison for a month or less. Which means they'll typically have committed non-violent crimes like theft. Given over half the women in prison have suffered domestic violence and many will have mental health or substance misuse problems, it's widely acknowledged that if you tackle and support those issues, you've a better chance of rehabilitating and reducing reoffending. As well as the personal cost, there's also a huge cost implication to the state as women's prison places cost Â£15,000 more per prisoner than a similar place for a man. The challenge now will be deciding where to locate the new facility - it's been argued in the past that one would be needed in both north and south Wales. With a budget of Â£800,000, the facility will have 12 beds but will also act as a community resource to support many more women caught up in the criminal justice system, whether they've been given a custodial sentence or not.

"The use of Covid bubbles in England's schools, colleges and early year settings will end on 19 July It is part of a whole range of relaxations in schools as the country moves towards lockdown easing From 16 August, under-18s in England will no longer need to self-isolate after being in close contact with a positive case Fully-vaccinated adults will also not have to self-isolate from then if they are a close contact of a case Those who test positive themselves will still have to self-isolate whether they are vaccinated or not, though The final lifting of England's restrictions is expected on 19 July, but it will be confirmed on 12 July after a review Health Secretary Sajid Javid said new coronavirus cases âcould go as high as 100,000â per day, after restrictions ease England's cricket authorities will name a new squad for their one-day series after three players and four staff test positive Germany is lifting a Covid-related travel ban on people from the UK and four other variant-hit countries Edited by Claire Heald There have been a flurry of announcements today - here are the main ones:  The live page writers today have been Tiffany Wertheimer, Emma Harrison, Jennifer Meierhans, Richard Morris and Ella Wills. It was edited by Claire Heald, Jenny Matthews and Lauren Turner. Thank you for joining us. Reality Check Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth asked in Parliament about the numbers of people who could suffer from long term symptoms, generally known as long Covid, if cases rise as high as 100,000 cases a day - as the health secretary warned. âWith infections running at 100,000 a day that will translate into around 5,000 people a day developing long term chronic illness - long Covid,â he said. The difficulty with these figures is that there is not an agreed definition of what long Covid is. Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty said at the news conference on Monday that it was âseveral different syndromes, almost certainlyâ. Symptoms can range from fatigue and headaches to chest and muscle pain. Labour confirmed that Mr Ashworth was referring to research from October 2020 by Kingâs College London that found that one in 20 people with Covid were likely to suffer symptomsfor eight weeks or more,external. More recently, the React study at Imperial College London found that 37% of people who said they had had Covid reported having at least one symptom that lasted for 12 weeks or more,implying a total of more than two million people have suffered with it. The Office for National Statistics (ONS)has also been running a survey of people with ongoing symptoms,external. Its latest figures estimated that 962,000 people in the UK had experienced symptoms lasting for more than four weeks in the four weeks to 6 June 2021, which was down from 1.02 million the previous month. From 19 July, wearing a face mask will become a matter of ""personal choice"" says Prime Minister Boris Johnson. It seems, however, that companies intend to view these rules differently. Some airlines have confirmed face masks will still be compulsory after 19 July, while shops, pubs and hairdressers are altering policies. The World Health Organization still advises masks continue to be mandatory on public transport, in shops and in crowded places. You can read more on plans from across companieshere. A loneliness network in Northern Ireland has installed ""chatty benches"" to combat loneliness and isolation during the pandemic. Childminder Janice Nelson meets her friend at a bright yellow bench in Carrickfergus, County Antrim most days. They say hello to strangers who walk by and often that turns into longer conversations. This video can not be played The bright seats bringing people together Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online Lots of people have been Googling to find out what this new(ish) variant of Covid is and what threat it might pose. Itâs yet another mutated version of the pandemic virus. Experts are certainly keeping an eye on it, but they are not worried enough just yet to move it onto the ""variant of concern"" list that Delta and Alpha belong to. Lambda, or C.37, was first identified in Peru in 2020. Itâs since been found elsewhere, including in the UK,which has recorded eight cases so far,external. Importantly, Lambda hasnât outcompeted other variants that are circulating, despite possessing some genetic changes that could potentially help ittransmit more easily than original Covid,external. New variants will keep emerging. Many will be of little or no consequence. But some could potentially threaten how well our vaccines work. Thatâs why it is so important to keep them in check. The Portuguese are being told to maintain hygiene and social distancing as the country battles a fourth wave of coronavirus. The more infectious Delta variant is now causing nearly 90% of new cases, the national health institute said. The infection rate jumped in mid-May when Portugal opened to visitors from the EU and Britain, and the cases are now back to the numbers seen in February, when the country was in lockdown. A night-time curfew was put in place last week
in 45 municipalities including Lisbon, Porto and Albufeira, and
restaurants and non-food shops must close earlier at the weekend
in some areas. Authorities in Spain's Catalonia region have also said restrictions will be imposed there to try to control a surge in cases. From this weekend, nightclubs will be closed and a negative Covid-19 test or proof of vaccination will be needed to take part in outdoor activities involving more than 500 people. ""We can't pretend to have defeated the virus,"" a spokeswoman for the regional government said. ""The pandemic has not ended, the new variants are very contagious and we still have significant segments of the population that are not vaccinated.""  Trade union Unite is seeking urgent meetings with London's mayor Sadiq Khan and Transport for London (TfL) over the rules on face masks. The union, which represents more than 20,000 London bus workers, wants passengers in the capital to continue to be required to wear face coverings even when England's coronavirus restrictions end, which is expected to be on 19 July. More than 50 bus workers in London have died after testing positive for coronavirus. Unite regional secretary for London Pete Kavanagh says bus workers are ""rightly worried for their safety following the government's reckless announcement"". On Monday, Khan said discussions were planned between TfL, the Department for Transport and other transport providers ""before we decide our next steps"". Read more:Unions warn workers at risk if face masks rules dropped. NHS Test and Trace are to take over notification of contact with a positive Covid case from nurseries, schools and colleges. The system of ""bubbles"" for school years will end, stopping the need for all children to isolate if there is a positive case. From mid-August, under 18s will only have to self-isolate if they themselves test positive for Covid-19. From 19 July, it'll no longer be required to wear masks in schools, and start times for different year groups will no longer be staggered. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, secondary school pupils must wear masks even in classrooms. In Wales, students must wear masks in areas where social distancing cannot be maintained. While the government has confirmed rules will be relaxed from 19 July, the current guidance remains the same. You must continue to follow the current guidance and rulesin order to stay safe while enjoying the football -including when England play Denmark in the Euro 2020semi-final tomorrow. Up tosix people from six households,external(or two households of any size) can meet in a pub in England, or 30 in a pub garden. Different groups must not mix. In England, guidance remains on using ""personal judgement"" on whether or not to hug friends and family. You can have friends over, but you must keep the room well ventilated and adhere to the six people from six households (or two households of any size) rule. There are special areas to watch matches outdoors in London, Manchester, Birmingham, Glasgow and other cities. What are the rules elsewhere? Captured in a timelapse video, festival crew expertly rolled out the enormous and iconic red carpet Organisers have rolled out the red carpet - literally - in preparation for the Cannes Film Festival's opening ceremony tonight. Film stars have started to arrive in the French Riviera town, and there are strict health measures and testing in place to keep the return of the iconic festival virus-free. The event was cancelled last year because of the pandemic, and its return is seen as symbolic of cinema's bounce back. The opening film is the musical Annette, starring Marion Cotillard and Adam Driver and directed by Leos Carax. Follow the latest on the Cannes Film Festivalhere. There are strict coronavirus measures in place, as France warns against a rise in the Delta variant In most places from 19 July,wearing a face mask will not be legally required. But England's chief medical officer Chris Whitty, and chief scientific advisor Sir Patrick Vallance have said they will continue to wear masks in crowded settings, if asked to, or as a common courtesy to those who are uncomfortable. The British Medical Association has said it makes no sense to stop wearing masks in enclosed spaces. Businesses can still refuse service if you will not wear a mask, if you do not have an exemption. And the legal requirement to wear masks will remain in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Nearly 80m vaccine doses have now been given in the UK. A total of 79,302,857 jabs have been given, according to thegovernment's daily figures.,external That's 45,428,681 first doses and 33,874,176 second doses. The rules on self-isolation will soon change for those who have had both jabs -here's how to prove you've had yours. Professor Chris Whitty has urged the nation to ""push hell for leather"" to reduce coronavirus infection rates and roll out the vaccines to prevent a significant increase in long Covid. England's chief medical officer told the Local Government Association's annual conference: ""Since there's a lot of Covid at the moment and the rates are going up I regret to say I think we will get a significant amount more long Covid, particularly in the younger ages where the vaccination rates are currently much lower. ""Fundamentally the two ways to prevent long Covid in my view are to keep Covid rates right down and make sure everyone is vaccinated so they get very mild disease and I think we really just need to push hell for leather for those two. ""The deaths from Covid I think are mercifully going to be much lower in this wave compared to the previous ones as a proportion of cases but long Covid remains, I think, a worry. ""We don't know how big an issue it's going to be but I think we should assume it's not going to be trivial."" There have been a further 37 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK,according to the government's daily figures.,external That brings the total number of deaths in the 28 days following a positive Covid-19 test to 128,268. There have also been another 28,773 new infections recorded in the last 24 hours. The Bank of England is asking staff to come in to the office from September, starting with a minimum of once a week. Its cautious approach contrasts with other companies in the City of London and the wider country who are keener to return to pre-pandemic office hours. The government says people can return to the office after 19 July, if Covid restrictions in England are lifted as planned. Government guidance that people who can work from home should do so is set to end with other restrictions. Read more on this story. Food chain Pret says it is now selling its Christmas sandwich - five months early, or seven months late, depending how you look at it - after it was closed over some of the festive period in 2020 because of the pandemic. Pret says the sandwich will be available to buy for one month. Just days before Christmas 2020, new restrictions to combat growing number of Covid cases were brought in in England and Wales. Measures included being told to stay at home, while non-essential shops and businesses had to close.

Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst The China-Myanmar border gate has been closed In the past 48 hours, there has been a fresh outbreak of Covid-19
in the city of Ruili in southwestern China. Ruili, in Yunnan province, sits next to the border with Myanmar.
Three people tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday, and today a
further three symptomatic cases have been recorded, along with two asymptomatic
cases. The majority of those affected are Burmese nationals. Yesterday, a mass testing drive was launched in the city, which has a population of 210,000 people. The bridge that connects China
with Myanmar has been closed and the residential areas where
patients have tested positive have gone into lockdown. This is not the first time that Ruili has experienced an outbreak - the city has had four waves of the virus throughout the pandemic. The
most recent outbreak happened in March-April, affecting some 100 people. The national Global Times newspaper says that âthe long border and
the Delta virus strain that is widespread among South Asian countries may have
contributed to the epidemic resurgenceâ. Previous outbreaks
have largely been blamed on âillegalâ border crossings. However, since its last
major outbreak, Global Times notes that local officials and militias have been
mobilised to guard the villages at the border. BBC Radio 5 Live Cheryl Burns runs a bar in Netherton, Kirklees, and says despite the prime minister's announcement being a ""hallelujah"" moment for hospitality, she is still ""really anxious"" about opening on 19 July as case numbers are still high. Talking to Nicky Campbell on 5 Live Your Call, she describes her concerns around the responsibility being in the hands of the general public. ""People feel they now have the autonomy to do as they choose... it's nerve-racking,"" she says. ""We don't know whether the public will behave."" She says she is ready to get back to normal, adding: ""We need to learn to live with it, but it doesnât mean that I'm just going to open up my bar and go back to normal. ""We are risking our business and healthy people, and we want people to be safe."" Listen to 5 Live onBBC Sounds. Michelle O'Neill says Northern Ireland will not be following Boris Johnson's plan Boris Johnson's approach to ending Covid-19 restrictions in England is reckless and Northern Ireland won't be following it, NI's Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill has said. She says: ""I would be concerned for the people in England because of the route map set out by Boris Johnson. In my opinion, it's a reckless approach."" The PM says he expects face maskswill no longer be required and distancing rules scrappedfrom 19 July, following a review of health data on 12 July. O'Neill says the Northern Ireland Executive would take its own decisions, adding she hoped ministers could agree future steps at its meeting on Thursday.

"For more than a year, personal freedoms have been curtailed to keep Covid at bay. That looks likely to change, with ministers proposing to lift many of the remaining restrictions in England on 19 July. The details, set out on Monday, have sparked intense debate. Prof Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London, whose modelling led to the first lockdown, has said it is a gamble, but one worth taking. What is unarguable is that the nature of the pandemic in the UK has changed - and with it so should many of our assumptions. The rollout of the vaccination programme has altered everything, reducing both the individual risk and the wider one to the health system. Back in January, about one in 10 infections could be expected to translate into a hospital admission 10 days later. Now that figure appears to be somewhere between one in 40 and one in 50. What is more, those ending up in hospital seem to be less sick, and need less intensive treatment. The risk of death, as a result, has reduced even further. In January about one in 60 cases resulted in someone dying. Today it's fewer than one in 1,000. But this does not mean England - and the rest of the UK for that matter - is not heading for a significant third wave. As the charts above show, infection rates are rising. If they rise enough, that has the potential to cause a significant number of hospitalisations, possibly 1,000 a day before summer is out. Covid: Most rules set to end in England, says PM Covid: Doctors want to keep some measures after 19 July Many may wonder how this can happen given how effective the vaccines are. Individually, those who have had two doses are at a very tiny risk of getting seriously ill, but with infection rates high it means many people are taking that tiny risk at the same time. Add to that those who are unvaccinated or for whom the vaccines do not work as well and you can get a lot of admissions to hospital. But serious illness happens all the time. In the depths of winter there can be 1,000 admissions a day for respiratory infections. Flu alone killed more than 20,000 people in England in the winter of 2017-18. There was no talk of the need to introduce restrictions or curtail freedoms then. ""That is the context we need to start seeing Covid in,"" says Prof Robert Dingwall, a sociologist at Nottingham Trent University. But why even take the risk? Why not - as scientists on Independent Sage have suggested -wait until the adult vaccination rollout is complete in September? There was always going to be an ""exit wave"" once restrictions were lifted. And government scientists are hopeful the wall of immunity built up by natural infection and the vaccine rollout so far will soon kick in and flatten the wave. The fact remains interventions are not harm-free, so in the end it comes down to difficult judgements about trade-offs. As the virus presents less of a risk, that in turn shifts the balance on what can be considered proportionate. Perhaps the clearest example of this is what is happening with schools where there are currently more than 500,000 children at home self-isolating in England because they were deemed to have close contact with an infected person at school. That's 20 children out of school for every positive case. This approach started in September, before vaccines had even completed their clinical trials. The idea was to contain spread of the virus to protect vulnerable adults - children are at incredibly low risk from Covid. Now that all over-50s have had the chance of a second jab - these are the age groups where 99% of Covid deaths have occurred - the benefits of quarantining children like this is hugely reduced, while the costs in terms of disruption to education are clear to see. Ministers say they will change this approach in time for September, but should this have been avoided given how much school has been disrupted already? There are other arguments for why it should be now. ""Covid will never go away,"" says Prof Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia. ""It's inevitable that we're going to catch it repeatedly for the rest of our lives, whether we have had the vaccine or not. ""The issues becomes not whether it is safe to lift all restrictions, but when would it be safest to do so."" Waiting any longer could make the situation worse, he believes, extending the exit wave into the autumn when schools are back and the flu season is getting under way. It was a view echoed by England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty, who said it had his personal backing when the government unveiled its plans on Monday. But the idea of letting a virus spread when we have spent so long trying to do the opposite requires a psychological shift. Dr Muge Cevik, an infectious disease expert at University of St Andrews, says this will take time. ""We need to accept Covid is here. We won't be able to completely stop the spread. We are now at the stage of managing the virus."" She would like to see more emphasis now on recovery, tackling the backlog in hospital care for non-Covid treatments, dealing with the economic fallout and loss of jobs and the emotional and mental health toll the pandemic has had. But none of this is without risks. What if infection rates keep rising and that wall of immunity is slow to kick in? Understandable concerns have also been raised about those who are at risk because they have conditions such as blood cancer which mean the vaccines do not work as well or who have a higher chance of exposure because of their jobs, such as shop or factory workers. There is also Long Covid to contend with - although the risks of this are far from fully understood. We are, perhaps, the first country to find ourselves in this situation, where we are attempting to return to normal in the face of a rapidly rising rate of infection and a more infectious variant, Delta. Others will soon face similar dilemmas. It's why the world will be watching what happens on these shores. Most Covid rules set to end in England, says PM How many cases are there in your area?

"The second homes issue has sparked campaigns in Wales Changes to local taxes, government house purchase schemes and planning laws could be introduced to tackle a second homes ""crisis"" in Wales. The Welsh government will pick an area of Wales to pilot new policies in an attempt to ""inject fairness back into the housing system"". Officials will also look at options to shut a tax ""loophole"" where some second home owners do not pay council tax. But the plans were accused of being ""weak"" and ""vague"" by Plaid Cymru. The Welsh Conservatives also questioned whether second homes were making areas unaffordable. There were 24,873 second homes registered for council tax purposes in January 2021, according to official figures. Officials say numbers of homes could be much higher depending on the exact definition of a second home. 'Crazy prices too much for local home buyers' Are second home owners really pricing locals out? What is the tax loophole? Gwynedd has the highest number of second homes at 5,098, which represents 20% of all second homes in Wales. There are 4,068 in Pembrokeshire, while Cardiff has 3,477, Anglesey 2,139 and 2,104 in Swansea. Rachel Kelway-Lewis would like to buy in Pembrokeshire, but is currently living in a caravan Rachel Kelway-Lewis, 25, is among those finding it difficult to get on the housing ladder in Wales. Originally from the village of Solva in Pembrokeshire, she is now living in a caravan she rents just outside St Davids. ""It's incredibly difficult"" to get on the housing ladder in the area, the Carmarthenshire council worker said. ""Currently there's plots being sold for Â£350,000 alone... luxury developments, when so many local people can't afford to live in the area they've grown up in. ""I moved away for university and then I've come back to the area. ""I'd really like to buy locally and I work full-time, but unfortunately we're being priced out by second homeowners."" Campaigners and politicians in west and north Wales have been calling on the government to act to tackle what they believe is a second homes crisis. In response toa report on the issue,externalby Dr Simon Brooks, of Swansea University, the Welsh government is promising ""a summer of action which will determine how we tackle this issue now and into the future"". Housing Minister Julie James says ""the urgency and gravity of this situation calls for further intervention"" Julie James, the climate change minister responsible for housing, said Wales was the only part of the UK to give councils the power to introduce a 100% council tax premium on second homes, but added ""the urgency and gravity of this situation calls for further intervention"". The minister is proposing three solutions: Addressing affordability and availability of housing Introducing regulations, including planning and the introduction of a statutory registration scheme for holiday accommodation Using national and local taxation systems to ensure second home owners ""make a fair and effective contribution to the communities in which they buy"" Policy measures will be trialled and evaluated in a pilot area, which will be decided over the summer, before being considered for wider rollout. A Welsh Language Community Housing Plan, to protect the particular interests of Welsh language communities, will be published for consultation in the autumn. The Gwynedd council area has the highest number of second homes in Wales ""The continuing rise of house prices mean people, especially younger generations, can no longer afford to live in the communities they have grown up in,"" Ms James said. ""A high concentration of second homes or holiday lets can have a very detrimental impact on small communities, and in some areas could compromise the Welsh language being spoken at a community level."" But Welsh Conservative climate change spokeswoman Janet Finch-Saunders argued that while rising house prices mean people can no longer to afford to live in their home communities, ""the minister has made a grave error by linking this to second homes"". ""The report by Dr Simon Brooks made important points, including that there is little evidence that second homes are the main cause of high house prices as opposed to buyers moving to reside there permanently."" She called for Ms James ""to restore the Right-to-Buy in those crisis communities in Wales, reinvesting sale proceeds into more social housing and protecting homes from sale for 10 years"". Even the beach huts in the village of Abersoch are hot property, with one selling for Â£153,000 in 2016 Mabon ap Gwynfor, housing spokesman for Plaid, said: ""These weak measures will not be nearly enough to truly get to grips with a housing emergency that is fast engulfing our communities at an alarming rate. ""There is nothing here about closing the council tax loophole. There is nothing here about imposing caps on second homes. And there is nothing here about bringing numbers of holiday homes into community ownership through public intervention. ""In fact, there is no detail just vague plans for more consultation,"" he added. Research by Gwynedd council suggests that over 60% of people in the area are priced out of their local communities, with second homes making up 11% of the county's housing stock. Council leader Dyfrig Siencyn, a Plaid councillor, said: ""Consultations and pilot schemes will not assist young people keen to get onto the housing ladder this year, it is therefore exasperating to see that no direct immediate action will be made to support people now.""

"This video can not be played Health Secretary Sajid Javid outlines new rules for double-jabbed Fully vaccinated people in England will not have to self-isolate if a close contact tests positive for Covid from 16 August, the health secretary says. Sajid Javid told MPs the same policy would also apply to anyone under the age of 18 from that date. The government would give more details this week on self-isolation rules for international travel, he added. Meanwhile, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has announcedthe end of ""bubbles"" in schoolsfrom 19 July. This system has led to large numbers of pupils being sent home if a single child has a positive test. Covid-relatedpupil absence in England has hit a new highsince all students returned to school in March - with 640,000 pupils in England not in school due to Covid last week. On Monday, the prime minister confirmedhe intended to scrap most of the remaining restrictionsin England on 19 July, including the laws on mask wearing and rules on social distancing. A further 28,773 cases were reported across the UK on Tuesday, and there were another 37 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Some firms to insist people still wear face masks I'm fully vaccinated, but how can I prove it? Why it's time to think differently about Covid What next for the NHS Covid-19 contact tracing app? In a statement to the House of Commons, the health secretary said: ""From 16 August when even more people will have the protection of both doses, and when modelling suggests the risks from the virus will be even lower, anyone who is a close contact of a positive case will no longer have to self-isolate if they have been fully vaccinated. ""If someone gets their second dose just before or just after 16 August, they'll need to wait two weeks, after which their second jab can take effect and give them these new freedoms."" As under-18s are not routinely jabbed, he said a similar exemption from self-isolation rules would be extended to them. Mr Javid said adults who had been in close contact with a positive case would be ""advised"" to get a PCR test as soon as possible to make sure they had not been infected, while for children it would be dependent on their age. People identified as close contacts of a confirmed Covid case are currently required to self-isolate for up to 10 full days when contacted by NHS Test and Trace. He added that ""of course"" anyone that tested positive would have to self-isolate whether they have had the jab or not. The Department of Health and Social Care said the date for the changes was chosen to allow more people to become double jabbed and with rising case numbers ""it makes sense"" to keep protective measures in place until mid-August. It said if fully-vaccinated users of the NHS Covid-19 app are notified that a contact has tested positive after 16 August, they will be able to tell it they have had both jabs. Industry group UK Hospitality said Mr Javid's announcement ""doesn't go far enough, quickly enough"". Chief executive Kate Nicholls said it ""fails to recognise the carnage the current system"" is causing with pub and restaurant staff who ""have been told to isolate despite not having shared shifts with colleagues who tested positive"". The NHS Confederation, representing hospital leaders, said the move ""may act as an incentive for people to have both jabs, but we must also remember that no vaccine is 100% effective... it's still vital that people continue to get tested, and isolate if they have Covid"". The education secretary confirmed that the rules on pupils in England self-isolating would be ending Transport Secretary Grant Shapps will update MPs this week on international travel and removing ""the need for fully-vaccinated arrivals to isolate when they return from an amber list country"", Mr Javid said. Earlier, the health secretary told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he would expect cases numbers by 19 July to be ""at least double"" what they were now ""so around 50,000 new cases a day"". ""As we ease and go into the summer we expect them to rise significantly and they could go as high as 100,000 case numbers,"" he said. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Mr Javid had justified allowing infections to climb by pointing to the UK ""building a protective wall"" of vaccines. However, Mr Ashworth said the ""wall is only part built"", and data from Israel suggested that the infectious Delta variant could be transmitted through fully vaccinated people. He said he ""understood the rationale"" for Mr Javid's announcement but believed that the ""biggest barrier to an effective isolation policy"" was a ""lack of financial incentive to stay at home"". He also called for a U-turn on the decision to make mask-wearing voluntary, saying: ""Yes, let's have freedom but not a high-risk free-for-all - keep masks for now, fix sick pay, and let's unlock in a safe and sustainable way."" The Scottish government has said it maycontinue to require masksin certain settings even after 9 August, when it is hoped the final curbs will end. Ahead of a review on 15 July in Wales, ministers said peoplewould need to learn to livewith Covid. Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill saidthe prime minister's approach to ending coronavirus restrictions in England was reckless. She said Northern Ireland, which is due to review its rules on 8 July, would make its own decisions but would ""not be following that model"". Ireland's deputy prime minister Leo Varadkar called England's plan ""too risky"" and warned if things went wrong there would be a ""spillover effect"" into neighbouring countries. Asked about contingency planning for potential vaccine-resistant variants, Mr Javid told MPs: ""Reasonable experts will have different views on this... we are making some proportionate and balanced changes but border controls are staying in place. We are keeping the test, track and isolate policy in place."" The lifting of the remaining restrictions and now the ending of quarantining for the close contacts of people who are infected are bold moves. No other country in the world has tried this in the face of a rapidly increasing level of Covid infection driven by a more infectious variant. So, of course, it comes with risks. While the link between infections and serious illness has been weakened, it has not been broken altogether. If cases reach 100,000 a day, that could translate to close to 2,000 hospital admissions a day - twice what the NHS would see for all types of respiratory illness in the depths of winter. Soon afterwards, you would expect so see Covid deaths top 100 a day. And what if infection rates rise even further? Should we compare this to flu? In a bad winter those deaths can top 20,000. These are difficult questions to answer. The hope of government scientists is that the wall of immunity built up by the vaccination programme and natural infection will halt the rise in rates before we have to. Prof Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College - whose modelling helped lead to the first nationwide restrictions - said as restrictions eased there was the potential for the UK to have a very large numbers of cases - 150,000 to 200,000 a day - which could ""still cause some pressure to the health system"". However he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that although it was a ""slight gamble"" he thought it was ""justifiable"", adding ""I'm reasonably optimistic."" He said the vaccines would keep deaths far lower than in previous waves. ""The ratio which we saw in the past between case numbers and deaths has been reduced by more like eight to 10-fold."" In the worst-case scenario there ""may need to be a course correction later"", he added. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? Businesses have given mixed reactions to the plans to ease rules in England from 19 July. Melvin Benn, chief executive of Festival Republic, which runs the Reading and Leeds festivals, said the government had ""got this right"", adding that ""the country wants to reopen, we are tired of this, we want to reopen"". He also said he was not inclined to encourage festival guests to wear masks - even indoors. However, Jacinta Rowsell, manager of the Westfield shopping centre in London, said staff would still ""encourage guests"" to wear masks as they wanted people visiting to feel safe.

"Vauxhall owner Stellantis has announced plans to build electric vans at its Ellesmere Port plant in Cheshire. The Â£100m investment, which the UK government will contribute to, will safeguard more than 1,000 factory jobs. The future of the plant has been in doubt after Vauxhall's parent company scrapped plans to build its new Astra model there. The Ellesmere Port plant will also make electric passenger car models for Vauxhall, Opel, Peugeot and CitroÃ«n. Production of an all-electric van will start in 2022, the carmaker said. The government has held talks with Stellantis about options for the Cheshire factory and ministers are understood to have offered about Â£30m in financial support. Carlos Tavares, head of Stellantis, had previously warned that the company would no longer invest in pure diesel or petrol cars at the plant, and said a decision on where it would build electric vehicles would depend on the UK government's support of the car sector. Mr Tavares said: ""Performance is always the trigger for sustainability and this Â£100m investment demonstrates our commitment to the UK and to Ellesmere Port."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""It's a huge vote of confidence in our economy, in the people of Ellesmere Port, and in our fantastic post-Brexit trading relationships."" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said: ""Ellesmere Port's proud tradition in auto manufacturing will continue for many years to come thanks to today's investment."" He said that the investment will also ""secure thousands of jobs across the region in the supply chain"". ""In this global race to secure electric vehicle production, we are proud to support Britain's auto sector in this crucial transition as we work to build back better,"" Mr Kwarteng added. Mr Tavares said the fate of Ellesmere Port will depend on the UK government's commitment to the car industry Sales of vans have been booming during the pandemic,as a result of growing home delivery sales. Vauxhall's Luton plant is currently operating at full capacity so Stellantis wants to expand production at Ellesmere Port to serve the UK market. Like other manufacturers it is also preparing for an all-electric future. The UK will ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030, with other European countries setting similar targets. Last week, Japanese carmaker Nissan announced an expansion ofelectric vehicle production at its car plant in Sunderland which will create 1,650 new jobs. Hollie Hughes, 24, an engineer at the Ellesmere Port plant, who started as an apprentice nearly eight years ago, said the plans were ""so exciting"", especially the electric vehicle aspect. ""It's a massive highlight for Ellesmere Port,"" she said, adding that her team will be ""heavily involved"" in implementing the plans. Oliver Holden, 27, a manufacturing engineer at the plant, said the employees had waited a long time for the announcement. ""From today, everyone will be pleased - the mood will be lifted, I believe,"" he said. ""Everyone now can focus on the next challenges and move towards the future."" Professor David Bailey, an economist at Birmingham Business School, told the BBC's Today programme that Vauxhall's plans would support jobs in the short term, but there was a question over how sustainable they would make Ellesmere Port. ""There is there is no [Stellantis electric vehicle] battery plant being built in the UK... so if batteries are being brought in from France and elsewhere, that's going to add to costs and it's going leave Ellesmere Port as a relatively high-cost location,"" he said. ""[Building one in the UK] would really anchor vehicle production at Stellantis at Ellesmere Port and Luton in the UK. ""Longer term we're going to need a lot of batteries in the UK and we will need battery plants to keep mass car and vehicle production here."" Stellantis is currently building two battery plants, one in France and one in Germany, and is looking to establish a third, rumoured to be in Italy. The two ""gigafactories"" at Douvrin in France and Kaiserslautern in Germany will get French and German government support of â¬1.3bn (Â£1.1bn). The Ellesmere Port plant will have a new body shop and investment in general assembly and on site battery pack assembly. Work will begin on potential wind and solar farms at the site. Stellantis will also consult on the creation of a UK parts distribution centre which will require further investment. The outlook for the British automotive industry is certainly a lot rosier now than it was just a few months ago. Without investment in new products every few years, car plants die; and the ageing factory at Ellesmere Port has long been regarded as particularly vulnerable. Earlier this year Carlos Tavares, the acerbic chief executive of Vauxhall's parent company Stellantis, made it very clear that investment would only arrive if the government itself were prepared to support the industry. It appears the government has done just that, with both Nissan and Stellantis, pledging to spend serious amounts of money developing electric vehicles here as a result. But there's a long way to go to secure the future of car manufacturing, as it prepares for an all-electric future. After years of uncertainty over the outcome of Brexit, which made carmakers reluctant to commit to new plans, the UK is still playing catch-up. So while the news from Nissan and Vauxhall has been widely welcomed, people within the sector agree that much more is needed. Stellantis is the world's fifth-largest carmaker and also owns Peugeot, Fiat and Chrysler. Ellesmere Port, acquired by Vauxhall Motors in 1957 from the Royal Auxiliary Air Force, initially developed the site as a sub-assembly and engine production line for its Dunstable and Luton factories. It produced its first car, the Vauxhall Viva, in 1964, and produced the Viva, Chevette, and Vauxhall and Opel Astra. Employment peaked at the site in 1975, with 12,000 people on staff.

"Ball and Lineker both had their pay reduced Gary Lineker remains the BBC's top earner despite agreeing to a pay cut of just under Â£400,000, the broadcaster has revealed in its annual report. Last year it was announcedthe Match of the Day host had agreed to his wages being reduced. Tuesday's report showed he earned Â£1.36m in the 2020/21 financial year, down from Â£1.75m. Radio 2's Zoe Ball, who also took a pay cut after offering to do so, is still the second-highest paid star on Â£1.13m. Last year she earned the same as Lineker's earnings in the latest financial year - Â£1.36m. Her current salary is actually Â£980,000, a reduction of 28% from 2019/2020 - the Â£1.13m figure takes into account her wages before she took the pay cut towards the end of last year. The wage bill for all on-air talent overall has been cut by 10% to Â£130m - down from Â£144m last year. Wages for broadcasters earning more than Â£150,000 have been reduced by Â£2.2m. The BBC's director general Tim Davie said most of the renegotiations about pay with top stars had been ""mutual and constructive"". Zoe Ball took over from Chris Evans as the host of the Radio 2 Breakfast Show in January 2019 ""Clearly, as a management team, we want to get more value and we're willing to make tough decisions to that extent,"" he said. ""But I think these conversations have all been constructive - as with Zoe Ball when she came forward and said she wanted to adjust her salary. I think everyone is absolutely with the programme on that one."" He added that ""we should maintain restraint in pay across the top talent"" and would ""continue to look for efficiency"" savings in the future. But Conservative MP Julian Knight, who is the chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee (DCMS), said: ""It's welcome that some of the BBC's top-earners have agreed to 'significant reductions' in their salaries this year. Yet despite taking a pay cut, Gary Lineker is still earning Â£1.36 million."" BBC pay: The 2020-2021 list of star salaries BBC annual report,external Five of the six top earners - including Steve Wright, Huw Edwards and Question Time anchor Fiona Bruce - now earn less than they did last year. Radio 5 Live presenter Stephen Nolan, in joint-fifth place, saw his salary increased by Â£15,000. Four women - Ball, Bruce, Radio 2's Vanessa Feltz and Lauren Laverne of 6 Music - make the top 10, the same number as last year. There are 31 women on the list and 40 men, a split of 44%/56%, despite the previous director general Tony Hall pledging that the gap would be closed by 2020. Again like last year, all of the top 10 earners are white. While 20% of all presenters earning over Â£150,000 are from ethnic minority backgrounds, up from 18% last year, the overall staff pay gap for minorities has widened slightly. Graham Norton, who left his Radio 2 show in December 2020, dropped out of the top 10 entirely. The star earned Â£150,000 in 2020/2021. Graham Norton had his own Radio 2 show until December, and is also the voice of the BBC's Eurovision coverage He also fronts the BBC's Eurovision coverage-although the event was cancelled last year due to the pandemic. Covid cancellations tell part of the story when it comes to savings - for example, Sue Barker and John McEnroe didn't cover Wimbledon after the event was pulled last year. Mr Davie said there had been ""quite a lot"" of ""little reductions"" because most major sporting, cultural and political events did not take place last year - but that most pay cuts were ""structural"". Since 2017, the BBC has been made to publish the names of those earning more than Â£150,000 each year, a move instigated by the government, and Lineker has topped the list on each occasion. However, many stars do not appear on the list because the corporation's commercial arm, BBC Studios, does not have to publish its talent spend. Norton's TV chat show, for instance, does not appear on the report for that reason. Claudia Winkelman also disappears from the list, as Strictly Come Dancing isn't counted either. She replaced Norton on Saturday mornings on Radio 2 in February, so that will be reflected in next year's list. The number of senior leaders at the BBC is down from 253 to 241, the report also says. This annual report covers an exceptional year. Despite the usual supply of controversy, from the Proms to Lord Dyson's report on the Princess Diana interview, there are deep trends within this pandemic year which show the BBC to be pursuing a clear strategy under its new leadership. First, reach: 6.1bn streams on iPlayer represents 28% growth, an extraordinary performance. Average time spent with the BBC each also grew. In the current global market, that is remarkable. Second, leanness: Tim Davie, director general since September, is a commercial creature, and wants efficiency. This has caused ructions and even distress within the BBC, with many staff leaving or having to re-apply for jobs. But it has also led to big reductions in overall public sector staff, and also the wage bill for on-air stars. Finally, education, the third pillar of the BBC's Reithian mission to ""inform, educate, and entertain"", has renewed its centrality to the corporation. Consumption of educational programming has soared, fortifying the connection between the BBC and young Britons. Will they pay for a licence fee? They might not, which means the pressure on the BBC's commercial arm, which has ambitious targets, will grow. But ahead of negotiations with the government next year, Davie and Richard Sharp, the chairman since February, can point to clear evidence of continued high demand for what the BBC does. Mr Knight called for the BBC to ""commit to full transparency on its talent bill and drop the smoke and mirrors approach"" following the publication of the report. ""There remains a concerning lack of transparency because a number of top-earning stars are paid through BBC Studios and their salaries don't appear here."" However, in an earlier press briefing, Mr Davie said it was ""absolutely appropriate"" that the broadcaster did not reveal BBC Studios pay and that he would ""defend robustly"" the current system. BBC chairman Richard Sharp pointed to the corporation's work during the Covid-19 pandemic, saying: ""During a profound trauma for the nation, almost overnight we reconfigured all the BBC's output around the most urgent needs of the country. The speed and the agility of the response was exceptional, and they continue to demonstrate very clearly the enduring importance of the BBC is core mission to inform, educate and entertain."" He warned about ""super inflation"" in production with competition from global giants, saying: ""The cost of some of our biggest series have more than doubled. ""Yet despite these pressures, the BBC has proved itself to be resilient and relevant and competitive."" Nine out of 10 adults use the BBC every week, and they spend an average of 18 hours and two minutes watching, listening or reading - up from 17 hours 45 minutes last year. However, those figures fall markedly for younger audiences. Overall, 80% of people aged between 16 and 34 used the BBC every week, falling to 77% for under-16s. Among the 16-34 age group, 51% watched BBC TV every week and 47% listened to BBC radio. The BBC's total workforce has reduced by over 1,200 - that's a 6% decrease. BBC Studios - the corporation's commercial arm - suffered a drop in sales of 10% and profits were down 17%, although those figures were due to production pauses and constraints during the pandemic.

It was edited by Claire Heald, Jenny Matthews and Lauren Turner. Thank you for joining us. Reality Check Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth asked in Parliament about the numbers of people who could suffer from long term symptoms, generally known as long Covid, if cases rise as high as 100,000 cases a day - as the health secretary warned. âWith infections running at 100,000 a day that will translate into around 5,000 people a day developing long term chronic illness - long Covid,â he said. The difficulty with these figures is that there is not an agreed definition of what long Covid is. Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty said at the news conference on Monday that it was âseveral different syndromes, almost certainlyâ. Symptoms can range from fatigue and headaches to chest and muscle pain. Labour confirmed that Mr Ashworth was referring to research from October 2020 by Kingâs College London that found that one in 20 people with Covid were likely to suffer symptomsfor eight weeks or more,external. More recently, the React study at Imperial College London found that 37% of people who said they had had Covid reported having at least one symptom that lasted for 12 weeks or more,implying a total of more than two million people have suffered with it. The Office for National Statistics (ONS)has also been running a survey of people with ongoing symptoms,external. Its latest figures estimated that 962,000 people in the UK had experienced symptoms lasting for more than four weeks in the four weeks to 6 June 2021, which was down from 1.02 million the previous month. From 19 July, wearing a face mask will become a matter of ""personal choice"" says Prime Minister Boris Johnson. It seems, however, that companies intend to view these rules differently. Some airlines have confirmed face masks will still be compulsory after 19 July, while shops, pubs and hairdressers are altering policies. The World Health Organization still advises masks continue to be mandatory on public transport, in shops and in crowded places. You can read more on plans from across companieshere. A loneliness network in Northern Ireland has installed ""chatty benches"" to combat loneliness and isolation during the pandemic. Childminder Janice Nelson meets her friend at a bright yellow bench in Carrickfergus, County Antrim most days. They say hello to strangers who walk by and often that turns into longer conversations. This video can not be played The bright seats bringing people together Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online Lots of people have been Googling to find out what this new(ish) variant of Covid is and what threat it might pose. Itâs yet another mutated version of the pandemic virus. Experts are certainly keeping an eye on it, but they are not worried enough just yet to move it onto the ""variant of concern"" list that Delta and Alpha belong to. Lambda, or C.37, was first identified in Peru in 2020. Itâs since been found elsewhere, including in the UK,which has recorded eight cases so far,external. Importantly, Lambda hasnât outcompeted other variants that are circulating, despite possessing some genetic changes that could potentially help ittransmit more easily than original Covid,external. New variants will keep emerging. Many will be of little or no consequence. But some could potentially threaten how well our vaccines work. Thatâs why it is so important to keep them in check. The Portuguese are being told to maintain hygiene and social distancing as the country battles a fourth wave of coronavirus. The more infectious Delta variant is now causing nearly 90% of new cases, the national health institute said. The infection rate jumped in mid-May when Portugal opened to visitors from the EU and Britain, and the cases are now back to the numbers seen in February, when the country was in lockdown. A night-time curfew was put in place last week
in 45 municipalities including Lisbon, Porto and Albufeira, and
restaurants and non-food shops must close earlier at the weekend
in some areas. Authorities in Spain's Catalonia region have also said restrictions will be imposed there to try to control a surge in cases. From this weekend, nightclubs will be closed and a negative Covid-19 test or proof of vaccination will be needed to take part in outdoor activities involving more than 500 people. ""We can't pretend to have defeated the virus,"" a spokeswoman for the regional government said. ""The pandemic has not ended, the new variants are very contagious and we still have significant segments of the population that are not vaccinated.""  Trade union Unite is seeking urgent meetings with London's mayor Sadiq Khan and Transport for London (TfL) over the rules on face masks. The union, which represents more than 20,000 London bus workers, wants passengers in the capital to continue to be required to wear face coverings even when England's coronavirus restrictions end, which is expected to be on 19 July. More than 50 bus workers in London have died after testing positive for coronavirus. Unite regional secretary for London Pete Kavanagh says bus workers are ""rightly worried for their safety following the government's reckless announcement"". On Monday, Khan said discussions were planned between TfL, the Department for Transport and other transport providers ""before we decide our next steps"". Read more:Unions warn workers at risk if face masks rules dropped. NHS Test and Trace are to take over notification of contact with a positive Covid case from nurseries, schools and colleges. The system of ""bubbles"" for school years will end, stopping the need for all children to isolate if there is a positive case. From mid-August, under 18s will only have to self-isolate if they themselves test positive for Covid-19. From 19 July, it'll no longer be required to wear masks in schools, and start times for different year groups will no longer be staggered. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, secondary school pupils must wear masks even in classrooms. In Wales, students must wear masks in areas where social distancing cannot be maintained. While the government has confirmed rules will be relaxed from 19 July, the current guidance remains the same. You must continue to follow the current guidance and rulesin order to stay safe while enjoying the football -including when England play Denmark in the Euro 2020semi-final tomorrow. Up tosix people from six households,external(or two households of any size) can meet in a pub in England, or 30 in a pub garden. Different groups must not mix. In England, guidance remains on using ""personal judgement"" on whether or not to hug friends and family. You can have friends over, but you must keep the room well ventilated and adhere to the six people from six households (or two households of any size) rule. There are special areas to watch matches outdoors in London, Manchester, Birmingham, Glasgow and other cities. What are the rules elsewhere? Captured in a timelapse video, festival crew expertly rolled out the enormous and iconic red carpet Organisers have rolled out the red carpet - literally - in preparation for the Cannes Film Festival's opening ceremony tonight. Film stars have started to arrive in the French Riviera town, and there are strict health measures and testing in place to keep the return of the iconic festival virus-free. The event was cancelled last year because of the pandemic, and its return is seen as symbolic of cinema's bounce back. The opening film is the musical Annette, starring Marion Cotillard and Adam Driver and directed by Leos Carax. Follow the latest on the Cannes Film Festivalhere. There are strict coronavirus measures in place, as France warns against a rise in the Delta variant In most places from 19 July,wearing a face mask will not be legally required. But England's chief medical officer Chris Whitty, and chief scientific advisor Sir Patrick Vallance have said they will continue to wear masks in crowded settings, if asked to, or as a common courtesy to those who are uncomfortable. The British Medical Association has said it makes no sense to stop wearing masks in enclosed spaces. Businesses can still refuse service if you will not wear a mask, if you do not have an exemption. And the legal requirement to wear masks will remain in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Nearly 80m vaccine doses have now been given in the UK. A total of 79,302,857 jabs have been given, according to thegovernment's daily figures.,external That's 45,428,681 first doses and 33,874,176 second doses. The rules on self-isolation will soon change for those who have had both jabs -here's how to prove you've had yours. Professor Chris Whitty has urged the nation to ""push hell for leather"" to reduce coronavirus infection rates and roll out the vaccines to prevent a significant increase in long Covid. England's chief medical officer told the Local Government Association's annual conference: ""Since there's a lot of Covid at the moment and the rates are going up I regret to say I think we will get a significant amount more long Covid, particularly in the younger ages where the vaccination rates are currently much lower. ""Fundamentally the two ways to prevent long Covid in my view are to keep Covid rates right down and make sure everyone is vaccinated so they get very mild disease and I think we really just need to push hell for leather for those two. ""The deaths from Covid I think are mercifully going to be much lower in this wave compared to the previous ones as a proportion of cases but long Covid remains, I think, a worry. ""We don't know how big an issue it's going to be but I think we should assume it's not going to be trivial."" There have been a further 37 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK,according to the government's daily figures.,external That brings the total number of deaths in the 28 days following a positive Covid-19 test to 128,268. There have also been another 28,773 new infections recorded in the last 24 hours. The Bank of England is asking staff to come in to the office from September, starting with a minimum of once a week. Its cautious approach contrasts with other companies in the City of London and the wider country who are keener to return to pre-pandemic office hours. The government says people can return to the office after 19 July, if Covid restrictions in England are lifted as planned. Government guidance that people who can work from home should do so is set to end with other restrictions. Read more on this story.

Pret says the sandwich will be available to buy for one month. Just days before Christmas 2020, new restrictions to combat growing number of Covid cases were brought in in England and Wales.

Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst The China-Myanmar border gate has been closed In the past 48 hours, there has been a fresh outbreak of Covid-19
in the city of Ruili in southwestern China. Ruili, in Yunnan province, sits next to the border with Myanmar.
Three people tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday, and today a
further three symptomatic cases have been recorded, along with two asymptomatic
cases. The majority of those affected are Burmese nationals. Yesterday, a mass testing drive was launched in the city, which has a population of 210,000 people. The bridge that connects China
with Myanmar has been closed and the residential areas where
patients have tested positive have gone into lockdown. This is not the first time that Ruili has experienced an outbreak - the city has had four waves of the virus throughout the pandemic. The
most recent outbreak happened in March-April, affecting some 100 people. The national Global Times newspaper says that âthe long border and
the Delta virus strain that is widespread among South Asian countries may have
contributed to the epidemic resurgenceâ. Previous outbreaks
have largely been blamed on âillegalâ border crossings. However, since its last
major outbreak, Global Times notes that local officials and militias have been
mobilised to guard the villages at the border. BBC Radio 5 Live Cheryl Burns runs a bar in Netherton, Kirklees, and says despite the prime minister's announcement being a ""hallelujah"" moment for hospitality, she is still ""really anxious"" about opening on 19 July as case numbers are still high. Talking to Nicky Campbell on 5 Live Your Call, she describes her concerns around the responsibility being in the hands of the general public. ""People feel they now have the autonomy to do as they choose... it's nerve-racking,"" she says. ""We don't know whether the public will behave."" She says she is ready to get back to normal, adding: ""We need to learn to live with it, but it doesnât mean that I'm just going to open up my bar and go back to normal. ""We are risking our business and healthy people, and we want people to be safe."" Listen to 5 Live onBBC Sounds. Michelle O'Neill says Northern Ireland will not be following Boris Johnson's plan Boris Johnson's approach to ending Covid-19 restrictions in England is reckless and Northern Ireland won't be following it, NI's Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill has said. She says: ""I would be concerned for the people in England because of the route map set out by Boris Johnson. In my opinion, it's a reckless approach."" The PM says he expects face maskswill no longer be required and distancing rules scrappedfrom 19 July, following a review of health data on 12 July. O'Neill says the Northern Ireland Executive would take its own decisions, adding she hoped ministers could agree future steps at its meeting on Thursday.

"This video can not be played Health Secretary Sajid Javid outlines new rules for double-jabbed Fully vaccinated people in England will not have to self-isolate if a close contact tests positive for Covid from 16 August, the health secretary says. Sajid Javid told MPs the same policy would also apply to anyone under the age of 18 from that date. The government would give more details this week on self-isolation rules for international travel, he added. Meanwhile, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has announcedthe end of ""bubbles"" in schoolsfrom 19 July. This system has led to large numbers of pupils being sent home if a single child has a positive test. Covid-relatedpupil absence in England has hit a new highsince all students returned to school in March - with 640,000 pupils in England not in school due to Covid last week. On Monday, the prime minister confirmedhe intended to scrap most of the remaining restrictionsin England on 19 July, including the laws on mask wearing and rules on social distancing. A further 28,773 cases were reported across the UK on Tuesday, and there were another 37 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Some firms to insist people still wear face masks I'm fully vaccinated, but how can I prove it? Why it's time to think differently about Covid What next for the NHS Covid-19 contact tracing app? In a statement to the House of Commons, the health secretary said: ""From 16 August when even more people will have the protection of both doses, and when modelling suggests the risks from the virus will be even lower, anyone who is a close contact of a positive case will no longer have to self-isolate if they have been fully vaccinated. ""If someone gets their second dose just before or just after 16 August, they'll need to wait two weeks, after which their second jab can take effect and give them these new freedoms."" As under-18s are not routinely jabbed, he said a similar exemption from self-isolation rules would be extended to them. Mr Javid said adults who had been in close contact with a positive case would be ""advised"" to get a PCR test as soon as possible to make sure they had not been infected, while for children it would be dependent on their age. People identified as close contacts of a confirmed Covid case are currently required to self-isolate for up to 10 full days when contacted by NHS Test and Trace. He added that ""of course"" anyone that tested positive would have to self-isolate whether they have had the jab or not. The Department of Health and Social Care said the date for the changes was chosen to allow more people to become double jabbed and with rising case numbers ""it makes sense"" to keep protective measures in place until mid-August. It said if fully-vaccinated users of the NHS Covid-19 app are notified that a contact has tested positive after 16 August, they will be able to tell it they have had both jabs. Industry group UK Hospitality said Mr Javid's announcement ""doesn't go far enough, quickly enough"". Chief executive Kate Nicholls said it ""fails to recognise the carnage the current system"" is causing with pub and restaurant staff who ""have been told to isolate despite not having shared shifts with colleagues who tested positive"". The NHS Confederation, representing hospital leaders, said the move ""may act as an incentive for people to have both jabs, but we must also remember that no vaccine is 100% effective... it's still vital that people continue to get tested, and isolate if they have Covid"". The education secretary confirmed that the rules on pupils in England self-isolating would be ending Transport Secretary Grant Shapps will update MPs this week on international travel and removing ""the need for fully-vaccinated arrivals to isolate when they return from an amber list country"", Mr Javid said. Earlier, the health secretary told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he would expect cases numbers by 19 July to be ""at least double"" what they were now ""so around 50,000 new cases a day"". ""As we ease and go into the summer we expect them to rise significantly and they could go as high as 100,000 case numbers,"" he said. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Mr Javid had justified allowing infections to climb by pointing to the UK ""building a protective wall"" of vaccines. However, Mr Ashworth said the ""wall is only part built"", and data from Israel suggested that the infectious Delta variant could be transmitted through fully vaccinated people. He said he ""understood the rationale"" for Mr Javid's announcement but believed that the ""biggest barrier to an effective isolation policy"" was a ""lack of financial incentive to stay at home"". He also called for a U-turn on the decision to make mask-wearing voluntary, saying: ""Yes, let's have freedom but not a high-risk free-for-all - keep masks for now, fix sick pay, and let's unlock in a safe and sustainable way."" The Scottish government has said it maycontinue to require masksin certain settings even after 9 August, when it is hoped the final curbs will end. Ahead of a review on 15 July in Wales, ministers said peoplewould need to learn to livewith Covid. Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill saidthe prime minister's approach to ending coronavirus restrictions in England was reckless. She said Northern Ireland, which is due to review its rules on 8 July, would make its own decisions but would ""not be following that model"". Ireland's deputy prime minister Leo Varadkar called England's plan ""too risky"" and warned if things went wrong there would be a ""spillover effect"" into neighbouring countries. Asked about contingency planning for potential vaccine-resistant variants, Mr Javid told MPs: ""Reasonable experts will have different views on this... we are making some proportionate and balanced changes but border controls are staying in place. We are keeping the test, track and isolate policy in place."" The lifting of the remaining restrictions and now the ending of quarantining for the close contacts of people who are infected are bold moves. No other country in the world has tried this in the face of a rapidly increasing level of Covid infection driven by a more infectious variant. So, of course, it comes with risks. While the link between infections and serious illness has been weakened, it has not been broken altogether. If cases reach 100,000 a day, that could translate to close to 2,000 hospital admissions a day - twice what the NHS would see for all types of respiratory illness in the depths of winter. Soon afterwards, you would expect so see Covid deaths top 100 a day. And what if infection rates rise even further? Should we compare this to flu? In a bad winter those deaths can top 20,000. These are difficult questions to answer. The hope of government scientists is that the wall of immunity built up by the vaccination programme and natural infection will halt the rise in rates before we have to. Prof Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College - whose modelling helped lead to the first nationwide restrictions - said as restrictions eased there was the potential for the UK to have a very large numbers of cases - 150,000 to 200,000 a day - which could ""still cause some pressure to the health system"". However he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that although it was a ""slight gamble"" he thought it was ""justifiable"", adding ""I'm reasonably optimistic."" He said the vaccines would keep deaths far lower than in previous waves. ""The ratio which we saw in the past between case numbers and deaths has been reduced by more like eight to 10-fold."" In the worst-case scenario there ""may need to be a course correction later"", he added. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? Businesses have given mixed reactions to the plans to ease rules in England from 19 July. Melvin Benn, chief executive of Festival Republic, which runs the Reading and Leeds festivals, said the government had ""got this right"", adding that ""the country wants to reopen, we are tired of this, we want to reopen"". He also said he was not inclined to encourage festival guests to wear masks - even indoors. However, Jacinta Rowsell, manager of the Westfield shopping centre in London, said staff would still ""encourage guests"" to wear masks as they wanted people visiting to feel safe.

This video can not be played The bright seats bringing people together Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online Lots of people have been Googling to find out what this new(ish) variant of Covid is and what threat it might pose. Itâs yet another mutated version of the pandemic virus. Experts are certainly keeping an eye on it, but they are not worried enough just yet to move it onto the ""variant of concern"" list that Delta and Alpha belong to. Lambda, or C.37, was first identified in Peru in 2020. Itâs since been found elsewhere, including in the UK,which has recorded eight cases so far,external. Importantly, Lambda hasnât outcompeted other variants that are circulating, despite possessing some genetic changes that could potentially help ittransmit more easily than original Covid,external. New variants will keep emerging. Many will be of little or no consequence. But some could potentially threaten how well our vaccines work. Thatâs why it is so important to keep them in check. The Portuguese are being told to maintain hygiene and social distancing as the country battles a fourth wave of coronavirus. The more infectious Delta variant is now causing nearly 90% of new cases, the national health institute said. The infection rate jumped in mid-May when Portugal opened to visitors from the EU and Britain, and the cases are now back to the numbers seen in February, when the country was in lockdown. A night-time curfew was put in place last week
in 45 municipalities including Lisbon, Porto and Albufeira, and
restaurants and non-food shops must close earlier at the weekend
in some areas. Authorities in Spain's Catalonia region have also said restrictions will be imposed there to try to control a surge in cases. From this weekend, nightclubs will be closed and a negative Covid-19 test or proof of vaccination will be needed to take part in outdoor activities involving more than 500 people. ""We can't pretend to have defeated the virus,"" a spokeswoman for the regional government said. ""The pandemic has not ended, the new variants are very contagious and we still have significant segments of the population that are not vaccinated.""  Trade union Unite is seeking urgent meetings with London's mayor Sadiq Khan and Transport for London (TfL) over the rules on face masks. The union, which represents more than 20,000 London bus workers, wants passengers in the capital to continue to be required to wear face coverings even when England's coronavirus restrictions end, which is expected to be on 19 July. More than 50 bus workers in London have died after testing positive for coronavirus. Unite regional secretary for London Pete Kavanagh says bus workers are ""rightly worried for their safety following the government's reckless announcement"". On Monday, Khan said discussions were planned between TfL, the Department for Transport and other transport providers ""before we decide our next steps"". Read more:Unions warn workers at risk if face masks rules dropped. NHS Test and Trace are to take over notification of contact with a positive Covid case from nurseries, schools and colleges. The system of ""bubbles"" for school years will end, stopping the need for all children to isolate if there is a positive case. From mid-August, under 18s will only have to self-isolate if they themselves test positive for Covid-19. From 19 July, it'll no longer be required to wear masks in schools, and start times for different year groups will no longer be staggered. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, secondary school pupils must wear masks even in classrooms. In Wales, students must wear masks in areas where social distancing cannot be maintained. While the government has confirmed rules will be relaxed from 19 July, the current guidance remains the same. You must continue to follow the current guidance and rulesin order to stay safe while enjoying the football -including when England play Denmark in the Euro 2020semi-final tomorrow. Up tosix people from six households,external(or two households of any size) can meet in a pub in England, or 30 in a pub garden. Different groups must not mix. In England, guidance remains on using ""personal judgement"" on whether or not to hug friends and family. You can have friends over, but you must keep the room well ventilated and adhere to the six people from six households (or two households of any size) rule. There are special areas to watch matches outdoors in London, Manchester, Birmingham, Glasgow and other cities. What are the rules elsewhere? Captured in a timelapse video, festival crew expertly rolled out the enormous and iconic red carpet Organisers have rolled out the red carpet - literally - in preparation for the Cannes Film Festival's opening ceremony tonight. Film stars have started to arrive in the French Riviera town, and there are strict health measures and testing in place to keep the return of the iconic festival virus-free. The event was cancelled last year because of the pandemic, and its return is seen as symbolic of cinema's bounce back. The opening film is the musical Annette, starring Marion Cotillard and Adam Driver and directed by Leos Carax. Follow the latest on the Cannes Film Festivalhere. There are strict coronavirus measures in place, as France warns against a rise in the Delta variant In most places from 19 July,wearing a face mask will not be legally required. But England's chief medical officer Chris Whitty, and chief scientific advisor Sir Patrick Vallance have said they will continue to wear masks in crowded settings, if asked to, or as a common courtesy to those who are uncomfortable. The British Medical Association has said it makes no sense to stop wearing masks in enclosed spaces. Businesses can still refuse service if you will not wear a mask, if you do not have an exemption. And the legal requirement to wear masks will remain in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Nearly 80m vaccine doses have now been given in the UK. A total of 79,302,857 jabs have been given, according to thegovernment's daily figures.,external That's 45,428,681 first doses and 33,874,176 second doses. The rules on self-isolation will soon change for those who have had both jabs -here's how to prove you've had yours. Professor Chris Whitty has urged the nation to ""push hell for leather"" to reduce coronavirus infection rates and roll out the vaccines to prevent a significant increase in long Covid. England's chief medical officer told the Local Government Association's annual conference: ""Since there's a lot of Covid at the moment and the rates are going up I regret to say I think we will get a significant amount more long Covid, particularly in the younger ages where the vaccination rates are currently much lower. ""Fundamentally the two ways to prevent long Covid in my view are to keep Covid rates right down and make sure everyone is vaccinated so they get very mild disease and I think we really just need to push hell for leather for those two. ""The deaths from Covid I think are mercifully going to be much lower in this wave compared to the previous ones as a proportion of cases but long Covid remains, I think, a worry. ""We don't know how big an issue it's going to be but I think we should assume it's not going to be trivial."" There have been a further 37 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK,according to the government's daily figures.,external That brings the total number of deaths in the 28 days following a positive Covid-19 test to 128,268. There have also been another 28,773 new infections recorded in the last 24 hours. The Bank of England is asking staff to come in to the office from September, starting with a minimum of once a week. Its cautious approach contrasts with other companies in the City of London and the wider country who are keener to return to pre-pandemic office hours. The government says people can return to the office after 19 July, if Covid restrictions in England are lifted as planned. Government guidance that people who can work from home should do so is set to end with other restrictions. Read more on this story. Food chain Pret says it is now selling its Christmas sandwich - five months early, or seven months late, depending how you look at it - after it was closed over some of the festive period in 2020 because of the pandemic. Pret says the sandwich will be available to buy for one month. Just days before Christmas 2020, new restrictions to combat growing number of Covid cases were brought in in England and Wales. Measures included being told to stay at home, while non-essential shops and businesses had to close. We've had a quite a few coronavirus rule changes outlined to us today so here's a recap of what they mean: Schools  Self-isolation  For more details see our explainers onschool rulesandself-isolation. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst The China-Myanmar border gate has been closed In the past 48 hours, there has been a fresh outbreak of Covid-19
in the city of Ruili in southwestern China. Ruili, in Yunnan province, sits next to the border with Myanmar.
Three people tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday, and today a
further three symptomatic cases have been recorded, along with two asymptomatic
cases. The majority of those affected are Burmese nationals. Yesterday, a mass testing drive was launched in the city, which has a population of 210,000 people. The bridge that connects China
with Myanmar has been closed and the residential areas where
patients have tested positive have gone into lockdown. This is not the first time that Ruili has experienced an outbreak - the city has had four waves of the virus throughout the pandemic. The
most recent outbreak happened in March-April, affecting some 100 people. The national Global Times newspaper says that âthe long border and
the Delta virus strain that is widespread among South Asian countries may have
contributed to the epidemic resurgenceâ. Previous outbreaks
have largely been blamed on âillegalâ border crossings. However, since its last
major outbreak, Global Times notes that local officials and militias have been
mobilised to guard the villages at the border. BBC Radio 5 Live Cheryl Burns runs a bar in Netherton, Kirklees, and says despite the prime minister's announcement being a ""hallelujah"" moment for hospitality, she is still ""really anxious"" about opening on 19 July as case numbers are still high. Talking to Nicky Campbell on 5 Live Your Call, she describes her concerns around the responsibility being in the hands of the general public. ""People feel they now have the autonomy to do as they choose... it's nerve-racking,"" she says. ""We don't know whether the public will behave."" She says she is ready to get back to normal, adding: ""We need to learn to live with it, but it doesnât mean that I'm just going to open up my bar and go back to normal. ""We are risking our business and healthy people, and we want people to be safe."" Listen to 5 Live onBBC Sounds. Michelle O'Neill says Northern Ireland will not be following Boris Johnson's plan Boris Johnson's approach to ending Covid-19 restrictions in England is reckless and Northern Ireland won't be following it, NI's Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill has said. She says: ""I would be concerned for the people in England because of the route map set out by Boris Johnson. In my opinion, it's a reckless approach."" The PM says he expects face maskswill no longer be required and distancing rules scrappedfrom 19 July, following a review of health data on 12 July. O'Neill says the Northern Ireland Executive would take its own decisions, adding she hoped ministers could agree future steps at its meeting on Thursday. She says: ""We will probably be able to set out a direction of travel for what the next couple of months will look like, but certainly it will not be everything."" We've got more on this storyhere.

"This video can not be played Health Secretary Sajid Javid outlines new rules for double-jabbed Fully vaccinated people in England will not have to self-isolate if a close contact tests positive for Covid from 16 August, the health secretary says. Sajid Javid told MPs the same policy would also apply to anyone under the age of 18 from that date. The government would give more details this week on self-isolation rules for international travel, he added. Meanwhile, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has announcedthe end of ""bubbles"" in schoolsfrom 19 July. This system has led to large numbers of pupils being sent home if a single child has a positive test. Covid-relatedpupil absence in England has hit a new highsince all students returned to school in March - with 640,000 pupils in England not in school due to Covid last week. On Monday, the prime minister confirmedhe intended to scrap most of the remaining restrictionsin England on 19 July, including the laws on mask wearing and rules on social distancing. A further 28,773 cases were reported across the UK on Tuesday, and there were another 37 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Some firms to insist people still wear face masks I'm fully vaccinated, but how can I prove it? Why it's time to think differently about Covid What next for the NHS Covid-19 contact tracing app? In a statement to the House of Commons, the health secretary said: ""From 16 August when even more people will have the protection of both doses, and when modelling suggests the risks from the virus will be even lower, anyone who is a close contact of a positive case will no longer have to self-isolate if they have been fully vaccinated. ""If someone gets their second dose just before or just after 16 August, they'll need to wait two weeks, after which their second jab can take effect and give them these new freedoms."" As under-18s are not routinely jabbed, he said a similar exemption from self-isolation rules would be extended to them. Mr Javid said adults who had been in close contact with a positive case would be ""advised"" to get a PCR test as soon as possible to make sure they had not been infected, while for children it would be dependent on their age. People identified as close contacts of a confirmed Covid case are currently required to self-isolate for up to 10 full days when contacted by NHS Test and Trace. He added that ""of course"" anyone that tested positive would have to self-isolate whether they have had the jab or not. The Department of Health and Social Care said the date for the changes was chosen to allow more people to become double jabbed and with rising case numbers ""it makes sense"" to keep protective measures in place until mid-August. It said if fully-vaccinated users of the NHS Covid-19 app are notified that a contact has tested positive after 16 August, they will be able to tell it they have had both jabs. Industry group UK Hospitality said Mr Javid's announcement ""doesn't go far enough, quickly enough"". Chief executive Kate Nicholls said it ""fails to recognise the carnage the current system"" is causing with pub and restaurant staff who ""have been told to isolate despite not having shared shifts with colleagues who tested positive"". The NHS Confederation, representing hospital leaders, said the move ""may act as an incentive for people to have both jabs, but we must also remember that no vaccine is 100% effective... it's still vital that people continue to get tested, and isolate if they have Covid"". The education secretary confirmed that the rules on pupils in England self-isolating would be ending Transport Secretary Grant Shapps will update MPs this week on international travel and removing ""the need for fully-vaccinated arrivals to isolate when they return from an amber list country"", Mr Javid said. Earlier, the health secretary told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he would expect cases numbers by 19 July to be ""at least double"" what they were now ""so around 50,000 new cases a day"". ""As we ease and go into the summer we expect them to rise significantly and they could go as high as 100,000 case numbers,"" he said. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Mr Javid had justified allowing infections to climb by pointing to the UK ""building a protective wall"" of vaccines. However, Mr Ashworth said the ""wall is only part built"", and data from Israel suggested that the infectious Delta variant could be transmitted through fully vaccinated people. He said he ""understood the rationale"" for Mr Javid's announcement but believed that the ""biggest barrier to an effective isolation policy"" was a ""lack of financial incentive to stay at home"". He also called for a U-turn on the decision to make mask-wearing voluntary, saying: ""Yes, let's have freedom but not a high-risk free-for-all - keep masks for now, fix sick pay, and let's unlock in a safe and sustainable way."" The Scottish government has said it maycontinue to require masksin certain settings even after 9 August, when it is hoped the final curbs will end. Ahead of a review on 15 July in Wales, ministers said peoplewould need to learn to livewith Covid. Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill saidthe prime minister's approach to ending coronavirus restrictions in England was reckless. She said Northern Ireland, which is due to review its rules on 8 July, would make its own decisions but would ""not be following that model"". Ireland's deputy prime minister Leo Varadkar called England's plan ""too risky"" and warned if things went wrong there would be a ""spillover effect"" into neighbouring countries. Asked about contingency planning for potential vaccine-resistant variants, Mr Javid told MPs: ""Reasonable experts will have different views on this... we are making some proportionate and balanced changes but border controls are staying in place. We are keeping the test, track and isolate policy in place."" The lifting of the remaining restrictions and now the ending of quarantining for the close contacts of people who are infected are bold moves. No other country in the world has tried this in the face of a rapidly increasing level of Covid infection driven by a more infectious variant. So, of course, it comes with risks. While the link between infections and serious illness has been weakened, it has not been broken altogether. If cases reach 100,000 a day, that could translate to close to 2,000 hospital admissions a day - twice what the NHS would see for all types of respiratory illness in the depths of winter. Soon afterwards, you would expect so see Covid deaths top 100 a day. And what if infection rates rise even further? Should we compare this to flu? In a bad winter those deaths can top 20,000. These are difficult questions to answer. The hope of government scientists is that the wall of immunity built up by the vaccination programme and natural infection will halt the rise in rates before we have to. Prof Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College - whose modelling helped lead to the first nationwide restrictions - said as restrictions eased there was the potential for the UK to have a very large numbers of cases - 150,000 to 200,000 a day - which could ""still cause some pressure to the health system"". However he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that although it was a ""slight gamble"" he thought it was ""justifiable"", adding ""I'm reasonably optimistic."" He said the vaccines would keep deaths far lower than in previous waves. ""The ratio which we saw in the past between case numbers and deaths has been reduced by more like eight to 10-fold."" In the worst-case scenario there ""may need to be a course correction later"", he added. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? Businesses have given mixed reactions to the plans to ease rules in England from 19 July. Melvin Benn, chief executive of Festival Republic, which runs the Reading and Leeds festivals, said the government had ""got this right"", adding that ""the country wants to reopen, we are tired of this, we want to reopen"". He also said he was not inclined to encourage festival guests to wear masks - even indoors. However, Jacinta Rowsell, manager of the Westfield shopping centre in London, said staff would still ""encourage guests"" to wear masks as they wanted people visiting to feel safe.

"The second homes issue has sparked campaigns in Wales Changes to local taxes, government house purchase schemes and planning laws could be introduced to tackle a second homes ""crisis"" in Wales. The Welsh government will pick an area of Wales to pilot new policies in an attempt to ""inject fairness back into the housing system"". Officials will also look at options to shut a tax ""loophole"" where some second home owners do not pay council tax. But the plans were accused of being ""weak"" and ""vague"" by Plaid Cymru. The Welsh Conservatives also questioned whether second homes were making areas unaffordable. There were 24,873 second homes registered for council tax purposes in January 2021, according to official figures. Officials say numbers of homes could be much higher depending on the exact definition of a second home. 'Crazy prices too much for local home buyers' Are second home owners really pricing locals out? What is the tax loophole? Gwynedd has the highest number of second homes at 5,098, which represents 20% of all second homes in Wales. There are 4,068 in Pembrokeshire, while Cardiff has 3,477, Anglesey 2,139 and 2,104 in Swansea. Rachel Kelway-Lewis would like to buy in Pembrokeshire, but is currently living in a caravan Rachel Kelway-Lewis, 25, is among those finding it difficult to get on the housing ladder in Wales. Originally from the village of Solva in Pembrokeshire, she is now living in a caravan she rents just outside St Davids. ""It's incredibly difficult"" to get on the housing ladder in the area, the Carmarthenshire council worker said. ""Currently there's plots being sold for Â£350,000 alone... luxury developments, when so many local people can't afford to live in the area they've grown up in. ""I moved away for university and then I've come back to the area. ""I'd really like to buy locally and I work full-time, but unfortunately we're being priced out by second homeowners.""

"The second homes issue has sparked campaigns in Wales Changes to local taxes, government house purchase schemes and planning laws could be introduced to tackle a second homes ""crisis"" in Wales. The Welsh government will pick an area of Wales to pilot new policies in an attempt to ""inject fairness back into the housing system"". Officials will also look at options to shut a tax ""loophole"" where some second home owners do not pay council tax. But the plans were accused of being ""weak"" and ""vague"" by Plaid Cymru. The Welsh Conservatives also questioned whether second homes were making areas unaffordable. There were 24,873 second homes registered for council tax purposes in January 2021, according to official figures. Officials say numbers of homes could be much higher depending on the exact definition of a second home. 'Crazy prices too much for local home buyers' Are second home owners really pricing locals out? What is the tax loophole? Gwynedd has the highest number of second homes at 5,098, which represents 20% of all second homes in Wales. There are 4,068 in Pembrokeshire, while Cardiff has 3,477, Anglesey 2,139 and 2,104 in Swansea. Rachel Kelway-Lewis would like to buy in Pembrokeshire, but is currently living in a caravan Rachel Kelway-Lewis, 25, is among those finding it difficult to get on the housing ladder in Wales. Originally from the village of Solva in Pembrokeshire, she is now living in a caravan she rents just outside St Davids. ""It's incredibly difficult"" to get on the housing ladder in the area, the Carmarthenshire council worker said. ""Currently there's plots being sold for Â£350,000 alone... luxury developments, when so many local people can't afford to live in the area they've grown up in. ""I moved away for university and then I've come back to the area. ""I'd really like to buy locally and I work full-time, but unfortunately we're being priced out by second homeowners.""

"This video can not be played Health Secretary Sajid Javid outlines new rules for double-jabbed Fully vaccinated people in England will not have to self-isolate if a close contact tests positive for Covid from 16 August, the health secretary says. Sajid Javid told MPs the same policy would also apply to anyone under the age of 18 from that date. The government would give more details this week on self-isolation rules for international travel, he added. Meanwhile, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has announcedthe end of ""bubbles"" in schoolsfrom 19 July. This system has led to large numbers of pupils being sent home if a single child has a positive test. Covid-relatedpupil absence in England has hit a new highsince all students returned to school in March - with 640,000 pupils in England not in school due to Covid last week. On Monday, the prime minister confirmedhe intended to scrap most of the remaining restrictionsin England on 19 July, including the laws on mask wearing and rules on social distancing. A further 28,773 cases were reported across the UK on Tuesday, and there were another 37 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Some firms to insist people still wear face masks I'm fully vaccinated, but how can I prove it? Why it's time to think differently about Covid What next for the NHS Covid-19 contact tracing app? In a statement to the House of Commons, the health secretary said: ""From 16 August when even more people will have the protection of both doses, and when modelling suggests the risks from the virus will be even lower, anyone who is a close contact of a positive case will no longer have to self-isolate if they have been fully vaccinated. ""If someone gets their second dose just before or just after 16 August, they'll need to wait two weeks, after which their second jab can take effect and give them these new freedoms."" As under-18s are not routinely jabbed, he said a similar exemption from self-isolation rules would be extended to them. Mr Javid said adults who had been in close contact with a positive case would be ""advised"" to get a PCR test as soon as possible to make sure they had not been infected, while for children it would be dependent on their age. People identified as close contacts of a confirmed Covid case are currently required to self-isolate for up to 10 full days when contacted by NHS Test and Trace. He added that ""of course"" anyone that tested positive would have to self-isolate whether they have had the jab or not. The Department of Health and Social Care said the date for the changes was chosen to allow more people to become double jabbed and with rising case numbers ""it makes sense"" to keep protective measures in place until mid-August. It said if fully-vaccinated users of the NHS Covid-19 app are notified that a contact has tested positive after 16 August, they will be able to tell it they have had both jabs. Industry group UK Hospitality said Mr Javid's announcement ""doesn't go far enough, quickly enough"". Chief executive Kate Nicholls said it ""fails to recognise the carnage the current system"" is causing with pub and restaurant staff who ""have been told to isolate despite not having shared shifts with colleagues who tested positive"". The NHS Confederation, representing hospital leaders, said the move ""may act as an incentive for people to have both jabs, but we must also remember that no vaccine is 100% effective... it's still vital that people continue to get tested, and isolate if they have Covid"". The education secretary confirmed that the rules on pupils in England self-isolating would be ending Transport Secretary Grant Shapps will update MPs this week on international travel and removing ""the need for fully-vaccinated arrivals to isolate when they return from an amber list country"", Mr Javid said. Earlier, the health secretary told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he would expect cases numbers by 19 July to be ""at least double"" what they were now ""so around 50,000 new cases a day"". ""As we ease and go into the summer we expect them to rise significantly and they could go as high as 100,000 case numbers,"" he said. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Mr Javid had justified allowing infections to climb by pointing to the UK ""building a protective wall"" of vaccines. However, Mr Ashworth said the ""wall is only part built"", and data from Israel suggested that the infectious Delta variant could be transmitted through fully vaccinated people. He said he ""understood the rationale"" for Mr Javid's announcement but believed that the ""biggest barrier to an effective isolation policy"" was a ""lack of financial incentive to stay at home"". He also called for a U-turn on the decision to make mask-wearing voluntary, saying: ""Yes, let's have freedom but not a high-risk free-for-all - keep masks for now, fix sick pay, and let's unlock in a safe and sustainable way."" The Scottish government has said it maycontinue to require masksin certain settings even after 9 August, when it is hoped the final curbs will end. Ahead of a review on 15 July in Wales, ministers said peoplewould need to learn to livewith Covid. Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill saidthe prime minister's approach to ending coronavirus restrictions in England was reckless. She said Northern Ireland, which is due to review its rules on 8 July, would make its own decisions but would ""not be following that model"". Ireland's deputy prime minister Leo Varadkar called England's plan ""too risky"" and warned if things went wrong there would be a ""spillover effect"" into neighbouring countries. Asked about contingency planning for potential vaccine-resistant variants, Mr Javid told MPs: ""Reasonable experts will have different views on this... we are making some proportionate and balanced changes but border controls are staying in place. We are keeping the test, track and isolate policy in place."" The lifting of the remaining restrictions and now the ending of quarantining for the close contacts of people who are infected are bold moves. No other country in the world has tried this in the face of a rapidly increasing level of Covid infection driven by a more infectious variant. So, of course, it comes with risks. While the link between infections and serious illness has been weakened, it has not been broken altogether. If cases reach 100,000 a day, that could translate to close to 2,000 hospital admissions a day - twice what the NHS would see for all types of respiratory illness in the depths of winter. Soon afterwards, you would expect so see Covid deaths top 100 a day. And what if infection rates rise even further? Should we compare this to flu? In a bad winter those deaths can top 20,000. These are difficult questions to answer. The hope of government scientists is that the wall of immunity built up by the vaccination programme and natural infection will halt the rise in rates before we have to. Prof Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College - whose modelling helped lead to the first nationwide restrictions - said as restrictions eased there was the potential for the UK to have a very large numbers of cases - 150,000 to 200,000 a day - which could ""still cause some pressure to the health system"". However he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that although it was a ""slight gamble"" he thought it was ""justifiable"", adding ""I'm reasonably optimistic."" He said the vaccines would keep deaths far lower than in previous waves. ""The ratio which we saw in the past between case numbers and deaths has been reduced by more like eight to 10-fold."" In the worst-case scenario there ""may need to be a course correction later"", he added. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? Businesses have given mixed reactions to the plans to ease rules in England from 19 July. Melvin Benn, chief executive of Festival Republic, which runs the Reading and Leeds festivals, said the government had ""got this right"", adding that ""the country wants to reopen, we are tired of this, we want to reopen"". He also said he was not inclined to encourage festival guests to wear masks - even indoors. However, Jacinta Rowsell, manager of the Westfield shopping centre in London, said staff would still ""encourage guests"" to wear masks as they wanted people visiting to feel safe.

"Emma Raducanu called on her trainer while a set and a break down Wimbledon 2021 on the BBC Venue:All England ClubDates:28 June-11 July Coverage:Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. Full detailshere British wildcard Emma Raducanu retired from her Wimbledon fourth-round match after suffering breathing difficulties as her dream debut came to a heartbreaking end. The 18-year-old was trailing 4-6 0-3 to Ajla Tomljanovic when she called on a trainer. She left the court to receive further treatment, but it was soon announced she would not be returning. Tomljanovic will face fellow Australian Ashleigh Barty in the quarter-finals. Later on Monday, Wimbledon confirmed that Raducanu retired from the match because of ""difficulty breathing"". ""I am really sorry for her, I wish we could have finished it. I am wishing her all the best,"" Tomljanovic said. Raducanu, who was ranked 338th in the world before the tournament, had lost a tight first set and it was early in the second when she started to show signs that all was not well, frequently putting a hand to her stomach and showing hints of breathlessness. When Tomljanovic went 3-0 up, Raducanu called on a trainer at the change of ends, with a second medic soon following and appearing to listen to her chest. They quickly took her off court, and after only a few minutes, it was announced Raducanu was not fit to continue. This video can not be played Wimbledon 2021: How British teenager Raducanu lit up the first week of Wimbledon The young Briton had enjoyed a remarkable rise over the last week at Wimbledon, her maiden Grand Slam only a month after making her WTA Tour debut. She beat two top-50 opponents, Marketa Vondrousova and Sorana Cirstea, to reach the last 16, making her the last Briton standing in the singles draws. Raducanu was proving to be the story of the championships, the likes of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the prime minister, astronaut Tim Peake and musician Liam Gallagher among thousands tweeting their support. ""In so many ways this has been a life-changing week for her,"" former world number one Tracy Austin told BBC Sport. ""She was ranked 338 and now she's going to go into the 100s so it will make it much easier for her to play higher-level tournaments. ""She has a wonderful game as far as very athletic, a very good head on her shoulders, she seems very grounded because she has stayed in school. She has got ways to win points with weapons, she's got a terrific defence, it all looks great."" Raducanu and Tomljanovic had to wait for their meeting, the match not getting under way until 20:00 BST, owing to a five-set thriller between Alex Zverev and Felix Auger-Aliassime on Court One before them. But they were welcomed on to court to a rapturous applause, the capacity of Court One - and neighbouring Centre Court - increased to 75% on Manic Monday, so-called because every men's and women's singles fourth-round match is played. Little could separate the two once they did get going, Raducanu forced to save a break point in the second game before missing out on a break herself in the seventh as she continued to impress with her strong backhands and fine baseline strokes. Raducanu failed to convert two further break points, before world number 75 Tomljanovic, who defeated former French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko in the previous round, capitalised on her own next break point to take the first set. It was the first set Raducanu had dropped in the tournament, but her troubles continued as she face two break points on her opening service game of the second set, saving the first with a driving backhand down the line, but she could not save the second. But the boisterous support in the Court One stands, cheering Raducanu's every point as though she had won a set, soon changed to concern as it became clear she was unwell. When it was announced she had retired, the court gave Raducanu an ovation, saddened her fairytale run had to end this way.

"The use of Covid bubbles in England's schools, colleges and early year settings will end on 19 July It is part of a whole range of relaxations in schools as the country moves towards lockdown easing From 16 August, under-18s in England will no longer need to self-isolate after being in close contact with a positive case Fully-vaccinated adults will also not have to self-isolate from then if they are a close contact of a case Those who test positive themselves will still have to self-isolate whether they are vaccinated or not, though The final lifting of England's restrictions is expected on 19 July, but it will be confirmed on 12 July after a review Health Secretary Sajid Javid said new coronavirus cases âcould go as high as 100,000â per day, after restrictions ease England's cricket authorities will name a new squad for their one-day series after three players and four staff test positive Germany is lifting a Covid-related travel ban on people from the UK and four other variant-hit countries Edited by Claire Heald There have been a flurry of announcements today - here are the main ones:  The live page writers today have been Tiffany Wertheimer, Emma Harrison, Jennifer Meierhans, Richard Morris and Ella Wills. It was edited by Claire Heald, Jenny Matthews and Lauren Turner. Thank you for joining us. Reality Check Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth asked in Parliament about the numbers of people who could suffer from long term symptoms, generally known as long Covid, if cases rise as high as 100,000 cases a day - as the health secretary warned. âWith infections running at 100,000 a day that will translate into around 5,000 people a day developing long term chronic illness - long Covid,â he said. The difficulty with these figures is that there is not an agreed definition of what long Covid is. Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty said at the news conference on Monday that it was âseveral different syndromes, almost certainlyâ. Symptoms can range from fatigue and headaches to chest and muscle pain. Labour confirmed that Mr Ashworth was referring to research from October 2020 by Kingâs College London that found that one in 20 people with Covid were likely to suffer symptomsfor eight weeks or more,external. More recently, the React study at Imperial College London found that 37% of people who said they had had Covid reported having at least one symptom that lasted for 12 weeks or more,implying a total of more than two million people have suffered with it. The Office for National Statistics (ONS)has also been running a survey of people with ongoing symptoms,external. Its latest figures estimated that 962,000 people in the UK had experienced symptoms lasting for more than four weeks in the four weeks to 6 June 2021, which was down from 1.02 million the previous month. From 19 July, wearing a face mask will become a matter of ""personal choice"" says Prime Minister Boris Johnson. It seems, however, that companies intend to view these rules differently. Some airlines have confirmed face masks will still be compulsory after 19 July, while shops, pubs and hairdressers are altering policies. The World Health Organization still advises masks continue to be mandatory on public transport, in shops and in crowded places. You can read more on plans from across companieshere. A loneliness network in Northern Ireland has installed ""chatty benches"" to combat loneliness and isolation during the pandemic. Childminder Janice Nelson meets her friend at a bright yellow bench in Carrickfergus, County Antrim most days. They say hello to strangers who walk by and often that turns into longer conversations. This video can not be played The bright seats bringing people together Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online Lots of people have been Googling to find out what this new(ish) variant of Covid is and what threat it might pose. Itâs yet another mutated version of the pandemic virus. Experts are certainly keeping an eye on it, but they are not worried enough just yet to move it onto the ""variant of concern"" list that Delta and Alpha belong to. Lambda, or C.37, was first identified in Peru in 2020. Itâs since been found elsewhere, including in the UK,which has recorded eight cases so far,external. Importantly, Lambda hasnât outcompeted other variants that are circulating, despite possessing some genetic changes that could potentially help ittransmit more easily than original Covid,external. New variants will keep emerging. Many will be of little or no consequence. But some could potentially threaten how well our vaccines work. Thatâs why it is so important to keep them in check. The Portuguese are being told to maintain hygiene and social distancing as the country battles a fourth wave of coronavirus. The more infectious Delta variant is now causing nearly 90% of new cases, the national health institute said. The infection rate jumped in mid-May when Portugal opened to visitors from the EU and Britain, and the cases are now back to the numbers seen in February, when the country was in lockdown. A night-time curfew was put in place last week
in 45 municipalities including Lisbon, Porto and Albufeira, and
restaurants and non-food shops must close earlier at the weekend
in some areas. Authorities in Spain's Catalonia region have also said restrictions will be imposed there to try to control a surge in cases. From this weekend, nightclubs will be closed and a negative Covid-19 test or proof of vaccination will be needed to take part in outdoor activities involving more than 500 people. ""We can't pretend to have defeated the virus,"" a spokeswoman for the regional government said. ""The pandemic has not ended, the new variants are very contagious and we still have significant segments of the population that are not vaccinated.""  Trade union Unite is seeking urgent meetings with London's mayor Sadiq Khan and Transport for London (TfL) over the rules on face masks. The union, which represents more than 20,000 London bus workers, wants passengers in the capital to continue to be required to wear face coverings even when England's coronavirus restrictions end, which is expected to be on 19 July. More than 50 bus workers in London have died after testing positive for coronavirus. Unite regional secretary for London Pete Kavanagh says bus workers are ""rightly worried for their safety following the government's reckless announcement"". On Monday, Khan said discussions were planned between TfL, the Department for Transport and other transport providers ""before we decide our next steps"". Read more:Unions warn workers at risk if face masks rules dropped. NHS Test and Trace are to take over notification of contact with a positive Covid case from nurseries, schools and colleges. The system of ""bubbles"" for school years will end, stopping the need for all children to isolate if there is a positive case. From mid-August, under 18s will only have to self-isolate if they themselves test positive for Covid-19. From 19 July, it'll no longer be required to wear masks in schools, and start times for different year groups will no longer be staggered. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, secondary school pupils must wear masks even in classrooms. In Wales, students must wear masks in areas where social distancing cannot be maintained. While the government has confirmed rules will be relaxed from 19 July, the current guidance remains the same. You must continue to follow the current guidance and rulesin order to stay safe while enjoying the football -including when England play Denmark in the Euro 2020semi-final tomorrow. Up tosix people from six households,external(or two households of any size) can meet in a pub in England, or 30 in a pub garden. Different groups must not mix. In England, guidance remains on using ""personal judgement"" on whether or not to hug friends and family. You can have friends over, but you must keep the room well ventilated and adhere to the six people from six households (or two households of any size) rule. There are special areas to watch matches outdoors in London, Manchester, Birmingham, Glasgow and other cities. What are the rules elsewhere? Captured in a timelapse video, festival crew expertly rolled out the enormous and iconic red carpet Organisers have rolled out the red carpet - literally - in preparation for the Cannes Film Festival's opening ceremony tonight. Film stars have started to arrive in the French Riviera town, and there are strict health measures and testing in place to keep the return of the iconic festival virus-free. The event was cancelled last year because of the pandemic, and its return is seen as symbolic of cinema's bounce back. The opening film is the musical Annette, starring Marion Cotillard and Adam Driver and directed by Leos Carax. Follow the latest on the Cannes Film Festivalhere. There are strict coronavirus measures in place, as France warns against a rise in the Delta variant In most places from 19 July,wearing a face mask will not be legally required. But England's chief medical officer Chris Whitty, and chief scientific advisor Sir Patrick Vallance have said they will continue to wear masks in crowded settings, if asked to, or as a common courtesy to those who are uncomfortable. The British Medical Association has said it makes no sense to stop wearing masks in enclosed spaces. Businesses can still refuse service if you will not wear a mask, if you do not have an exemption. And the legal requirement to wear masks will remain in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Nearly 80m vaccine doses have now been given in the UK. A total of 79,302,857 jabs have been given, according to thegovernment's daily figures.,external That's 45,428,681 first doses and 33,874,176 second doses. The rules on self-isolation will soon change for those who have had both jabs -here's how to prove you've had yours. Professor Chris Whitty has urged the nation to ""push hell for leather"" to reduce coronavirus infection rates and roll out the vaccines to prevent a significant increase in long Covid. England's chief medical officer told the Local Government Association's annual conference: ""Since there's a lot of Covid at the moment and the rates are going up I regret to say I think we will get a significant amount more long Covid, particularly in the younger ages where the vaccination rates are currently much lower. ""Fundamentally the two ways to prevent long Covid in my view are to keep Covid rates right down and make sure everyone is vaccinated so they get very mild disease and I think we really just need to push hell for leather for those two. ""The deaths from Covid I think are mercifully going to be much lower in this wave compared to the previous ones as a proportion of cases but long Covid remains, I think, a worry. ""We don't know how big an issue it's going to be but I think we should assume it's not going to be trivial."" There have been a further 37 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK,according to the government's daily figures.,external That brings the total number of deaths in the 28 days following a positive Covid-19 test to 128,268. There have also been another 28,773 new infections recorded in the last 24 hours. The Bank of England is asking staff to come in to the office from September, starting with a minimum of once a week. Its cautious approach contrasts with other companies in the City of London and the wider country who are keener to return to pre-pandemic office hours. The government says people can return to the office after 19 July, if Covid restrictions in England are lifted as planned. Government guidance that people who can work from home should do so is set to end with other restrictions. Read more on this story. Food chain Pret says it is now selling its Christmas sandwich - five months early, or seven months late, depending how you look at it - after it was closed over some of the festive period in 2020 because of the pandemic. Pret says the sandwich will be available to buy for one month. Just days before Christmas 2020, new restrictions to combat growing number of Covid cases were brought in in England and Wales. Measures included being told to stay at home, while non-essential shops and businesses had to close. We've had a quite a few coronavirus rule changes outlined to us today so here's a recap of what they mean: Schools  Self-isolation  For more details see our explainers onschool rulesandself-isolation. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst The China-Myanmar border gate has been closed In the past 48 hours, there has been a fresh outbreak of Covid-19
in the city of Ruili in southwestern China. Ruili, in Yunnan province, sits next to the border with Myanmar.
Three people tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday, and today a
further three symptomatic cases have been recorded, along with two asymptomatic
cases. The majority of those affected are Burmese nationals. Yesterday, a mass testing drive was launched in the city, which has a population of 210,000 people. The bridge that connects China
with Myanmar has been closed and the residential areas where
patients have tested positive have gone into lockdown. This is not the first time that Ruili has experienced an outbreak - the city has had four waves of the virus throughout the pandemic. The
most recent outbreak happened in March-April, affecting some 100 people. The national Global Times newspaper says that âthe long border and
the Delta virus strain that is widespread among South Asian countries may have
contributed to the epidemic resurgenceâ. Previous outbreaks
have largely been blamed on âillegalâ border crossings. However, since its last
major outbreak, Global Times notes that local officials and militias have been
mobilised to guard the villages at the border. BBC Radio 5 Live Cheryl Burns runs a bar in Netherton, Kirklees, and says despite the prime minister's announcement being a ""hallelujah"" moment for hospitality, she is still ""really anxious"" about opening on 19 July as case numbers are still high. Talking to Nicky Campbell on 5 Live Your Call, she describes her concerns around the responsibility being in the hands of the general public. ""People feel they now have the autonomy to do as they choose... it's nerve-racking,"" she says. ""We don't know whether the public will behave."" She says she is ready to get back to normal, adding: ""We need to learn to live with it, but it doesnât mean that I'm just going to open up my bar and go back to normal. ""We are risking our business and healthy people, and we want people to be safe."" Listen to 5 Live onBBC Sounds. Michelle O'Neill says Northern Ireland will not be following Boris Johnson's plan Boris Johnson's approach to ending Covid-19 restrictions in England is reckless and Northern Ireland won't be following it, NI's Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill has said. She says: ""I would be concerned for the people in England because of the route map set out by Boris Johnson. In my opinion, it's a reckless approach."" The PM says he expects face maskswill no longer be required and distancing rules scrappedfrom 19 July, following a review of health data on 12 July. O'Neill says the Northern Ireland Executive would take its own decisions, adding she hoped ministers could agree future steps at its meeting on Thursday. She says: ""We will probably be able to set out a direction of travel for what the next couple of months will look like, but certainly it will not be everything."" We've got more on this storyhere.

"This video can not be played 'More rehabilitation support needed to break prison cycle' ""The only place for her that will keep her safe and secure is prison."" For Ellie, 22, from Cardiff, seeing her mum in the criminal justice system is not new - she was arrested ""something like 30 times"" last year alone. Ex-offenders, experts and support services have all said Wales needs better rehabilitation services. The Ministry of Justice said it had invested hundreds of millions of pounds into rehabilitation services ""to help offenders turn their backs on crime"". Ellie said her mother, who has been struggling with an alcohol addiction since Ellie was five years old, has been ""in and out of police cells for as long as I can remember"".

""It's horrible to say and, of course, I wouldn't wish for her to be in prison, but the best place for my mum to be is not out on the streets, it's not out in a council flat, where she is given no support.

"England's schools will find out later how the government plans to relax rules that have led to large numbers of pupils being sent home if a single child has a positive Covid test. Last week the ""bubble"" system saw more than 375,000 children sent home. It has meant missed days of lessons for thousands of pupils and frustration for parents juggling work and childcare. The announcement will come amid a backlash to government plans to ditch rules on the wearing of face masks. Labour, trade unions and some scientists have said now is not the time to change the rules on masks as case numbers continue to rise rapidly, driven by the new, more infectious Delta variant. Meanwhile, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said he would make an announcement to MPs later on self-isolation changes for those who have had been fully vaccinated. He told BBC Breakfast: ""We will have a more proportionate system of test, trace and isolate and it is absolutely right that those that have been double jabbed, that we can take a different approach than the one we can take today."" He said the UK was now entering ""uncharted territory"" as it moved to lift legal restrictions aimed at controlling the spread of coronavirus but he said the decision had to be made because of the ""other health problems"" millions of people were facing. At a Downing Street press conference on Monday, Boris Johnson confirmed he intended to scrap the laws on mask wearing and social distancing in the final stage of England's Covid lockdown roadmap on 19 July. The date will be confirmed on 12 July after a review of the latest data. Most Covid rules set to end in England, says PM Workers can return to office in two weeks' time, says PM Crowds to return to sport from 19 July When can we stop wearing face coverings? Other changes announced on Monday include the planned reopening of nightclubs for the first time since the pandemic began, an end to all legal limits on the number of people who can attend events and the scrapping of guidance to work from home. On schools, Mr Johnson said Education Secretary Gavin Williamson would outline a move away from sending ""bubbles"" home and from contact isolation for pupils so as to ""greatly reduce the impact on schools of Covid outbreaks"". ""And obviously the way forward is with testing rather than by sending the bubbles home,"" he added. There has been widespread concern that thousands of pupils are missing school unnecessarily. Last month the number sent home from school for Covid-related reasons quadrupled - but only about 4% were confirmed cases, with most pupils sent home because of a potential contact at school. Mr Williamson is expected to say the changes will come into effect on 19 July, alongside the lifting of other Covid restrictions. The PM's message on Monday was it was ""now or never"" to lift the restrictions. He said the success of the vaccine rollout had weakened the link between cases and deaths. This video can not be played PM Boris Johnson: ""If we can't reopen in next few weeks, when will we?"" ""If we don't go ahead now, when we've clearly done so much with the vaccination programme to break the link... when would we go ahead?"" He added: ""We run the risk of either opening up at a very difficult time when the virus has an edge, has an advantage, in the cold months, or again putting everything off to next year."" On Monday, a further 27,334 cases were reported across the UK - and another nine deaths within 28 days of a positive test. In a sombre warning, Mr Johnson warned cases were predicted to rise to 50,000 a day later this month - and more people would die. Prof Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College, whose modelling led to the first nationwide restrictions, said there was the potential for the UK to have a very large numbers of cases - 150,000 to 200,000 a day - which could ""still cause some pressure to the health system"". However he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that although it was a ""slight gamble"" he thought it was ""justifiable"", adding ""I'm reasonably optimistic"". He said that in the worst-case scenario there ""may need to be a course correction later"". This video can not be played Keir Starmer: ""Lifting all protections, in one go, when the infection rate is going up, is reckless"" Labour politicians, as well as some doctors and trade unions, have expressed concern that the lifting of the restrictions may be premature. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the government's plan was ""reckless"" and urged a more ""balanced approach"" to keep protections in place. He suggested the compulsory use of masks in enclosed spaces and on public transport. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham, who is opposed to the lifting of the face-covering rule, said that while he had the power to continue to make them mandatory on Manchester's tram network, he would not do so as ""I just don't see how we would be able to enforce it"". And Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said discussions were planned between Transport for London, the Department for Transport and other transport providers ""before we decide our next steps"". West End musical closes for 10 days after Covid case Who could get a third jab in September? Check the latest cases in your area Trade union Unite, which represents tens of thousands of public transport workers, said it would be ""an act of gross negligence by the government"" to end the requirement to wear face coverings on public transport in two weeks. Dr Nathalie MacDermott, an infectious diseases expert at Kings College London, said that now was not the right time to lift all restrictions. ""If we give the virus a foothold now by removing restrictions, we're probably just setting ourselves up for a bigger problem in the autumn,"" she told BBC's Newsnight. ""We should be waiting until all of our adult population - and possibly some of our younger adult population, or children and young people - are immunised, fully immunised, before we reduce our restrictions."" Speaking alongside Mr Johnson on Monday, England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty warned this coming winter ""may be very difficult for the NHS"". Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said the link between cases, hospital admission and death had been ""weakened, not broken"" by the vaccines. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? At the press conference, there was also a suggestion that a new tracing system would be introduced for fully vaccinated people, with an announcement expected this week. Mr Johnson said a test, trace and isolate system that is ""proportionate to the pandemic"" would continue to be used. ""You will have to self-isolate if you test positive or are told to do so by NHS test and trace,"" he said. ""We are looking to move to a different regime for fully vaccinated contacts of those testing positive, and also for children."" Mr Johnson also ruled out making domestic vaccine passports mandatory at this stage in the pandemic. He said Covid status certificates would not be needed for entry to venues or events, but he said businesses might choose to employ checks of an individual's NHS app to see their status. On the vaccine roll-out, Mr Johnson said the gap between first and second vaccine jabs for the under-40s would be shortened from 12 weeks to eight. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are in charge of their own coronavirus rules. The Scottish government has said it maycontinue to require masksin certain settings even after 9 August, when it is hoped the final curbs will end. Ahead of a review on 15 July in Wales, ministers said peoplewould need to learn to livewith Covid. Rules in Northern Irelandhave just eased, with another review due on 8 July.

"This video can not be played 'More rehabilitation support needed to break prison cycle' ""The only place for her that will keep her safe and secure is prison."" For Ellie, 22, from Cardiff, seeing her mum in the criminal justice system is not new - she was arrested ""something like 30 times"" last year alone. Ex-offenders, experts and support services have all said Wales needs better rehabilitation services. The Ministry of Justice said it had invested hundreds of millions of pounds into rehabilitation services ""to help offenders turn their backs on crime"". Ellie said her mother, who has been struggling with an alcohol addiction since Ellie was five years old, has been ""in and out of police cells for as long as I can remember"". She believes that better support and rehabilitation services would help end this cycle of behaviour that many ex-offenders find themselves in, and wants her mother to ""be safe and get the right support"". ""I love my mum, after all she's my mum. I've prayed, wished, hoped everyday and begged everyone under the sun that I can possibly think of to fix her. The reality is, you can't fix the condition but you can improve it,"" she said. Trans women in female jails policy ruled lawful 'My stalker told my friends and family I had HIV' Victim's shock at seeing sex abuser in supermarket Her mother served her first short sentence in prison earlier this year after several run-ins with the authorities over the years. Ellie said the ""immediate and focused support"" made a positive difference. Once out of prison, her mother was put on a 15-week waiting list for therapy, which Ellie said was not good enough for somebody who needed help ""right now and right there."" Ellie said her mother lost the support that was making a ""positive difference"" once she was released from prison Ellie said the best option would be for a controlled environment, similar to what prison provided, that her mum and others could afford to access. ""It's horrible to say and, of course, I wouldn't wish for her to be in prison, but the best place for my mum to be is not out on the streets, it's not out in a council flat, where she is given no support. ""Unfortunately, because of the system we are in, because of the situation we are in as a country, the only place for her that will keep her safe and secure is prison."" Ellie's mother - who spoke to BBC Wales and was happy to share her story - said better services were needed to avoid people like herself ""slipping through the net"", but was now getting access to support and advice. Chris Leslie said without the support he received he ""who knows"" where he would be Chris Leslie is a rehabilitated offender in Cardiff who now works as part of the team at Inside Out Support Wales to help others do the same. He said it could be ""extremely difficult"" getting back into society, with even everyday tasks proving challenging. He said: ""It's harder when you've been in a prison environment where you're around 300 people knowing everyone's name. ""Then all of a sudden you're in a supermarket with thousands of people and it can be daunting. You don't realise how much anxiety can be built up over the years."" Latest figures,externalshow 37% of female offenders and 41% of male offenders in Cardiff re-offended when released from prison. Chris said, without the support he received, he could have ended up in a very different situation, adding that some people return to crime ""because they go back to what they know best"". He said support was available, but you had to ""seek it out because of how resources are stretched"". ""It would have been easy to slide back,"" he said. ""Without the support I've had, who knows where I'd be. Bernie Bowen-Thompson said reoffending was not ""unusual"" for people leaving prison Bernie Bowen-Thompson, head of the charity Safer Wales, said more resources needed to be available for people leaving prison. ""To think someone feels better going back to prison because of a lack of services is absolutely awful,"" she said, adding that community-based services were vital. ""If you come out and you have unsecure accommodation, you've got debts, your mental health is poor, or trying to manage substance misuse, the cycle will continue. Unless we can get those fundamental needs that we all have, how do you move on?"" The Ministry of Justice said it was planning to open ""the first residential women's centre in Wales which will focus on reducing reoffending and ultimately keep the public safe"". The Welsh government said: ""We continue to press the Ministry of Justice for a new women's residential care centre in Wales, and will continue to work with them on its development. ""We want to improve outcomes for all women who come into contact with the criminal justice system in Wales."" Offending doesn't happen in a vacuum. Whether it's substance misuse, domestic violence and trauma or poor mental health - many in the criminal justice system experience problems that lead to prison, but that prison alone cannot address. The failure to tackle those issues creates a destructive cycle. Fourteen years after theCorston Report,externalcalled for smaller custodial units for women - instead of prison - to tackle this issue, a 12-bed women's residential unit is finally being planned for Wales. Research shows children are disproportionately affected when women are jailed, but effective rehabilitation and support in the community is vital if all offenders, regardless of gender, are to get their lives back on track.

"Vauxhall owner Stellantis has announced plans to build electric vans at its Ellesmere Port plant in Cheshire. The Â£100m investment, which the UK government will contribute to, will safeguard more than 1,000 factory jobs. The future of the plant has been in doubt after Vauxhall's parent company scrapped plans to build its new Astra model there. The Ellesmere Port plant will also make electric passenger car models for Vauxhall, Opel, Peugeot and CitroÃ«n. Production of an all-electric van will start in 2022, the carmaker said. The government has held talks with Stellantis about options for the Cheshire factory and ministers are understood to have offered about Â£30m in financial support. Carlos Tavares, head of Stellantis, had previously warned that the company would no longer invest in pure diesel or petrol cars at the plant, and said a decision on where it would build electric vehicles would depend on the UK government's support of the car sector. Mr Tavares said: ""Performance is always the trigger for sustainability and this Â£100m investment demonstrates our commitment to the UK and to Ellesmere Port."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""It's a huge vote of confidence in our economy, in the people of Ellesmere Port, and in our fantastic post-Brexit trading relationships."" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said: ""Ellesmere Port's proud tradition in auto manufacturing will continue for many years to come thanks to today's investment."" He said that the investment will also ""secure thousands of jobs across the region in the supply chain"". ""In this global race to secure electric vehicle production, we are proud to support Britain's auto sector in this crucial transition as we work to build back better,"" Mr Kwarteng added. Mr Tavares said the fate of Ellesmere Port will depend on the UK government's commitment to the car industry Sales of vans have been booming during the pandemic,as a result of growing home delivery sales. Vauxhall's Luton plant is currently operating at full capacity so Stellantis wants to expand production at Ellesmere Port to serve the UK market. Like other manufacturers it is also preparing for an all-electric future. The UK will ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030, with other European countries setting similar targets. Last week, Japanese carmaker Nissan announced an expansion ofelectric vehicle production at its car plant in Sunderland which will create 1,650 new jobs. Hollie Hughes, 24, an engineer at the Ellesmere Port plant, who started as an apprentice nearly eight years ago, said the plans were ""so exciting"", especially the electric vehicle aspect. ""It's a massive highlight for Ellesmere Port,"" she said, adding that her team will be ""heavily involved"" in implementing the plans. Oliver Holden, 27, a manufacturing engineer at the plant, said the employees had waited a long time for the announcement. ""From today, everyone will be pleased - the mood will be lifted, I believe,"" he said. ""Everyone now can focus on the next challenges and move towards the future."" Professor David Bailey, an economist at Birmingham Business School, told the BBC's Today programme that Vauxhall's plans would support jobs in the short term, but there was a question over how sustainable they would make Ellesmere Port. ""There is there is no [Stellantis electric vehicle] battery plant being built in the UK... so if batteries are being brought in from France and elsewhere, that's going to add to costs and it's going leave Ellesmere Port as a relatively high-cost location,"" he said. ""[Building one in the UK] would really anchor vehicle production at Stellantis at Ellesmere Port and Luton in the UK. ""Longer term we're going to need a lot of batteries in the UK and we will need battery plants to keep mass car and vehicle production here."" Stellantis is currently building two battery plants, one in France and one in Germany, and is looking to establish a third, rumoured to be in Italy. The two ""gigafactories"" at Douvrin in France and Kaiserslautern in Germany will get French and German government support of â¬1.3bn (Â£1.1bn). The Ellesmere Port plant will have a new body shop and investment in general assembly and on site battery pack assembly. Work will begin on potential wind and solar farms at the site. Stellantis will also consult on the creation of a UK parts distribution centre which will require further investment. The outlook for the British automotive industry is certainly a lot rosier now than it was just a few months ago. Without investment in new products every few years, car plants die; and the ageing factory at Ellesmere Port has long been regarded as particularly vulnerable. Earlier this year Carlos Tavares, the acerbic chief executive of Vauxhall's parent company Stellantis, made it very clear that investment would only arrive if the government itself were prepared to support the industry. It appears the government has done just that, with both Nissan and Stellantis, pledging to spend serious amounts of money developing electric vehicles here as a result. But there's a long way to go to secure the future of car manufacturing, as it prepares for an all-electric future. After years of uncertainty over the outcome of Brexit, which made carmakers reluctant to commit to new plans, the UK is still playing catch-up. So while the news from Nissan and Vauxhall has been widely welcomed, people within the sector agree that much more is needed. Stellantis is the world's fifth-largest carmaker and also owns Peugeot, Fiat and Chrysler. Ellesmere Port, acquired by Vauxhall Motors in 1957 from the Royal Auxiliary Air Force, initially developed the site as a sub-assembly and engine production line for its Dunstable and Luton factories. It produced its first car, the Vauxhall Viva, in 1964, and produced the Viva, Chevette, and Vauxhall and Opel Astra. Employment peaked at the site in 1975, with 12,000 people on staff.

"More than 1,000 Afghan soldiers have fled to neighbouring Tajikistan after clashing with Taliban militants, officials have said. The troops retreated over the border to ""save their own lives"", according to a statement by Tajikistan's border guard. Violence has risen in Afghanistan and the Taliban have been making significant gains, particularly in the north of the country, in recent weeks. The surge comes as the US, UK and allies withdraw after 20 years. The vast majority of remaining foreign forces in Afghanistan have left ahead of a September deadline. There are concerns that the Afghan military, who were supposed to take over security in the country, will collapse. Under a deal with the Taliban, the US and its Nato allies agreed to withdraw all troops in return for a commitment by the militants not to allow any extremist group to operate in the areas they control. But the Taliban did not agree to stop fighting Afghan forces, and now reportedly control about a third of the country. Who are the Taliban? How can the West fight terror after leaving? US troops must leave by deadline - Afghan Taliban The retreat is the third time Afghan soldiers have fled to Tajikistan over the past three days and the fifth case over the past fortnight.  In total, nearly 1,600 soldiers have crossed the border. This group of Afghan soldiers fled to Tajikistan in June The latest group of Afghan troops sought refuge early on Monday morning after fighting with militants during the night, Tajikistan's National Security Committee said. Badakhshan and Takhar provinces, which border Tajikistan, have seen a rapid Taliban advance. ""The Taliban cut off all the roads and these people had nowhere to go but to cross the border,"" one senior Afghan official told Reuters on Monday. Zabihullah Atiq, a parliamentarian from Badakhshan, said the troops had used various routes to flee. Tajik border guards said Afghan soldiers were being provided with shelter and food, but further details were not available. By Kawoon Khamoosh, BBC News With the new surge in violence across the country, Afghan forces are facing an unprecedented level of combat in the absence of foreign troops. Government officials have been tweeting non-stop to keep soldiers motivated by underlying their sacrifices. But much of the troops' motivation disappears amid news of retreat, collapse of key districts and casualties. Military officials in Kabul have talked about ""tactical retreat"" whenever insurgents made gains, but we hear from commanders in the battlefield about a lack of ammunition, and delays in sending support. In Badakhshan province, where the government lost significant territory in recent days, local sources say many government officials ""escaped"" to Kabul way before Taliban attacks. Not only can this dishearten soldiers, but it also raises the bigger question of the loyalty of high-ranking officials in peace talks. Will political leaders - whose families already reside abroad - remain in the country if full-scale civil war erupts? President Ashraf Ghani insists that Afghan security forces are fully capable of keeping insurgents at bay, but there have also been reports of more soldiers seeking refuge in Pakistan and Uzbekistan to escape the fighting. Neighbouring countries are bracing themselves for a potential influx of refugees if the fighting continues to intensify. Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen told the BBC the group was not responsible for the recent increase in violence.  He insisted that many districts had fallen to the Taliban through mediation after Afghan soldiers refused to fight. This video can not be played ""US forces remaining would violate Doha agreement"" - Taliban For the people of Afghanistan, it is a worrying time, says Lyse Doucet, the BBC's chief international correspondent. The Taliban, who have been accused of various human rights and cultural abuses, support Islamic punishments - such as public executions of convicted murderers - as well as banning television, music and cinema, and disapproving of girls over 10 going to school. ""They are uncertain about uncertain about their own lives and the futures of their families,"" she says. Zahra, a 25-year-old resident of Kabul, is among those concerned about the future. ""People are expecting a wider than ever war. A lot of people in Kabul fear that the Taliban might reach us at any time,"" she toldBBC OS on World Service radio. Zahra said people in Kabul feared the Taliban could reach the city ""at any time"" Jamshid, a student at Kabul University, said he did not plan to stay in the country if the Taliban took power. There are also growing concerns about how to protect diplomatic missions in Afghanistan. Russia on Monday announced that it had temporarily suspended operations at its consulate in the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif because of the deteriorating security situation. Envoy Zamir Kabulov said Afghan troops had surrendered too many districts, making the situation unstable. Turkey and Iran have also suspended operations in the city, moving diplomats to Kabul, according to reports. US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in Afghanistan in 2001. The group had been harbouring Osama Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda figures linked to the 9/11 attacks in the US that triggered the invasion. However, it has gradually regained enough strength to seize territory again. The Taliban entered direct talks with the US in 2018, and President Joe Biden has said the American pull-out is justified as US forces have made sure Afghanistan cannot become a base for foreign jihadists to plot against the West again. However, former Afghan President Hamid Karzai told the BBC he believed the Nato and US military mission there had failed in defeating terrorism and extremism. This video can not be played Former Afghan president Hamid Karzai: Nato failed to defeat extremism He called on both the Afghan government and the Taliban to ""sit down and talk as soon as possible for peace"". From 9/11, to intense fighting on the ground, and now full withdrawal of US-led forces, hereâs what happened. 11 September 2001 Al-Qaeda, led by Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan, carries out the largest terror attack ever conducted on US soil. Four commercial airliners are hijacked. Two are flown into the World Trade Centre in New York, which collapses. One hits the Pentagon building in Washington, and one crashes into a field in Pennsylvania. Nearly 3,000 people are killed. 7 October 2001 A US-led coalition bombs Taliban and al-Qaeda facilities in Afghanistan. Targets include Kabul, Kandahar and Jalalabad. The Taliban, who took power after a decade-long Soviet occupation was followed by civil war, refuse to hand over Bin Laden. Their air defences and small fleet of fighter aircraft are destroyed. 13 November 2001 The Northern Alliance, a group of anti-Taliban rebels backed by coalition forces, enters Kabul as the Taliban flee the city. By the 13 November 2001, all Taliban have either fled or been neutralised. Other cities quickly fall. 26 January 2004 After protracted negotiations at a “loya jirga” or grand assembly, the new Afghan constitution is signed into law. The constitution paves the way for presidential elections in October 2004. 7 December 2004 Hamid Karzai, the leader of the Popalzai Durrani tribe, becomes the first president under the new constitution. He serves two five-year terms as president. May 2006 British troops arrive in Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold in the south of the country. Their initial mission is to support reconstruction projects, but they are quickly drawn into combat operations. More than 450 British troops lose their lives in Afghanistan over the course of the conflict. 17 February 2009 US President Barack Obama approves a major increase in the number of troops sent to Afghanistan. At their peak, they number about 140,000. The so-called “surge” is modelled on US strategy in Iraq where US forces focussed on protecting the civilian population as well as killing insurgent fighters. 2 May 2011 The leader of al-Qaeda is killed in an assault by US Navy Seals on a compound in Abbottabad in Pakistan. Bin Ladenâs body is removed and buried at sea. The operation ends a 10-year hunt led by the CIA. Â The confirmation that Bin Laden had been living on Pakistani soil fuels accusations in the US that Pakistan is an unreliable ally in the war on terror. 23 April 2013 The founder of the Taliban, Mullah Mohammed Omar, dies. His death is kept secret for more than two years. According to Afghan intelligence, Mullah Omar dies of health problems at a hospital in the Pakistani city of Karachi. Pakistan denies that he was in the country. 28 December 2014 At a ceremony in Kabul, Nato ends its combat operations in Afghanistan. With the surge now over, the US withdraws thousands of troops. Â Most of those who remain focus on training and supporting the Afghan security forces. 2015 The Taliban launch a series of suicide attacks, car bombings and other assaults. The parliament building in Kabul, and the city of Kunduz are attacked. Islamic State militants begin operations in Afghanistan. 25 January 2019 Afghan President Ashraf Ghani says more than 45,000 members of his countryâs security forces have been killed since he became leader in 2014. The figure is far higher than previously thought. 29 February 2020 The US and the Taliban sign an “agreement for bringing peace” to Afghanistan, in Doha, Qatar. The US and Nato allies agree to withdraw all troops within 14 months if the militants uphold the deal. 13 April 2021 US president Joe Biden announces that all US troops will leave Afghanistan by 11 September 2021. 16 August 2021 In just over a month, the Taliban sweep across Afghanistan, taking control of towns and cities all over the country, including Kabul. Afghan security forces collapse in the face of the Taliban advance.
